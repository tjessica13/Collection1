   The United Methodists voted Tuesday to write
mankind out of their hymns in favor of people and include
portrayals of God as a feminine figure, but the denomination didn't
tamper with psalms.
   The nation's second-largest Protestant body overwhelmingly
adopted a new hymnal that generally shifts to inclusive language
for humans, such as using ``All'' for ``men'' and ``people'' for
``mankind.''
   But members decided to retain masculine pronouns for God in the
book's psalms, denying the request of several delegates to use
gender-neutral nouns such as ``God's'' rather than ``His.''
   Delegates of the 9.6 million-member denomination _ whose
founder, John Wesley, exhorted followers to ``Sing lustily and with
full courage'' _ approved the new hymnal by 893 to 69.
   ``An exciting and historical moment,'' proclaimed the Rev. C.
Rex Bevins of Lincoln, Neb., after applause quieted in the
Cervantes Convention Center, packed with about 3,000 visitors and
observers.
   It was the eighth day of the church's 11-day quadrennial
governing conference. Delegates also approved a major, revamped
summary of doctrine, reflecting a conservative shift in church
attitudes.
   It gives Scripture a firmer primacy and eliminates an explicit
acceptance of ``pluralism'' in concepts, a key shift away from a
recognition of divergent theologies, including some embraced by
feminists and leftist liberation movements.
   But the new hymnbook, replacing the old edition of 1966,
provided the zestful note of the day, with several interludes of
rousing song from the book and deliberations about it.
   The hefty, 960-page volume combines ritual, psalms and 625
songs, compared with 552 in the old book.
   The hymnal has 330 songs new to Methodists, including gospel
songs, spirituals, ethnic hymns and new compositions.
   Some hymns such as ``Faith of Our Fathers'' and ``Dear Lord and
Father of Mankind'' were not changed at all because they are
imprinted deeply in people's memories.
   But the most popular Easter hymn, ``Christ the Lord is Risen
Today,'' was given a revised first verse changing ``sons of men and
angels say'' to ``earth and heaven in chorus say.''
   The book also includes ``Good Christian Friends Rejoice''
instead of the old ``Good Christian Men Rejoice,'' and substitutes
``God of the Ages'' for ``God of Our Fathers.''
   The Rev. Carlton Young of Nashville, editor of the new hymnbook,
said the revision offered a chance to ``address God in alternative
terms,'' other than masculine, but ``we backed off because of
controversy.''
   As a result, he said, only three hymns offer feminine images of
God. Several others were rejected.
   Those three include ``Wonder of Wonders'' and ``How Can We Name
a Love,'' by British poet Brian Wren, which portay God both as
mother and father. The third song, ``The Care the Eagle Gives Her
Young,'' compares God to a mother eagle.
   The hymnal also retains many popular mainstays, including many
of Wesley's.
   At one point in the book's genesis, a massive reaction by
members overturned a committee decision to delete ``Onward
Christian Soldiers'' and ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic''
because of their militaristic metaphors. It also keeps familiar
revival hymns, such as ``In the Garden'' and ``Jesus Calls Us,''
often frowned on by musicologists.
   Tuesday's only substantial debate concerned the use of masculine
pronouns for God in the book's psalms. They had been substituted
with gender-neutral nouns initially, but a legislative committee
recommended that masculine pronouns be restored, and the conference
agreed despite the opposition of some delegates.
   Bishop Reuben P. Job of Des Moines, who chaired the 25-member
committee that worked four years in compiling the volume, said the
``voice of the whole church'' was involved in the process.
   Job told a news conference the new book ``will serve to draw
this denomination toward its center, toward Christ. It also will
serve to open us to people and cultures to which we haven't been
sensitive.''

<TEXT>
   Banks will reopen for nearly normal
operations next Monday after being closed for two months because of
Panama's economic and political crisis, the president of the
Bankers' Association announced.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Roman Catholic Church said it will not
mediate the crisis until the civilian government that does Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega's bidding has ``a change of attitude.''
   Edgardo Lasso, the Bankers' Association president, said in a
television interview Tuesday that to avoid a run on the banks, the
amount of cash depositors can withdraw will be restricted.
   ``We are trying to reactivate the economy of the country,''
Lasso said.
   ``We will take care of the public in all banking activities''
within the restrictions set by the government's Banking Commission
late in March, he said.
   Conditions for reopening the banks limit withdrawals to 25
percent of checking account balances as of March 3, the day the
government ordered banks closed. It sets a maximum of $10,000, with
the rest frozen for 90 days.
   Withdrawals of up to $50 may be made from savings accounts one
month after banks reopen.
   Payment of interest is restricted and subject to cash
availability in each bank.
   The commission has promoted a gradual reopening of the banks. On
April 18, it let them begin accepting deposits. Because of limits
on withdrawals, however, about 75 percent of the checks deposited
bounced, analysts and business people said.
   A week later, about a dozen additional services were resumed,
including handling letters of credit; collecting outstanding loans;
transferring funds within Panama, and making foreign exchange
transfers. But business people said the operations were largely on
paper and did little to help resolve their problems of liquidity
and credit.
   The association represents 93 of the 117 banks operating here,
most of them foreign.
   Both the March 3 closing and the reopening applied to the 67
banks holding licenses to conduct both local and international
banking business.
   Others also closed their doors because of the impact of the
crisis.
   Some closed as early as late February, after Noriega ousted
President Eric Arturo Delvalle following the president's attempt
tried to fire the military strongman.
   The political instability, U.S. economic sanctions and the lack
of banking facilities brought Panama's economy to a near-standstill.
   The Banking Commission had urged the banks to reopen with some
restrictions intended to ``maintain the cash position of the banks
and protect depositors.''
   The church agreed at the end of March to mediate talks between
the government and Noriega's opponents. It suspended the effort a
week later.
   In a statement issued Tuesday, the church accused the government
and official news media of ``personal and institutional attacks''
on it and Archbishop Marcos Gregorio McGrath.
   ``Since the attacks have proliferated in government news media,
we assume the government rejects the mediation of the church,'' it
said.
   Monsignor Jose Maria Carrizo Villarreal, vice president of the
Panamanian Conference of Bishops, signed the statement.
   The bishops had offered to seek an ``honorable way out for Gen.
Noriega as commander of the Defense Forces.'' The opposition
demands Noriega leave as a condition for further talks, but the
government said it would not accept conditions for negotiating.
   In Washington, Guillermo Cochez, a spokesman for Panama's
opposition Christian Democratic Party, said Noriega is considering
stepping down on Aug. 12, which Cochez said is Noriega's fifth
anniversary as defense chief.
   Noriega is under federal indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges, which he denies. In its attempt to remove him,
the Reagan administration imposed sanctions that include blocking
Panamanian assets in the United States and prohibiting U.S.
payments to Panama.
   The church has held the government responsible for the crisis,
but also blamed the ``economic domination of foreign powers and ..
. the corruption in the public and private sectors.''
   Leaders of the opposition said Tuesday they had held their first
meeting aimed at establishing common objectives.
   Alfredo Ramirez, president of the Liberal Republican Movement,
said the objectives include ``democratization of the country and
the search for a solution to the economic and political crisis.''
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle as Panama's chief
executive.

<HEAD>States Denied Chance To Tax Income From Federal Securities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than two weeks after creating a potential
new source of federal tax money, the Supreme Court is denying a
similar opportunity for state treasuries.
   The justices on Monday refused to let states tax pension fund
income from investments in federal government securities.
   On April 20, the court had ruled that the federal government may
tax the interest earned on state and municipal bonds.
   Although congressional leaders say there is no plan to impose
such taxes, the court's ruling last month cleared away a
constitutional hurdle in the event Congress some day changes
federal tax law.
   Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the court on April 20,
said giving the federal government power to tax state and municipal
bonds does not suggest that states should have reciprocal power.
   ``States can never tax the United States directly,'' he said.
``The federal tax immunity has always been greater than the states'
immunity.''
   That opinion was reinforced indirectly Monday as the court
rejected an appeal by Vermont officials seeking to tax income from
such federal obligations as treasury bills and short-term borrowing.
   Vermont officials said they should be allowed to tax the income
after it is distributed to retirees.
   The Vermont Supreme Court last December upheld a ruling by a
state judge who said the pension fund money is tax-exempt.
   Superior Court Judge Matthew I. Katz of Windsor County ruled
that interest on federal obligations is immune from state taxation
even when the income is passed on by a pension fund to a retired
investor.
   ``In practical operation, the tax in question was in fact a
state tax on interest derived from federal obligations,'' Katz
said. The fact that pension money was passed on to someone other
than the fund itself does not eliminate the exemption enjoyed by
investments in federal securities, he said.
   The judge rejected arguments by state officials that interest on
a government security is exempt ``only in the hands of the original
recipient unless there is a specific federal statute to pass
through the tax-exempt character of such income.''
   Katz ruled in favor of Loren D. Keys, who when he retired in
1981 received a lump-sum distribution of $141,000 from a savings
plan in which he had invested.
   The money included $35,000 in interest on federal securities.
   Vermont officials said Keys owed an additional tax of $1,246 on
the income from the government obligations. The court rulings in
Keys' favor meant he received a tax refund of $203 plus interest.
   Vermont officials said a lot more was at stake. They said the
state court rulings could force them to examine the source of
payments from pension and mutual funds, corporate dividends and
even bank deposit interest and then eliminate from the state's tax
base any income traced to investments in federal obligations.

<BYLINE>WASHINGTON WIRE: Could Missouri Bullfrogs Eat Britain?
^By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It happened in England, and the plot reminded
the congressman from Missouri of the title of an imaginary horror
film _ ``The Bullfrogs That Ate Britain.''
   According to Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo., British gardeners who
raise goldfish in ornamental pools were looking for a way to scare
off marauding cats that scooped the goldfish out of the pools and
had them for lunch.
   The solution: A British pet store imported Missouri tadpoles
which are said to grow into foot-long Missouri bullfrogs, large
enough to give a British cat the fight of his or her life.
   But, said Buechner, alarmed environmentalists saw in all of this
an unintended consequence.
   ``Ecologists protested that the carnivorous amphibians would eat
native frogs and newts and wreck the area's ecological balance,''
he said.
   So the pet store recalled 400 Missouri bullfrogs as a threat to
the native-born inhabitants of British gardens, Buechner said and
added this:
   ``After hearing this, I hopped over to the House floor to
deliver this sad news to my colleagues.
   ``Lest the tiny creatures of Britain croak, it is far better
that our Missouri bullfrogs be recalled. Sounds like a horror film
_ ``The Bullfrogs That Ate Britain.'
   ``And so my colleagues I stand before you warts and all.
   ``As a responsible Missourian, I believe that although we should
not leap to conclusions, we must ensure our frogs do not cause any
undue harm in the land of Thatcher.
   ``So we welcome our British brethren to send back both our
tadpoles and foot-long bullfrogs back home.
   ``Imagine _ a foot-long frog!
   ``Who would believe it?
   ``It's no wonder they call Missouri the `Show Me State.'''

   Lady Bird Johnson was in Washington last week to receive House
and Senate tributes on the 20th anniversary of the launching of her
campaign to beautify the capital and the nation's highways.
   The celebration took place at a season appropriate to the
occasion.
   The flowers of spring _ most of them planted as a result of her
labors _ were bursting like an explosion in a paint factory.
   But the occasion, perhaps inevitably, also brought forth
memories of President Lyndon B. Johnson's legendary style and
towering ego.
   Some went to the point of how Lady Bird coped with it all.
   Rep. Jake Pickle, D-Texas, who said he had been proud to call
himself ``LBJ's congressman,'' told the House of the time Mrs.
Johnson had prepared dinner for guests at the LBJ ranch only to
find her husband was driving some of the guests around the ranch
``to show them the deer and the antelope and where the buffalo do
not roam.''
   Three times, he said, Mrs. Johnson radioed the car using the
Secret Service code names for the presidential couple.
   ``Volcano, this is Volunteer,'' she said. ``When can we serve
dinner?''
   ``Finally, Pickle said, ``after hours of waiting, Lady Bird's
voice came over the radio _ `Volcano, this is Volunteer. Our guests
and I are sitting down at the table. Goodbye.'
   ``Whereupon, without a word, the president wheeled his car
around and returned to the ranch house so quickly he not only got
there in time for dinner, he got there in time to say the
blessing.''
   Another Texan remembered a hunt at the LBJ ranch for which
Johnson had made some unusual preparations. He had hired an artist
to record the results.
   After it was over the artist produced five identical paintings
showing Johnson in the foreground bringing down a bird.
   When Johnson saw the results, this Texan said, he sent it back
for retouching.
   The new version showed the president bringing down two birds,
not just one.
   Another tale teller told of a Johnson friend using his car phone
to call LBJ who was riding in his car.
   ``The purpose was to show he had his own car phone and he
started bragging about it to Johnson,'' he said.
   Johnson produced an immediate display of one-upmanship.
   ``Johnson said, `Let me put you on hold for a moment, someone's
calling on my other line.'''

<HEAD>Soviet Scientist Says USSR Not Under ``Illusion'' It's Ahead In
Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet scientist says that despite the delay
in U.S. space exploration caused by the Challenger disaster, his
country is not ahead in space.
   Albert Galeev, co-chairman of the U.S.S.R. Space Research
Institute, said Monday that the Soviets have taken advantage of the
two years that the United States has not been able to launch
satellites easily, but he said both countries could learn from the
other.
   ``We never have had the illusion that we were ahead,'' said
Galeev at a news conference at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   ``Temporarily, you've lost launch capability, but if you take
into account the satellites waiting to be launched, the
understanding is that you'll easily catch up,'' he said.
   The United States has not had regular space launches since
Challenger exploded and killed its seven crewmembers on Jan. 28,
1986. Since then, the space shuttle fleet, which was the main U.S.
launch system, has been grounded. Flights are scheduled to resume
in August.
   ``We took advantage of this delay,'' said Galeev. ``We are still
leading in a few fields.''
   He noted, however, that the Soviet Union has to launch more
satellites because its equipment is not as durable as American
models.
   ``We launch a lot of satellites but their lifetime is shorter,''
he said. ``That means we don't get as much data.''
   A Soviet astronomer, Rashid Sunyaev, also a co-chairman of the
U.S.S.R. Space Research Institute, said scientists everywhere
keenly felt the Challenger accident.
   ``Challenger was a tragedy for astronomers,'' he said, ``because
the space telescope is still on the ground.''
   Sunyaev said astronomers are anxious for the American-made
telescope to be placed into orbit and to start bringing back new
visions of the universe. The telescope is to be the most powerful
astronomy instrument ever placed into space.
   In answer to a question, Sunyaev admitted that some of the
scientific information gathered by the Soviet space program has
been used for military purposes. But he said this can be said of
many things learned by scientists.
   ``Even some of the work of Issac Newton has been used for
military purposes,'' he said. Newton formulated basic principles of
gravity and motion.
   Galeev and Sunyaev answered questions at a news conference that
marked the end of a week of meetings with American colleagues who
are members of the U.S.-Soviet joint working groups on astronomy
and astrophysics. Representatives of the two spacefaring nations
met to work out ways to exchange data from their space science
programs.
   NASA officials said the working groups arrived at an agreement,
but the plan will have to be approved by leaders of the two
governments before it is released publicly.

<HEAD>Ohio Has A Home-State Presidential Ballot In Some Districts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Traficant Jr., an Ohio congressman
waging an on-again, off-again campaign for president, is hoping to
pick up a few delegates today in his home state but admits his
chances of winning even his own congressional district are slim.
   Traficant, a Democrat from suburban Youngstown who also is
seeking his third term in Congress, announced last summer that he
would run for president to attract attention to the problems of his
congressional district, which has been hard hit by the decline of
the steel industry.
   Traficant said he would run a national campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination, but it never materialized. He
blamed a lack of money.
   ``If I had the same amount of money these other candidates had
in the state of Ohio and could have come on TV the past two weeks,
there would have been a fight,'' he said.
   Leesa Brown of the Ohio secretary of state's office said
Traficant met the qualifications to get onto the ballot in 12 of
Ohio's 21 congressional districts.
   A former sheriff, Traficant is best known for successfully
defending himself against charges that he accepted $163,000 from
mobsters in 1980. But he had little name recognition outside his
own district.
   William Binning, chairman of the political science department at
Youngstown State University, said Traficant's presidential
candidacy was actually given some credence early on because so many
of the Democratic candidates were not well known nationally.
   But ultimately, Binning said, ``I think Traficant would have to
win a major statewide office in Ohio in order to be considered a
viable candidate for president.''
   A survey conducted by Youngstown State's Center for Urban
Studies suggested residents of his district favor Traficant as a
congressman, but not as a presidential candidate.
   The poll, commissioned by The Youngstown Vindicator, indicated
38 percent of the 697 people surveyed favor Michael Dukakis, the
Democratic front-runner, with Traficant supported by 14 percent and
Jesse Jackson backed by 11 percent. Nearly a quarter of the
participants were undecided.
   However, more than 70 percent of the same respondents supported
Traficant's bid to a third term in Congress.
   The poll was conducted between April 11 and April 20 and had a
margin of error of 5-6 percentage points.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III is the
apparent target of anonymous graffiti artists who have left
inscriptions such as ``sleazy'' and ``resign'' on the walls of the
main Justice Department building.
   The graffiti began appearing at about the time two top aides to
Meese resigned March 29 due to concern about problems associated
with the criminal investigation of Meese.
   The word ``sleazy'' last week was scrawled in black, 4-inch-high
letters on a second-floor staircase in the middle of the building.
The stairwell is far from Meese's fifth-floor office but is heavily
traveled.
   Employees first noticed the graffiti there Friday, said a
Justice Department lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The basement and first-floor levels of the staircase are heavily
traveled because they lead to the cafeteria.
   In another instance, the word ``resign'' was scribbled on a wall
near Meese's office but it was cleaned off quickly, said department
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Such graffiti started appearing around the same time that Deputy
Attorney General Arnold Burns and criminal division chief William
Weld submitted their protest resignations March 29, the course said.
   Burns and Weld quit out of concern that Meese's continued tenure
as attorney general was hurting the Justice Department's operation,
morale and public image, sources said.
   Meese was in Rome on Monday for a meeting of police executives.
   Independent counsel James McKay last May 11 launched an
investigation of Meese's activities including his involvement with
the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline.
The probe also has examined his holdings of regional Bell telephone
stock and his wife's $40,000-a-year job. The money for Ursula
Meese's job comes from a Washington family whose real estate
company leases office space to the Justice Department.

<HEAD>Ozone Violations Up, Monoxide Violations Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More areas violated federal clean air
standards last year for ozone, a principal part of smog, while
fewer violated the carbon monoxide standard, the Environmental
Protection Agency said today.
   Sixty-eight urban and rural areas failed to meet the limit for
ozone, up from 62 last year. Fifty-nine urban areas failed to meet
the carbon monoxide standard, down from 65 last year.
   There is substantial overlap between the two lists, and all the
nation's 24 largest metropolitan areas are on one or both. The
largest urban area not on either list is Kansas City.
   ``We had a hot, dry summer in the East, which tends to push up
ozone levels,'' said EPA spokesman Chris Rice. ``It was much like
the summer of 1983, except confined to the East.''
   The decline in carbon monoxide was expected as more and more
cars made before 1981 are junked. Cars made before then had to meet
less stringent standards for exhaust pollution.
   In addition, the same weather that elevates ozone tends to
depress carbon monoxide, EPA noted.
   The carbon monoxide list is based on data for two years. Looking
only at 1987 readings, 37 cities would have failed to comply, while
50 would have flunked in 1986.
   Motor vehicle exhaust is the primary source of carbon monoxide,
which can interfere with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
   In most areas, motor vehicles also are the major source of a key
raw material for making smog, unburned gasoline from both exhaust
pipes and natural evaporation from the fuel system.
   Those gasoline vapors react in sunlight with oxides of nitrogen,
also present in exhausts as well as in power plant emissions, to
produce ozone. The brighter and sunnier the day, the more ozone
that is produced.
   Ozone is the part of smog that interferes with breathing and
makes the chest feel tight.
   Winds can blow the raw materials for ozone away from the source,
but they may still react in sunlight, which accounts for violations
in several rural counties in Maine, EPA says. The chemicals that
made their ozone were emitted in the Boston-Washington corridor.
   Because weather has such an influence on ozone, EPA judges
compliance in three-year blocks. This year's compliance is based on
ozone readings for 1985-1987.
   But weather can still push areas into and out of compliance. For
example, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Mich., and Richmond,
Va., are listed as violators this year, but were not last year. All
four were on the 1986 list using 1983-1985 data.
   The relevant ozone readings for those four cities for 1985-1987
are similar to those for 1983-1985, possibly because the summers of
1983 and 1987 were similar, Rice said.
   Los Angeles is far and away the national leader in ozone
pollution, with an average of 143.5 days out of compliance per year
over the three-year period. Elsewhere, only Houston, Atlanta and
Philadelphia showed 10 or more estimated days per year in which the
ozone standard would be exceeded. On last year's list, Houston, New
York, much of urban Connecticut, Dallas and El Paso, Texas showed
such days.
   EPA's lists were produced three months early this year to help
Congress decide what to do about areas that fail to meet the
standards.
   Congress has prohibited EPA from taking any action against
non-complying areas until Aug. 31 while it debates the issue.
   EPA had planned penalties for some areas for failure to comply
with planning requirements.
   The turnover of the motor vehicle fleet will eventually bring
all but a handful of areas into compliance with the carbon monoxide
standard, EPA believes. Rice said agency analysts now estimate that
just four to six cities would not comply eventually.
   For ozone, however, 25 or more cities will not comply without
more stringent control measures, EPA says.

   A Christian Science couple pleaded innocent to
manslaughter in the death of their 2{-year-old son who died after
they refused to seek medical help for him because of their beliefs.
   David and Ginger Twitchell entered the plea at their arraignment
Monday in Suffolk Superior Court on charges stemming from the April
8, 1986, death of their son Robyn.
   Magistrate Gary Wilson set a pretrial conference for June 1, and
ordered the Twitchells, who have two other sons, released on their
recognizance.
   The Twitchells are the second Christian Science parents to be
prosecuted in Massachusetts and the first since 1971, when the
state amended the child abuse and neglect law to recognize
spiritual healing as an alternative to modern medicine.
   Followers of Christian Science refuse medicine or other health
care on the belief that true understanding of God acts as a cure.

   Ancient custom permits one woman in Kenya
to take another as a ``wife,'' but a divorce case involving two
such women has thrown up a challenge to Kenya's Western-style legal
system.
   The case involves Wanjiru Gutu, a barren widow, who 10 years ago
took Mary Njeri Macharia as a ``wife'' to bear her the children she
desperately wanted.
   The relationship went sour and the women have asked a
Western-style divorce court to sort out their broken marriage,
including the question of alimony, child support and property
settlement.
   ``We don't have a precedent for this case,'' said Paul Mberi,
Ms. Macharia's lawyer.
   ``The problem we have is that our legal system as practiced in
the courts is changing to the Western legal system. But at the same
time, in the village we are living with people whose arrangements
are based on customary law concepts.''
   Marriage between women is not uncommon in Kenya and neither is
divorce.
   But this case is unique because the couple has turned to Western
laws, instead of adhering to custom and letting tribal elders
decide the issue.
   Barren women, such as Ms. Gutu, often take one or more fertile
women as ``wives'' to bear children, which the female ``husband''
then claims as her own. Even married women make such arrangements,
with the husband of the barren woman fathering children by his
spouse's wife.
   Barren women often are ostracized in Africa, where wealth and
prestige still are measured by the number of children a couple has.
   Since both Ms. Macharia and Ms. Gutu were single, Ms. Macharia
was entitled to choose the man to father the children.
   For the surrogate mother, such an arrangement offers the
security of a home and income.
   Ms. Macharia, in her late 20s, was a single mother of two
children, aged 12 and 10, when she married Ms. Gutu and took her
surname. She brought them to Ms. Gutu's home and had two more
children, now 7 and 5.
   After a fierce quarrel in January 1986, Ms. Gutu chased her
``wife'' from their matrimonial home in the western Kenyan town of
Nakuru, according to court records.
   Before turning to the Western-style courts, Ms. Macharia twice
went to a court of tribal elders, asking for alimony and child
support or a share of Ms. Gutu's property, including a small
grocery store.
   Ms. Gutu, about 60, complained that Ms. Macharia beat her,
threatened her life and stole from the business.
   Both times the elders ruled that Ms. Macharia could keep the
children but should receive nothing else.
   ``This was not a hardship in the past, as the woman would go
back to her father and his community, which jointly owned and
shared land and resources,'' explained Gibson Kamau Kuria, a
Nairobi lawyer who specializes in family law.
   Ms. Macharia did return to her father, a peasant farmer near
Nakuru. But when she felt that she and the children were a burden,
she sued her former ``husband'' for divorce in the district
magistrate's court, again demanding alimony and child support or a
share of Ms. Gutu's property.
   She filed suit in August 1986, but the case has been delayed by
a backlog and is expected to be heard soon.
   Ms. Gutu had told the tribal courts Ms. Macharia had no money or
property when they married, and that the relationsip gave her
status and a comfortable lifestyle.
   Odhiambo Ochieng', Ms. Gutu's lawyer, argues in an affidavit
that because the marriage is recognized only by customary law, only
a traditional solution is possible: for Ms. Macharia to return to
her father's family with nothing.
   Kenya's very diversity is at the root of the now-budding legal
problems.
   The East African nation's 22 million people are divided among
dozens of ethnic groups who abide by Islamic, Hindu and various
tribal customary laws in addition to the statutory Western laws
inherited from British colonizers at independence 25 years ago.
   A case last year pitted the widow of a prominent lawyer, S.M.
Otieno, against his Luo clansmen in a tussle over whether the widow
or the tribe should bury him. The High Court ruled that in the
absence of written law, customary law prevails.
   Otieno's widow lost.
   ``These problems are going to have to be tackled and will not go
away until Kenya is lived in by an overall younger and more modern
generation,'' Ochieng' said.

<HEAD>Bush Backers May Make Dukakis' Budget-Balancing Struggle A
Campaign Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who has made his
efficiency as a manager one of the key selling points in his
presidential campaign, is struggling to balance his state budgets
for this year and next year.
   Dukakis' budget-balancing efforts are turning into something of
a balancing act, because his status as the Democratic front-runner
puts him under intense scrutiny.
   Supporters of Republican rival George Bush are hoping the
situation will provide them with ammunition they can use against
the governor.
   Dukakis boasts that he has given Massachusetts nine balanced
budgets as governor, including the current one for fiscal 1988, and
that he will do the same for the coming fiscal year.
   But he'll have to find some way to make up a $77 million revenue
shortfall this year, and already has proposed $233 million in
additional cuts to offset supplementary spending.
   ``We will make the necessary adjustments which will make it
possible for us to live within our income,'' Dukakis said last week.
   He said there are ``a number of ways to do that,'' but hasn't
said exactly which way he favors.
   Bush backers were rubbing their hands in anticipation.
   ``I think it raises a credibility issue for the governor,'' said
Sen. Paul Cellucci, George Bush's state campaign chairman. ``He has
talked about balancing a federal budget, yet it appears he is going
to have difficulty with a fiscal 1989 state budget.''
   Dukakis said he will work matters out with the legislature. But
some lawmakers are grumbling that that hasn't happened yet.
   ``You are telling us you are going to work with us, and you
haven't worked with us,'' Rep. Christopher Hodgkins, a Democrat on
the budget-writing House Ways and Means Committee, told Dukakis'
budget chief, Frank Keefe, during an appearance before the
committee last week.
   No one doubts that the budgets ultimately will be balanced,
because they must be under the state constitution. But how Dukakis
does it could become a campaign issue.
   ``He is either going to have to raise taxes or cut human
services spending, neither of which he wants to do. So it's
something we (Republicans) are obviously going to watch very
carefully,'' said Cellucci.
   Advocacy groups fighting to keep funding for their programs are
mindful of Dukakis' status as a presidential candidate.
   ``I think the governor running for president has created a
situation where the advocates feel that they can leverage his
cooperation more _ that they can make him look bad if they don't
get what they want,'' said Barbara Salisbury, the state budget
director.
   Dukakis and his aides have consistently said he will not cut
existing services to balance this year's budget, but will instead
clamp down on program expansions, primarily in human services. But
even that tactic is bringing complaints.
   ``People were promised ... they were going to get this service
and they still haven't gotten it yet,'' said Deborah Weinstein,
executive director of the Massachusetts Human Services Coalition.
``That is suffering and you can't take that away.''
   The Dukakis administration had projected 6.6 percent revenue
growth, but this week reduced its estimate to 5.7 percent. Even so,
House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Voke says the
administration's revenue estimates are too optimistic.
   A large part of the shortfall is blamed on smaller-than-expected
corporate tax collections due to a state law allowing state
companies to use losses on out-of-state subsidiaries to reduce
their Massachusetts tax bill.
   Dukakis has proposed changing this measure. Meanwhile, the state
has an appeal pending with the Massachusetts Supreme Court.
   The governor has proposed a $700 million package of savings and
revenue increases to balance his fiscal 1989 budget. Some of the
controversial features include:
   _Recouping $70 million in unclaimed bottle deposits from
beverage wholesalers. That issue is also before the courts.
   _Spending $22 million for more tax collectors _ some of the
nearly 1,600 new jobs contained in the budget _ to raise $190
million in new revenue.
   _Raising $55 million by requiring applicants for Medicaid
nursing home coverage to agree to a state lien on their homes for
reimbursement after they die. The administration has modified the
proposal to say Medicaid eligibility will be delayed after
applicants transfer assets to others, depending on the size of the
transfers.

   Vice President George Bush says Michael
Dukakis is displaying his lack of experience on foreign affairs
with ``macho'' talk about how to oust Panama's dictator.
   Bush was headed to Morgantown, W.Va., today to visit research
facilities at West Virginia University before returning home for a
belated victory party this evening to celebrate his clinching the
number of delegates needed to win the GOP presidential nomination.
   West Virginia's primary is a week from today.
   On a primary-eve campaign swing to Ohio and Indiana on Monday,
Bush ridiculed both Dukakis and Jesse Jackson for what the vice
president said was naivete about how Panaman's strongman, Manuel
Antonio Noriega, should be dealt with.
   ``You'd think it's a cinch listening to these guys: `Throw out
Noriega! Do this! Do that!''' Bush said.
   Noriega is under a U.S. drug indictment. In pressuring him to
step down, Bush said the United States must avoid moves that hurt
the Panamanian people or seem like some ``great bullying,
gringos-of-the-North kind of overstatement of power.''
   Bush told high school students in Vandalia, Ohio, that ``we're
still living down'' past military intervention in Central America.
   ``Ninety percent are now living under democracy in this
hemisphere. We don't want to set that back by some kind of macho
statement out of Harvard,'' Bush said. Dukakis was a lecturer at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   Even with the nomination all but in hand, Bush was continuing to
campaign in primary states. On Wednesday, he heads to California,
which votes June 7.
   Bush's celebration tonight comes a week after he actually
obtained his mathematical lock on the nomination. He secured the
last few delegates he needed in the Pennsylvania primary on April
26.
   Aides had thought it would take today's round of contests _ in
Ohio, Indiana and the District of Columbia _ to put him over the
top.
   Bush told 1,200 supporters at the Canton Civic Center Monday
evening, ``They say, `What in God's name are you doing in Canton,
Ohio, when you got this Republican nomination wrapped up?' I will
not project in overconfidence. I will not project in arrogance.''
   ``I will work right down to the Republican convention and, with
your help, in the fall will be the next president of the United
States,'' he said. He predicted ``a classical confrontation'' in
the general election with a liberal Democrat nominee.
   Stephen Hart, a Bush spokesman, said President Reagan is not
expected at tonight's ``Over The Top'' celebration at a posh
Washington hotel. There had been speculation that Reagan, who has
stayed neutral during the GOP primaries, would use the occasion to
formally endorse Bush.
   Bush said in Mishawaka, Ind., on Monday, ``I had the feeling the
president did endorse me at lunch the other day.''
   That was a reference to a private White House meeting with the
president, at which Reagan congratulated him for his Pennsylvania
win and the White House indicated a formal endorsement would come
soon.
   Bush seemed exasperated when the question was raised again by
local reporters in Canton.
   ``Do you think there's any doubt in any credible person's mind
about who he's for? So what's the big deal?'' he said. ``You'll see
an endorsement soon, so stay tuned.''

<TEXT>
   The political joustings, coded language and
sophistictated election arguments of Paris fade long before they
reach this French provincial capital.
   To the residents of Foix, President Francois Mitterrand and
challenger Jacques Chirac are just about the same.
   ``Do you know what `bof' means?'' asks 80-year-old Roger Boy, a
retired draftsman, as he sipped his morning coffee on the main
square of this lovely town nestled in the foothills of the Pyrenees.
   Bof is a French expression that amounts to a verbal shrug. And
that's exactly how Boy and many other inhabitants of Foix view
Sunday's election runoff between the Socialist president and the
conservative premier.
   ``Whether its one or the other, things will continue just the
same,'' said Boy. ``It's `le bof' in general.
   Foix, a town of about 10,000 residents 500 miles from Paris, is
the capital of the Ariege Department, one of the least populated
districts of the country. It is dominated by the 11th century
chateau of the Counts of Foix perched on a massive rock overlooking
the town.
   The area has a long Socialist tradition, and because of this
Mitterrand is favored, but with more resignation than enthusiasm.
   On April 24, in the first round of voting, the Ariege gave
Mitterrand 41 percent of its vote, seven points above the
president's national score, and 18 percent to Chirac, two points
under his overall showing.
   Mitterrand no doubt will win again here Sunday, but it will be a
gut vote more than a carefully reasoned choice.
   Jacques Doumenc, who for the past 25 years has been the local
correspondent for the Toulouse newspaper 50 miles away, put it best
when he said the things people here really care about are
television reception and a proposed tunnel to Spain.
   ``Mitterrand doesn't have a program for after May 8,'' said
Gerard Firon, a local homebuilder. ``Really, there is no
fundamental difference between the two. And they both need the Le
Pen vote.''
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right National Front,
won 14.4 percent in the first round, stunning many political
observers. Le Pen campaigned hard on a platform of ridding France
of its immigrants and cracking down on law and order.
   In the Ariege, despite its leftist tradition, Le Pen won 10.3
percent. It's hard to find somebody who will own up to voting for
the extreme right and many Fuxiens, as local residents are called,
were looking suspiciously at their neighbors last week.
   Bernard Rouch lounged on a bench in Foix's packed criminal
court, wearing the traditional black bailiff's robe. A crowd waited
for the jury to return its verdict in a sensational local murder
case.
   ``The Ariege is a place where we live well,'' he said. ``There
is no pollution, no racism. There is unemployment, yes ... but we
live well. I don't know about Le Pen. It's a rejection phenomenon.''
   Despite the lack of enthusiasm for Mitterrand, polls after the
first round show him winning the runoff by scores ranging from
53-47 percent to 57-43 percent.
   Mitterrand ``still represents a popular image that no other
political group can match,'' said defense attorney Yves Saez, just
before the jury convicted his client and sentenced her to 12 years
in prison for bludgeoning her husband to death.
   In the Cafe de la Mairie on the night of the great debate
between Mitterrand and Chirac, most of the clientele sat in the
back room drinking and socializing. Up front, where the debate was
on the television, only a few folks paid attention.
   Lined up on a bench were four working-class men in their 30s and
40s, stonefaced, arms crossed. After the two-hour debate, they got
up as a unit and left. One of them, in another typical French
mannerism, expressed his opinion by filling his cheeks with air and
letting it out with a soft puff.
   ``They're all the same.''
   The next morning at the farmers' market, a peasant selling her
cheese declared herself for Mitterrand, but was hard put to explain
why.
   ``We live on agricultural subsidies,'' she said. ``For peasants
it's an absolute necessity.''
   Has Chirac threatened to cut subsidies?
   ``Well, you have the feeling that you are listened to under the
left. Under the right, decisions are made without consultation, and
that's it.''

<HEAD>Reagan Aides Recommend Veto of Benefits for `Atomic Veterans'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's advisers are recommending
that he veto a bill which would grant some new benefits to ``atomic
veterans,'' the American servicemen exposed to radiation in the
1945 occupation of Japan or during post-World War II tests of
nuclear weapons.
   The bill was sent to Reagan after the House approved it Monday
on a 326-2 vote, which would be far above the two-thirds majority
needed to override any veto.
   However, the Senate margin last week was just 48-30, indicating
that a veto could be sustained there.
   The Veterans Administration opposes the bill and says there is
no direct evidence proving that the veterans' exposure is causing
current health problems.
   The bill was part of a larger measure authorizing benefits for
some 2.7 million veterans. But it was stripped out after
administration officials said they would recommend a veto of the
overall bill because of the ``atomic veterans'' provision.
   The measure would cover an estimated 250,000 U.S. military
personnel who were in Hiroshima or Nagasaki after U.S. atomic bombs
were dropped on those Japanese cities in August 1945, or who took
part in open-air tests of U.S. nuclear weapons in the southern
Pacific Ocean or in Nevada after the war.
   Many have health problems which they say are related to their
radiation exposure. But the Veterans Administration says they can't
get disability benefits unless they can show a direct link to their
service duty.
   The bill establishes a presumptive link and sets out 13 types of
cancers for which the veterans could receive disability payments.
   According to Rep. J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., the VA has only allowed
44 of the 6,000 claims filed by atomic veterans.
   The chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Rep. G.V.
Montgomery, D-Miss., said the VA's standard can't be met because
``the level of exposure cannot be verified.''
   He said that during the tests, some personnel didn't wear
radiation-monitoring badges, other servicemen lost their badges and
some badges were found to be ineffective.
   Rep. Bob McEwen, R-Ohio, called the bill ``a reasonable and
modest approach'' to the problem. ``If we err in our approach, and
I think we do not, then we err on the side of compassion,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviet Delegations Discuss Building New Nuclear Power Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a Soviet delegation says
prospects are good for collaboration with a U.S. company to develop
new nuclear power reactors.
   The company, GA Technologies of San Diego, Calif., built the
only working commercial gas-cooled reactor in the United States,
the Fort St. Vrain plant of Colorado Public Service Co. near Denver.
   A joint U.S.-Soviet committee on peaceful uses of atomic energy
last week visited GA Technologies for talks on development of
so-called modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactors.
   In a ceremony at the State Department on Monday in which the
heads of both delegations signed a document recommending renewal of
the cooperation agreement, the Soviet chairman, Alexandor N.
Protsenko, said, ``We think the prospects are very good for
collaboration with (GA Technologies) in this area, as well as with
other companies.''
   The agreement was begun by President Nixon and Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev in 1973. It was renewed in 1983 and 1985.
   Asked just what form cooperation with GA Technologies might
take, Protsenko, who is chairman of the state committee for the
utilization of atomic energy, said through an interpreter the
Soviet and United States delegations were discussing ``a possible
collaborative program with (the company) in the context of the
general agreement.''
   But, he added, ``We don't exclude the possibility that our
cooperation will lead to a time where we might have a separate
agreement'' with GA Technologies.
   Gas-cooled reactors have been widely used in Europe, but neither
the Soviet Union nor the United States has favored them for
civilian power.
   They do offer certain safety advantages, such as slow reaction
to disturbances. Modular designs, which could be built efficiently
in small sizes so utilities could add generating capacity only as
needed, have attracted increasing attention both in the United
States and the Soviet Union, and the Soviets plan to complete
construction of two in 1995.
   The modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor is ``a good
example of a safe, economically feasible new generation of
reactor,'' Protsenko said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Cautions Against Overconfidence But Focuses On Contest
With Bush</HEAD>

   Democrat Michael Dukakis is looking ahead to the
November election with calls for Vice President George Bush to
provide more information about his role in the Iran-Contra affair
and the Reagan administration's dealings with Panama.
   The Democratic front-runner also turned aside criticism from
Jesse Jackson, but continued to avoid any sharp attacks on his
Democratic rival.
   Dukakis was back home in Boston today, after a day of
primary-eve campaigning in Ohio and Indiana where he held a
substantial lead in the polls. The District of Columbia is holding
a primary today too, with Jackson seen as sure to win there.
   Dukakis, trying to prevent overconfidence in his camp, urged
supporters to disregard the polls in Ohio and Indiana.
   ``This is not over,'' he said. ``It's very, very important that
we get a big turnout.''
   At the same time, though, the Democratic front-runner was
warming up for a fall campaign against Bush.
   Bush has been criticizing Dukakis for foreign policy
inexperience, and did so again Monday. Dukakis in turn questioned
the administration's dealings with Panamanian strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment on drug charges, and
Bush's role in other foreign policy matters including the
Iran-Contra affair.
   ``This administration for the past 7{ years has broken the law.
... I think the vice president has to address the issue,'' he said
in an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``I want to know why we were doing business with Noriega, why
they were paying off Noriega, why they were doing business with a
drug-running Panamanian dictator,'' he told reporters in Cleveland.
``That's the first thing we need, a full explanation, and I think
the people of America are entitled to it.''
   Earlier, Dukakis said Bush was promising to be ``the education
president'' without saying whether he opposed administration
cutbacks in college financial aid programs.
   ``I don't know where the vice president stands on education,''
Dukakis said. ``I don't know if he has a program.''
   In addition to criticism from Bush, Dukakis has come under
increasing fire from Jackson in recent days. But Dukakis refused to
respond directly.
   ``I hope we can keep it positive,'' he said upon arriving in
Boston. ``While we have some differences, we respect each other.''
   In Cleveland, responding to Jackson's suggestion that he lacks
leadership, Dukakis ticked off his administration's
accomplishments, including his state's 2.9 percent unemployment
rate and legislation providing health care for all workers.
   ``That's a lot of fire and a lot of productivity,'' Dukakis
said. ``I'm not just a talker. I'm a doer. There's no question
about my record.''
   In an interview with Japanese television, Dukakis said he would
try to negotiate a trade agreement with Japan that accommodated
both nations. He also called on Japan to increase its aid to
developing nations.
   ``I would also hope that Japan could do a great deal in Third
World countries with its surpluses,'' he said.

   Audrey Deetz thought her traveling days were
over when she was diagnosed as having emphysema. But this week
she's packing for her third Caribbean cruise, accompanied by a
hospital medical team.
   For the third year, University Hospitals of Cleveland is sending
a doctor, nurses and therapists on a week-long cruise with a group
of people with chronic lung diseases. The trip begins Sunday from
Fort Lauderdale with ports of call including Jamaica and Grand
Cayman.
   ``You might say we're all in the same boat,'' said the
73-year-old Ms. Deetz. ``We all have something in common. We
understand each other's problems.''
   Dr. Michael Nochomovitz, medical director of the hospital's
Pulmonary Treatment Center, said many people with breathing
problems are afraid to travel because of their unstable health.
   ``They live for years with the anxiety of something happening
suddenly,'' said Nochomovitz, who went on the first two trips.
``Cruise lines are not equipped to handle complex medical illnesses
and you can't expect them to be.''
   He said the hospital-sponsored cruise developed after a patient
brought up the problem of traveling. Besides the patient's fear,
there's the problem of carrying oxygen supplies and other medical
equipment along, he said.
   Some airlines and cruise lines won't allow the equipment, a
situation that Nochomovitz wants changed.
   ``Somehow we've got to set up a system to accommodate these
people so they can live as near as normal lives as possible,'' he
said.
   University Hospitals plans the cruise with a supplier of home
medical equipment that publicizes the trip among its customers. The
first cruise drew about 25 people, including 17 patients. Last
year, the group swelled to 80 people, about half patients, from
more than a dozen states.
   The cost of the cruise ranges from $1,600 to $2,000.
   Nochomovitz said this year's trip was almost canceled because of
Coast Guard restrictions on portable oxygen tanks on cruise ships.
But Nochomovitz said an exemption was obtained to allow about three
dozen to make the trip.
   Some past participants hadn't traveled for years because of
their health problems, said Nochomovitz. ``For many of the
patients, this is a goal,'' he said.
   The trip has many side effects as well, he added.
   ``It's humbling to see how this experience improves on the
patient's sense of well being, achievement and independence,''
Nochomovitz said.
   Ms. Deetz said the first hospital-sponsored cruise gave her the
confidence to continue traveling.
   She was found to have emphysema about four years ago, after
returning from a trip to Stockholm. The cruise was her next trip.
   ``I thought (my travels) were over and that's why I jumped at
the first cruise,'' said Ms. Deetz, of suburban Berea.
   Next week's cruise will be her fifth in three years, and she's
planning a trip to Europe this summer with one of her three sons.
She takes along a breathing machine for daily treatment.
   ``I enjoy the cruises. They're really wonderful for people like
me,'' she said.

   A woman accused of stabbing a man in the
head with a 12-inch-long bayonet after he dropped a beer can in her
yard has been charged with aggravated battery, authorities said.
   Oakre Johnson was charged in Peoria County Circuit Court on
Monday, said county Sheriff's Sgt. Daniel Basfield. Bond was set at
$15,000, and a preliminary hearing was scheduled May 27.
   The 51-year-old Peoria woman is accused of attacking Steven C.
Johnson, 37, in a parking lot Saturday after he refused to pick up
the empty beer can, Basfield said.
   When officers arrived, Ms. Johnson was sitting on her porch with
the bayonet, according to a police report.
   Johnson was treated for cuts on the back of his head, forehead
and chin.
   Basfield said he did not believe Johnson and Ms. Johnson were
related.

   Actor Tom Hanks, who romanced a mermaid in
the movie ``Splash,'' has taken the plunge in real life.
   Hanks and actress Rita Wilson were married Saturday night at an
undisclosed Los Angeles church, his publicist, Heidi Schaefer, said
Monday. The couple left for a honeymoon at an undisclosed location,
Miss Schaefer said.
   No details were released because the couple doesn't want any
publicity, she said.
   Hanks and Miss Wilson met while making the film ``Volunteers,''
Miss Schaefer said.
   She said they will live in Los Angeles.
   Hanks' other screen credits include ``Nothing in Common'' and
``Dragnet.'' He stars in the comedy ``Big,'' scheduled for June
release, and appears with Sally Field in the film ``Punchline,''
due out this year.

<TEXT>
   One day after a water rationing plan took
effect, decorative fountains fell idle, bar tabs grew and plumbing
supply stores reported brisk sales of water-saving devices.
   San Francisco residents have been told to cut consumption by 25
percent in response to the area's most severe water shortage since
the 1976-77 drought. But many of the cutbacks will be highly
visible to the hundreds of thousands of tourists who crowd the
City-By-The-Bay each summer.
   Only fountains that use recycled water _ like the one in front
of City Hall _ continued to flow Monday. Others were still filled
with water, but no longer sprayed it into the air or let it tumble
from sculpted waterfalls.
   Restaurants no longer serve water to diners automatically. Many,
like Maxwell's Plum at Ghirardelli Square, have posted signs
advising diners of the regulation.
   ``I would say right now, about one-quarter of the customers have
asked for water,'' said dining director Robert Stewart as he
observed the popular restaurant's luncheon crowd.
   If one person at a table asks for water, only he gets water,
said Stewart.
   Business at the bar was up, Stewart said.
   ``At lunch, most people have a beverage. They have a drink, they
have a little wine,'' he said. ``The only people who might complain
are usually from the Midwest. You know, they don't generally drink
(alcohol) as much.''
   Homeowners were snatching up plumbing supplies such as sink
washers and flow-restricting shower heads.
   At the supermarket-like Goodman's Lumber store, plumbing manager
Andy Pappas said he was especially busy Sunday afternoon as
customers sought ways to cut water use in their homes.
   He said people were especially interested in water-saving shower
heads, which Goodman's stocks at prices ranging from $5 to $40.
``The expensive ones have more adjustments for the spray,'' Pappas
said.
   ``We carry a flow restrictor kit (for about $3), but it seems
like they're more interested in putting on a new head,'' he said.
``We're also selling a lot of washers.
   ``We're getting a lot of questions on what to do to save
water,'' he said. ``They're bugging us pretty good on that.''
   Meanwhile, city officials confirmed that 12 million gallons of
water per year _ enough to supply 30,000 households _ are wasted
cooling City Hall computers without any recycling system. The water
is pumped continuously through four huge air conditioners that keep
the temperature cool for the basement computers, city engineers
said.
   The city Public Works Department will ask the Board of
Supervisors this week for an emergency fund to buy a water tower
that would recycle the waste, said Richard Evans, public works
director.
   The water has been dumped down the drain after one pass for 22
years, he said, explaining why no tower was built into the design.
   ``With technology what it is, a water cooling tower 10 years ago
might have been the size of City Hall,'' said Evans.
   Residents won't know exactly how much water they need to save
until mid-May. City officials will send a notice to each household
telling them how many gallons they used during an average month
during the past year and, hence, how much they need to save 25
percent.
   City officials actually expect people to cut their personal use
by 10 percent and reduce outdoor uses _ like car washing and lawn
watering _ by 60 percent.
   Residents who don't save enough will pay premium prices for the
extra water they use. Anyone who doesn't think their allotment is
fair can appeal.
   Although there was a chance of rain in the forecast for today,
water officials said it's highly unlikely Northern California will
get enough rain this season to make up for its extremely dry winter.

<TEXT>
   Some people write as a hobby,
scribbling in journals or dashing off verse and short stories for
nothing more than their own pleasure.
   Others, be they authors of flashy ad campaigns, creators of TV
sitcoms or this year's Hemingway, are blessed with enough talent
and good fortune to do it for money.
   But Van Garner, a mental patient-turned-poet and songwriter,
uses his typewriter to exorcise the demons that led him to two
nervous breakdowns and a bout with alcoholism.
   ``It's been the real savior for me, writing,'' he says,
``because it gave me a chance to bring out my inner feelings.''
   Garner, 55, of Chattanooga, is the author of ``Deep Within,'' a
recently published collection of poetry, and a gospel music album,
``Polished by the Master,'' to be released this month.
   His voice deliberate and thoughtful, his eyes lively, there's
little in Garner's demeanor to suggest his rocky past. But his work
is the culmination of a journey that began 28 years ago at Warner
Robins Air Force Base in Georgia.
   That's where Garner was stationed when he suffered his first
nervous breakdown. Although granted an honorable discharge after
observation by military officials, he soon checked into a Veterans
Administration mental hospital in Murfreesboro.
   The doctors diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic: He
suffered from feelings of persecution marked by flights of fantasy,
illogical thinking and hallucinations.
   ``I would be depressed one moment, then I'd go to another
extreme and be as high as a kite,'' he said.
   He spent three months in locked confinement. Then another
patient suggested he enter a Hospitalized Veterans Writing Project
contest. Reluctantly, he submitted an article.
   Then another, and some short stories and poetry. Nearly all
focused on his illness. One poem, ``The Apple,'' read in part:
   ``Take an apple from a tree;
   Pretend that apple is me;
   Now cut the apple in half,
   Hear one part cry, one part laugh!''
   He won some prizes, but that wasn't the important thing. Putting
the words down seemed to release something within him.
   ``The more I wrote, the better I felt,'' Garner said.
   In 1965, after five years of hospitalization, he was discharged.
``I literally wrote myself out of the hospital,'' he said.
   Two years later, he met and married Helen, his wife of 21 years.
He suffered another nervous breakdown and was hospitalized for
three months in 1972, but he hasn't been back in the hospital.
   Garner's work has appeared in numerous poetry anthologies, and
he has published two collections of short stories.
   Dick Green, whose G&G Publishers of Nashville published ``Deep
Within,'' remembered his first impression of Garner's poetry.
   ``He was almost like an inner soul crying out,'' Green said.
``There was something there that really sort of got to me.''
   Garner doesn't expect his efforts to make him rich. But he
figures he's already done pretty well.
   ``I want to tell people what I went through so it may help
someone else who may say, `Well, this is the end. I had a nervous
breakdown, and this is the end of the world,''' he said.
   ``But it isn't the end. It's just the beginning.''

<TEXT>
   Japanese authorities on Tuesday investigated the
apparent engine failures that caused a United Airlines jumbo jet
with 258 people aboard to make an emergency landing with only one
of its four engines working.
   The plane landed safely Monday after two of the engines stopped
over the Pacific and the third stopped just before the landing, an
airline official said.
   Kyodo News Service, quoting airport and airline officials it did
not identify, said the pilot shut off the engines after noticing
problems with fuel gauges. It was not known if that meant the plane
was running out of fuel.
   United spokesman Katsuro Isa said emergency vehicles stood by at
the New Tokyo International Airport in Narita, 40 miles northeast
of Tokyo, but the Boeing 747 taxied to the terminal under its own
power.
   None of the 239 passengers and 19 crew members on the Los
Angeles-Tokyo flight was injured, he said.
   UAL Flight 97 was 39,000 feet above the Pacific and about 125
miles from Narita when the first engine stopped, Kyodo reported.
   Isa said that half an hour later, 45 minutes before landing, the
second engine stopped and the pilot radioed the Narita control
tower for an ``expedited approach.'' The third engine stopped
shortly before the plane landed at 3:17 p.m.
   Passenger Shinobu Murota, 21, said flight attendants ordered
people to put on life jackets as the plane approached Japan and
said they might have to make an emergency landing.
   ``A few minutes later the sound of the engine suddenly stopped,
and I felt as if the plane was floating in the air like a hang
glider,'' Ms. Murota told The Associated Press.
   Passengers cheered and applauded when the Boeing 747-100 settled
on the runway, Kyodo said.
   ``I expected death at any moment,'' it quoted Kazuko Kato as
saying. Mrs. Kato, who was returning from her honeymoon, shouted at
her husband when the plane landed: ``Thank goodness we didn't die!''
   Boeing spokesman David Jimenez in Seattle, Wash., said the safe
landing did not surprise him.
   ``Almost any aircraft we have is capable of operating on one
engine,'' he said. Jimenez said he did not know of another 747
losing power in three engines.
   A Tokyo newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, said in its Tuesday
editions that while the jumbo jet was some 120 miles from Narita
control tower authorities at the airport received the following
message from the pilot: ``Out of the four main engines, the
condition of No. 1 and No. 4 engines at both ends is bad and I want
to make an emergency landing.''
   The newspaper account added, ``According to the Transport
Ministry, the Narita airport office and the airline, during the
flight the gauge that indicates how much fuel is feeding into the
engine from the fuel tank showed there was almost no fuel going
into engines number 1 and 4 and that the No. 3 engine was also
malfunctioning.
   ``For this reason, the pilot turned off the number 1 and 4
engines at about 2:00 p.m. and 2:40 p.m. (Tuesday local time)
consecutively. After requesting emergency landing permission from
control authorities, he turned off engine 3 just before beginning
to glide in for a landing.''
   A statement released by United Airlines in Chicago said in part
that about one hour and 15 minutes before the jetliner landed ``it
lost power in one of the four engines. About 30 minutes later they
lost power to a second engine. And just before landing they lost
power to a third engine. The plane landed safely and taxied to the
terminal under its own power where the passengers deplaned in a
normal fashion. The cause of the incident is still under

   The mishap occurred several hours after the government urged
Japanese airlines to ground and do maintenance checks on Boeing 737
jets of the model that lost part of its fuselage last week on an
inter-island flight in Hawaii.
   An official of the Transport Ministry's engineering deparment
said the 21 Boeing 737s in Japan are operated by All Nippon
Airways, Air Nippon and the airline Nansei Koku.

   Police say they'll try to work with groups
planning demonstrations during this summer's Democratic National
Convention but warn that space is limited and that protests will
have to be scheduled.
   Only five groups have applied so far for demonstration permits
during the July convention, but many more are expected.
   ``We assume we'll have a lot of diverse groups here and, to the
extent we can accommodate them, we plan to,'' said Deputy Chief
W.J. Taylor. ``We don't want anyone to feel they are not welcome.''
   However, the American Civil Liberties Union charged last week
that was exactly what was happening, and threatened legal action
unless the city clarified the procedures it intends to follow for
handling protest groups.
   The ACLU's key complaint is that the city has not adopted rules
and procedures for permitting demonstrations, Margaret L. Dudney, a
staff attorney for the organization's Georgia chapter, said Monday.
   She also contended that the city has not said whether it intends
to adhere to existing rules requiring seven days' notice for street
marches and 30 days' notice to hold political gatherings in parks.
   In addition, some city officials have indicated that downtown
parks will not be available for demonstrations, she said.
   Taylor said those problems are being addressed.
   ``The problem is, there's not that much available space,'' he
said.
   Taylor said the city is trying to secure two parking lots
directly across from The Omni, the convention site, to serve as
staging areas for demonstrations. Some downtown parks also may be
used, he said.
   The advance-notice rules for street demonstrations and park use
will be waived, he said, so long as organized groups have obtained
permits.
   No applications have been processed yet, and none will be acted
on until June, he said.
   Those already seeking permits are the International Society for
Krishna Consciousness; the Lenora Fulani Committee, which supports
Ms. Fulani's New York-based New Alliance Party campaign for the
presidency; a committee supporting legislative equality for
homosexuals; a local group calling itself ``Arts Pluribus Unum'';
and another local group called Alternative 88. The group was formed
by the owners of the Metroplex nightclub in Atlanta.
   Partner James Fleter said the group is designed to serve as ``a
loose coordinating group for different groups that will be raising
First Amendment and alternative issues.''

   Artist Jackson Pollack's painting, ``The
Search,'' believed to be his last canvas, fetched $4.84 million _ a
record for a work of contemporary art _ in frenzied bidding at
Sotheby's Monday night, the auction house said.
   The auction, which included works put up for sale by various
owners as well as artist Andy Warhol's personal collection, brought
in $25,954,500, a record for an auction of contemporary art, said
Lucy Mitchell-Innes, the head of Sotheby's contemporary art
department.
   Record prices were set for works by 12 artists, including
Pollack, Warhol, Franz Kline, Cy Twombly, David Hockney and Richard
Diebenkorn. Six paintings sold for over $1 million, she said.
   ``The contemporary (art) world is now extremely aware of the
rarity of these really important paintings,'' she said. ``People
are very sensitive to the fact that these paintings won't come up
again. People know this is their last shot.''
   ``I've never seen the bidding as heated as it was this
evening,'' said Ms. Mitchell-Innes.
   The auction of Warhol's personal collection of contemporary art
brought in $5,115,000, with an untitled painting by Twombly
fetching $990,000, the highest bid for a Warhol-owned work.
   Pollack's ``Search,'' a canvas in tones of green, red, yellow,
black and white, was bought for $4.84 million by an anonyous
Japanese dealer, Ms. Mitchell-Innes said. The work, which displays
the artist's drip technique as well as paint applied with a brush
and spattered, had a pre-sale estimate of $3 million to $4 million.
   The previous record for a work of contemporary art sold at
auction was the $3.63 million for Jasper John's ``Out the Window''
in November 1986 and the same amount for Willem de Kooning's ``Pink
Lady'' in May 1987. Both paintings were sold at Sotheby's.
   The second highest bid at Monday night's auction was the $1.87
million an American dealer paid for Kline's ``Ninth Street,'' a
black and white abstraction, Sotheby's said. Its pre-sale estimate
was $700,000 to $900,000.

<HEAD>Setback Raises Doubt About Creating `Super-OPEC'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The stalemate that doomed OPEC's latest
meeting also dimmed prospects for creating a new global alliance of
oil producers.
   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries says
it will press ahead with efforts to establish closer ties with
other oil producers. But the going is likely to be slow.
   OPEC wants to persuade as many independent producers as possible
to join the cartel in restraining production as a means of getting
prices up to OPEC's official target of $18 a barrel.
   Hisham Nazer, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, said on Monday
in Vienna there was ``unanimous recognition in OPEC'' that OPEC
alone cannot keep supplies low enough to prevent prices from
lagging.
   Last week a group of six independent producers, led by Mexico,
met with a committee of six OPEC oil ministers and presented an
offer: we'll cut our oil exports by 5 percent if you do likewise.
   The two groups issued a joint communique declaring ``the
beginning of a new stage of cooperation'' among some of the biggest
oil-producing countries in the world. But that's as far as it went.
   The non-OPEC officials left town and all 13 of the OPEC
ministers spent four days debating the offer, only to suspend the
talks after falling into a bitter impasse.
   Cartel leaders said they were not explicitly rejecting the
non-OPEC offer, they just wanted more time to think it over.
   The offer, by Mexico, Egypt, China, Oman, Malaysia and Oman, was
for two months of production cuts only, starting May 1.
   Now that the starting date has passed and the OPEC leaders have
gone home, there is little chance the two groups will get back to
considering joint production cuts before next year. That's because
oil demand is expected to rise in the second half of this year,
eliminating the incentive on both sides to grapple with the problem
of sharing any cutbacks.
   This is likely to be welcomed in Washington. Energy Secretary
John Herrington has publicly campaigned against what he called
efforts to create a ``world OPEC.''
   Even so, OPEC says it will try to keep alive a dialogue with
non-OPEC exporters, including the Soviet Union, which ranks as the
world's largest oil producer. The United States is the No. 2
producer.
   ``It is important that we keep talking to them,'' Rilwanu
Lukman, the OPEC president, said of the six independent exporters
who met in Vienna. ``The opportunity given to us is one that we
cannot take lightly.''
   The reasons are obvious. OPEC's capacity for influencing oil
prices has been gradually eroded by the emergence of new oil
producers in all corners of the globe.
   Ironically, it was the sudden and severe increases in OPEC oil
prices in the 1970s that created the financial incentive for
countries to step up the search for oil. In recent years Norway,
China, Angola, Colombia and many other nations have joined the
ranks of oil exporters.
   As production outside its control steadily rose, OPEC
reluctantly chose to cut its output in a vain attempt to prevent
prices from falling.
   Today the cartel pumps about 17.5 million barrels a day,
compared with a peak in 1978 of 31 million barrels daily. In that
same period, non-OPEC output has jumped from about 22 million
barrels daily to more than 28 million.
   This year alone, non-OPEC oil output is expected to rise by
800,000 barrels a day. OPEC's probably will not grow at all.
   All oil exporters naturally want to get as much for their
product as possible. But they seem to have little prospect for
overcoming the political and economic differences that make formal
cooperation with OPEC hard to achieve.
   ``There just isn't a community of interest between them,'' said
Paul McDonald, a London-based oil consultant. ``You're either a
member of OPEC or not; nobody's knocking down the door to join
OPEC.''

<HEAD>Women's Representatives Differ On Robins Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates for women who used the Dalkon Shield
are divided on the merits of a reorganization plan involving the
manufacturer of the defective contraceptive devices and
establishing a trust fund for victims.
   One representative of the victims, Atlanta-based attorney Guerry
R. Thornton Jr., said the plan offers the best deal yet for the
more than 196,000 women harmed by the intrauterine device.
   But Karen Hicks, founder of the Dalkon Shield Information
Network, told a news conference Monday: ``After an agonizing
decision-making and education process, we have found that the plan
is unfair, inadequate and contrary to the law.''
   The $3.2 billion reorganization plan _ the sixth plan developed
since Robins filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1985 _ is part of
the Manhattan-based American Home Products Corp.'s agreement to
take over the beleaguered company. The $3.2 billion plan includes
$2.3 billion to be put in a trust fund for the victims.

   President Reagan has added his signature to a
Senate resolution urging the United States to refrain from
participating in June ceremonies marking the millennium of
Christianity in the Soviet Union if religious persecution there
persists.
   The resolution, signed by the president on Monday, deplores
persecution by the Soviet government of religious believers in the
Ukraine. The document also expresses congressional concern for
Ukrainian religious believers who are persecuted for attempting to
worship.
   The June ceremonies will mark the founding of Christianity in
Kievan Rus', an area now within the Ukraine, 1,000 years ago.

<HEAD>Bone Marrow Cells A Site For AIDS Virus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A government scientist says researchers have
found that the bone marrow can become a quiet haven for the deadly
AIDS virus, adding to the types of cells in the body known to be
attacked by the virus.
   Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, said Monday that the bone marrow, which is
the body's blood-making organ, ``can be a reservoir'' for the virus.
   ``It (the AIDS virus) can reside in the marrow, but not be
detected in the peripheral blood,'' he said.
   The finding demonstrates just how challenging it will be to
develop an antiviral drug or vaccine to defeat the AIDS virus, said
Fauci. In order to effect a cure, some way will have to be found to
seek out and destroy the virus wherever it hides.

<HEAD>World Bank Lowers Status of Its Loans to Panama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The World Bank has placed its loans to Panama
on ``non-accrual status,'' making the accounting change because the
country has paid nothing for six months on the $502 million it owes.
   The change in status, announced Monday, means the bank no longer
includes on its own statements the interest and other charges due
from Panama until money is actually received.
   ``Placing loans in a non-accrual status is an accounting action
which does not reduce in any way the country's obligation to the
bank or the bank's ability to assist the country in formulating
policies to help redress its economic difficulties,'' the
announcement said.
   The bank, owned by 151 countries, is the biggest single source
of aid money for the Third World. The United States is the largest
shareholder.

   The state Assembly approved legislation
Monday to restore the death penalty in New York state and sent it

   It was the 12th straight year the Legislature approved a death
penalty bill. Six times from 1977-82 the measures were vetoed by
former Gov. Hugh Carey and five times since then by fellow Democrat
Cuomo.
   As in years past, the Democratic-controlled Assembly failed
Monday to come up with the 100 votes needed in the 150-member house
to override Cuomo's impending veto. The vote Monday was 92-53.
   The Assembly's chief death penalty advocate, Democrat Vincent

to that needed 100 votes. We're only some five or six votes short.

   After three weeks in the nation's movie
theaters, the gang film ``Colors'' has moved past ``Beetlejuice''
as the No. 1 box office attraction.
   ``Colors,'' with Sean Penn as a cocky rookie cop teamed with the
savvy veteran Robert Duvall, nearly tripled its coverage last
weekend _ from 480 screens to 1,372 _ and took in $6.5 million in
its third week of release while the comedy ``Beetlejuice'' dropped
to second with a $5 million take.
   After the top two finishers, box office receipts plummeted.
   The teen-oriented film ``Casual Sex?'' was third with $2.4
million and the violent ``Above the Law,'' featuring a Chicago
cop's drug-ring battle, was fourth with $2.3 million.
   Fifth was ``Biloxi Blues,'' starring Matthew Broderick as an
Army boot camp private, with $2.1 million in its sixth week of
release.
   In sixth was the new James Garner-Bruce Willis film ``Sunset,''
which earned $2 million in its debut weekend. ``Bloodsport'' was
seventh at $1.9 million.
   ``Critters II: The Main Course'' made its debut as No. 8.
   ``The Last Emperior,'' the Bernardo Bertolucci epic that won
nine Academy Awards, was ninth with $1.7 million and
``Moonstruck,'' was 10th with $1.5 million.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release, and estimated production costs when available.

   Sir Greville Spratt, lord mayor of London, led the fancy
flotilla of floats up the river on Monday as part of a charity

   The waterborne procession was based on a Thames pageant devised

   Mayor Eugene Sawyer on Monday accepted a written
apology to the public from an aide whose religious slurs prompted
aldermen and others to demand his dismissal. But Sawyer said the
apology might not be sufficient.
   ``I humbly apologize to Chicago residents of all races and
religious groups who were offended by remarks made prior to my
ascension to the mayor's office,'' said a letter signed by Steve
Cokely, a $35,000-a-year mayoral aide.
   ``I have, since working in the mayor's office, respected all
those I have had the privilege to serve,'' added the apology,
distributed by the mayor's office.
   ``No one has accused me of abusing the privilege of working for
Mayor Sawyer. Mayor Sawyer has discussed with me, in a firm and
gentlemanly manner, what he expects from all employees of the
mayor's office.''
   Later Monday at a gathering of Jewish business leaders, Sawyer
said: ``This afternoon, a young man issued an apology that might
not be sufficient ... We will not tolerate an individual with views
of this type.
   ``We are reviewing the situation, and we will have something to
say about it in the very near future,'' Sawyer added.
   Alderman Bernard L. Stone called Monday for the immediate ouster
of the 35-year-old aide. Alderman Edwin Eisendrath said the City
Council would take up the matter next week if the mayor fails to
act.
   Cokely, who serves as a liaison to black nationalist groups,
said in four tape-recorded lectures before the Chicago-based Nation
of Islam between August 1985 and November 1987 that Jewish doctors
were guilty of injecting blacks with the AIDS virus and that a
Christian crucifix is a symbol of white supremacy, according to
published reports over the weekend.

Cholesterol</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have developed eggs that don't
raise human cholesterol levels like regular eggs, and are trying to
prevent heart disease by identifying food chemicals that reduce
blood cholesterol.
   Both efforts at making diets healthier were outlined Monday at
the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for
Experimental Biology.
   Suk Y. Oh, an associate professor of nutrition, and colleagues
at the University of Utah added fish oil to chicken feed. Hens that
ate the oil-enriched feed for eight weeks laid eggs that reduced
blood pressure and blood fats in a group of 12 people and, unlike
regular eggs, didn't raise cholesterol levels.
   The eggs taste and smell like fish, but Oh said that can
probably be avoided by feeding hens deodorized fish oil.
   If Oh's preliminary findings are confirmed in a larger study,
``consumption of such eggs will not increase the risk of developing
coronary heart disease'' no matter how many are consumed, he said.
   Oh said fish oil-enriched eggs could join existing
low-cholesterol egg substitutes in markets by summer 1989, but
because of the price of fish oil, the eggs would probably cost
about 40 percent more than regular eggs.
   The American Heart Association recommends people eat no more
than 300 milligrams of cholesterol daily because high levels of the
fat-like substance in blood are linked to increased risk of
hardening of the arteries, heart attacks and strokes. A regular egg
averages 274 milligrams of cholesterol.
   In the other study, nutritional sciences professor Charles Elson
and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin found that daily
consumption of 140-milligram capsules of lemongrass oil, a spice
common in Thai food, reduced blood cholesterol more than 10 percent
in more than one-third of a small group of people with unhealthy
high levels.
   Elson now is testing other foods containing chemicals called
isoprenoids to learn if they also can inhibit the body's formation
of cholesterol from simpler fats.
   ``We're looking in beer, wine, citrus peel and oats,'' he said.
``We've found a compound in barley. Any green plant has similar
compounds, and some also are in milk. If we're correct, we could
create a diet composed of a variety of foods containing factors
that work together to control cholesterol.''
   For now, people should eat a wide variety of vegetables and
fruits to ``have ready access to compounds that will help block or
reduce cholesterol synthesis'' in the body, Elson said.
   Oh and his colleagues fed hens fish oil-enriched chicken feed
because the oil contains omega-3 fatty acids. Previous studies
suggest people who consume cold-water fish, which contain omega-3
fatty acids, enjoy a lower risk of heart attack and stroke.
   In Oh's study, 12 healthy people with normal blood levels of
cholesterol and triglycerides _ fatty substances that also
contribute to heart disease _ were divided into two groups. Each
person ate four eggs daily for eight weeks.
   The first group ate fish oil-enriched eggs for the first four
weeks, which significantly reduced their blood pressure and kept
blood cholesterol virtually unchanged. When they switched to
regular eggs for the last four weeks, their cholesterol levels
increased 5 percent to 10 percent, their blood pressure rose to
normal and their triglyceride levels rose significantly.
   The second group started on regular eggs, which boosted their
blood cholesterol significantly. When they switched to fishy eggs,
their cholesterol levels dropped to normal and their blood pressure
and triglyceride levels fell significantly.

   An Iranian attack on a United Arab

destroyed two Iranian oil platforms in the gulf in retaliation for
Iran's alleged sowing of a mine that damaged a U.S. warship the
previous week.
   Gulf-based shipping executives were puzzled by the attack
because Iran receives half the net revenues from the oil field.

<HEAD>Candidates for Governor Chosen in Indiana, NC; Ohio Senate Race
Takes Shape</HEAD>

   Democratic voters choose nominees for governor in Indiana and
North Carolina today, and in Ohio they are expected to nominate
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum for a third term, pitting him against
Cleveland's Republican Mayor George Voinovich in November.
   Presidential primaries are being held in Ohio and Indiana, and
in Washington, D.C.
   North Carolina did its presidential primary voting as part of
the Super Tuesday on March 8.
   With Indiana's GOP Gov. Robert Orr forced by law to retire after
two terms, the governor's race is viewed by Democrats as a golden
opportunity to recapture an office they have not held in 20 years.
   Secretary of State Evan Bayh, 32-year-old son of former Sen.
Birch Bayh, is the leading contender, opposed only by former Kokomo
Mayor Stephen J. Daily. Senate Minority Leader Frank L. O'Bannon's
name was put on the Democratic ballot by Bayh's campaign when it
appeared Bayh might be held in violation of the state's five-year
residency requirement. But the state Supreme Court ruled last week
that Bayh could run.
   Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz, who is the only Republican candidate, has
pointed to his own experience as a 20-year veteran of the General
Assembly and executive branch and tried to make an issue of Bayh's
age.
   ``We're not talking about electing somebody class president
here,'' said Mutz, 52.
   ``Age is not relevant,'' countered Bayh. ``It's ability. It's
ideas. It's where you hope to lead Indiana.''
   Indiana also has a Senate race this year, with Republican Sen.
Richard G. Lugar unopposed for nomination to a third term. The lone
Democratic contender is Indianapolis attorney Jack Wickes, formerly
with Gary Hart's campaign staff.
   In North Carolina, Gov. Jim Martin is unopposed for renomination
as he tries to become the first Republican in the state to serve
consecutive terms as governor this century.
   Leading a field of five Democrats is Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan, who
has portrayed Martin as doing little of substance and trying to
take credit for Democrats' accomplishments.
   ``North Carolina doesn't need a governor who is content to be a
passenger or a back-seat driver,'' Jordan said in January after
driving an 18-wheel truck from his family lumberyard in Mount
Gilead to Raleigh to dramatize his ``hands-on'' management style.
   Opposing Jordan are Billy Martin, a service-station employee not
related to the governor; Bruce Friedman, an anti-nuclear activist
from Sylva; Carroll W. Crawford of Mount Ulla, who said he quit the
Ku Klux Klan in 1987 but remains sympathetic to some of its causes;
and James T. Lloyd of Salisbury.
   In Ohio's Senate race, the popular Voinovich is unopposed on the
GOP side, while Metzenbaum is heavily favored over Ralph Applegate,
a political newcomer from Columbus who has hardly been heard from
since filing in February.
   The fall campaign promises to be a high-spending one, with
Federal Election Commission reports showing that Metzenbaum had
raised $4.4 million as of March 31. That's the third-highest amount
of any incumbent senator seeking re-election this year.
   Voinovich, who raised $2.9 million by the same date, had
initially criticized his rival for collecting money out of state.
But he recently announced his own fund-raising drive in major
cities around the country.
   Ohio also two congressional races of note. GOP Rep. Delbert
Latta is retiring in rural Northwest Ohio, and the Republican
candidates include his attorney son, Robert, State Senate President
Paul Gillmor, of Port Clinton, and Rex Damschroder, of Fremont.
   And in Cleveland, Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, who seeks her sixth
term, is pitted in a Democratic primary against Dennis Kucinich,
the former Cleveland mayor who has attracted large numbers of
blue-collar votes in the past.

   The city's finest probably won't win any fashion
contests with a new uniform they're testing, but at least they
won't have to shine their shoes, crease their pants or polish their
gunbelt buckles.
   ``It's quite different, but it doesn't look that different,''
Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said Monday as two
nervous-looking police officers modeled the new threads.
   The new uniform will be worn by 135 officers citywide for the
next year. If it passes final inspection, the duty jacket,
raincoat, shirt, trousers, gunbelt and shoes will become mandatory
for the city's 27,000 police officers.
   The changes reflect New York's busy lifestyle that calls for
minimal upkeep, and includes machine washable shirts; pants with a
permanent crease; shoes that don't need to be shined and a gunbelt
with a non-tarnish buckle.
   The new jacket, a lightweight poly-wool blend, has four
gold-plated buttons to give it the appearance of a dress coat, but
is actually closed by a concealed plastic zipper with a Velcro
closure.
   ``You don't lose the buttons, and yet you have the traditional
appearance of the buttons,'' Ward said approvingly.
   The most visible change is the placement of the Police
Department patch on both sleeves of the duty jacket, raincoat and
shirts. Currently officers wear the patch only on their right
shoulders.
   ``On the old uniform, if you happened to be facing the wrong
way, you wouldn't know whether this was a police officer or a
private security guard in a dark suit,'' Ward said.
   As usual, convenience doesn't come cheap. The new uniform costs
$476, versus the $350 for the current uniform.
   ``This is a great improvement over what I wore,'' Ward said,
recalling that his leather uniform coat ``was heavy and it wasn't
warm.''

   Technique doesn't count for much when
throwing fish, but kissing may help, says the winner of the fourth
annual Interstate Mullet Toss.
   Steve King of Pensacola, Fla., won the men's division Sunday by
tossing a mullet 111 feet, 7 inches across the state line from
Florida to Alabama.
   ``We bought a couple of mullet last week,'' King said. ``We
tried to make them spiral and be aerodynamic, but it didn't work.
You just gotta grab it and throw it.''
   A day earlier in the preliminaries, King got off a toss of 171
feet, 6 inches, about 30 feet farther than the record set in 1986.
But it won't go into the record books because only final round
throws qualify.
   ``I know what happened,'' King said after his shorter toss into
a strong head wind. ``I didn't kiss (the mullet) today. Yesterday,
I kissed him. That helps.''
   Vickie Andrews of Thomasville won the women's competition with a
toss of 72 feet, 1 inch.
   ``I throw one every day,'' Ms. Andrews said. ``The first thing I
do when I get up is throw a mullet.''
   About 200 people attended the competition as part of the Greater
Gulf Coast Beach Party.
   Mullet are about 8 to 10 inches long and popular for fish fries
along the Florida Panhandle and Alabama coast. Appropriately
enough, mullet are related to flying fish.

   Former World War II servicemen
in the town of Midsomer Norton have demanded the removal of a

a television program.
   The veterans in the southwest English town said on Monday they

opposite the headquarters of their Royal British Legion chapter.
   The poster shows the Nazi leader holding a glove puppet of
former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, whose policy of
appeasement led to the 1938 Munich Pact, which allowed Germany to
annex part of Czechoslovakia.
   The poster was one of many put up by Thames Television to

<HEAD>Arthritis Gene Identified In Mice; Early Step Toward Human Cure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers seeking to cure crippling
diseases like arthritis and multiple sclerosis in humans say
they've taken an early, important step by isolating the gene that
causes a form of arthritis in mice.
   ``We are on the way to finding the cure for this type of
arthritis in mice,'' Tariq M. Haqqi, a molecular biologist at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said Monday.
   If the same kinds of arthritis-causing genes _ or inherited
blueprints _ can be identified in humans, ``we are one step closer
to the cure and prevention of human rheumatoid arthritis and other
human auto-immune diseases'' in which the body apparently is
attacked by its own disease-fighting immune system, Haqqi said.
   Discovery of the gene Vb6 that causes mouse arthritis was
outlined by Haqqi during the annual meeting of the Federation of
American Societies for Experimental Biology, which drew 22,000
scientists and exhibitors.
   The discovery is ``very exciting'' because it is the first time
scientists have isolated a gene that causes arthritis, said Dr. C.
Garrison Fathman, an immunologist-rheumatologist at Stanford
University.
   But he said it still will take scientists years to find a cure
for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 7 million Americans, or
any of the other 100 forms of arthritis and related diseases such
as lupus, multiple sclerosis and juvenile or insulin-dependent
diabetes.
   Fathman recently used what are called monoclonal antibodies,
proteins made in the laboratory to target specific types of cells,
to attack T cells _ a type of white blood cell in the immune system
_ that cause diabetes in mice. The mice were cured, he reported
Friday in the journal Science.
   Haqqi is now trying to cure mice of arthritis by using other
tailor-made monoclonal antibodies to attack the T cells responsible
for that disease without harming other white blood cells, which are
needed to defend the body against infection.
   T cells normally help fight infection by recognizing an invading
germ or foreign substance and then triggering production of
antibodies to combat them. But bacterial and viral infections also
can trigger auto-immune diseases.
   Haqqi and his colleagues identified and isolated the gene that
codes for production of a certain receptor on the surface of T
cells in mice.
   Haqqi said this receptor causes the T cells to lose their
ability to distinguish foreign collagen, or connective tissue, from
the collagen naturally found in cartilage, tendon and skin.
   So the T cells attack collagen in cartilage in the mice's
joints, causing the inflammation, swelling and pain known as
arthritis.
   Scientists from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at
Washington University in St. Louis and from the University of
Tennessee in Memphis also worked on the study, in which mice
developed arthritis when injected with collagen from cows. The
disease is similar to crippling rheumatoid arthritis in humans.
   If researchers can identify the genes for human T cell receptors
that go awry to cause human arthritis and other auto-immune
diseases, ``then we can cure the disease'' and prevent it by
producing monoclonal antibodies to attack the culprit T cells while
leaving other white blood cells unharmed, Haqqi said.
   But, he cautioned, ``the antibody that works in mice may not
work in humans, so we'll have to find the antibody that works in
humans.''
   Fathman agreed, saying different monoclonal antibodies would be
needed not only for every form of arthritis and auto-immune
disease, but possibly for each individual human.

<TEXT>
   A South Korean pharmaceutical company
was given permission today to begin mass producing and exporting an
anti-AIDS drug at cut-rate prices, officials said.
   The Health and Social Affairs Ministry said Samchully
Pharmaceutical Co. received a permit to manufacture and export
Azidothymidine (AZT).
   But domestic sales of the drug will not be allowed until
clinical tests are completed, the ministry said.
   The drug, first developed in Britain as an anti-cancer drug, can
lengthen the lives of patients suffering from acquired immune
deficiency syndrome by restraining development of the virus that
causes the disease.
   Export plans call for producing the drug at about half the
international price of $155 for 100 milligrams, officials said.
Exports to the United States and Western Europe are expected to
begin as early as next month, they said.
   Plans call for exporting about $10 million worth of AZT annually.

<TEXT>
   The president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
Fund said today that scratches found in the memorial, one
resembling a swastika, appear to be random vandalism and not the
work of someone trying to make a political statement.
   ``It looks like the random defacement that happens to memorials
in Washington from time to time,'' said Jan Scruggs. ``The memorial
has had about 24 million visitors and only one bad egg.''
   The vandalism is the first since the memorial opened in 1982,
National Park Service officials said Monday. The 493-foot granite
wall inscribed with 58,156 names of those killed in the Southeast
Asian conflict has become the most visited monument in the nation's
capital.
   ``The wall itself has such great respect that we have never had
problems with damage,'' said Bill Ruback, superintendent of
national parks in downtown Washington. ``It had to be someone crazy
to do this.''
   Ruback said he believed the marks were an act of vandalism.
``Someone stood here and did this on purpose,'' he said, noting
that hard objects such as cameras and women's purses often strike
the wall without causing any damage.
   The scratches, about eight inches long, were discovered on a
center panel and on a panel near the east end of the memorial early
last month.
   ``We worried about vandalism from the time we began to talk
about a memorial,'' said Scruggs, head of the organization that
raised money to build the memorial.
   Scruggs said he has contacted a specialist in polished surfaces
to come to inspect the scratches, which he said are not deep. Any
necessary repairs will be the responsibility of both the fund and
the federal government, said Scruggs.
   Scruggs said he will also offer a $1,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever committed the
vandalism.

<TEXT>
   A proposed bypass road in eastern England has
caused a battle between conservationists who want to save the
habitat of a rare moth and people who want heavy traffic diverted
from their village.
   Six hundred residents from the village of Dersingham marched 1{
miles on Monday to Queen Elizabeth II's Sandringham estate in
Norfolk to demand that work begin on the bypass, which they first
called for 25 years ago.
   After pressure from conservationists, environment secretary
Nicholas Ridley said he would consider revoking planning permission
for the bypass, which would cut through a bog on the royal estate
that is home to the moth.
   A group called the Nature Conservancy Council said the road
could wipe out the moth, Choristoneura Lafauryana, by destroying
the bog where it breeds.
   But the demonstrators doubt there are any moths left.
   ``A big survey by the Nature Conservancy Council led to nothing
_ they couldn't even find the damn moth,'' said one marcher, James
Crowe.

<HEAD>Engineer Says Uncertain If Civil War Ship Monitor Should Be
Salvaged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL L. GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An engineer studying the sunken Civil War ship
USS Monitor says it could cost $20 million to raise the ironclad
vessel from its 125-year-old grave off North Carolina.
   But James Jenkins, a corrosion and metallurgical engineer with
the Navy Civil Engineering Laboratory in Port Hueneme, Calif., also
said that federal officials are uncertain whether to raise the ship.
   ``Personally, I'd like to make sure anything done there is done
carefully so we don't waste the 120 years that it's been down
there,'' Jenkins said Monday at the Offshore Technology Conference
here. ``We really don't know today what could or should be done.''
   Already, $3 million has been spent on research, and estimates of
costs to raise the ship range from $10 million to $20 million, he
said.
   ``There are major structural components, like the armored deck,
the turret, the guns, the engine and the boilers, that appear to be
relatively intact and probably could be retrieved,'' he said.
   On New Year's Eve 1862, the USS Monitor sank in a storm off Cape
Hatteras.
   Nine months earlier, on March 9, 1862, it battled the
Confederate vessel Merrimack to a draw in the first combat between
two ironclad ships. Neither ship was able to inflict serious damage
on the other in the battle, which occurred at Hampton Roads off
Virginia.
   The Merrimack, renamed the Virginia by the Confederates, was
scuttled two months later when Southern forces abandoned the
Norfolk navy yard. The Merrimack was discovered in 1910, its
armored plates retrieved and sold as souvenirs, Jenkins said.
   ``We don't want that to happen to the Monitor, to have pieces of
it on the end of keychains,'' he said. ``We don't want people going
in and we don't want souvenir hunters, a la the Titanic.''
   The Monitor suffered extensive damage while being depth-charged
during World War II when it mistakenly was believed to be a German
submarine. It was not until 1973 that Duke University researchers
said they believed the wreck was the Monitor. Photographs made two
years later confirmed that.
   Last year, Jenkins coordinated a corrosion survey of the
Monitor, using Norwegian-made electronic probes attached to
remote-controlled underwater gear. The probes normally are used to
test the corrosion of offshore drilling rigs and the investigation
of the Monitor marked one of the first times oilfield technology
was applied to marine archeology, he said.
   The Monitor is in about 230 feet of water, upside down, with its
two-gun turret _ made of foot-thick wrought iron and weighing 120
tons _ supporting about 90 feet of the deck above the sea floor.
   Although corrosion has set in, Jenkins said, it's important to
note that less than one-half inch of material has been lost.
   ``Corrosion rates tend to drop over long periods of time,'' he
said.
   As an engineer, Jenkins said the wreck is significant because it
provides corrosion data over 120 years.
   The wreck in 1975 was designated the first National Marine
Sanctuary.
   Jenkins said technology exists to preserve what it left of the
ship or the debris around the vessel could be retrieved or
officials can take no action at all.
   ``We have a lot more plans than money,'' he said. ``Its value is
as a fingerprint of society and a fingerprint of shipbuilding in
the 1860s.''

   The rights to 87 books by the queen of suspense,
Agatha Christie, have been purchased by the Putnam Berkley Group as
part of a package sold by the ailing publishing house Dodd Mead &
Co.
   The price of the purchase, which also included 156 works by
Western writer Max Brand, was not released. But The New York Times
reported today that it was thought to be about $4 million.
   Dodd Mead, a 149-year-old firm, sold the rights in an effort to
retire its debt and survive as an independent publisher. The
purchase also included several titles on sailing and Dodd Mead's
entire juvenile list, which was 44 of its 154 titles last year.
   Jerome H. Grossman, chairman of Dodd Mead, said problems during
the past two years included paying advances that were not justified
by sales, printing more books than necessary and signing up too
many books in light of the firm's debt.
   The company's major assets were the rights to the Brand and
Christie books. It acquired the rights to the Christie books
starting in 1921 and Brand in 1927. Brand was a pen name for
Frederick Schiller Faust, who was killed on the Italian front while
covering World War II for Harper's magazine. Ms. Christie died in
1976.

<HEAD>Reports Of U.S. Deal With Noriega Alarm Opposition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition party leaders said they
were alarmed by reports of a U.S. deal that would force Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega to resign as head of the military but allow him to
remain in Panama.
   In another development, an official of the bilateral commission
that runs the Panama Canal said the waterway continues to do a
thriving business despite the nation's protracted economic and
political crisis.
   The opposition leaders discussed the reported deal Monday at
what they called their first meeting since Panama's crisis began
nearly a year ago.
   ``We met to discuss jointly the grave situation of our country
and what we may do together to find a democratic solution for our
country,'' said Ricardo Arias Calderon, who held the two-hour
meeting at his home.
   The opposition wants Noriega, the power behind the civilian
government, to resign as commander of the 15,000-member Defense
Forces and leave the country.
   The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Panama
designed to oust Noriega and has called for him to leave Panama.
Some U.S. political leaders say it would be a mistake if the United
States backed off that stance.
   The sanctions, which have caused an economic crisis in Panama,
were imposed after Noriega was indicted in February on U.S. drug
trafficking charges.
   Following Monday's meeting some of the opposition leaders said
they were alarmed by reports of a deal that would allow Noriega to
remain in Panama.
   The leaders discussed ``everything that has to do with the
serious crisis,'' including the reported arrangement between
Washington and Noriega, said one source at the meeting, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   U.S. officials in Washington have said Noriega agreed to step
down as commander of the Defense Forces but refused to leave
Panama. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker said on Sunday that U.S.
talks with Noriega continued during the weekend and that ``progress
is being made.'' Noriega denied on Saturday he had reached any
agreement with the United States.
   Sources in the opposition say their leaders are afraid the
United States is bypassing them and ignoring promises to them. They
say if Noriega quits but remains in Panama he will continue to
wield power through the Defense Forces. ``He would continue to be a
focus of controversy,'' Arias Calderon said Monday.
   The Christian Democrats, the second largest opposition party,
called Monday's meeting. Also attending were representatives of the
Authentic Panamanian Party, the Republican Party of ousted
President Eric Arturo Delvalle, the Liberal Republican Nationalist
Movement and factions of the Liberal and Labor parties. The
Authentic Panamanian Party is the largest opposition party followed
by the Christian Democrats.
   Delvalle was deposed Feb. 26, the day after he tried to fire
Noriega.
   Such concerns have not reduced traffic in the Panama Canal.
   ``Business is almost embarrassingly high,'' said Richard A.
Wainio, chief of economic research and market development for the
Panama Canal Commission. He said on Monday that the canal is
running smoothly because neither the United States nor Panama
``wants to jeopardize operation of the canal.''
   Five Americans and five Panamanians make up the commission,
established under 1977 treaties that will turn the canal ove to
Panama at the end of 1999.
   During the first five months of fiscal 1988, toll revenues came
to $143.6 million, $4.6 million higher than anticipated.
   Wainio said he expects income to match expenses the rest of the
year.

   Oliver North used his first speech as a
civilian to blast his critics, while the Rev. Jerry Falwell
compared North's criminal indictment to the persecution and
crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
   North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel who is accused of
illegally diverting money from Iranian arms deals to the Nicaraguan
Contras, delivered the commencement address Monday at Falwell's
Liberty University.
   ``He's already been convicted in much of the national media,''
Falwell told a cheering crowd of about 12,000. ``He's already
guilty. The first question's always asked: Why are you having an
indicted man to speak to the students of Liberty University? I
said, `Well, we serve a savior who was indicted and convicted and
crucified.'''
   North told the crowd that he had asked his daughter to forgive
his accusers, and said he never intended to get caught in a
political war between President Reagan and Congress.
   ``From certain commentaries in the media, it is clear that some
believe once a man is accused, he's branded forever,'' North said.
   ``Well, I've been accused of helping the brave young men and
women of the Nicaraguan resistance in their struggle for the very
liberties we claim as birthright.
   ``I've been accused of trying to rescue American hostages, held
captive, and trying to prevent other terrorist attacks. Those
accusations are not a brand. They are a badge of honor.''
   The crowd chanted ``Ollie, Ollie,'' as North, wearing a black
and purple academic robe, marched to the stage placed in front of a
huge American flag in Liberty's baseball park. He was given an
honorary doctorate in the humanities.
   Conservatives seeking to draft North for Virginia's U.S. Senate
seat being vacated by Republican Paul Trible listened for clues
that North might like the idea. They thought they had one when
North said, ``We need a better Congress.''
   ``That was a signal for all of us in the commonwealth of
Virginia to go at it,'' said Jamey R. Wheeler, head of a committee
seeking to draft North for the Senate.
   North, whose retirement from the Marine Corps became effective
this week, told the students they should be grateful for the
opportunities they have as American citizens.
   ``As you leave Liberty University, you can be anything you want
to be,'' North said. ``As your counterparts are graduated from the
University of Moscow, they can be anything the state wants them to
be.''
   While North addressed the audience, peace activists staged an
anti-North demonstration in downtown Lynchburg.
   Also, members of People for the American Way came to Liberty to
hand out a statement saying they opposed Falwell's effort to get
North pardoned.
   Falwell said Monday he has collected 600,000 of the 2 million
signatures he wants for a petition calling on Reagan to pardon
North.
   ``The issue isn't whether Ollie North is innocent or guilty;
it's whether the president and his staff are above the law,'' said
the group's president, Arthur J. Kropp.

<HEAD>Judge: Prince's `U Got The Look' Doesn't Look Like Half Sister's
Song</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has dismissed a lawsuit against rock
star Prince by his half sister who alleged he used her lyrics in
violation of copyright laws.
   The song by Lorna Nelson, ``What's Cooking in This Book,'' was
not substantially similar to Prince's song, ``U Got the Look,''
said U.S. District Judge David Doty.
   ``I don't believe it,'' Nelson said about the judge's order,
which was filed Thursday. ``We (Nelson and her lawyer) never did
think the judge understood it. We're going to appeal.''
   The lawsuit, filed in August, also sought an accounting from
their father, John L. Nelson, for money he received from Prince for
use of lyrics he allegedly wrote with Ms. Nelson.
   Doty said that claim falls under state, not federal, law.
   The two songs are not identical, but Ms. Nelson's suit said
recurring expressions in her song ``take another look'' and
``cooking in this book'' were used in Prince's song, which was
recorded with singer Sheena Easton.
   The lawsuit claimed that Duane Nelson, Lorna's brother and
Prince's half-brother, had inspected lyrics she had written, and
delivered the lyrics to Prince and his company, PRN Productions
Inc., in the Minneapolis suburb of Chanhassen where Prince lives.
   Doty's order said the defendants conceded a proper copyright and
access to the lyrics.

   An American high school marching band today
became the first foreign musical group to perform on Tiananmen
Square, the vast plaza in central Beijing that is one of China's
most important sites.
   The Pennsbury High School Marching Band of Fairless Hills,
Penn., gave a brief concert before hundreds of Chinese and foreign
sightseers in the square, which is ringed by the Forbidden City,
Mao Tse-tung's Mausoleum, and the Great Hall of the People, the
seat of China's government.
   Five members of the honor guard laid a wreath at the foot of the
Martyrs' Shrine in the center of the square before the band played.
The monument honors those who died fighting Japanese invaders and
Nationalist troops in the 1940s.
   The 170-member band stood in formation at the base of the
monument and played the American and Chinese national anthems and
the song ``Brotherhood'' but did not march. One band organizer said
they were not allowed to march because the square is sacred ground.
   Several hundred Chinese sightseers watched the performance, but
most were more interested in taking each other's pictures or lining
up to see Mao's mausoleum, which is behind the monument.
   The audience listened impassively to the three songs and did not
clap.
   Asked afterward why there was no applause, one elderly peasant
from Henan province said, ``We can't understand the music. How can
we clap?''
   Lisa Brumbaugh, who holds the school banner at the head of the
band, said they were told Chinese audiences are not used to
applauding. ``So I wasn't expecting it,'' she added.
   The group, the second American high school band to play in
China, toured the ancient capital of Xian and performed on the city
wall on Friday before coming to Beijing on Saturday.
   Sunday morning, they played at the Great Wall, where thousands
of Chinese turned out to celebrate May Day.
   The band is to perform for the last time tonight at Beijing's
Capital Stadium before leaving on Wednesday for Japan.
   ``We practiced for more than a year, and it's been worth it,''
Miss Brumbaugh said. ``China is wonderful. All the people are so
interested in what we're doing.''
   ``They all make us feel very special,'' said Michela Turpin, who
holds the banner with Miss Brumbaugh.
   The trip, which cost nearly $400,000, was organized by Richard
Hansel, a Fairless Hills businessman who sells processing equipment
in China.
   He said students raised about two-thirds of the money by selling
candy, Christmas ornaments, plants and other items. Thirty-four
chaperones and about 20 others, mostly parents, also are on the
trip.
   The band, which played at the 1986 New Year's Day Rose Bowl
Parade in Pasadena, Calif., came to China at the invitation of the
China International Culture Exchange Center.
   A 100-member band from Live Oaks High School in Morgan Hill,
Calif., which visited last summer, was the first American high
school band to perform in China.

   A premature baby so small she could fit
in her mother's hand when she was born has gone home from the
hospital _ cradled in her mother's arms.
   Elsa Marie Gustafson weighed only 15 ounces and was 10{ inches
long when she was born three months premature on Jan. 11 at Oak
Knoll Naval Hospital. She left the hospital for her home in Vallejo
on Monday, weighing 4-pounds, 10 ounces, and measuring 15 inches.
   ``It is remarkable the way she has caught up in growth,'' said
Cmdr. David R. Field, who delivered Elsa, the smallest surviving
premature baby in the hospital's 46-year history. ``I consider her
a miracle baby.''
   The tiny infant also survived heart and lung surgery.
   ``She was just a slip of a thing in Saran Wrap to keep the
moisture and heat in and I thought `that's my baby,''' said her
mother, Navy Lt. Linda Prince-Gustafson, 39.
   ``The first night was hard,'' she said, ``because every time the
door to my room opened I kept expecting them to tell me that she
had died, but on the contrary, everybody said she was going to be
OK.''
   Elsa's father, Lt. Cmdr. Water A. Gustafson, said their
confidence was boosted after she made it through the first day.
   ``Everything was in the Lord's hands,'' he said.
   Elsa was delivered by Caesarean section after doctors found her
mother had high blood pressure and that her placenta wasn't
functioning properly.
   Doctors first estimated Elsa's survival chances at 10 percent to
15 percent.
   Elsa will remain connected to an oxygen tank for a few more
months.
   Her father said the baby still mostly just eats and sleeps but
there are a few hours a day when she's ``pretty interactive.''
   ``We think she's smiling a lot and surprisingly responsive. We
receive a lot from her and she's a positive influence on our
lives.''

<HEAD>AIDS-Infected Blood Cells Increase Before Disease Develops</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of white blood cells infected
by the AIDS virus rises sharply in the year before virus-infected
males actually develop the disease, says a study that may lead to
speedier treatment for AIDS victims.
   While the existing test to detect the increase in AIDS-infected
cells is too time-consuming and expensive for routine use, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control is trying to develop a simpler test
that could predict when an infected person will get full-blown
AIDS, said the CDC's Janet Nicholson.
   Such a test would help doctors decide when the benefits of
giving patients certain toxic anti-AIDS drugs outweigh the risks,
said Dr. Paul Volberding, associate professor of medicine at the
University of California, San Francisco, and AIDS program director
at San Francisco General Hospital.
   ``If we knew that somebody was getting close to the point of
developing AIDS, we would want to treat the person at that point,
even if he hadn't developed full-blown AIDS,'' he said.
   Nicholson, the CDC's clinical immunology chief, presented her
findings Monday during the annual meeting of the Federation of
American Societies for Experimental Biology.
   She and her colleagues spent three years regularly testing blood
cells from 15 homosexual Atlanta men who were infected by the virus
and had chronic swelling of lymph glands but didn't suffer AIDS.
   Six of the 15 subsequently developed AIDS, Nicholson said.
   She said in the year before those symptoms became apparent, the
six showed a 25-fold increase in the number of AIDS virus-infected
peripheral blood mononuclear cells _ a class of white blood cells.
   If a simple test could show that someone infected with the virus
soon will get AIDS, doctors could better decide when to prescribe
AZT and antibiotics that prevent pneumocystis pneumonia and other
infections that kill AIDS patients once the virus has crippled
their immune systems, Volberding said. AZT, or azidothymidine, is
believed to slow progression of AIDS.
   From a scientific standpoint, ``learning what a person's risk of
developing AIDS is over time is a very important one,'' he said.
   But Nicholson and Volberding acknowledged that some
AIDS-infected people may not want to learn that they soon will
develop disease symptoms.
   Nicholson said researchers previously knew that people infected
with AIDS show reduced numbers of one type of disease-fighting
white blood cell, called T4-helper cells, while the infection
progresses.
   Her study found that the number of helper cells decreases more
quickly and the number of AIDS-infected cells rises sharply in
infected patients who go on to develop overt AIDS symptoms.
   ``It's not clear yet whether everyone who is infected will
develop disease,'' she said, adding that her findings point the way
toward determining which patients are likely to do so.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a
virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to death from infections and cancer.
   The CDC estimates that 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have
been infected with the virus, and of that total, 20 percent to 30
percent will develop AIDS by the end of 1991.

   The cocaine-smuggling trial of reputed
Colombian drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas could go to the jury next
week, after his lawyers shocked the courtroom by resting their case
without calling witnesses.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton scheduled closing arguments
to begin next Monday, and attorneys estimated they could last up to
three days.
   The judge also denied a defense motion Monday to sequester the
jury during closing arguments, which defense attorneys complained
will come during ``Just Say No To Drugs Week.''
   Lehder, 38, is accused of smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine into the
United States from his private island, Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   A federal indictment names Lehder as one of the leaders of
Colombia's Medellin cartel, believed to be responsible for 80
percent of the cocaine smuggled into United States _ a bonanza
worth $8 billion each year.
   Defense attorney Edward R. Shohat stunned the courtroom Monday
when he announced the defense would rest without calling any
witnesses to counter the 115 prosecution witnesses who testified
during a 22-week period. He refused to discuss the move with
reporters.
   ``You could honestly say I looked surprised and stunned,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller said later. The jury did not
show any visible reaction.
   Stephen Weinbaum, an attorney for co-defendant Jack Carlton
Reed, also rested without calling any witnesses.
   That tactic is used by defense attorneys ``to keep the
sufficiency of the government's case at issue,'' Weinbaum said.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy; possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute; importation of cocaine; and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise. Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is
charged with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy.
   If convicted of all 11 counts, Lehder could be sentenced to a
maximum sentence of life plus 165 years. Reed would face a possible
15 year-sentence.
   Lehder also is also charged in separate indictments in Los
Angeles and Miami.

<HEAD>Three More Bodied Recovered From Indian Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers recovered three more bodies
today from the wreckage of a children's hospital annex that
collapsed in northern India, the United News of India said. The
discovery raised the official death toll to 17.
   UNI quoted hospital authorities as saying as many as 32 people,
including 22 children, were still unaccounted for and that the
death toll could rise.
   Arun Joshi, a reporter for the Kashmir Times, said rescuers were
losing hope of finding anyone alive. ``It is a terrible sight up
here,'' he said. ``No one knows how many children have died or are
dying.''
   Rescue workers pulled 30 people alive from the rubble of the
three-story hospital wing on Monday, UNI said. Twenty-three of
them, mostly children, were being treated at a makeshift emergency
center, state-run All India Radio said.
   Civilians, police and army units with cranes today removed
blocks of concrete and brick at the site. R.S. Chib, the state's
health minister, told UNI he expected rescue operations to be
completed tonight.
   The collapse of several wards in the hospital annex was blamed
on structural defects. The Statesman newspaper said four wards
collapsed in the wing of the hospital, which was built four years
ago.
   The newspaper said each ward had 17 beds and some contained more
than one child. In addition to hospital staff, parents and
relatives were attending some of the children when the accident
occurred, the paper said.
   In Jammu, a city of 500,000 more than 300 miles north of New
Delhi, most stores and businesses closed today in sympathy for the
victims and their families. Stores also were reported closed in
neighboring towns.
   Satish Gupta, a Jammu police department spokesman, said the
collapse apparently was caused by a weak foundation under the
hospital wing. The older wing of the hospital was still standing.
   Joshi said cracks had developed over the weekend in the ground
floor walls. He said one doctor told him the cracks widened Sunday
and he evacuated 35 children. The three civil engineers who oversaw
construction of the hospital wing have been suspended, news reports
said. They did not elaborate.

   A string of price records for contemporary
artists, including Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol, fell in
frenzied bidding at Sotheby's that fetched nearly $26 million, the
auction house said.
   ``I've never seen the bidding as heated as it was this
evening,'' Lucy Mitchell-Innes, head of Sotheby's contemporary art
department said after Monday night's sale.
   The highest price bid was the $4.84 million an anonymous
Japanese dealer paid for Pollock's ``The Search,'' believed to be
his last canvas, Ms. Mitchell-Innes said.
   It was a record for a work of contemporary art, as well as a
record for the artist, she said.
   The auction of works put up for sale by various owners as well
as from Warhol's personal collection brought in $25,954,500, a
record for an auction of contemporary art, according to Sotheby's.
Of 74 lots offered, 65 were sold.
   Record prices were set for works by 12 artists, including
Pollock, Warhol, Franz Kline, Cy Twombly, David Hockney, Willem de
Kooning and Richard Diebenkorn. Six paintings sold for more than $1
million, she said.
   ``The contemporary (art) world is now extremely aware of the
rarity of these really important paintings,'' Ms. Mitchell-Innes
said. ``People are very sensitive to the fact that these paintings
won't come up again. People kow this is their last shot.''
   Pollock's ``Search,'' a canvas in tones of green, red, yellow,
black and white, had a presale estimate of $3 million to $4
million. The painting is from the Palm Beach residence of art
collector Belle Linsky.
   The previous record for a work of contemporary art sold at
auction was the $3.63 million Jasper John's ``Out the Window''
brought in 1986 and the same amount for de Kooning's ``Pink Lady''
last May. Both paintings were sold at Sotheby's.
   The second highest bid Monday night was the $1.87 million a U.S.
dealer paid for Kline's ``Ninth Street,'' a black and white
abstract, Sotheby's said. Its presale estimate was $700,000 to
$900,000.
   The previous record for an auction of contemporary art was $18.9
million last May, according to Sotheby's.

<TEXT>
   A former Wedtech Corp. official says the
ex-chairman of the scandal-plagued defense contractor once
suggested killing another official insured by the company for $15
million.
   But Lawrence Shorten, testifying Monday at the racketeering
trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and six others, said he never
took the suggested murder plot seriously.
   Shorten, once Wedtech's chief financial officer, is one of four
former company officials to plead guilty to state and federal
charges, and was the second to testify at the trial in exchange for
leniency.
   Biaggi, Wedtech founder John Mariotta and five others are
accused of turning Wedtech, now in bankruptcy proceedings, into a
racketeering enterprise that made millions of dollars in payoffs to
secure government contracts.
   Under cross-examination by the defense, Shorten admitted that
after he and other Wedtech executives forced Mariotta out of the
company in 1985, they kept paying premiums for a $15 million
insurance policy on Mariotta despite Wedtech's financial problems.
   Shorten, however, denied that another Wedtech executive, Anthony
Guariglia, wanted to keep up the policy ``because it might come in
handy.''
   ``But he did say that if John Mariotta died the company could
use the $15 million?'' pressed Mariotta attorney Jeffrey Glekel.
   ``He did make that statement, yes,'' said Shorten.
   The witness said Guariglia called him in late 1985 to talk about
a conversation with then-Wedtech Chairman Fred Neuberger.
   ``I think he said to the effect, `Wait till you hear this one.'
I said `What?' He said, `Freddie came up with the bright idea to
knock off John Mariotta.'
   ``I said to him: You are not serious?' He says, `No, I just
thought you'd want to know that Freddie made that statement.'''
   Guariglia and Neuberger are expected to testify for the
government.
   The defense has been trying to depict them and other former
Wedtech officials as liars and thieves who have admitted crimes far
more serious than the ones Biaggi and his co-defendants are accused
of.
   Mario Moreno, another one of the four cooperating Wedtech
officials, testified earlier that Neuberger suggested hiring an
Israeli hitman to kill Mariotta.
   Shorten said Neuberger often boasted of having connections with
an Israeli hitman.
   ``He said he could take care of everything, he could hire a
`consultant from Israel,' but it had nothing to do with John
Mariotta. It was more joking than anything else,'' said Shorten.
   Shorten said later that local Teamsters officials suggested
killing Mariotta in March 1986.
   ``They said it could be done for $50,000,'' said Shorten. ``We
rejected it out of hand, that it was a crazy thought, that we
wouldn't get involved in anything like that.''
   Moreno has testified that Wedtech paid off Teamsters officials
for labor peace and that a union leader offered to ``eliminate''
Mariotta because they were afraid he might ``spill the beans'' on
the payoffs.
   Moreno also testified that most of the executives rejected the
idea, although he said Neuberger complained they were acting like
``Boy Scouts.''

   Florida State University ordered a
fraternity to disband for five years for a rape of a teen-age
student at the fraternity house and subsequent cover-up, officials
said.
   ``I hope what we're doing sends out a message we do take this
very seriously,'' Dean of Students James Hayes said Monday. ``The
nature of the whole incident was so serious that to be responsible
you have to take action.''
   University officials accepted a recommendation after a four-day
hearing by an administrative hearing panel made up of a student,
faculty member and staff representative.
   Hayes announced the sanctions just 10 days after a strongly
worded grand jury interim report urged university officials to
crack down on Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, where the woman was
allegedly raped March 5 by two fraternity members.
   The grand jury report issued last month said the 18-year-old
victim was raped by more than one person and left in a
life-threatening condition of intoxication. She suffered several
scratches and abrasions and had crude words and a fraternity symbol
scrawled on her thighs.
   Other fraternity members allegedly tried to block the
university's investigation, which led to the arrest of three men.
   ``The question of not cooperating was a pretty serious one,''
Hayes said.
   The fraternity's president, Brant Byrd of Belleair, denied
claims that the fraternity failed to cooperate.
   ``I know that we cooperated with the FSU police from the
beginning and we'll continue to,'' Byrd said.
   The fraternity, which has about 170 members, has until May 15 to
appeal the sanctions.
   Fraternity members Daniel G. Oltarsh, 23, of Fort Lauderdale and
Byron L. Stewart, 21, of Orlando were charged with sexual battery.
Jason J. McPharlin, 19, of Plantation, a Pi Kappa Alpha member at
Auburn University, was charged with being an accessory to a felony
and failing to report a sexual battery.
   Oltarsh and Stewart were freed on $10,000 bond last week, while
McPharlin was freed on $6,000 bond.
   The Pi Kappa Alpha chapter at Stetson University in Deland,
about 250 miles southeast of Tallahassee, was suspended for one
year by school officials last week following rape allegations. No
criminal charges were filed.

   The ailing mother of deposed
President Ferdinand Marcos today slipped into semi-consciousness
after asking President Corazon Aquino to allow her son to return as
``my dying wish.''
   There was no reaction from Mrs. Aquino to the request of
95-year-old Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who was hospitalized Sunday with
pneumonia and diabetes. The military chief hinted the armed forces
command opposed a Marcos return.
   Dr. Sergio Brillantes, director of the Veterans Medical Center,
said Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' condition had worsened in the past 24
hours. He said her kidneys were failing but that her blood pressure
was too low for dialysis.
   ``Dona Josefa Marcos has deteriorated quite rapidly since
yesterday,'' Brillantes told The Associated Press. ``Her level of
consciousness is deteriorating. She is semi-comatose.''
   Later, Brillantes told radio station DZXL that Mrs.
Edralin-Marcos' condition was ``very, very bad and the prognosis is
very poor at the moment.''
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos stayed behind in February 1986 when a
military-civilian uprising drove her son to exile in Hawaii and
brought President Aquino to power. Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow
Marcos to come back.
   Mrs. Aquino's staff said the presidential palace received a
letter today from Mrs. Edralin-Marcos asking that her son be
allowed to return to be with her in her final hours.
   ``My end beckons me,'' said the letter, the text of which was
released by the presidential palace. ``I know I am about to render
my own accounting with my maker. I leave our world content.
   ``My dying wish, the one thing that will put a smile upon my
lips when I leave this world, is to see my Ferdinand by my bedside,
as I say goodbye to all of you who have been part of my mundane
existence.
   ``May God bless you with all the compassion, understanding and
the undying love of a mother to her own child, especially at the
sunset hours my being. Pray grant me this wish ... as one mother to
another for the love of all.''
   Presidential officials said the letter was signed with Mrs.
Edralin-Marcos' thumbprint and was written Monday. They said Mrs.
Aquino had not been shown the letter.
   Only family members and attendants were allowed in Mrs.
Edralin-Marcos' hospital room. But dozens of Marcos supporters
jammed an adjacent room where they watched Mrs. Edralin-Marcos
through a small window.
   Outside the hospital, about 100 Marcos supporters held a
candle-light vigil and prayed for her recovery.
   Earlier, Brillantes said the patient was not responding to
medication because of her advanced age. He said the former
president's brother, Dr. Pacifico Marcos, and his sister, Mrs.
Fortuna Barba, were at their mother's bedside.
   In Honolulu, Marcos' spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said the former
president was aware of his mother's condition.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to come back, saying his
return would not be good for the country. Marcos supporters have
been linked to several previous coup attempts.
   Marcos was not allowed to return for the funeral of his sister,
Elizabeth Keon, who died in the Philippines in December 1986.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa today said that if
Mrs. Edralin-Marcos died, the Cabinet would be consulted on whether
to allow the former president to attend the funeral.
   ``We will have to assess at this point in time whether
conditions in the past are still the same,'' de Villa told
reporters. ``We still have certainly a serious threat situation in
the country, coming from (communist rebels) and we don't want
additional problems if it's possible at this time.''
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos came from a prosperous northern Luzon family
of Filipino and Chinese extraction. Marcos' father Mariano, a
politician and lawyer, died in 1944 during the Japanese occupation.

   Israeli security forces raided a Palestinian
newspaper and detained the managing editor, police and newspaper
officials said today.
   Hannah Siniora, editor of the Arab- and English-language Al Fajr
newspaper in east Jerusalem, sharply criticized the Monday night
raid. It followed the closing Monday of the Palestinian weekly, Al
Awdah, and was the latest in a series of measures taken against
journalists.
   ``I feel all these oppressive measures will backlash against the
peace process,'' he told The Associated Press today. ``Journalists
apparently are being singled out for special attention.''
   A police official confirmed that Israeli authorities carried out
the raid, and security sources said managing editor Hatem Abdul
Khader would be jailed for six months without trial under Israeli
emergency regulations. The officials spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Since unrest began in the occupied territories Dec. 8, Israeli
authorities have shut two pro-Palestinian newspapers and a press
agency, arrested 22 reporters, most of them Arabs, and lifted the
credentials of two American correspondents.
   The authorities said they closed Al Awdah, the only
English-language weekly magazine published in east Jerusalem
because it received funding from terrorist organizations. The
magazine's publisher, Ibrahim Kara'een, denied the charge.
   Siniora said it was not clear why Al Fajr's managing editor was
detained.
   ``We are making inquiries with our lawyers today about what
actions to take,'' Siniora said.
   The army also has periodically closed large areas of the
occupied territories to journalists and empowered local commanders
to chase them from the scene of trouble spots.
   Israeli officials have blamed television cameras for stoking the
fires of the uprising and accused the press of maintaining a double
standard, taking Israel to task for actions that are overlooked
elsewhere in the world.
   ``A sort of paranoia has developed about the media,'' said Yariv
Ben-Eliezer, a professor of film and communications at Tel-Aviv
University. ``Soldiers always ask, `Why is the media against us?'
and students ask the same question.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner,
acknowledged Israelis feel resentment toward the media.
   The media ``have given us the short end of the stick _ they
didn't tell the whole of the Israeli side of the story,'' Pazner
said. ``No wonder there is resentment.''
   He stressed, however, that Israel has made no changes in its
policy of freedom of the press.
   ``We scrupulously maintain our principle of safeguarding the
freedom of the press in the country,'' Pazner said. ``There are
very few countries in the world that would allow this kind of
freedom, in the situation we have been in during the last months.''
   Monday's actions followed the six-month closure in March of Al
Awdah's sister organization, the English-language Palestine Press
Service, a key source of information on the occupied territories.
   Israel also shut down a left-wing, pro-Arab Israeli newspaper,
Derech Hanitzotz. The Press Service and Derech Hanitzotz were
charged with maintaining links with terror organizations.
   Since its February closing, four editors of the Israeli
newspaper, including three Israelis, have been arrested and accused
of membership in guerrilla groups.
   At least 18 Palestinian journalists are in jail, many held under
administrative detention orders which allow imprisonment for up to
six months without trial, according to a representative of the Arab
Journalists Association, who asked not to be identified for fear of
reprisals.
   Israel has also periodically barred the distribution of
Arabic-language newspapers in the occupied territories.
   Last month, the government suspended the press credentials of
foreign correspondents Glenn Frankel of the Washington Post and
Martin Fletcher of NBC News after they published details of the
assassination of a PLO leader without submitting them to military
censorship.
   Since the uprising began, the Foreign Press Association, which
represents 200 foreign journalists working in Israel, has received
between 100 and 150 complaints of harassment and physical attacks
by Israeli troops and Jewish settlers, said Robert Slater, the
group's chairman.
   ``There is a feeling among many people that the media should be
taken out of the territories, that if you don't see it, it isn't
there,'' Ben-Eliezer said.

<TEXT>
   A Vietnam veteran's family held a tearful reunion
with his 20-year-old daughter, separated from them for 16 years by
red tape.
   ``She's home,'' Don Benson said after Hanh Dung arrived at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Monday night. ``A few times I
had a lot of wonders and a lot of worries, but you don't give up on
something like this.''
   ``I never gave up hope,'' his wife, Linh, said as she waited for
her daughter's plane to arrive. ``Every night I prayed and prayed.''
   Ms. Benson's prayers were answered at 6:35 p.m. Trembling and
smiling nervously, she entered the plane to greet her daughter and
her husband.
   Ms. Benson and Hanh Dung emerged from the aircraft with tears in
their eyes. Ms. Benson, her arms draped around her daughter, guided
her to her 18-year-old sister, Kim, and her 15-year-old brother,
Greg. Kim Benson was 2 when the family left for the United States.
Hanh Dung had never seen her brother.
   There were more tears than words.
   Hanh Dung, clad in red corduroy pants, white and purple sneakers
and a gray jacket over a white shirt, said nothing as she faced
dozens of reporters and television cameras. She speaks little
English and had been awake for more than 24 hours, her father said.
   ``She's glad to be here. She's tired and she's worn out,'' said
the 49-year-old retired Army sergeant. ``She's got some adjusting
to do.''
   Benson and his wife, Linh, left South Vietnam in 1972, leaving
Hanh Dung behind with her grandmother, who has since died.
   Two years later, they tried to arrange for their daughter to
travel to the United States, but progress was slow.
   In 1975, South Vietnam fell to the communists.
   Hanh Dung has held an exit visa from Vietnam since 1979, but
U.S. officials would not allow her to emigrate because some medical
test results had been lost.
   Benson, who lives in Puyallup near Tacoma, traveled to Vietnam
in February to try to bring his daughter back.
   After Benson's return to this country in April, his daughter was
finally allowed to travel to Bangkok, Thailand. Following final
arragements, she flew to San Francisco, where she met her father.
The two continued to Seattle.
   Asked Monday night what kept him going through the long fight to
bring his daughter home, Benson replied simply, ``Love.''
   He said his battle to get his daughter back left him bitter, and
vowed to continue the fight to help reunite other Amerasian
families.
   ``I don't know what my next move is,'' Benson said. ``But
there's going to be a next move.''

<HEAD>Letter To Pravda Criticizes Communist Party, Past and Present</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist Party member harshly criticized his
comrades in a letter to Pravda, saying their careerist ambitions
and conformity made the party into a mere instrument of Josef
Stalin and his successors.
   The letter from a government official, V. Selivanov, to the
party daily differed markedly from the usual criticism now seen of
the Soviet past, which blames former party leaders themselves for
excesses or departures from Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy.
   Selivanov, deputy chief of administration at the Ministry of the
Aviation Industry, criticized the 19-million member party itself,
and its role in his country's political life since the death of
Vladimir I. Lenin in 1924.
   Selivanov, a party member since 1972, wrote: ``The party is the
mind, honor and conscience of our epoch.'' Those words of V.I.
Lenin unfortunately cannot be applied to all members of our party
at the current time.''
   His letter, frontpaged in Pravda's Monday editions, appeared the
day after May Day, the workers holiday, and its prominent place was
clearly designed to give its contents maximum exposure.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has told party members to
back his ambitious program for ``perestroika,'' or social and
economic restructuring, or get out of the way for those who do. He
is expected to use a party conference on June 28 to set his stamp
even more firmly on the party, which holds the monopoly on Soviet
political power.
   ``The main question of perestroika is the democratization of
society, and this is not feasible without democratization of the
party,'' Selivanov wrote in this letter. To that end, he called for
reviewing each Communist's past performance to see whether
membership should be extended or revoked.
   The nation's criminal code, now being rewritten, should be
modified so Communists who commit crimes get a more severe sentence
than non-party members, he said. Party leaders up to the level of
regional chief should be elected for a set term by secret ballot,
he said. Top local party officials are now appointed by Moscow, and
the appointment ratified by a ritual vote.
   Gorbachev himself floated the idea of a more democratic
selection process for local party officials at the party Central
Committee's meeting in January 1987. The idea was not repeated in
the Central Committee's report, indicating a defeat for Gorbachev,
but it has resurfaced in speeches by Soviet officials.
   Analyzing the often troubled role of the party during 70 years
of Soviet history, Selivanov wrote that during the internecine
ideological battles of the late 1920s and 1930s, the party
leadership pursued unity ``at any price.''
   The result, he said, was the spread of the opinion ``that the
GenSec (party General Secretary) is always right, that his speeches
are the truth, down to the last detail ... it is only necessary to
correctly quote the leader.''
   During their tenures as party leader, Stalin, Nikita S.
Khrushchev and Leonid I. Brezhnev all had no intention of modifying
the party structures that concentrated so much power in their
hands, Selivanov wrote.
   For many Communists and their families, the careers, awards,
benefits and contacts with influential people they could obtain
from their party membership became the chief goals in their lives,
he said.
   In the 1970s, when Brezhnev was in power, Selivanov said some
people told him that having intelligence and a conscience was
incompatible with being a member of the Communist Party.

   U.S. military experts met with Laotian
officials today to start a search for the remains of two American
servicemen shot down in a wartime reconnaissance mission 22 years
ago, a military spokesman said.
   The U.S. team of 14 people arrived in southern Laos on two C-130
transport planes from Bangkok. The planes carried electric
generators, metal detectors and tools to excavate the site in
Savannakhet province where the Mohawk OV-1A aircraft crashed, said
Maj. Tim Pfister.
   The weeklong project is the third U.S.-Laotian excavation for
the remains of 555 Americans listed as missing in action in Laos.
   Pfister, spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command, said the team
included an anthropologist experienced in identifying human remains
and two weapons disposal experts in case any live munitions
remained at the site.
   The team is from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and
the Army Central Identification Laboratory, Honolulu-based agencies
entrusted with resolving the fates of Americans missing in action
from the Vietnam War. The war ended in 1975 with the defeat of the
U.S.-backed South Vietnam government.
   The U.S. team led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, the Resolution Center
commander, will be working with officials from Laos' Defense and
Foreign ministries, Pfister said.
   The Savannakhet province is in the southern panhandle area
between Thailand and Vietnam. The crash site is 95 miles east of
the city of Savannakhet.
   Pfister said the remains of 11 missing Americans were recovered
in the first joint excavation in the communist country in 1985 and
eight others in a 1986 project.
   On previous excavations, the workers went down on their hands
and knees to dig out plane wreckage and sift for bone fragments
with fine metal screens. A number of unexploded shells were found.
   At Savannakhet, the Americans hope to resolve the fates of two
soldiers reported missing after heavy ground fire struck the Mohawk
March 15, 1966.
   Pfister said another U.S. aircraft on that mission reported that
one crewman parachuted out but landed in the area where the plane
crashed.
   U.S. military experts said they saw no trace of remains during a
preliminary inspection of the site last week. Serial numbers found
on some wreckage were confirmed by the aircraft manufacturer, the
Grumman Corp., as belonging to an OV-1A Mohawk.
   Details of the Mohawk's mission were not available. But a number
of U.S. planes were shot down in eastern Laos while trying to
disrupt traffic on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which North Vietnamese
communists used to bring men and supplies into South Vietnam.
   Laos agreed in August 1987 to devote more effort to the MIA
issue after the United States pledged to respond to its calls for
humanitarian assistance.

<TEXT>
   South Africa, Cuba and Angola today began
U.S.-sponsored negotiations aimed at the withdrawal of foreign
troops from the civil war in Angola, the U.S. Embassy said.
   The embassy said the scheduled two-day talks had begun, but
refused to disclose where representatives are meeting in London.
   The British Foreign Office said the nations also would discuss
independence for South-West Africa, or Namibia, which South Africa
controls.
   The talks come after an eight-year U.S. effort to secure the
withdrawal of 40,000 Cuban troops, sent in 1975 to defend Angola's
Marxist government against pro-Western rebels.
   Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, led the American delegation to the negotiations.
   Cuba was to be represented by its foreign minister, Raul Roa
Kouri, and Angola's foreign minister, Alfonso Van Dunem, also was
to attend.
   South Africa sent a delegation headed by a Neil van Heerden,
director general of the Department of Foreign Affairs.
   Crocker made no comment before the talks. They were announced on
Friday in a brief British statement after Crocker conferred in
London with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamishin.
   Adamishin told a news conference on Friday that Moscow supported
the ``political dynamism'' behind the talks.
   South African troops are in Angola to attack bases of the South
West Africa People's Organization, which seeks independence for
South-West Africa, and to support the Angolan rebels, known as the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   South Africa acknowledges up to 3,000 troops in southern Angola,
while Angola says there are 9,000 South Africans there, backed by
heavy artillery.
   In return for a Cuban withdrawal, Angola and the Soviet Union
want South Africa to give Namibia independence as demanded in a
1966 U.N. resolution.
   The British Foreign Office said the talks will cover both the
troop withdrawals and independence for Namibia.
   But the exclusion of Namibian and Angolan rebels appeared to
indicate the emphasis will be on getting the South Africans and
Cubans out of Angola, rather than Namibian independence.
   Previous attempts at settlement have foundered partly on the
Reagan administration's demand that Cuban troops leave before
Namibia becomes independent. President P.W. Botha of South Africa
repeated that demand in Johannesburg on Monday.
   In recent months, the South Africans and Cubans have been bogged
down in heavy fighting around the strategic southeastern city of
Cuito Cuanavale.
   The war is a heavy burden on the already strapped Angolan
economy, and the Cubans have sustained high, but undisclosed,
losses.
   South Africa acknowledges that more than 50 of its troops have
been killed in Angola since September.

<HEAD>Game Show Winner Sentenced for Insurance Fraud</HEAD>

   A man who was the biggest single-game winner
on the TV game show ``Super Password'' has been sentenced to five
years in prison for an insurance scheme in which he falsely said
his wife was dead.
   U.S. District Court Judge William Byrne on Monday also ordered
Kerry Dee Ketchem to repay $100,000 to an insurance company and
said prosecutors were correct in calling Ketchem a ``con man and a
thief.''
   Ketchem, 36, who had been living in San Bernardino, admitted
fraudulently collecting the $100,000 from an insurance policy by
saying his wife had been killed in an auto accident.
   Ketchem's wife Kelly Ann, who had not been living with her
husband, told FBI agents she was unaware he had collected on the
policy, held by Amex Life Insurance Co. of San Rafael.
   Ketchem admitted obtaining a death certificate and accident
report from a U.S. Air Force Base in England and filling them out
to fake his wife's death.
   Investigators later found Mrs. Ketchem on active duty at
Lackland AFB in Texas, where she had been transferred.
   Ketchem pleaded guilty March 14 to two counts of a six-count
mail-fraud indictment returned by a federal grand jury in San
Francisco.
   Ketchem had used the name Patrick Quinn to appear on the TV
show, which was seen by an Alaskan banker who recognized Ketchem as
the man who allegedly ran up about $25,000 in credit in Alaska by
fraudulently obtaining credit cards.
   Authorities arrested Ketchem when he tried to pick up $58,600 in
winnings from his appearance on ``Super Password.''
   Ketchem told the judge he used the other name to hide his assets
from his wife, whom he was divorcing.
   NBC has announced it will not give Ketchem his winnings because
he lied about his name while on the show, posing as a government
employee. In a move show officials called ``unbelievable,'' Ketchem
sent a Mailgram from his jail cell demanding the cash and saying
the show had received ``priceless free publicity because of me.''

   Armando Reyes bided his time for nearly a
year, waiting for the immigration service to reveal that its
amnesty program was just a cruel trick. But, facing the deadline,
Reyes took his place in line to sign up.
   The Mexican-born Reyes and thousands of others jammed lines
outside and inside U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
offices nationwide Monday as the clock ticked toward Wednesday's
midnight deadline for applying for amnesty and the right to become
a U.S. citizen.
   By Monday, 1.2 million people had signed up under the program in
the western region, said Harold Ezell, INS western regional
commissioner. Two million were expected to sign up nationwide, he
said.
   When asked on the NBC ``Today'' show why so many aliens had
waited until the last minute, Ezell said, ``Same reason that you
didn't file your income tax until, like me, four o'clock on the
fifteenth of April. Procastination is the biggest problem that we
all face. And the illegal alien is no different.''
   In Miami, applicants lined up two days in advance to be assured
help Monday morning. In Houston, they brought lawn chairs, ice
chests and toys for the long wait. In Los Angeles, aliens conceded
they had been putting it off, but now there was no time left for
procrastination.
   ``I was afraid before, but now there's no more time to be
scared,'' Reyes said, as he stood outside the Wilshire Boulevard
office in Los Angeles, ready to apply for himself, his wife and two
daughters.
   ``A good friend says it's not a trick, and now I realize I have
to think of my family.''
   Reyes, 39, a janitor who came to the United States in 1978 from
Aguas Calientes, said he easily assembled the papers needed to
prove his family had lived here since Jan. 1, 1982, as required by
the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act.
   One of the authors of the legislation was in Los Angeles on
Monday, and he sought to reassure those hoping for a life in the
United States.
   ``Wednesday night at 12 o'clock we will take anyone in the line,
all over the United States,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who
donned an ornate sombrero. ``(They) will receive status in the
United States that removes them from a fearful subculture of human
beings.''
   In Miami, aliens began lining up as much as two days in advance
in front of the Biscayne Boulevard office, agency spokesman Ray
Dudley said.
   ``We had 600 people out there this morning,'' Dudley said
Monday. ``It wasn't healthy. We have no restroom facilities on the
weekend, we have traffic problems, and and it's a danger to
people.''
   Thousands of undocumented aliens queued up Monday outside the
Houston INS office. At least 2,000 camped out Sunday night. One
woman stood holding her baby in one arm and in the other, clutching
amnesty documents that were longer than the infant.
   ``This is an incredible amount of activity,'' regional INS
commissioner Mario Ortiz said. ``The pace is really phenomenal,
particularly in Dallas and Houston.''
   ``Things have been so wild,'' said Eugene Botts, chief
legalization officer for Phoenix, Ariz., where the number of
applications had doubled during the past month, numbering 500 to
600 Monday.
   Some, like Beto Silva, 26, who stood in line outside a Tucson,
Ariz., INS office, said they had procrastinated because it took
them a long time to assemble the paperwork needed to prove
continuous residency.
   ``I want to work,'' he said. ``If I didn't have to work, I
wouldn't have gone through all of this.''
   Edilia Grijalva, a friend waiting with Silva, said, ``He just
wants to know how it feels to be an American citizen.''
   With the amnesty program about to end, the INS is preparing to
shift its emphasis to sanctions for employers who knowingly hire
illegal workers.
   ``Amnesty is not going to stem the flow (of illegal aliens),''
Ezell said. ``Sanctions are going to stem the flow.''

performance in ``Wenceslas Square'' and ``Driving Miss Daisy,''
which also was named best Off-Broadway play.
   ``Oil City Symphony'' and ``Romance Romance'' tied for best
Off-Broadway musical. ``Romance Romance,'' which transferred to
Broadway on Sunday, also won best book and lyrics for Barry Harman
and best music for Keith Herrmann in the Off-Broadway category.
   The award for outstanding debut of an actress went to Melissa
Gilbert for ``A Shayna Maidel.''

<HEAD>Talks To Set Rules For Mining In Antarctica</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives from 37 nations
have opened a monthlong meeting aimed at hammering out
international rules governing the mining of oil, gas and other
minerals in Antarctica.
   The talks were opened Monday by Foreign Minister Russell
Marshall.
   Environmentalists, such as the Greenpeace organization, are
strongly opposed to any mining in Antarctica and say the
mineral-rich continent could one day ignite a military conflict as
the world's natural resources dwindle.
   Greenpeace, which conducts scientitic research in Antarctica, is
campaigning to have the continent a ``world park.''
   But to others, in particular the 19 countries operating
geological programs there, Antarctica is rich in mineral resources
waiting to be extracted.
   The United States, which is represented at the meeting,
estimates there are 48 billion barrels of offshore petroleum
reserves and vast quantities of coal, copper, gold and uranium in
Antarctica.
   Marshall told representatives from the 37 Antarctic Treaty
nations there was no reference to mining in a 1959 Antarctic Treaty
and the meeting would fill that gap. In 1977, the nations agreed to
voluntary mineral restraints.
   Chris Beeby, deputy secretary of foreign affairs, said it had
not been determined whether mining should ever be allowed
Antarctica.

<HEAD>Congressman's Aide Wrote of `Ill Winds That Taunt Us' Before
Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top aide to U.S. Rep. Roy Dyson wrote an
eight-line poem that spoke of ``ill winds that taunt us'' shortly
before jumping out a window in his New York City hotel room to his
death, The Sun reported today.
   Tom Pappas, administrative assistant to the Maryland Democrat,
died Sunday after talking with colleagues about a front-page
article that appeared in The Washington Post. The story said
Pappas, 46, recruited young, single men as employees and pressured
them to socialize with him.
   The Sun today quoted an unidentified source close to the police
investigation as saying Pappas' poem read, in part, ``Ill winds
that taunt us through peace and understanding will not cause us to
have a crash-landing.''
   The verse also spoke of the ``dark and ugly world.''
   ``Goodbye'' was neatly printed on the lined notebook paper that
bore no addressee, The New York Times reported. Police called the
death a suicide.
   Meanwhile, Maryland Republican leaders considered asking a GOP
congressional candidate to step aside so a stronger opponent could
challenge Dyson.
   The Post article quoted former Dyson aides as saying the
congressman had ceded control of his office to Pappas. Some staff
members complained about Pappas' unusual demands, including one
that an unidentified employee perform a striptease at a staff
retreat.
   Dyson, Pappas and Todd Skipper, another aide, were in New York
to meet with a lawyer and attend the Broadway musical ``Phantom of
the Opera,'' police there said.
   Republican leaders said Monday they are thinking of asking Wayne
Gilchrest, a political novice who won the party's nomination in the
March primary, to consider stepping aside so a better-known
candidate can challenge Dyson.
   But they said they won't try to force Gilchrest out, and
Gilchrest said he would not withdraw.
   ``I was given the `10 count' the day after the primary,'' he
said. ``I think I'm more electable than anybody has imagined.''
   Gilchrest, a former high school social studies teacher who has
never held public office, works as a counselor at Chesapeake
College. His campaign has no paid staffers and he estimates he so
far has raised only about $1,000.
   Democratic officials Monday predicted Dyson, 39, would win
re-election in November.

   A judge said he was sending ``a warning to
landlords'' when he sentenced a Russian emigre violinist to 15
years to life in prison for hiring arsonists to burn an occupied
apartment house he owned.
   The landlord, Gregory Gelman, 39, who has performed at Carnegie
Hall, insisted at his sentencing Monday that he was innocent.
   ``The truth did not come out at trial. People lied under oath,''
Gelman protested when state Supreme Court Justice Jeffrey Atlas
sentenced him.
   Gelman's lawyer, Irving Cohen, asked the judge for leniency and
said his client had been frustrated and financially hobbled by the
complexities of the city's housing laws. Gelman, who came to this
country 10 years ago, is a graduate of the Juilliard School of
Music.
   Gelman, married and the father of a 2-year-old daughter, was
unable to make an adequate living at his profession, according to
Cohen, so he became a landlord. He owns four buildings.
   Atlas, who heard Gelman's two-month trial without a jury, told
the defendant that he convicted him only after finding him guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge also said he could not believe
Gelman's assertion that virtually every prosecution witness had
lied.
   The judge said the sentence, imposed under a recently enacted
``arson-for-profit'' law, should be ``a warning to landlords that
their financial problems will not be solved by burning down their
buildings.''
   Atlas convicted Gelman on Oct. 6 of first-degree arson,
second-degree conspiracy and first-degree reckless endangerment for
torching his five-story building in the Chelsea section of
Manhattan on Feb. 24, 1986 while a rent strike was on.
   Assistant District Attorney Suzanne Flamm said Gelman wanted to
burn the 15 tenants out so he could collect $250,000 in insurance
money and then rent to tenants who would not be covered by rent
control or rent stabilization laws.
   Gelman hired four men to torch the building, but two were
seriously burned when the 40 gallons of gasoline they had brought
into the building ignited. The four pleaded guilty to third-degree
arson and are awaiting sentencing.
   The building's occupants escaped the blaze without injuries and
moved back into their apartment after repairs were made.
   Ms. Flamm, observing that the value of Gelman's building
increased after he bought it, said, ``He could have made a handsome
profit without arson but profit was not enough.''
   Gelman blamed the tenants for his troubles. ``The tenants did
not pay for two years,'' he said. ``In New York, being a landlord
you can never win.''

<HEAD>Investigators Find More Weakened Rivets In Aloha's Boeing 737 Jet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAHULUI, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two fuselage panels on an Aloha Airlines
jetliner that ripped open at 24,000 feet had several rivets showing
signs of cracking, but officials are not sure if the cracks were
present before the accident.
   More electronic tests of rivets along a key strip of the plane's
structure were scheduled for today as investigators near the end of
their field work, Joseph Nall, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board, said Monday.
   A 20-foot section of the Boeing 737's upper fuselage ripped off
as it flew across the Hawaiian Islands on Thursday, killing a
flight attendant and injuring 61 of the 89 passengers.
   Tests were done on 760 rivets and 30 were found cracked, he said.
   None of the bad rivets were next to each other and they were
randomly scattered along the length of the aircraft, he said.
   In normal maintenance, rivets usually are checked visually for
cracks resulting from metal fatigue, and a focus of the
investigation will be whether that method is adequate, Nall said.
   The pilot of Aloha's Flight 243, Capt. Robert Schornstheimer,
and co-pilot Mimi Tompkins, returned to Maui from Honolulu on
Monday to look at the crippled plane they managed to land.
   ``They had not seen the floor beams and were just as amazed as
the rest of us. Our investigators have been scratching their heads
that the aircraft held itself together,'' Nall said.
   Nall said he hopes the accident forces the airline industry to
reassess its maintenance methods and take another look at ``high
cycle'' aircraft, meaning older, heavily used planes.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered the oldest
versions of the Boeing 737s not to fly above 23,000 feet.
   Meanwhile, family members, friends and hundreds of fellow
workers at Aloha Airlines gathered in a hangar at Honolulu
International Airport on Monday for a memorial service for missing
flight attendant, Clarabelle ``C.B.'' Lansing, 57, who was swept
out of the plane when it tore open.
   Seven injured passengers remained hositalized in Maui Memorial
Hospital in stable condition, according to a nursing supervisor.

<TEXT>
   The government refused to allow
three rightist elected officials to go today to the island of
Ouvea, where Melanesian separatists are holding 23 police officers
hostage in a cave.
   The main pro-independence organization, the Kanak Socialist
National Liberation Front, also rejected the offer.
   Dick Ukeiwe, who represents the French Pacific island territory
in the French Senate, said he and two National Assembly members,
Jacques Lafleur and Maurice Nenou, want to change places with the
hostages.
   Lafleur asked that an airplane be made available for the three
men to go to Ouvea. The request was refused.
   ``Given the present situation and the talks in progress, the
government has decided to not accept this proposition,'' said a
official in the High Commission in Noumea, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Transportation to Ouvea, in the Loyalty Islands group east of
New Caledonia's main island, has been interrupted since separatists
attacked a police station in the village of Fayaoue on April 22,
killing four policemen and taking others hostage.
   New Caledonia, a French possession since 1853, is about 1,000
miles east of Australia and has been the scene of sporadic violence
since 1984.
   About 43 percent of New Caledonia's 145,000 people are native
Melanesians, known as Kanaks, and many of them favor independence.
About 36 percent are Europeans, who generally want to remain part
of France. The rest are mostly Asian or Polynesian.
   Ukeiwe, Lafleur and Nenou are members of the rightist Rally for
the Republic, and are prominent opponents of the separatist
movement.
   The hostages include the head of an anti-terrorism squad and an
assistant prosecutor. The hostages are being held in a cave in a
remote part of Ouvea, which lies off the east coast of New
Caledonia's main island, La Grande Terre.

   Today is Tuesday, May 3, the 124th day of 1988. There are 242
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On May 3, 1802, Washington, D.C., was incorporated as a city,
with the mayor to be appointed by the president, and the council
elected by property owners.
   On this date:
   In 1654, a bridge in Rowley, Mass., was permitted to charge a
toll for animals, while people crossed for free.
   In 1765, the first U.S. medical school was proposed at the
College of Philadelphia, now the University of Pennsylvania.
   In 1916, Irish nationalist Patrick Pearse and two others were
executed by the British for their roles in the Easter Rising.
   In 1921, West Virginia imposed the first state sales tax.
   In 1933, Nellie Taylor Ross became the first woman director of
the U.S. Mint.
   In 1937, Margaret Mitchell won a Pulitzer Prize for her novel,
``Gone With the Wind.''
   In 1948, Pulitzer Prizes were awarded to playwright Tennessee
Williams for ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' and to novelist James
Michener for ``Tales of the South Pacific.''
   In 1948, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that covenants prohibiting
the sale of real estate to blacks and other minorities were legally
unenforceable.
   In 1971, anti-war protesters, calling themselves the ``Mayday
Tribe,'' began four days of demonstrations in Washington aimed at
shutting down the nation's capital.
   In 1979, Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher was elected
Britain's first female prime minister.
   In 1986, in NASA's first post-Challenger launch, an unmanned
Delta rocket, lost power in its main engine shortly after liftoff,
forcing safety officers to destroy it by remote control.
   Ten years ago: ``Sun Day'' fell on a Wednesday as thousands of
people extolling the virtues of solar energy held ceremonies,
demonstrations and other events across the country.
   Five years ago: After two years of debate, U.S. Roman Catholic
bishops overwhelmingly approved a pastoral letter that condemned
the first use of nuclear weapons, virtually ruled out their use for
retaliation and demanded a halt to the growth of superpower
arsenals.
   One year ago: The Miami Herald published a story in its Sunday
editions saying its reporters had observed a young woman spending
``Friday night and most of Saturday'' at a Washington townhouse
belonging to Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart.
   Today's Birthdays: Broadway librettist Betty Comden is 69. Folk
singer Pete Seeger is 69. Former boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson
is 68. Singer James Brown is 55. Singer Engelbert Humperdinck is
52. Singer Frankie Valli is 51. Magician Doug Henning is 41.
   Thought for Today: ``Great minds discuss ideas, average minds
discuss events, small minds discuss people.'' _ Adm. Hyman G.
Rickover, ``father'' of America's nuclear navy (1900-1986).

   The Soviet Union could limit terms
of office of high-ranking officials and develop a two-party system
in the near future, a panel of Soviet officials said during a
conference on U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations.
   American participants at Monday's conference appeared skeptical
upon hearing those and other statements from their Russian
counterparts, who outlined plans to revitalize Soviet society after
what they called ``10 years of stagnation.''
   ``We are only in the beginning of the process,'' said Nikolai
Shislin, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party,
the Soviet Union's only political party.
   ``In five, seven, 10 years _ I don't know'' how many parties
there might be, he said.
   ``I'd like to see more evidence,'' said George Kessinger,
president of Goodwill Industries of Orange County. He said he'd
like to visit the Soviet Union to see such changes for himself.
   ``If half of what they say is true, there's an amazing thing
going on,'' said Kessinger.
   Sergei Plekhanov, deputy director of the Soviet Institute for
USA and Candada Studies, said a greater separation of power is part
of the goal.
   ``We are talking about introducing the rule of law in the Soviet
Union,'' he said. ``But do we want to turn into a litigious society?
   ``We want ... the judiciary empowered to pass judgment on laws
and a legislature with more independence,'' Plekhanov said. ``But
do we want to create a class of professional politicians?''
   The panel discussion was one of many events at the annual
weeklong conference here, which is now in its 28th year. It brings
together experts on American and Soviet affairs.
   In June, the Central Committee will hold a party conference and
will consider many new laws to promote change and create what
Shislin called a state of citizens' rights.
   One issue will be rules to ``promote rotation in the party,'' he
said, including limiting the general secretariat to two or three
5-year terms.
   Alexander Kislov, a political scientist with the Soviet Academy
of Sciences, said such a system is necessary ``because we have to
get rid of the people who are afraid of change.''

   Ohio Democrats pick pledged national convention delegates
through a presidential preference primary on May 3.
   The state's 104 pledged delegates from congressional districts
will be elected directly from the primary ballot. The presidential
candidate receiving the most votes in a congressional district will
receive one ``bonus delegate'' from that district and the remaining
delegates will be allocated among presidential candidates in
proportion to the results of the primary.
   Ohio's remaining 55 pledged national convention delegates will
be chosen by the party's executive committee on June 10 and will be
allocated among presidential candidates in proportion to the
results of the primary.

   Ohio Republicans elect their national convention delegates
directly from the May 3 primary ballot.
   Ohio is a winner-take-all state, so the candidate getting the
most votes in each congressional district will get all three of the
convention delegates from those districts.
   The remaining 25 delegates at large are awarded to the candidate
receiving the most votes statewide.

   A mudslide swept through a rural Afghan village,
killing 35 people and destroying hundreds of homes, Tass reported
today.
   Rescue and reconstruction workers had arrived in the village of
Rabotak in the Afghan province of Samangan, said the Soviet news
agency, which quoted the official Afghan news agency Bakhtar.
   The Moscow-aligned government of President Najib formed a
special commission to assess damage and provide relief, Tass said.
The agency gave no further details of the disaster, and did not say
when it occurred.
   Spring rains have caused many recent mudslides in mountainous
regions of Afghanistan and the Soviet republic of Kirgizia in
Central Asia.

   A 16-year-old boy died after he was shot while
a friend fought with another teen-ager over a 15-cent cherry
Popsicle, police said.
   Clay Sands III, shot once in the abdomen Sunday on the street
near his home, died at University Hospital early Monday, said
Detective David H. Hollingsworth.
   A friend of Sands, 17-year-old Tracey Sheppard, said he asked
Sands to stay with him while Sheppard fought with a youth who he
claimed had grabbed a Popsicle out of his hand.
   While Sheppard and the youth fought, another youngster,
described as about 16, started fighting with Sands, pulled a
handgun and shot him, police said.
   ``We were pretty close. We always did things together. He was
like a big brother. I'm short for my age. He always looked out for
me,'' Sheppard said of Sands.
   Police were still looking for the suspect, Hollingsworth said.

<HEAD>Manager: Liberace Knew Radio City His Final Concerts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM DAHLBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberace knew a November 1986 series of
concerts at Radio City Music Hall would probably be his last, but
still his longtime manager said the late entertainer never told him
he had AIDS.
   Seymour Heller, Liberace's personal manager for 37 years, said
Liberace complained to him the night before he closed in New York.
   ``He said, ```I've been working 43 years and I'm very tired. I
may never work again and I want to quit on top,''' said Heller, but
he said Liberace didn't say why. Heller said the performances were
indeed Liberace's last.
   Heller's testimony came Monday as a hearing on a request by the
late entertainer's longtime manager and four others to remove Joel
Strote as executor of Liberace's estate and head of his trusts
entered its third week in state court.
   Heller said the next month he asked Liberace if he had AIDS and
Liberace denied it, ordering his attorney to sue a newspaper that
reported he had the fatal disease.
   ``He said, `No, I don't have AIDS, Seymour,' '' Heller recalled.
``I'd been with him all those years and I had no idea he had AIDS.''
   Heller said Liberace told him to call his attorney, Strote, and
launch a lawsuit against the Las Vegas Sun.
   ``Lee wanted the Sun sued, but it never went anywhere,'' he
said. ``That's what broke the story about AIDS.''
   Liberace died less than two months later, on Feb. 4, 1987, at
his Palm Springs home from complications of AIDS.
   Heller, who was the executor on all of Liberace's wills except
the final one penned by Strote two weeks before Liberace's death,
had harsh words for Strote, who also served as Heller's attorney.
   ``After Lee died and he became executor, he turned on me like a
snake,'' Heller said of Strote. ``We were very close friends before
that.''
   Heller accused Strote, who he introduced to Liberace in the
mid-1970s, of ordering he be kept from Liberace in the final weeks
of the entertainer's life. He said he wasn't allowed to see
Liberace in a Palm Springs hospital two weeks before he died.
   ``Mr. Strote had put out an edict against me,'' said Heller, who
first served as Liberace's manager in 1950.
   Heller described how he traveled with Liberace and described
their friendship and business relationship as very close.
   ``We had a wonderful performer-personal manager relationship,''
he said. ``We never had any fights over business.''
   Heller said he made some $500,000 a year over the last years of
Liberace's life from his contracts with the pianist. The last year
of his life, he said was a ``slow year'' and he made $450,000.
   ``I deserved it and I'm not ashamed of it,'' he said.
   Heller also said he had life insurance contracts on Liberace
that paid $300,000 upon his death. He said that was normal in the
personal management business.

   A six-week audit shows dozens of calls were
made to a dial-a-porn service from a state-owned telephone in a
prison warden's home, according to a report published today.
   ``This is the first I've ever heard of it,'' Gander Hill Prison
Warden Howard R. Young told The (Wilmington) Morning News on Monday.
   ``I don't know who would do it, other than my oldest son or my
daughter. My daughter's the only one there at five. I'll be talking
to my daughter and whoever when I get home,'' Young said.
   The audit also turned up ``976'' calls from several state
offices. At the state Justice Department, ``Sports Phone'' seemed
to be the favorite, while calls at the Department of Transportation
were traced mostly to pornographic numbers.
   Between early November and late December, 93 calls were made
mostly during the day from various agency telephones.
   The number of calls showed ``surprisingly'' little abuse of
state telephone lines, Administrative Services Secretary George E.
Hale said Monday.
   The survey turned up $75.33 in direct tolls for calls to special
service lines, although the report did not detail costs charged for
calls on the state's wide-area, bulk-calling service.
   ``I reached the conclusion that, from a financial standpoint,
it's not a significant problem,'' Hale said. ``Although it does
raise questions about what the individual employees involved have
to do with their time.''

   Solidarity chief Lech Walesa today told
thousands of cheering workers at the Lenin shipyard that they must
find another union leader as a strike took hold at the birthplace
of the outlawed labor federation.
   Strike leaders said 80 percent of the 12,000 workers had dropped
their tools.
   The yard's giant cranes were idle, and a large poster at the
gate listed the strikers' demands: higher pay, reinstatement of
Solidarity nationwide, release of political prisoners and
reinstatement of fired activists.
   Thousands of workers, gathered in the factory's courtyard and
perched on rooftops and fences, heard Walesa's speech.
   ``We don't want to be the beggars of Europe and of the world,''
Walesa told the shipyard workers as he endorsed the strike that
began Monday.
   Walesa, who headed the August 1980 strike at the shipyard that
gave rise to the East bloc's first independent labor movement,
received a loud cheer from the workers when he entered the yard
this morning.
   The 44-year-old electrician had been on sick leave this week,
complaining of back pains and low blood sugar.
   Walesa told workers that Poland's labor struggle had exhausted
him.
   ``I am not your leader. I am tired ... You have to find for
yourself a new Walesa,'' he said.
   He also told the workers they were taking up the same cause he
fought for in 1980.
   ``We lost eight years,'' he said, speaking through a loudspeaker.
   ``Here, in the birthplace of Solidarity, I state to the
authorities that they are deepening the losses, they are forcing
Solidarity to lead the nation onto the road to reforms,'' said
Walesa, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize.
   The work stoppage at the shipyard was at least the fourth strike
in communist Poland in a week and contributed to the worst wave of
labor unrest since the government's December 1981 military
crackdown on Solidarity.
   In Wroclaw today, workers at a railroad car plant stopped
production for about an hour. And a bitter strike at the Lenin
steelworks in southern Poland entered its eighth day.
   About 1,000 workers laid down their tools for several hours at
the Pafawag railroad car plant in Wroclaw, said Solidarity
spokeswoman Barbara Labuda, but they resumed work after a promise
for talks with management. Government spokesman Jerzy Urban
confirmed the stoppage.
   Alojzy Szablewski, 62, a 36-year veteran of the shipyard who led
a strike at the Lenin shipyard when martial law was imposed in
December 1981, has emerged as the leader of the strike committee.
   ``The nation has to believe somebody. It will believe only
Solidarity,'' Szablewski said in a speech today at the shipyard
gate.
   Walesa ``supports us,'' Szablewski told the strikers. ``We
listen to him and follow his advice.''
   Walesa endorsed the strike when it began Monday. But he stayed
off the local strike committee to coordinate Solidarity activities
nationwide, activists said.
   Strikers slept outside in the shipyard overnight and police
detachments roamed the city, but were not near the shipyard gate.
   When the strike began Monday, police surrounded the shipyard,
and authorities reportedly rounded up regional Solidarity leaders.
   Nevertheless, Solidarity adviser Jack Kuron said management had
agreed to talk today to the shipyard's newly formed strike
committee.
   A spokesman for the shipyard was unavailable today and a
secretary said shipyard director Czeslaw Tolwinski was in a meeting.
   The news of the strike heartened the steelworkers in
southeastern Poland.
   ``We feel better now,'' said Jan Ciesielski, a member of the
steel strike committee at the Lenin steel works in Nowa Huta
outside Krakow.
   A Solidarity communique signed by Walesa and issued late Monday
said, ``A strike wave is covering the country. They are not just
local conflicts. They are across Poland because the cause is the
economic crisis and the lack of convincing reform policies that
would offer prospects for the future.''
   Workers want pay raises of up to 60 percent because prices have
risen about 40 percent this year due to reductions in government
subsidies.
   Kuron said police arrested nine regional representatives on the
13-member Solidarity National Executive Commission. Bogdan Lis, a
Gdansk Solidarity leader, was detained, said Solidarity's chaplain,
the Rev. Henryk Jankowski.
   Poland's latest labor trouble began April 25 with a wildcat
action by transit workers in Bydgoszcz. It was settled the same day
with pay raises of at least 50 percent. Thousands of workers at the
Stalowa Wola heavy machinery plant struck Friday and ended the
action Saturday after promises of higher pay.
   About half the 3,500 workers at the Dolmel electronics plant in
Wroclaw, southwestern Poland, stopped work Monday. Josef Pinior, a
Solidarity leader, said the job action ended when management
promised a raise.

<HEAD>Postmaster General Shakes Up Management, Announces Losses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entering his third month as postmaster
general, Anthony M. Frank today shook up the management of the
Postal Service with a series of personnel shifts.
   Frank named two associate postmasters general, Kenneth J.
Hunter, to supervise technology and operations, and Edward E.
Horgan Jr., to handle international affairs.
   In addition, consumer advocate Ann Robinson's department was
expanded to include supervision of measuring the performance of the
mail service, and Mitchell H. Gordon was placed in charge of
administrative services. He was promoted from marketing and
communications.
   Frank, who had been known as an innovative manager in the
banking business before taking over the postal job, also announced
that he was shifting the Postal Service's planning operations to
report directly to him and separating them from the finance
operation.
   Also at today's meeting of the Postal Service's board of
governors, it was announced that the agency had rejected a
recommendation for lower postage on preprinted return envelopes.
   The independent Postal Rate Commission had recommended cutting
prices for items such as utility bills that are mailed back to post
office boxes. The governors concluded, however, that most of the
savings in such a case is achieved by the use of a post office box
rather than the preprinted envelope and they felt it would be
unfair to offer lower postage to some letters going to post office
boxes but not to all.
   The Postal Service announced that it had suffered a loss of $635
million for the accounting period from Dec. 19 to March 11. The
Postal Service had anticipated a lost of $586 million for that
period. Higher postage rates intended to put the service back in
the black took effect April 3.

   Ousted Moscow Communist Party boss Boris N.
Yelstin today said the Soviet leadership cannot afford to
disappoint the nation in the application of its reform campaign.
   ``This hope must not be deceived, or then it will not be easy to
restore faith to the people, to elevate them to great tasks,''
Yeltsin told the daily Stroitelnaya Gazeta (Construction Newspaper)
in an interview.
   Yeltsin, 57, once considered a protege of Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, was fired as Moscow party chief Nov. 11 after
criticizing the slow pace of reform and the party's style of
leadership at a party meeting.
   One week after his ouster, Yeltsin was named first deputy
chairman of the State Construction Committee, a government job that
carries the rank of minister but that is clearly inferior to the
post of Moscow party boss.
   Stoitelnaya Gazeta sought Yeltsin's comments in connection with
a front-page article on woes in the Soviet contruction industry,
which is having to conform to the same cost-cutting and efficiency
measures as the rest of the economy.
   ``The situation here is serious in effect,'' Yeltsin said.
``Thus cardinal changes in our branch are especially needed.''
   He said Gorbachev's economic and social reform program, known as
``perestroika,'' or reconstruction, had reached a ``decisive
phase.''
   Its success, Yeltsin added, depends on ``the support of the wide
masses of workers who hope for changes for the better in their
lives and link them with perestroika.''
   Yeltsin, who graduated as a construction engineer in 1955 from
the Ural Polytechnical Institute in Sverdlovsk, said the reform
program could bring quick, beneficial changes in construction.
   ``What is reconstruction in a position to give people in the
near future? I think, first of all, an improvement in housing
conditions, growth in the number of up-to-date medical
installations, schools and kindergartens,'' Yelstin said.
   Housing is an acute problem in the Soviet Union, where one
family in five lives in dormitories or communal dwellings. A party
program has called for the construction of enough new housing so
each family will have its own home or apartment by the year 2000.
   Although the article printed in Stoitelnaya Gazeta made no
reference to Yeltsin's stormy political career, he defended the
criticisms he had made at the October meeting of the Central
Committee in an interview published abroad last month.
   ``I spoke in a straightforward manner and said what I felt and
thought was correct,'' Yeltsin said. ``Someone said correctly: each
must think independently so that later not all suddenly see the
light at once.''
   That interview was published in the inaugural edition of a
German-language version of the state-run weekly Moscow News, which
was printed and distributed in West Germany.
   Yeltsin's comments were not reproduced in Moscow News' Russian
editions.

<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot and co-pilot of a race
balloon that floated perilously for hours above a jagged island in
the Gulf of California landed safely today and were declared the
race's winners, officials said.
   Joe Kittinger and Sherry Reed, both of Orlando, Fla., were
declared the unofficial winners of the annual Gordon Bennett
Balloon Race after they touched down at 3:43 a.m. on Angel de la
Guarda island, said race spokeswoman Mildred Brodbeck.
   Their balloon had floated about 365 miles southeast from its
starting point in Palm Springs, Ms. Brodbeck said.
   The pair had declared an emergency shortly after 1 a.m. and
called for assistance when their helium balloon began descending
over the rough, uninhabited island, Ms. Brodbeck said.
   ``They ran out of ballast to throw overboard and began dropping
about 100 feet a minute,'' she said. ``That's a lot.''
   Ballast is made of weights used to control the altitude of such
balloons. When the helium in the craft cools, it contracts and
loses its lift, said Jacques Soukup, an official with the Balloon
Federation of America.
   ``To counteract the sinking, you have to throw ballast, in this
case sand and water, overboard,'' he said.
   A U.S. Coast Guard jet and a U.S. Customs plane spotted the
balloon at about 3 a.m. and stayed nearby in case of a crash
landing. Upon touchdown, the jet dropped supplies including a raft,
food and water, the spokeswoman said.
   The couple were believed to have landed near the beach, but that
was unconfirmed, Ms. Brodbeck said.
   The official winners will be announced Saturday night during a
``Survivor's Banquet'' and will receive a trophy designed by Los
Angeles Times editorial cartoonist Paul Conrad, she said.
   The other six balloons in the race, which left here between 11
p.m. Sunday and 2 a.m. Monday, all landed by Monday afternoon.
   The winning crew is the one whose balloon lands farthest from
the start of the race.
   Restaurateur Rocky Aoki holds the record for the race, which is
named after New York newspaper publisher James Gordon Bennett, who
founded the event in Paris in 1906. Aoki flew 1,346 miles to
Millarton, S.D., in 1981. Fickle winds held last year's winner to
just 49 miles.
   Of the other entrants this year, distances ranged from 247 miles
down to 42.

<TEXT>
   A couple has won $7.5 million in a
malpractice suit against a psychiatrist whose patient killed their
23-year-old daughter.
   Shelly Rotman, daughter of Phyllis and Alfred Rotman, was
fatally stabbed July 17, 1978, by Dennis Gould, who was later found
innocent of a murder charge by reason of insanity.
   Dr. Steven M. Merin had treated Gould during the three years
before the killing when he was medical director of a private
psychiatric hospital.
   Merin called the verdict ``shocking and regrettable'' because he
said he believed he had done ``everything I humanly could do with
the resources available to me to make sure Dennis Gould did not
kill Shelly Rotman.''
   His lawyer, Charles Reidy, said he may appeal.
   Merin said a number of psychiatric hospitals had treated and
discharged Gould between the time he was diagnosed as psychotic in
1973 and the slaying.
   According to testimony, Merin warned Ms. Rotman in a letter in
August 1976 that Gould had talked of harming her. Gould had dated
her for about one year before his breakdown.
   He believed he was a messiah and that he had to kill Ms. Rotman
to save the Jewish people, according to testimony.
   He continuously tried to contact her between 1973 and 1978, but
she did not return his telephone calls and tried to avoid him, said
Paul R. Sugarman, the Rotmans' lawyer.
   Sugarman argued that Merin should have hospitalized Gould while
he had psychotic delusions about Ms. Rotman and that his letter of
warning should have been stronger and more explicit.
   Ms. Rotman was stabbed when she arrived at a Quincy nursing home
where she worked.
   The Rotmans were awarded $4.5 million by a Middlesex Superior
Court jury. Interest payments will add $3 million to the award.
   Gould has been a patient at Bridgewater State Hospital since the
slaying.

<DATELINE>AIN ATA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli tanks pushed to within a few
miles of Syrian troops today, reinforcing heavily armed Israeli
soldiers as they searched for Palestinian guerrillas in the rugged
hills of south Lebanon.
   Syrian forces went on full alert.
   Helicopters flew in about 500 Israeli troops to the northern
edge of Ain Ata in the foothills of Mount Hermon before dawn,
Lebanese police said.
   The troops then fanned out around the area and began their
search.
   Several hours later six Israeli tanks and nine armored personnel
carriers rolled into the village, police said.
   ``It seems the Israelis are reinforcing their positions,'' said
a police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations.
   He said the Syrian command ordered its estimated 16,000 troops
in the Bekaa Valley north of the village on ``maximum alert''
shortly after the Israeli operation started.
   In Ain Ata, Israeli troops distributed leaflets calling on
residents not to cooperate with Palestinian guerrillas. The village
of about 3,500 people has been a stronghold for the guerrillas and
their Lebanese allies.
   Before the helicopter landing, Israeli artillery shelled areas
around Ain Ata and several nearby villages. There were no reports
of casualties.
   The operation occurred north of Israel's self-designated
security zone in south Lebanon. Israel created the zone in 1985
after it withdrew most of its forces, which had occupied Lebanon
since 1982.
   The police spokesman said Israeli troops had not clashed with
the Syrians.
   ``But the Syrians have their tanks dug in on hills overlooking
the Israeli operational zone,'' the spokesman said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir indicated his government
was not seeking a confrontation with Syria. ``I don't think there
is such a danger ...,'' he told Israel radio today.
   He described the operation as part of Israel's ongoing policy of
conducting sweeps in south Lebanon and added: ``It is a usual
action of watching and securing the area from attacks of
terrorists.''
   The operation began Monday night. The Israeli army censor held
up initial reports for hours.
   Acting Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss instructed its
ambassador at the United Nations, Rashid Fakhoury, to lodge a
complaint against the Israeli action.
   ``This new aggression by the (Israeli) occupation forces
violates the U.N. Charter,'' Hoss said.
   An Israeli commander in Lebanon, not identified by name, told
Israel radio he instructed his soldiers that the operation was a
complicated one.
   ``Don't be speedy in pressing the trigger ... but if you do
shoot you mean it seriously and shoot in order to kill.''
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, head of northern command, told Israel
radio the operation sought to ``deliver a message to residents of
the villages outside the security zone that we would not agree to
an increase of hostile activity against the state of Israel.''
   The operation was Israel's largest in Lebanon since Feb. 17,
1986, when more than 1,000 troops and dozens of tanks pushed into
south Lebanon to search for two soldiers captured by Lebanese
guerrillas.
   During that operation, Israeli troops detained more than 100
suspected guerrillas and questioned 3,000 Lebanese civilians. Two
Israeli soldiers and eight Lebanese were killed. The missing
Israelis were not found.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. force in south Lebanon,
said it appeared 1,500 to 2,000 Israeli troops were involved in the
current operation. Israeli sources said fewer than 1,000 soldiers
were taking part.
   Two guerrilla infiltrations into Israel last week brought to 12
the number that have taken place since Nov. 25, when a Palestinian
guerrilla landed a hang glider near an Israel military base and
killed six Israeli soldiers before being shot to death.
   Israeli officials say the increase in cross-border raids is
linked to the five-month Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Goksel said soldiers had rolled into three villages in armored
personnel carriers and a few tanks, ordered residents out of their
homes, then searched village houses. The Israeli newspaper Maariv
quoted an army spokesman as saying bulldozers were brought in to
wreck houses of collaborators.
   Another Lebanese police spokesman said reports from Lebanon's
Arkoub region in the foothills of Mount Hermon indicated Israeli
troops seized at least three suspected guerrillas.
   An Israeli army spokeswoman, who cannot be identified according
to Israeli law, said searches by the armored column were being
concentrated in the Lebanese villages of Kfar Chouba, Chebaa and
Hebbariye, all within three miles of the Israeli border and inside
the 6-to-10-mile wide security zone.
   The area was once known as ``Fatahland'' because Fatah, the
largest Palestine Liberation Organization faction, controlled it
before Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978. The Israelis withdrew about
three months later. They invaded Lebanon again in 1982.

<HEAD>Trust Fund Suggested to Finance Future Flights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House space committee
proposed today that Congress and industry explore setting up a
trust fund to finance future American ventures in space.
   Such a fund, said Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the
House Science, Space and Technology Committee, would work like the
highway trust fund that financed the interstate highway system.
   Roe also said that the NASA budget authorization bill, which a
subcommittee will take up Wednesday, will for the first time
include a multiyear authorization.
   ``It stands to reason that any good and reasonable plan must
have a duration of longer than a year,'' Roe told the American
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics at its annual meeting in
nearby Alexandria, Va. ``We insisted on the absurdity of funding
our plans in one-year cycles.''
   He said that had worked against rational planning because ``you
cannot devise a long-term research and development program, hold a
tactical team together, and keep your facilities and equipment up
to date if your primary concern is what next year's budget is going
to be.''
   Roe said the subcommittee will authorize spending for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal 1989
through fiscal 1991.
   He said there was a great need for innovative space financing
methods.
   ``How about developing a national space trust fund?'' he asked.
``We have built and maintained our country's highway system ...
through the highway trust fund.''
   He said that NASA, which will probably get $10.5 billion to $11
billion for the next fiscal year, needs at least $3 billion more.
He said a national space development bond program could raise the
money.
   ``Would the people of America buy bonds for their space
program?'' he asked. ``I'm sure they will if somebody asks them.''
   Roe said he may hold hearings to explore public and industry
reaction to his suggestion.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf, ``Rose will xxx, to show that Rose must appeal

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reds Manager Pete Rose called his 30-day
banishment from baseball for shoving an umpire ``excessive,'' and
says he'll fight the longest suspension handed a manager in 41
years.
   National League President Bart Giamatti ordered the suspension
Monday, two days after the incident he called ``one of the worst in
baseball's recent memory.''
   During the ninth inning of Saturday night's game, Rose rushed
from the dugout to argue a delayed call by first base umpire Dave
Pallone that allowed the New York Mets to score the winning run in
the 6-5 game.
   Rose said he pushed Pallone twice after the umpire poked him in
the cheek.
   The game was delayed 15 minutes and Pallone was forced to leave
after fans at Riverfront Stadium showered the field with debris.
The game was completed with three umpires.
   Coach Tommy Helms managed the Reds to a 3-2 victory over
Montreal on Monday.
   Rose said he was ``shocked'' by the length of the suspension and
would challenge it. ``While I expected to be suspended, I feel that
this unprecedented 30 days is excessive,'' he said.
   Rose will ask Giamatti to reconsider and will be allowed to
manage the team pending the outcome of the appeal. Giamatti's
decision would be final.
   The suspension was the longest for a manager since Leo Durocher
of the then-Brooklyn Dodgers was suspended the entire 1947 season
for allegedly associating with gamblers.
   Giamatti also said he had summoned two Cincinnati broadcasters,
Marty Brennaman and former Reds pitcher Joe Nuxhall, to New York
for ``inciting the unacceptable behavior of some of the fans'' by
criticizing Pallone for the call.

<HEAD>Dukakis Likely To Notch Two Wins Today, With One For Jackson</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Jackson appearance, turnout reports in top 7
grafs, picking up in 2nd graf pvs, Vice President</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, steadily building his delegate lead over
Democratic presidential rival Jesse Jackson, was heavily favored to
score victories in Ohio and Indiana today while Jackson urged
ministers in the District of Columbia to ``vote with a passion.''
   Considered a certain victor in the nation's capital but given
little chance in Ohio and Indiana, Jackson campaigned in Washington
as the first votes were being cast and then plunged ahead on the
campaign trail, heading for appearances in Atlanta and West
Virginia.
   Early turnout estimates varied.
   In Ohio there were reports of heavier than normal turnout in
black precincts.
   ``They are out for Jesse,'' said Jim Dellick, director of the
Mahoning County board of elections.
   In Washington, where Jackson received two-thirds of the vote in
the 1984 presidential primary, the turnout was described as
moderate.
   Turnout was light in Indiana, where both Republican and
Democratic officials said interest had been affected by the lack of
close races. ``It takes the excitement out of it,'' said Kurt Wise,
press secretary for the Indiana Democratic Party.
   Vice President George Bush, his claim to the GOP nomination
secure, was hammering away at Dukakis as inexperienced on foreign
policy. Dukakis shot back with a swipe at Attorney General Edwin
Meese III and criticism of the Reagan administration for failing to
provide sufficient funding for day care.
   But the Massachusetts governor was also being criticized by
Jackson who called Dukakis a ``Teflon'' candidate not being forced
by the media to spell out the cost of his proposals.
   However, Dukakis held to his refusal to respond directly to
gibes from his Democratic rival.
   ``I'm not just a talker, I'm a doer,'' he said, repeating a line
he has used for months in response to Jackson attacks.
   Dukakis was expected to capture at least 200 of the 254
delegates at stake in Indiana, Ohio and the District of Columbia.
That harvest would place him fewer than 600 delegates shy of the
2,081 needed for the nomination, and about that many ahead of
Jackson.
   Ohio offered the day's biggest prize with 159 Democratic and 88
Republican delegates. At stake in Indiana were 79 Democratic and 30
Republican, while the District of Columbia offered 16 Democratic
and 14 Republican.
   Bush surpassed the 1,139 delegates needed for a GOP convention
majority last week in Pennsylvania and was celebrating his victory
at an ``Over the Top'' rally in a Washington hotel tonight.
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said President Reagan would
formally endorse the vice president ``in the next couple of
weeks.'' Reagan stayed neutral while there was still a contest for
the GOP nomination.
   Asked if the Bush attacks on Dukakis represented a pattern for
the coming months, Atwater said, ``That's not the thrust of his
campaign. But he's not going to shy away from talking about that
kind of thing either. ... You are going to see him running an
aggressive campaign.''
   Campaigning in Ohio on Monday, Bush responded sharply to
Dukakis' criticism of administration policies in Central America
and his charge that the U.S. was paying Panamanian strongman Manuel
Noriega $200,000 a year.
   ``I can't wait for Mr. Dukakis to discuss the Noriega matter,''
Bush replied. ``And I'd say, `What would you do about it?' It's
fine sitting out there. You see, you can make a lot of unfounded
criticism. But what's his suggestion? What's he going to do, and do
it in a way that handles the delicate Central American
relationships that we're building?
   ``We're moving towards democracy. Ninety percent are now living
under democracy in this hemisphere. We don't want to set that back
by some kind of macho statement out of Harvard,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis also was in Ohio and spent part of his day visiting a
day care center at an inner-city high school as part of an attempt
to court more black support. He also told reporters he had no
intention of criticizing Jackson, whose black supporters will be
essential to any Democrat's chance of success in the fall.
   But he had no such hesitancy toward the Republicans.
   ``We want an attorney general that you and I can be proud of,
not ashamed of,'' he said, in a reference to Meese.
   He also said that in his administration, ``There won't be any
Robert Borks nominated to the Supreme Court.''
   He added, ``We can't have two and a half million people without
a home in this country and young families who can't afford a
home,'' he said. ``That's not the American dream.''
   Jackson, in a luncheon speech to the City Club in Cleveland,
called for a substantial increase in the minimum wage and for a
corporate code of conduct to press companies benefiting from
federal help to invest in America and not take jobs outside the
country.
   Jackson said he would raise the minimum wage of $3.35 an hour to
half the average hourly wage of production workers, which is $9.19.
   Jackson's staff said he gradually would increase the wage
standard to $5.50 an hour by 1993.
   The Democratic candidate also complained he was being held to a
different standard by the media than was Dukakis.
   ``So far the media is allowing him to have Teflon,'' Jackson
said, a reference to a situation in which opponents' criticism
slides right off.
   ``In time, that will change,'' Jackson said. ``The media
challenged me to show how I would pay for my dreams. I have done
just that.''

<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The third convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti
tankers in five days headed up the Persian Gulf today as the U.S.
Navy tried to make up for time lost to a mine threat and fighting
with Iranian forces.
   The convoy got under way as Adm. William H. Crowe Jr., chairman
of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived in the gulf to inspect
Navy operations and confer with Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less,
commander of the Joint Task Force Middle East, and other senior
officers.
   Crowe was expected to meet with top officials of Arab
governments in the gulf to outline the latest change in U.S. policy
that will permit American warships to respond to requests for help
from non-U.S. flag vessels under attack by the Iranians.
   Shipping industry and government officials in general have
reacted favorably to the change in the U.S. ``rules of engagement.''
   These had previously restricted commanders to protecting only
American-flagged ships and giving only ``humanitarian aid'' to
others if requested.
   The latest convoy was confirmed by a U.S. military spokesman
hours after shipping executives reported it sailing through the
Strait of Hormuz into the gulf for Kuwait.
   It included the 294,739-ton Townsend and the 81,283-ton Sea Isle
City, both oil products tankers, escorted by the destroyer USS
Merrill and the guided missile frigate USS John H. Sides.
   The convoy was the 28th this year and the 50th since the United
States agreed last summer to reflag and escort 11 Kuwait-owned
tankers to protect them from Iranian attack.
   The tankers' scheduled movement had been disrupted after the
missile frigate, USS Samuel B. Roberts, was severely damaged by a
mine in the central gulf April 14.
   The United States retaliated four days later by destroying two
Iranian oil platforms and sinking or disabling six armed vessels in
day-long fighting.
   The United States accused Iran of laying mines, including the
one that nearly sank the Roberts and wounded 10 crewmen.
   The convoys resumed after American and European minesweepers
found and destroyed several more mines in international shipping
lanes.
   Although U.S. officials in Washington denied there was any
postponement, six of the 11 tankers were backed up in the convoy
staging area in the Gulf of Oman, outside the gulf.
   Three of those, the Gas Queen, Chesapeake City and Surf City,
reached Kuwait on Friday, the first convoy to make the 550-mile
trip up the gulf since the U.S.-Iran clashes.
   The Merrill and the John H. Sides escorted a second convoy out
of the gulf Monday. It comprised one Kuwaiti tanker, the 46,723-ton
gas carrier Gas King, the U.S. Navy-chartered freighter Rover and
the Golden Monarch, a privately owned U.S. tanker.
   The Sea Isle City was making its first return trip to the gulf
since it was knocked out of service last Oct. 16 by an Iranian
missile.
   The tanker was waiting to load at Kuwait's main terminal when a
Chinese-made Silkworm missile hit the bridge and crew's quarters,
severely wounding the American captain and 17 others.
   The Sea Isle City left the gulf March 11 after nearly five
months in a repair yard.

   The federal arts agency today recommended that
high schools require students to complete two years of arts
instruction to help keep American children from growing up
``culturally illiterate.''
   A report by the National Endowment for the Arts on the state of
arts education in the United States set a national goal of making
the arts an integral part of the school curriculum from
kindergarten through the 12th grade.
   ``The problem is, basic arts education does not exist in the
United States today,'' said the endowment, an independent federal
agency which underwrites a wide variety of artistic projects with a
budget of $167 million.
   ``The arts are in triple jeopardy,'' the endowment said in a
report requested by Congress in 1985. ``They are not viewed as
serious, knowledge itself is not viewed as a prime educational
objective, and those who determine school curricula do not agree on
what arts education is.''
   The endowment prescribed a series of steps, including stiffer
curriculum requirements, teacher training, testing and evaluation,
to provide all students _ not just the gifted and talented _ with a
thorough education in their artistic heritage.
   ``Without knowledge and understanding of such supreme
achievements, we are culturally illiterate,'' the report said.
   Endowment chairman Frank Hodsoll said he will lead a series of
regional meetings with state and local arts and education officials
around the country to ``make a case for the study of the arts.''
The first, starting next Monday in St. Louis, will include
officials from Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and
Texas.
   Hodsoll acknowledged at a news conference that his emphasis on
arts education ``will be a problem in some school districts'' that
favor equipping students to compete in science and technology. But
he reminded questioners that the arts are part of the basic school
curriculum in high-tech Japan.
   Study of the arts, he said, ``helps us to be masters, not
servants, of technology.''
   The endowment suggested doubling Education Secretary William J.
Bennett's proposal last December for one year of art and music
history as graduation requirements under his model high school
curriculum.
   Instead, the endowment proposed requiring two years of art
courses, or other approved courses that incorporate the arts, to
obtain a high school diploma, and said high schools might consider
extending the class day to seven periods to accommodate the new
requirements.
   High schools also should offer optional courses in each of the
arts, such as dance, theater or films, for talented students who
wish to pursue their interests beyond the required courses, the
report said.
   Currently, the endowment said, high school graduation
requirements in 29 states include some form of the arts, but 13 of
those states allow such courses as homemaking or industrial arts as
substitutes and only nine require arts courses specifically.
   The endowment said junior high schools _ grades 6 through 8 _
should require all students to take arts instruction for at least
15 percent of the school year, with specific emphasis on the
often-neglected areas of design and media arts such as television
and movies.
   For elementary schools, it recommended a ``fairly minimal''
guideline of 4{ hours of arts instruction in a 30-hour school week.
   The endowment urged the states to stiffen their credentials
requirements for arts teachers, and consider using qualified
professional artists to help fill the ranks where there are
shortages of arts teachers.
   Noting that only 6 percent of school districts require
competency tests in the arts for promoting pupils to the next
grade, the endowment said that until testing and evaluation of arts
instruction is improved, ``arts courses will continue to be
considered extra-curricular and unimportant.''
   The report concluded that ``the artistic heritage that is ours,
and the opportunities to contribute significantly to its evolution,
is being lost to our young people.''
   It cited a survey conducted three years ago which found that 61
percent of American adults had not attended a live cultural
performance or visited an art gallery or museum in the previous
year.
   ``The cultural heritage and most contemporary expression outside
the popular culture of the moment is not part of the lives of most
Americans,'' the endowment said, but added: ``There is evidence
that arts education can make a difference.''

   The final episode of the CBS detective show
``Magnum P.I.'' smashed the competition in the national ratings for
its special two-hour time slot on Sunday, network officials said
today.
   Super sleuth Thomas Magnum, played by Tom Selleck, captured a 32
percent national rating and 48 percent share of television viewers
during the 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. EDT period, according to spokesmen at
ABC, NBC, and CBS.
   ABC's initial installment of the two-part drama ``The Richest
Man in the World _ The Story of Aristotle Onassis,'' starring Raul
Julia, came in a distant second, garnering a 12.1 percent rating
and 18 percent share.
   NBC's ``Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,'' with Mel Gibson and Tina
Turner, trailed the group with a 9.2 percent rating and 14 percent
share.
   Magnum ended its eight-year, 162-episode run with a two-hour
special called ``Resolutions,'' in which the crime-fighting
Hawaiian detective rejoins the Navy and discovers his
half-Vietnamese daughter is alive.
   Loose ends were also tied up for Magnum cohorts T.C. (Roger
Mosley) who was reunited with his ex-wife and Rick (Larry Manetti),
who in the final scene is about to marry a former prostitute.
   The question of whether Jonathan Higgins (John Hillerman) was
really millionaire Robin Masters remained unanswered. Throughout
the series Higgins ran Masters' estate while Magnum lived there as
the security guard, but Masters was never seen.
   Higgins, at one point, admits to a badgering Magnum that he is
the reclusive novelist, but later says he lied.
   The popular but ailing show ended the television season in 40th
place out of 106 entries.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A guerrilla-imposed road
transport ban, the third this year, drastically curtailed traffic
nationwide today.
   Not a single city bus was seen circulating downtown in a
rush-hour tour of the capital San Salvador. Buses are by far the
most important mode of public transport in El Salvador.
   Circulation of privately owned cars was a fraction of that on a
normal day.
   Thousands of workers left home early and walked, often several
miles, to their jobs. Many owners of vans and pickups converted
them to public transports, charging 40 cents, about six times the
average bus fare.
   Virtually all of the pickups and vans were overcrowded. During
the previous transport ban in March, the overcrowding caused
several accidents that killed at least one person and injured
several others.
   Leftist guerrillas waging an 8-year-old war against the
U.S.-backed government called the indefinite ban in response to
what they say is an increase in repression by police and the armed
forces.
   No time limit was put on the measure, although previous bans
have lasted two or three days. The guerrillas enforce the ban by
firing on or burning buses, trucks and private cars.
   On their clandestine Radio Venceremos, they warn drivers that
guerrillas and their supporters will be taking down license plate
numbers and that retaliation could come at any time in the future.
   Dispatchers at the capital's two main intercity bus terminals
said no buses had arrived from or left for provincial cities.
   Gen. Adolfo Blandon, chief of the joint chiefs of staff, said
Monday night that all leaves for members of the 56,000-strong armed
forces had been canceled to provide security along the nation's
roads and highways.
   In previous strikes, the army has put its trucks into service as
public transport. A few were seen on city streets this morning, but
not as many as in previous bans.

<HEAD>Homosexuals Primary Victims of Prisoners' Postal Money Order Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARCHMAN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Men who answered ads in homosexual
magazines were the primary victims of a $330,000 postal money order
scam run by seven current and former Mississippi state penitentiary
inmates, officials said.
   The inmates and four other people, including several relatives
of the prisoners, have been charged by the federal government in
the scam.
   The April 22 indictments resulted from a probe by Baltimore
postal inspectors that began in 1986. The scheme, officials said,
involved the changing of 800 U.S. Postal money orders between
September 1986 and last month.
   Mississippi inmates using similar scams have cleared $5 million
over the past six years, officials estimate, and the schemes have
spread to other state prisons in Los Angeles, Indianapolis and
Michigan City, Ind. There have been 35 convictions connected with
the scams.
   According to the recent indictments, inmates wrote to those who
had either placed or responded to personal advertisements in
magazines. Inmates used fake names and claimed to be in prison on
minor charges, such as drunken driving.
   Two inmates would then call the individuals who responded and
pose as the inmate's case worker, social worker or lawyer.
Eventually, victims were asked to cash money orders from the ``case
worker'' and send the money to a third party.
   The non-inmates involved in the scheme would buy money orders
for between $1 and $5, then deliver them to the inmates, who would
alter the value to amounts up to $700.
   The people who received the money orders never knew they had
been altered, officials said. They would cash them for the altered
amounts and mail the money; the non-inmates involved would then
forward it to the inmates.
   Of more than 25 victims caught in the scheme by inmates,
Baltimore postal inspector J.R. Argubright said, ``the majority of
victims were from homosexual-oriented magazines.''
   For the last three years, the Mississippi State Penitentiary at
Parchman has stamped all prisoners' letters with the warning that
recipients should not cash any money orders enclosed, state
corrections department Ken Jones said.
   However, prisoners circumvent this precaution by sending letters
to co-conspirators outside prison, who mail them in other envelopes.

   A man convicted for a second time in the
1973 murders of six members of a family faced a possible death
sentence as the sentencing phase of his trial began today.
   A Dekalb County Superior Court jury on Monday found Wayne Carl
Coleman guilty in the slayings of Ned Alday, his brother, Aubrey,
Ned's sons Jimmy, Jerry and Chester, and Jerry's wife, Mary.
   The sentencing phase of Coleman's trial opened today with
testimony by police officials who investigated a Maryland slaying
allegedly committed by Coleman and his co-defendants.
   Defense attorneys said they plan to call Coleman's mother and
sister to testify about mitigating circumstances in his early life.
The slayings took place May 14, 1973; Coleman's original conviction
was overturned on appeal.
   When the verdict was announced, Coleman, standing with his hands
in his pockets, shifted his weight from one leg to another, but
otherwise showed no reaction.
   Prosecuting attorney Charles Ferguson has said he will seek the
death penalty.
   West expressed disappointment at the verdict, but said there was
a good chance Coleman, 41, could receive a life sentence because
the jury took about 3{ hours to reach a verdict.
   ``They're taking this very carefully. One of the jurors was
crying ... the jury seems to be sympathetic to Wayne,'' West said.
   Coleman, his half-brother Carl Isaacs and a third man, George
Dungee, were convicted and sentenced to death in 1974 for the
slayings.
   The victims had interrupted a burglary at Jerry Alday's trailer
in the southwest Georgia town of Donalsonville. The five Alday men
were shot to death one by one at the trailer and Mary Alday was
killed in a nearby field after being raped repeatedly, according to
testimony.
   A federal appeals court ordered new trials in 1985, ruling that
excessive publicity made it impossible for the three to get fair
trials in Seminole County, site of the murders and first trial.
   Isaacs was convicted of murder and again sentenced to death at
his retrial in Perry in January. Dungee is to be tried later this
year in Columbus.
   Coleman did not testify at his trial. Psychologist Howard
Albrecht said Coleman was a ``depressed, passive individual, with
few leadership capabilities'' and would suffer a severe anxiety
attack if called to testify.
   In closing arguments, West portrayed Coleman as a passive,
dimwitted accomplice of clever murderers.
   He also attacked the testimony of Billy Isaacs, Carl Isaacs'
brother, who turned state's evidence in the original trial and
testified against Coleman last week.
   Billy Isaacs was 15 at the time of the killings and received a
40-year sentence.
   Defense attorneys called Carl Isaacs to the stand Monday, but he
refused to testify.

   Mayor Eugene Sawyer has accepted an apology from
an aide accused of making slurs against Jews and Christians, but
the mayor later said the apology might not be sufficient.
   ``In this administration, with this mayor, we will not tolerate
any individual who has views of this type,'' Sawyer said Monday
night at a reception given by a Jewish group.
   ``We are reviewing the situation, and we will have something to
say about it in the near future,'' Sawyer added.
   His remarks came at the end of a day of demands that he fire the
aide, Steve Cokely, for remarks in four lectures before the
Chicago-based Nation of Islam between August 1985 and November 1987.
   In the lectures, taped and later sold at the Nation's bookstore,
Cokely, who is black, variously contended that Jews are conspiring
to gain world control and that the crucifix is a symbol of white
supremacy.
   ``I humbly apologize to Chicago residents of all races and
religious groups who were offended by remarks made prior to my
ascension to the mayor's office,'' Cokely, 35, said Monday in a
signed apology.
   At the time of the lectures, Cokely was an aide to then-alderman
Sawyer, who became mayor after the Nov. 25 death of Mayor Harold
Washington.
   ``I have, since working in the mayor's office, respected all
those I have had the privilege to serve,'' said Cokely, who makes
$35,000 a year.
   Sawyer said Monday night that Cokely's apology ``might not be
sufficient.'' He made that comment at a downtown reception for 300
people celebrating the 40th anniversary of the state of Israel.
   Sawyer had answered questions about Cokely earlier in the day by
saying: ``I don't think it's necessary to fire him. He's got a wife
and family. He needs the income, so I've asked him to tone down his
rhetoric.''
   A telephone call to Cokely at his City Hall office Monday was
not returned.
   A guest at Monday night's reception, State Sen. Howard Carroll
of Chicago, said an apology is not enough.
   ``It wasn't an accidental speech made in the heat of the
moment,'' Carroll said of Cokely's remarks.
   Alderman Bernard L. Stone called for Cokely's ouster, and
Alderman Edwin Eisendrath said the City Council would take up the
matter next week if the mayor fails to act.
   Eisendrath said he had drafted a resolution asking that Cokely
be fired if Sawyer has not already done so by the next regularly
scheduled City Council meeting, on May 11.
   ``I'm shocked that he hasn't already been told to pack his
bags,'' Eisendrath said.
   Groups denouncing Cokely's remarks and demanding that he be
removed included the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith; the
American Jewish Committee; the Community Renewal Society, an urban
mission agency; and the Illinois Ethnic Consultation, which
describes itself as the Midwest's oldest coalition of white, black,
Hispanic and Asian groups.

   Doctors at a Soweto hospital
today surgically separated 17-month-old twin girls joined at the
head since birth.
   A 40-person medical team began the operation on Mpho and
Mphonyana Mathibela early today and completed the surgery 7{ hours
later.
   Baragwanath Hospital reported late this afternoon that both
girls survived the operation and described it as ``successful.'' No
other details were available immediately.
   About four hours into the surgery, hospital officials described
the black girls as stable and said doctors were ``very happy with
progress so far.''
   Last September, doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore
separated West German twins joined at the head. The boys, Benjamin
and Patrick Binder, survived and were released in March, but they
reportedly are suffering physical and mental problems.
   The Baragwanath medical team, headed by Dr. Robert Lipschitz,
performed two operations on the black girls last October to prepare
for today's surgery.
   The girls share a major blood vessel in their heads, which
doctors partially clamped in the earlier operations in hopes lesser
blood vessels would take over the functions of the shared vein.
   ``This is going to be a long, lengthy, intricate operation which
carries many dangers with it,'' Lipschitz said last week of today's
surgery. ``The prognosis is still very grave.''
   Sophie Mathibela, the girls' mother, attended a prayer service
at the hospital chapel this morning. About 100 people, mostly
nurses and patients, said prayers and sang hymns for the girls.
   Ms. Mathibela, a 33-year-old domestic worker who earns about $60
a month, gave birth to the twins Dec. 7, 1986.
   She said initially she was so horrified that she refused to see
the girls for three days.
   ``Once persuaded to see them, I immediately accepted and loved
my little gifts from God,'' Ms. Mathibela said.
   The girls have a combined weight of 33 pounds. Mpho appears to
be developing normally and recently began to speak, while Mphonyana
is slightly smaller and does not appear to be as advanced, said
officials at Baragwanath, the main hospital in the black township
of Soweto outside Johannesburg.
   Ms. Mathibela was asked to make a $5 contribution for her
daughters' care, which is expected to cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars. The costs are being covered by the hospital and the
University of the Witwatersrand medical school.
   The Sowetan, a daily newspaper, has set up a trust fund for the
twins that has raised $26,000.

<HEAD>State Officials Say Bookmark Lottery Ticket Was Foregery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer expert who worked for a
company that helps operate the Pennsylvania state lottery printed a
fake ticket so that he and a friend could share a $15.2 million
jackpot, state officials said today.
   Henry Rich used a computer at his firm, Control Data Corp., to
print a copy of the winning ticket, then gave it to Mark S. Herbst,
state Attorney General LeRoy S. Zimmerman said at a news conference
today.
   The ticket listed the winning numbers for the Super 7 lottery
drawing last July 15. One winning ticket to that jackpot was sold
statewide, but the winner had never claimed the prize.
   When he came forward last week Herbst claimed he had kept the
ticket in a cigar box, then used it as a bookmark until recent
stories about the unclaimed prize led him to double-check the
numbers.
   Herbst cashed the ticket last Thursday and received a $469,989
check for the first installment. State officials quickly detected
the attempted fraud, however, and the money was never paid,
Zimmerman said.
   Rich, a computer expert at Control Data, which works with the
state lottery, has been charged with theft by unlawful taking,
theft by deception, conspiracy, forgery, tampering with public
information and unlawful use of a computer, Zimmerman said. Rich is
being held in Dauphin County Prison.
   Zimmerman said Herbst was in custody this morning and would be
charged later in the day.
   James Scroggins, executive director of the lottery, said the
forgery was traced because Herbst's ticket was printed on paper
that was returned to the state by a lottery-ticket agent in
Scranton, while computer records showed the unclaimed winning
ticket was actually sold in Bucks County.
   Scroggins admitted that some lottery officials had doubts about
the validity of the ticket, but he said he decided to award the
prize anyway because the computer validation code on the bogus
ticket was accurate.
   By 4:30 p.m. Thursday, Zimmerman said lottery officials knew the
ticket was fake and stopped payment on the check, which Herbst had
deposited in several accounts at a local bank.
   Agents from Zimmerman's office confronted Herbst on Sunday.
Zimmerman said Herbst told the agents Rich was expecting $5,000
from him Monday.
   On Monday night, Zimmerman said, Herbst gave Rich $5,000
provided by the state. Rich, who was armed, tried to flee when
agents moved in, but he was captured without incident, the
prosecutor said.
   This is the second fixing case to plague the Pennsylvania
Lottery. The April 24, 1980 drawing of the Daily Number was fixed
by altering pingpong balls used to pick the winning digits.
   The so-called 6-6-6 case, named after the winning numbers, also
resulted in tighter security procedures for the televised drawings.
Scroggins said new procedures would also be implemented because of
the new case.

<TEXT>
   Pauline Shaw says her body is so full of
electricity that she knocks out ordinary household appliances with
a mere touch.
   She says she is one of about 40 people in Britain who are
similarly afflicted, and the experts are baffled.
   The Sun newspaper, which interviewed the 46-year-old housewife,
calculated that she has wrecked 25 household irons, 18 toasters, 15
kettles, 6 tumble dryers, 10 washing machines, 12 television
receivers, 12 radios, 3 videos and at least 250 lightbulbs.
   The total damage, the Sun calculated, is about $13,000. Mrs.
Shaw says she doesn't bother to count anymore.
   ``I don't touch the video or the microwave,'' she said in a
telephone interview Tuesday from her home in Manchester. ``I cook
only with gas.''
   She said she lost her job at the counter of a drycleaning store
``because I was making the tills go haywire.''
   She said she once knocked out her bank's computer by leaning on
a terminal.
   Mrs. Shaw said she has suffered from body electricity since
childhood, but it worsened in 1982. ``It's not a party trick,
something I do at will. It comes suddenly, by itself. You can get
quite a sharp shock shaking my hand.''
   Doctors who have examined her think it may be caused by an
allergy or stress, ``but I'm not a tense person. I'm a noisy,
sense-of-humor kind of person,'' she said.
   Mrs. Shaw, a bus-driver's wife with three children, said the
only solution she has come up with is to shower three times a day.
``It washes the electricity off the skin,'' she said.

   The Soviet Union has offered to help

   Moscow's proposal came in talks Monday between David Charles,
secretry of industry, commerce and technology; and Victor Dukov,
vice president of the Soviet space agency, Glavkosmos, according to
the officials.
   Bruce Middleton, executive director of the Australian space
office, expressed keen interest in the Soviet offer. He said it
could lead to an Australian-trained astronaut on board a Soviet
spacecraft in the mid-1990s.
   A government statement said the talks also focused on possible
Soviet involvement in a proposed rocket-launching project in the
Cape York Peninsula in the northeast.
   More talks on the proposal were expected later this month in the

earns enough as a teacher, an award spokesman said Tuesday.
   Alexander Grothendieck wrote to the committee for the
prestigious Swedish Craaford Prize to reject the prize.
   ``We were aware he had opinions ... but the letter did come as a
bit of a surprise,'' said Tord Ganelius of the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize.
   ``It was a very polite letter, with beautiful French ways of
expression. He said he did well on his professor's salary and that
others get less if one single person gets more,'' said Ganelius.
``This kind of beautiful idealism is rare.''
   The committee announced April 13 that the German-born
Grothendieck of the Southern University of Science and Technology
in Montpellier would share the prize with Pierre Deligne, of the
Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, N.J. They were cited for
fundamental research in algebraic geometry, which has practical
applications in satellite communications and other fields.
   Ganelius said Deligne was expected to attend the prize ceremony
in Stockholm Sept. 21 to collect his half of the prize. The other
half will be returned to the prize fund.

   Jaromir Savrda, a Czechoslovak human
rights activist and writer, has died, emigre sources in Vienna said
Tuesday. He was 54.
   Savrda died at home Monday of heart disease, said the sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Savrda signed the Charter 77 manifesto, the basis of the
independent human rights monitoring group of the same name. He also
was active in citizens' rights activities and a member of a banned
Czechoslovak-U.S. Friendship Society founded last year.
   Despite his heart condition, he was imprisoned several times for
his activities, the sources said.
   He was the author of several books of prose and poetry, but was
prohibited from working as a journalist after the August 1968
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague
Spring reforms of Alexander Dubcek.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Laos began a
search Tuesday for remains of two U.S. soldiers shot down 22 years
ago on a reconnaissance mission in a remote area of Laos, a U.S.
military spokesman said.
   A 14-member U.S. military team flew from Bangkok on two C-130
transport planes to meet a group of Laotian officials at the crash
site in Savannakhet province of southern Laos, said Maj. Tim
Pfister, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command.
   The two aircraft carried electric generators, metal detectors
and tools to excavate the site where the Mohawk OV-1A airplane
crashed.
   The joint search is the third in a U.S. effort to account for
about 2,400 Americans who did not return from the Indochina war.
The wars in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia ended in 1975 with victories
of communist forces, but some Americans lost in the early 1960s
were listed as missing in action.
   A preliminary ground search involving U.S. military experts last
week failed to locate any human remains at the site in southern
Laos.
   The American team, which includes an expert in identifying human
remains and two explosive disposal specialists, will live in tents
during the week-long search, Pfister said.
   The team is from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and
the Army Central Identification Laboratory. The Honolulu-based
agencies are working to resolve the fates of Amerians missing in
action in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
   The U.S. Defense Department lists 555 MIAs in Laos, mostly
pilots who went down on missions over the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the
vital communist supply line which funneled men and material from
North Vietnam to South Vietnam.
   Pfister said the Laotian and U.S. teams hope to discover the
fates of two soldiers reported missing after heavy ground fire
struck their airplane on March 15, 1966.
   Another U.S. aircraft on the same mission reported that one
crewman parachuted out but landed near where the plane crashed, 95
miles east of Savannakhet City and 25 miles west of the main
section of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
   Serial numbers found on wreckage last week were confirmed by the
aircraft manufacturer, the Grumman Corp., as belonging to an OV-1A
Mohawk. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said famlies of the two crewmen
have been notified, but the names of the MIAs have not been
publicly released.
   The remains of 11 Americans were recovered in the first joint
excavation in Laos in 1985 and eight other sets of remains were
found in 1986.
   On previous excavations, the workers went down on hands and
knees, using small shovels and other hand tools to dig out plane
wreckage and fine metal screens to sift for bone fragments. A
number of unexploded shells were found, prompting the addition of
explosives experts to the new team.
   U.S. experts say chances of uncovering remains grow smaller with
the passage of time in the harsh tropical climate. They say looting
by local people also takes a toll.

<HEAD>Student's Analysis Finds School Lunches Lacking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHAWNEE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A skeptical eighth-grader analyzed her
school lunches for nutritional value and says the meals did not
make the grade.
   Thirteen-year-old Lauren Pratt has been carrying her own lunch
to school for some time, taking salads, fruits, vegetables, an
occasional sandwich, and ``is big on raisins,'' her mother, Megan
Pratt, said today.
   ``I was always skeptical of school lunches,'' said Lauren Pratt,
a Shawnee Junior High student who won state recognition for her
experiments.
   ``They tell you they are nutritional, and I suppose they are
from the standpoint of the basic food groups, but it seemed to me
that there was an awful lot of fried food and salt. If everything
is fried, then the food group balance doesn't matter that much,''
Miss Pratt said.
   Miss Pratt recently froze five school lunches and extracted or
calculated their fats, proteins, sodium, cholesterol and
carbohydrates using equipment at the Oklahoma Food Laboratory in
Oklahoma City, 30 miles west of here.
   She did the analysis as a project for the Oklahoma Science and
Engineering Fair. Her effort was recognized by the Oklahoma Section
of the American Chemical Society as a first-place project in the
junior high division.
   ``The meals were high in sodium, calories and cholesterol,''
Miss Pratt said. ``They do have a high level of protein as well,
but it's unhealthy to go through school eating that kind of diet.''
   ``Eating habits that are formed in early childhood have been
found to be extremely resistant to change and seem to affect
individuals the rest of their lives,'' the teen-ager said.
   State officials said students wouldn't eat more nutritious fare
when it was offered and often threw the food in the trash.
   ``If the schools are to change, we'll have also have to change
the likes and dislikes coming into the cafeteria,'' said Tom
Freeman, assistant superintendant and director of child nutrition
programs for the state Department of Education.
   ``The days of liver and spinach are past,'' Freeman said.

<DATELINE>CALUMET CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two police officers of this Chicago
suburb have accepted suspensions for failing to act promptly in the
rape ordeal last year of a 12-year-old girl.
   On Dec. 20, police waited for nearly 30 minutes outside an
apartment before rescuing the girl from a rapist despite repeated
pleas from the victim's mother to break down the door.
   Calumet City's Police and Fire Commission voted 2-1 Monday night
to find Officers Daniel Surufka and Kevin Beasley guilty of
violating department rules. The commission voted to drop three
other misconduct charges against each man.
   Lawyers for the officers had presented the negotiated settlement
to the three-member board.
   Surufka, 27, will be suspended without pay for 21 days, while
Beasley, 38, will be suspended for 15 days without pay.
   ``I wouldn't exactly say I'm bitter. I'd just say I'm a little
disappointed in the system I work for,'' Beasley said.
   But City Prosecutor Howard Rosenfeld called the officers'
punishment ``appropriate.''
   The agreement came three weeks after the commission found
Officer James Horka, the senior officer outside the apartment,
guilty of five misconduct charges and voted 2-1 to fire him.
   Rather than kick down the doors of the apartment, Horka waited
for the landlord to arrive with a key. He testified at his hearing
that he feared the rapist might kill the girl if he heard police
breaking in.
   A fourth officer, Peter Miller, did enter the apartment through
an unlocked back door, however, and rescued the girl as she was
being raped.
   Horka is appealing his dismissal in the Cook County Circuit
Court.

   A woman who says she had an affair with Cook
County Board President George Dunne has denied that she got her
county job because of the relationship.
   The Better Government Association, a private watchdog group, has
demanded that Dunne, board president for 19 years and Cook County
Democratic Party chairman, resign for giving county government jobs
or preferential job treatment to women who agreed to sexual trysts.
   But Marie Perkins, 35, said Monday she apologized to Dunne for
bringing the affair to the association's attention.
   ``If anyone should resign from a job, it is me,'' said Perkins,
a police officer with the Forest Preserve District. She said she
got her job ``not through sex but through proper channels.''
   The BGA contends that Dunne, a 75-year-old widower, engaged in
sex with four women between 1980 _ the year his wife died _ and
1986.
   Dunne has said he is guilty of nothing more than ``extremely
poor judgment'' and ``having relationships with the opposite sex,
which hurt no one.''
   Leading Democrats have rallied behind the veteran politician and
members of the Cook County Board gave him a hero's welcome Monday.
   Illinois House Speaker Michael J. Madigan and Senate President
Philip J. Rock were among office-holders saying Dunne should remain
at the helm of the county's Democratic Party organization.
   But not all of his colleagues agreed the matter should be
dropped.
   ``When you have such allegations, I think its the duty of the
state's attorney and the U.S. attorney to investigate,'' said
county board member Richard A. Siebel.

   The Boeing 747 that landed outside Tokyo with
only one engine operating had run out of fuel for the other three,
aviation sources in and out of the U.S. government said today.
   The sources, who asked not to be identified, said that the tanks
supplying fuel to the three dead engines were found to be dry when
the plane landed.
   The fourth tank had about 20,000 pounds of fuel remaining and
was in no imminent danger of also going day.
   It was not known whether the fuel problem had been caused by a
pilot error or by a mechanical problem with the plane's
fuel-switching equipment. On a Boeing 747, fuel is routinely
transferred from tank to tank during a long flight to balance the
aircraft.
   One source said it is possible that a fuel line or filter could
have kept the fuel from being shifted properly or the flight crew
by mistake might have shifted too much fuel into the fourth tank
and not been able to shift it back in time.
   The Boeing jumbo jet has a variety of gauges to tell the flight
crew how much fuel has been burned and how much is left. The flight
engineer in the three-person cockpit normally performs his own
calculations as to fuel burn and availability as well.
   ``Either one of two things happened. Either the crew messed up
or the transfer pumps or valves or lines were not working
properly,'' said the source.
   A Boeing 747 has a maximum fuel capacity of 320,000 pounds and
burns about 23,500 pounds of fuel per hour while cruising with all
four engines operating, according to the manufacturer.
   The plane, United Airlines flight 97 from Los Angeles to Tokyo
with 239 passengers and 19 crew members aboard, first lost the use
of one engine at 39,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean about 75
minutes from the airport. A second engine failed about 30 minutes
later.
   Pilot Jack Harper radioed the control tower at 2:49 p.m. that he
had shut down two of the four engines due to malfunctions and asked
permission to land. A third engine failed shortly before landing.
The plane touched down safely at the airport in Narita, 40 miles
northeast of Tokyo.
   The Washington Post reported the fuel starvation problem in
today's editions.
   A Tokyo newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, said that during the flight,
the gauge that indicates how much fuel is feeding into the engines
showed there was almost no fuel going into engines one and four and
that the No. 3 engine was malfunctioning.

<HEAD>New US Gulf Protection Policy Now In Effect</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf-US</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's new policy of
extending naval protection to neutral ships in the Persian Gulf has
been formally implemented, the Pentagon said today.
   Under the new policy announced last Friday, U.S. warships in the
gulf may come to the aid of any neutral, friendly commercial ship
not serving ports in Iran or Iraq if the ship comes under attack in
international waters.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said last Friday the new
policy would be implemented ``once we have informed those free
world, non-belligerent countries that maintain shipping interests
in the gulf.''
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said ``the
appropriate people have been notified'' and the new policy was now
``in effect.''
   Howard said the policy applied equally to both Iran and Iraq
when it came to breaking up attacks on merchant ships.
   ``If it meets the criteria ... then the rules are the same for
whoever the attacker might be,'' Howard said.
   The spokesman noted, however, the United States did not expect
any confrontations with Iraqi forces because that country has
limited its attacks to ships steaming inside certain declared
exclusion or war zones.
   ``The pattern is pretty clear,'' said Howard. ``The exceptions,
the attacks have been for the most part by Iran outside the
exclusion zone.
   ``We are prepared, under certain circumstances, to offer
assistance to ... non-belligerent vessels serving neutral ports
that are attacked by anyone outside the exclusion zones.''

   East Berlin Jews said today a Chicago rabbi had
been chosen to head their community on an interim basis, but the
rabbi said he had yet to receive an invitation and didn't know
whether he would go to East Germany.
   American Jewish Committee also denied that such an arrangement
had been made.
   However, Rabbi Ernst M. Lorge, contacted in Chicago, said he
would be willing to consider a short-term arrangement.
   ``I have not yet received an official invitation to come to East
Germany, and if I do I would have to think about it,'' said Lorge,
71. ``I might accept something shorter in term ... My life is here
in Chicago. I imagine with some understanding we could come to some
kind of agreement.''
   At issue is a successor for Rabbi Isaac Neuman, who is leaving
East Berlin after an eight-month tenure marked by several disputes
with the city's Jewish community president.
   Sources within the East Berlin Jewish community told The
Associated Press that President Peter Kirchner had received a
letter from the American Jewish Committee naming Lorge as interim
successor for Neuman.
   ``Kirchner has confirmed that Lorge is going to be the new
rabbi. But he will be a rabbi on an interim basis, until a
permanent rabbi can be found,'' sources close to the Jewish
community president said.
   They said Jewish leaders have in mind a rabbi in his 30s as a
permanent successor, but declined to elaborate. The sources spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Eugene DuBow, director of community services for the American
Jewish Community, denied that such an arrangement had been made
with Lorge.
   ``There is no truth to the report that he is coming,'' DuBow
said in a telephone interview from New York.
   He said Lorge had been a guest rabbi in East Berlin during the
High Holidays in the past.
   Lorge, who was born in Mainz, Germany and emigrated to the
United States to flee Nazi persecution in 1936, said he wanted to
help East Germany's Jewish community.
   ``I have a philosophy that Hitler should not get a posthumous
victory _ that there should not be any country where Jews are not
able to have any kind of community,'' he said.
   Neuman complained last weekend of interference from leadership
of the local Jewish community and outlined differences with the
communist government over funding. He said he would leave East
Berlin on May 16 and might return in September, but not to work.
   Jewish leaders, in a statement to the official East German news
agency ADN, denied they meddled in Neuman's activities.
   ``The assertion that Rabbi Neuman was hindered in carrying out
his functions by members, or the community representatives, or
other people must be rejected with emphasis,'' the statement said.
   It said Neuman told community members last month that he was
returning to his Champaign, Ill., home for medical reasons.
   ``His current assertion that anti-Semitic tendencies in the
press of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) have caused
his return were never raised in his discussions with the
community,'' the statement added.
   In explaining why he was leaving in an interview at his East
Berlin home last weekend, Neuman, 65, talked of differences with
the East German press over coverage of Israel and attitudes toward
Jewish issues.
   The East German Jewish community has fewer than 350 officially
registered members and about 100 others. Last September, Neuman
became the first rabbi assigned to East Germany in 21 years.

   The United Methodist Church upheld bans on
homosexual activity by clergy and others, but left the way open for
America's second-largest Protestant denomination to gain more
knowledge on the subject.
   Some leaders said the approval Monday at the denomination's
governing convention of a four-year study on homosexuality had left
the reaffirmed bans in question.
   ``It's a tacit recognition that there is some legitimacy to
various points of view,'' said the Rev. George McClain of New York
City, executive of the Methodist Federation for Social Action.
   The church's nine-member Judicial Conference, a church court,
must rule by Wednesday whether the study can be funded under a rule
that bars funding of any homosexual group or promoting acceptance
of homosexuality.
   Delegates overwhelmingly approved that action, along with
continuation of the bans on active homosexuals in the clergy and
condemnations of such activity generally, then authorized the study.
   United Methodists, often called ``those singing Methodists,''
today began consideration of a new, 625-song hymn book that
contains 330 new numbers, including spirituals and gospel songs.
   The hymnal, however, also retains a heavy sprinkling of numbers
by the Methodists' hymn-writing founder, John Wesley.
   Friction over homosexuality has continued for two decades in the
9.6 million-member United Methodist Church, largest in U.S.
Protestantism after Southern Baptists, and has troubled other
denominations.
   ``Homosexuality has proved to be particularly troubling to
conscientious Christians of differing opinion,'' the Methodists
declared in authorizing the study of the origins and nature of the
practice, biologically, psychologically and sociologically.
   Delegates voted 676 to 293 to maintain the restriction on
ordained clergy, and even more strongly _ 765 to 181 _ for the
expanded blanket rejection of homosexual practice.
   The restrictions expressed uncertainty about homosexuality, and
during a nearly four-hour debate, some delegates charged they were
based on shaky ground.
   ``We admit we lack understanding of homosexuality, and yet we
are willing to condemn those who _ some say by God's choice _ are
homosexual and who are living a homosexual lifestyle,'' said the
Rev. Betty Jane Young of Maplewood, N.J.
   The Rev. Richard Timberlake of Knoxville, Tenn., said there were
hundreds of petitions urging the restrictions, and that not
upholding the bans ``would break faith with our constituency.''
   Others said not keeping the bans would drive thousands out of
the church.
   During a break in the debate, about 150 members of a homosexual
caucus called Affirmation gathered around the podium. ``We are a
gentle, angry people, and we are singing, singing for our lives,''
they sang.
   Although the reaffirmed restrictions were tempered to some
extent, Affirmation leaders denounced them.
   ``It's a terrible thing that the church wants to cut itself off
from a whole class of people by calling them second-class
citizens,'' said the Rev. Morris Floyd of Minneapolis.
   The Rev. Julian Rush, an avowed homosexual minister from Denver,
called the votes distressing.
   ``I remain convinced that the longer we put off really facing up
to this issue the deeper and deeper the polarization in our church
will become,'' Rush said.
   While it is widely recognized that countless clergy and others
during Christian history have been homosexuals, most churches
reject homosexual activity, particularly among the clergy.
   However, in many cases, dealing with the matter is left to
regional units or dioceses.
   In issuing its marginally modified blanket position in the Book
of Discipline on Monday, the denomination declared:
   ``Although we do not condone the practice of homosexuality and
consider this practice incompatible with Christian teaching, we
affirm that God's grace is available to all.''
   The latter phrase was added to previous phraseology, along with
other appended portions emphasizing the church's care and ministry
to all persons.
   New material also acknowledged ``our limited understanding'' of
the complexities of sex and said the church should take the lead in
exploring ``this most complex issue.''
   Delegates also set a theme for the church's next four years of
``Celebrate and Witness'' to Christ, in connection with a stress on
evangelism to stem a gradual shrinkage in membership.
   The conference also authorized the Board of Higher Education to
seek to raise a $100 million fund for scholarships for needy
students.

   Help Wanted. Thirty-five thousand openings.
Must be detail-oriented. Pays $5.50-an-hour, plus mileage. Outdoor
work, no heavy lifting.
   The Census Bureau is gearing up for the 1990 national head
count, and it needs people to help compile the address list for use
in mailing out the forms when the time comes.
   Workers will go door-to-door to compile some 32 million
addresses this year, and will add another 11 million next year,
officials said Tuesday.
   Most of the work is in counties away from metropolitan areas.
Lists of the 56 million addresses in large cities are being
purchased from commercial mailing-list companies.
   Those compiling the address lists will work for about six weeks,
the Census Bureau said, with the effort starting in July in 18
states. The compilation will continue through December, moving to
other states as the first ones are completed.
   Applicants must take a written exam. Interested persons can get
details from their local state employment office or by writing
Field Division, Room 3005-3, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, D.C.
20233.
   The address list will be used to send census forms to households
in the spring of 1990, and then to double check which ones have
been returned and which require follow-up visits.
   At that time an even bigger hiring effort is planned, because
some 400,000 temporary workers will be needed for the census itself.

landed safely at New Tokyo International Airport with only one of
its four engines working.
   ``When the sound of the engine stopped suddenly, I thought my
heart beat would stop, too,'' said Shinobu Murota, 21, who was
sitting in a window seat close to plane's right engines when the
jetliner landed Monday.
   ``I could feel the plane lose the power and start floating in
the air like a hang glider. I thought we are going to crash,'' she
said.
   United Airline spokesman Robert Leu said UA Flight 97 from Los
Angeles to Tokyo with 239 passengers and 19 crew members aboard
lost the use of one engine while at 39,000 feet over the Pacific
Ocean about one hour and 15 minutes from the airport, and a second
engine about 30 minutes later.
   Pilot Jack Harper radioed the control tower at 2:49 p.m. that he
had shut down two of the four engines due to malfunctions and
requested an ``expedited approach'' with emergency vehicles
standing by, said Koichi Matsuda of the Transport Ministry.
   The jet lost the use of its third engine shortly before landing,
Leu said. But with 16 emergency vehicles including fire engines and
ambulances lining the runnway, the Boeing 747-100 landed safely at
the airport in Narita, 40 miles northeast of Tokyo at 3:17 p.m.
   A statement released by United Airlines in Chicago said three
engines lost power. But it did not specify whether they were shut
down by the pilot or lost power by themselves. The statement said
the Transport Ministry was investigating.
   Government and industry sources in Washington said today that
the tanks supplying fuel to the three dead engines were found to be
dry when the plane landed.
   The fourth tank had about 20,000 pounds of fuel remaining and
was in no imminent danger of also going dry.
   It was not known whether the fuel problem had been caused by a
pilot error or by a mechanical problem with the plane's
fuel-switching equipment. On a Boeing 747, fuel is routinely
transferred from tank to tank during a long flight to balance the
aircraft.
   A Boeing 747 has a maximum fuel capacity of 320,000 pounds and
burns about 23,500 pounds of fuel per hour, according to the
manufacturer.
   A Tokyo newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, said that during the flight,
the gauge that indicates how much fuel is feeding into the engines
showed there was almost no fuel going into engines one and four and
that the No. 3 engine was malfunctioning.
   On landing, the passengers cheered and applauded when the
jetliner touched down. The aircraft taxied to the terminal under
its own power, and all aboard left the plane in a normal fashion.
No one was injured, Leu said.
   Ms. Murota, who was returning from San Francisco and Los Angeles
said she was extremely frightened when flight attendants told
passengers to put their heads down and grab their ankles in
preparation for an emergeny landing.
   ``But when I saw the runway nearing, I knew I could at least
survive because we are not flying over the ocean,'' she said.
   ``The impact of landing was harder than usual,'' she added. ``It
went `bang! bang!' twice at landing, and I felt my heart beat
quickly. Then there was a big cheer.''
   Kyodo News Service quoted Kazuko Kato, who was returning from
her honeymoon, as saying: ``I expected death at any moment.'' After
the plane landed she shouted at her husband: ``Thank goodness we
didn't die!''

<HEAD>Mass Recall of Missouri Bullfrog Ordered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mass recall of pet Missouri bullfrogs is under
way, prompted by fears that when they mature they may gobble up the
gentler denizens of British garden ponds.
   In Washington, a Missouri congressman says he can already
imagine the movie version _ ``The Bullfrogs That Ate Britain.''
   Peter Barratt, who owns a garden supply center in Newcastle,
northern England, says about 200 of the 400 tadpoles he sold have
been returned since he put out the recall notice.
   ``They're still coming in as we speak,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   But is it too late?
   Missouri bullfrogs can grow to a foot long, raising mayhem in
garden ponds four to six years from now when they reach maturity.
   ``If you put an American bullfrog on one side of the ecological
scales, everything is going to fall off the other side because it
will gobble it all up,'' Tony Tynan, the naturalist who alerted the
garden center, was quoted as telling The Daily Telegraph.
   At the time they went on the market, the bullfrogs seemed like
no more than a novelty item _ something to scare off cats or herons
on the prowl for goldfish.
   Barratt said an outbreak of marauding Missouri bullfrogs in
Italy several years ago set off the fears.
   ``We were fairly ignorant on this subject,'' he said.
``Hindsight is a wonderful thing.''
   ``Once we heard the full facts and were aware of what could
happen we took a decision straight away to recall them,'' he said.
   Barratt thinks people may be leaping to conclusions about the
threat. So long as the bullfrogs aren't released into the wild, he
doesn't see them going on the rampage.
   Nonetheless, he has put up signs in his store apologizing to
frog-lovers for the inconvenience and offering to refund them the
$1.85 price of each tadpole.
   U.S. Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo., says the news made him jump.
   ``After hearing this, I hopped over to the House floor to
deliver this sad news to my colleagues,'' he said recently in
Washington.
   ``Lest the tiny creatures of Britain croak, it is far better
that our Missouri bullfrogs be recalled. Sounds like a horror film
_ `The Bullfrogs That Ate Britain.'
   ``And so, my colleagues, I stand before you warts and all.
   ``As a responsible Missourian, I believe that although we should
not leap to conclusions, we must ensure our frogs do not cause any
undue harm in the land of Thatcher.
   ``So we welcome our British brethren to send back both our
tadpoles and foot-long bullfrogs back home.
   ``Imagine _ a foot-long frog!
   ``Who would believe it?
   ``It's no wonder they call Missouri the `Show Me State.'''
   Barratt said the recalled tadpoles are being returned to the
supplier, who imported them from St. Louis. But he did not know
whether they were being shipped back to Missouri.

<HEAD>Dukakis Seeks Ohio, Indiana Wins; Jackson Settles For DC
Consolation Prize</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: First returns from Indiana expected shortly after 6 p.m. EDT.

   Michael Dukakis looked to lengthen his delegate lead over a
contentious Jesse Jackson in Indiana and Ohio primaries on Tuesday
as the Democratic presidential campaign turned predictable. Jackson
sought a consolation prize in the District of Columbia primary.
   Dukakis held a large lead in pre-election polls in the two
Midwestern states. Jackson was favored even more strongly in the
heavily black nation's capital.
   But the day's delegate arithmetic clearly favored Dukakis, now
seemingly the prohibitive favorite to lock up the nomination weeks
before the Democratic National Convention convenes in July in
Atlanta. Ohio picked 159 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, Indiana 79 and the District of Columbia 16.
   The Massachusetts governor, whose candidacy has been embraced in
recent days by a slow but steady trickle of Democratic Party
leaders, began the day with nearly 1,300 of the 2,081 delegates
needed to clinch the nomination, a lead of nearly 450 in The
Associated Press count over his sole remaining rival.
   Dukakis aides conceded Jackson's victory in the District of
Columbia in advance, but said they hoped it would be his last of
the primary season.
   If the Democratic primaries seemed to hold little suspense,
there was absolutely no mystery at all on the Republican side.
   Vice President George Bush faced no active ballot opposition in
Ohio, Indiana, the District of Columbia or elsewhere. He arranged
an ``Over the Top'' victory celebration at a Washington hotel to
celebrate the mathematical lock he gained on the GOP nomination
last week.
   Despite his certain nomination, Bush campaigned energetically in
Ohio and Indiana, previewing campaign themes for use in the fall
against the Democrats.
   He accused Dukakis of foreign policy inexperience and sought to
depict him and Jackson as advocates of policies that hearken back
to the Jimmy Carter era.
   On the left, Dukakis was being squeezed by Jackson, who turned
up the heat on his Democratic rival after last week's landslide
loss in Pennsylvania.
   He outspent Dukakis in Ohio television campaigning by a margin
of 4-to-1, and roughed up the Massachusetts governor for the first
time in a broadcast commercial.
   ``Bush wants to stay the course. Michael Dukakis wants to manage
the damage,'' said the commercial. ``Jesse Jackson wants to change
the course of America.''
   Dukakis declined to be drawn into a battle with Jackson as he
campaigned with his attention divided between the primary calendar
and the general election campaign. In blue collar precincts, he
sharply criticized President Reagan's decision to veto trade
legislation over a provision requiring notification to workers
before a plant can be closed.

   The Massachusetts governor spent four days campaigning in Ohio
and Indiana, but figured only a two-day swing through next week's
primary states in West Virginia and Nebraska would be sufficient to
move them into his column.
   A new poll in California showed Dukakis with a handsome lead in
the state which selects 314 delegates _ the largest single prize in
the nation _ in a June 7 primary.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, one of several campaign dropouts, was
quoted by one of his own supporters as saying the time had come to
rally around the Massachusetts governor.
   A few delegates backing Sens. Paul Simon and Albert Gore _ both
of whom have suspended their campaigns _ converted to the Dukakis
side, as well.
   As Dukakis' nomination moved toward the inevitable, Jackson for
the first time lashed out at his opponent.
   The Massachusetts governor turned aside Jackson's criticism by
saying, ``I'm not just a talker. I'm a doer,'' and criticized the
Reagan administration and Bush instead.
   He frequently mentioned the plant closing legislation and Bush's
support of Reagan's intended veto.
   He said Secretary of State George Shultz, a labor economist by
training, had once suggested in a book that displaced workers need
up to a year to adjust. ``Maybe the secretary can help the White
House understand the trauma and agony and pain of being laid off,''
he said.
   He criticized the administration on foreign policy, as well.
   ``I want to know why we were doing business with (Manuel)
Noriega, why they were paying off Noriega, why they were doing
business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator,'' he said.
``That's the first thing we need, a full explanation, and I think
the people of America are entitled to it.''
   While Dukakis turned his attention increasingly to the fall
campaign, Jackson decided to step up his challenge for the
nomination.
   He squelched campaign aides who were uttering semi-concessions
of defeat in the nominating race, and began demanding that Dukakis
be bolder and more specific in his campaign.
   ``So far, Dukakis has operated with caution when we must operate
with courage, clarity and candor,'' he said at one point, pressing
his rival to speak out on Southern Africa and economic issues.
   Bush devoted more time than Dukakis did to campaigning in Ohio
and Indiana, saying he didn't intend to project overconfidence.
   He criticized the Democrats wherever he went, scorning Dukakis
at one point for heeding ``macho'' advice from Harvard University
on foreign policy.
   ``I can't wait for Mr. Dukakis to discuss the Noriega matter.
And I'd say, What would you do about it?''
   He sought to link Dukakis' and Jackson's views to the tough
economic times found by the Reagan administration in 1981. ``The
country wants to move ahead, not go back to the misery we
inherited,'' he said. .
   Bush also said he was prepared to fire back if Dukakis sought to
make an issue of Meese and his legal difficulties.
   ``There is plenty of evidence to kind of go into a
guilt-by-association mode where we can find in Massachusetts
politics or campaign stuff or things of that nature,'' he said. ``I
hope we don't have to do it.''

   Adamsville has bought the home of the
late ``Walking Tall'' Sheriff Buford Pusser and is converting it
into a museum, officials say.
   The grand opening of the one-story brick home will be May 28,
Judy Essary, coordinator of the event, said Tuesday.
   The city purchased the home and its furnishings for $150,000
from the state, Ms. Essary said. The state had bought it from
Pusser's daughter, Dawana.
   The museum will include Pusser's clothes, furniture, the blue
light of his cruiser and a metal stick used in one of the ``Walking
Tall'' movies to smash a car windshield.
   Pusser, McNairy County sheriff from 1964 to 1970, died in a car
crash in 1974. While sheriff, he survived several attempts on his
life, including an ambush that killed his wife. His exploits
inspired a series of movies.

   Police arrested 175 chanting anti-abortion
demonstrators at a medical center today, one day after more than
500 protesters were arrested while blocking the entrance to a
doctor's office.
   By mid-morning, half the estimated 350 demonstrators who
converged on the Queens Women's Medical Office had been arrested,
charged with disorderly conduct and released, said Sgt. John
Venetucci, a police spokesman.
   Spokesman Lowell Patterson of Operation Rescue said the
demonstrators were holding a ``peaceful, prayerful presence in an
effort to block the doors'' at the office.
   Operation Rescue has been holding daily protests at New
York-area abortion clinics. On Monday, police arrested 503
demonstrators as they sat or lay in the street in an effort to
block the entrance to gynecologist Dr. Herbert Schwarz's office on
the Manhattan's Upper East Side.
   All of those arrested were given summonses for disorderly
conduct and released, said Officer Louis Llanes, another police
spokesman. No violence was reported.
   Joined by several clergymen, the group estimated at 600 people
prayed and sang hymns while a smaller group of about 50
abortion-rights advocates held a counter-demonstration across the
street, organizers said.
   Police refused to estimate the size of today's crowd.
   Cardinal John O'Connor issued a statement Monday, saying, ``We
support all peaceful efforts to bring an end to abortion which has
seen over 15 million pre-born babies aborted since the Roe vs. Wade
Supreme Court decision of 1973.''
   Barbara Page, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion group, said
the group believes in peaceful demonstrations and added that their
main goal was to ``counsel women going into the clinic.''
   ``We don't harass or harangue anybody. We don't hang onto the
woman. We don't punch her or hit her ... but we may be able to
deter her by blocking access,'' Mrs. Page said.
   Karen Rood, a member of the New York chapter of the National
Organization for Women, said they had about 50 people outside the
doctor's office ``to help people get access to the clinic and
escort women inside.''
   She said they were unable to do that because police put them
across the street from the anti-abortion demonstrators. But no
patients tried to enter the small residential building housing the
doctor's office before the demonstration ended early in the
afternoon.
   The doctor, who performs abortions and does pregnancy
counseling, was unable to open his office because of the
demonstrators, Ms. Rood said.
   An answering machine was on in the doctor's office all day. He
did not return phone calls.

<HEAD>Finnish Prime Minister Speaks Out Against Protectionism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finnish Prime Minister Harri Holkeri on
Tuesday praised President Reagan's resistance to trade
protectionism as an example for other countries.
   ``In defending free trade and resisting protectionist pressures,
this (Reagan) administration has shown responsibility that deserves
recognition overseas,'' Holkeri said in an address prepared for a
National Press Club audience.
   He also wished Reagan ``the very best'' for the Moscow summit at
the end of May. Holkeri, who met the president Monday, said Reagan
during his planned pre-summit stopover in Finland will get a warm
welcome from a friendly people who cherish good relations with the
United States.
   The prime minister, who is making a week-long visit to the
United States, said ``the worst scenario would be a trade war
between the major trading powers ... avoiding trade confrontation
is now a high priority for all governments.''
   In remarks that could be interpreted as criticism of some
provisions of the trade bill Reagan plans to veto, Holkeri urged
priority for the multilateral approach to trade over nationalist
economic policies.
   ``It is crucial that all countries refrain from new
protectionist measures'' and observe 1986 commitments at the start
of the Uruguay round of global trade talks for a freeze on existing
levels of protection, he said.
   Successful conclusion of the round by the end of 1990 demands
constructive actions by all countries regardless of size and ``and
puts a heavy responsibility'' on key players in world trade, such
as the United States, he said.
   ``We should discard support for ailing industries,'' he said. If
``Buy American'' policies are acceptable, why not ``Buy Finnish?''
he asked. He said absence of subsidies for industry forces Finnish
factories ``to become competitive, and stay, competitive.''
   Holkeri, a banker who a year ago became head of Finland's first
conservative-led coalition government with the Social Democrats,
said his country believes in the free market and wants to cooperate
with the United States in promoting multilateralism in trade.

<HEAD>South Africa, Cuba Meet to Talk About Angolan Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-led secret talks Tuesday put delegates from
Cuba and South Africa face-to-face Tuesday to seek a peace accord
for Angola.
   Strict secrecy surrounded the first day of the two-day meeting
under the chairmanship of Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary
of state for African affairs. The U.S. Embassy said Crocker would
make no statement until after the negotiations.
   Officially, the talks at a small hotel in London's West End also
encompassed independence for South African-controlled South-West
Africa, or Namibia, which shares a border with Angola in
southwestern Africa.
   But the region's two guerrilla groups were not invited, and
delegates to the talks were expected to concentrate on a formula to
pull back South African and Cuban forces from Angola.
   The meeting follows an eight-year U.S. effort to get Cuba to
withdraw 40,000 troops from Angola, sent in 1975 to defend the
Marxist government against pro-Western rebels of UNITA, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   South African troops are in Angola backing rebels and also
attacking bases of the South West African People's Organization,
the guerrilla group fighting for independence and black majority
rule in Namibia.
   The Angolans sent their foreign minister, Alfonso van Dunem, to
Tuesday's talks.
   The negotiations marked the first publicly known meeting between
the South Africans and Cubans.
   The Cubans dispatched a delegation headed by a senior member of
the Cuban Communist Party, Jorge Risquet Valdes. Its five-member
delegation also included military chief Gen. Ulises Rosales Del
Doro, the Cuban Embassy said.
   But the South African team was headed by a bureaucrat, Neil van
Heerden, director general of the Department of Foreign Affairs.
   Meanwhile, Pretoria played down prospects of a breakthrough.
   The state-controlled South African Broadcasting Corp. said
Tuesday that ``by its nature, it (the London meeting) cannot be
much more than exploratory.''
   On Monday, South African President P.W. Botha had warned against
``being too over-optimistic'' about the London talks.
   ``The moment the Cubans leave that part of southern Africa and
it is safe, then South Africa's forces will leave too,'' Botha told
Parliament. He made no mention of Namibian independence.
   The United States has backed the South African demand that Cuban
troops leave Angola before South Africa gives independence to
Namibia.
   South Africa says it has about 3,000 troops in Angola, while
Angola maintains that 9,000 South Africans are backed by heavy
artillery in its southern territory.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Returns No Indictments in MOVE Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special grand jury today called city
officials' conduct in the 1985 MOVE siege that led to 11 deaths
``totally unacceptable,'' but returned no criminal indictments in
what it called the city's greatest tragedy.
   Eleven people died and 61 homes were destroyed on May 13, 1985,
when police dropped a bomb on a barricaded west Philadelphia row
house occupied by the radical group MOVE.
   ``Applying the law to the facts as we find them, no charges are
warranted, yet we do not exonerate the men responsible for this
disaster,'' the grand jury said in its 279-page report. ``Rather
than a vindication of those officials, this report should stand as
a permanent record of their morally reprehensible behavior.
   ``This city, its leaders and citizens, must never forget the
terrible cost of their misjudgments.''
   The confrontation started after neighbors who had been targets
of threats and harassment for several years told authorities they
would try to evict MOVE themselves unless the city acted.
   The grand jury report, released this afternoon, denounced the
city's planning for and actions in the siege as incompetent and
inept. It especially castigated Mayor W. Wilson Goode.
   ``As the city's chief executive officer and the man legally
responsible for law enforcement in the city, Goode delegated too
much, deferred too often, and asked too few questions,'' the report
said.
   The MOVE group championed back-to-nature rituals, lived in filth
with rats and other animals, refused to send their children to
school and disobeyed health and safety laws. It was decimated by
the disaster, and most of its living members are now in jail.
   The report said other top officials also were uninformed,
including the city's No. 2 executive at the time, former Managing
Director Leo Brooks.
   During the confrontation, when police gunfire failed to drive
out the MOVE members, Goode approved a plan to drop an explosive
device on the row house from a helicopter.
   The bomb started a fire, not immediately fought, that eventually
destroyed 1{ city blocks and killed 11 people, five of them
children, in the fortified MOVE compound. Damage caused by the
police action already has exceeded $20 million, including
rebuilding the burned-down neighborhood.
   The grand jury said it considered criminal charges involving
conspiracy, murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault
and other charges. It determined in not bringing charges, ``that
Goode's conduct was not reckless under the law; that is, that he
did not consciously disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk
that people would be placed in danger of death or serious bodily
injury'' by the dropping of the bomb.
   A federal grand jury _ which has been probing for more than a
year whether the civil rights of the 11 victims were
unconstitutionally violated _ is nearing the end of its work.
   A report from the federal panel, with a possibility of
indictments, is expected in a few months, possibly by the start of
summer.
   Beside police participants, others criticized by the mayor's
investigating commission were Brooks, who ran operations at the
MOVE scene, former police commissioner Gregore Sambor,who planned
the bombing, and Fire Commissioner William Richmond, accused of
delaying fighting the blaze because officials allegedly hoped the
flames would drive out the occupants.

   The White House, in a response to the Israeli
incursion into Lebanon, today expressed concern about the
increasing level of violence in that country and called for
withdrawal of all foreign forces.
   ``The United States believes there is a need for mutually agreed
security arrangements to assure stability and security in
Lebanon,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``We are concerned about the increasing level of violence and
call for restraint by all parties,'' Fitzwater said. ``Violence
does not serve anyone's interest and underscores the need for
comprehensive political solutions.''
   ``In this regard, the United States continues to support
Lebanese unity, sovereignty and independence and the withdrawal of
all foreign forces and the extension of central government
authority throughout Lebanon,'' he said. ``We have consistently
supported political reform and dialogue in Lebanon.''
   ``On the broader issue of Middle East peace, we continue to
consult with the parties involved,'' he said. ``To date, we have
not heard anyone say no. This is a positive sign in itself. We will
continue to work for peace.''
   Asked why the statement was being issued, Fitzwater said, ``It's
a response to the incursion.''
   Israeli tanks pushed to within a few miles of Syrian troops in
south Lebanon today as heavily armed Israeli soldiers searched for
Palestinian guerrillas in the area's rugged hills in an operation
that began Monday night.

   Two Marines lost in the Persian Gulf
last month were ``excited and proud'' and dedicated to their duty,
a Marine officer said today at a memorial service for the men.
   More than 450 people gathered inside a chapel at New River Air
Station, where two tables covered in black cloth held the helmets,
swords and wings of the Marines, Capt. Kenneth Hill, 33, of
Thomasville and Capt. Stephen Leslie, 30, of New Bern.
   The two were aboard a helicopter that disappeared in the Persian
Gulf last month during a skirmish between the United States and
Iran. They were declared killed in action April 28.
   ``Steven and Ken were positive men, and they would want us to
press on,'' Maj. George Messier told the mourners during the
service.
   ``They didn't just climb into it (helicopter) _ they strapped it
on,'' Messier said.
   The Marines were on an evening patrol serving as backup for U.S.
combat ships the day they disappeared, Messier said after the
service.
   The two had been asked to check out a ``presence'' detected by a
U.S. ship. While doing so, they radioed they had detected an enemy
radar tracking their own helicopter, Messier said. That was the
last the Navy heard from them, he said.
   ``They almost certainly were shot down that evening,'' Messier
said.
   Hill's wife, Laura, and 4-year-old son, Andrew, and Leslie's
wife, Lisa, who is seven months pregnant with the couple's first
child, attended the service. Both Hill's and Leslie's parents were
also there.

   Congress should pass a universal health
insurance plan similar to the one signed into law last month by
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, former Cabinet member Joseph
Califano said Tuesday.
   Califano, who was secretary of health, education and welfare
during the Carter administration, said all other industrialized
nations make health care or insurance available to their citizens.
   He said his son is working and studying at a West German
hospital and receives full health coverage for $45 a month.
   ``We can do it in this country. The Dukakis plan provides a
model,'' Califano told the Joint Economic Committee's subcommittee
on education and health at a hearing on the future of health care
in America.
   The plan advanced by Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential
nominee, gives tax incentives to employers who offer health
insurance to their employees and sets up a state fund to help the
unemployed, the self-employed and others buy insurance for
themselves at subsidized rates. The cost is estimated at $645
million over the next five years.
   Universal health insurance was one of three changes which
Califano said he would make if he were trying to improve U.S.
health care and had no limits on what he could spend.
   He said he would also mount a huge health education and disease
prevention campaign, and spend ``an enormous amount of money'' on
research into addiction and the afflictions of the aged,
particularly incontinence, immobility and memory loss.
   Califano said at least $1 billion a year should be spent on
aging research and a new institute on addiction should be created
at the National Institutes of Health to study all forms of
substance abuse, including smoking.
   ``The cost of addiction in health care alone easily exceeds $50
billion. Yet out of a total health research budget of $6 billion,
the government spends less than $200 million to learn about
addiction,'' said Califano.
   Califano also offered ways to hold down health care costs, among
them capping malpractice awards and setting treatment standards
based on what is proven to work. The latter would help reduce
unnecessary procedures and hospital admissions, he said.
   Authorities also need ``a sea change in community attitudes'' to
help them start eliminating 400,000 excess hospital beds that are
costing $12 billion a year to maintain, Califano said.
   ``Closing hospitals is hard labor,'' Califano acknowledged.
``Everyone admits we have too many hospital beds in America _
they're just all in someone else's town, city or neighborhood.''
   Califano, author of a 1986 book called ``America's Health Care
Revolution,'' said the major stumbling block to his recommendations
is the health care industry.
   ``For these efforts to succeed, to have any hope of restraining
costs, the political system has to free itself from domination by
health care providers,'' Califano said. He said their political
action committees spent more on congressional races in the last
election cycle than any other industry except financial services.
   Daniel Waldo, of the government's Health Care Financing
Administration, said the trend toward higher spending on health
care is inevitable and desirable. He said more and more money is
becoming available for health care as national income increases.
   The aging of the population also contributes to higher
expenditures, he said, as does the willingness of people to pay for
more care, demonstrated by the rise in adult orthodontia.

   A home-made bomb was discovered at
a British army base today, just two days after IRA attacks killed
three British soldiers based in West Germany.
   Detmold municipal officials said the two-pound bomb was
discovered in a civilian parking area on the base, and that
explosives experts were on the scene.
   They said in a statement that it was not certain whether the
experts could defuse the bomb, or whether they would be forced to
explode it. The officials said British authorities sealed off the
parking lot and the surrounding area.
   Three senior airmen in the Royal Air Force Regiment died in bomb
and shooting attacks Sunday in the Netherlands. The airmen were
visiting Dutch discotheques and bars when they were killed.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a
machine-gun attack in Roermond, which killed one airman, and the
booby-trap car bomb in Nieuwbergen, which killed two others. Three
other servicemen were injured.
   The British armed services have nearly 70,000 personnel and
80,000 dependents stationed in West Germany at four Royal Air Force
and five army bases.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British from Northern Ireland
and unite the province with the Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Search Continues For Missing Children in Hospital Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue teams Tuesday searched for at
least 32 people missing after a children's hospital in the northern
state of Kashmir collapsed and killed at least 17 people, news
reports said.
   The three-story brick wing of the government-owned hospital in
the town of Jammu, 340 miles north of New Delhi, collapsed at 6:30
a.m. Monday.
   Floodlights were put up around the wreckage of the building to
aid the rescue efforts, but Arun Joshi, a reporter for the Kashmir
Times, said rescuers had lost hope of finding anyone alive.
   ``It is a terrible sight up there,'' Joshi said. ``No one knows
how many children have died or are dying.''
   At least 17 bodies were recovered from the debris, the United
News of India news agency reported. It said at least 23 people were
injured and 32 others, including 22 children, were believed to be
buried under the rubble.
   The hospital wing's four wards contained 17 beds, with more than
one child sleeping in some of them, according to the Statesman
newspaper. Visitors and hospital staff were also believed to be
among the victims, the newspaper said.
   But state-run television, quoting a local government statement,
said only 10 bodies were recovered from the site.
   It said army personnel, police and civilian workers were
continuing rescue operations.
   Structural defects were blamed for the collapse, UNI said. Three
civil engineers who oversaw the construction of the wing have been
suspended and authorities are seeking the contractor, Kasturi Lal
Gupta, the agency said.
   Satish Gupta, a Jammu police department spokesman, said the
collapse was apparently caused by a weak foundation under the
4-year-old building.
   Most stores and businesses in Jammu and neighboring towns were
closed Tuesday in sympathy for the victims and their families.

   A KLM Boeing 747 airliner
developed landing gear problems on a flight from Los Angeles and
made a successful emergency landing Tuesday, an airline spokesman
said.
   None of the jumbo jet's 196 passengers and 16 crew was injured

   ``The right leg of the plane's main landing gear failed to lock

   After the emergency services of Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport
went on full alert, the plane landed safely at 11:05 a.m., said
Baas. He said damage to the jumbo jet was minor.
   For safety reasons, passengers and crew left the plane while it
was still on the runway, Baas said.

   The state may not tax the Potawatomi
Indians for cigarette sales to tribal members at the tribe's store
near Shawnee, a judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Lee West ruled recently that the tribe must
work with state officials to set up a system for charging taxes on
purchases made by people who do not belong to the tribe.
   ``I think this will apply to any sales made at their store,''
David Miley, state Tax Commission general counsel, said Tuesday.
``We will have to see the wording in the final judgment, but from
reading the order, I think it would apply to all their sales.''
   The Tax Commission billed the Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian
Tribe in March 1987 for $2,691,470 in taxes it said were owed on
cigarettes sold since 1982 at the Gallery Trading Post.
   The tribe sued, contending such taxes violated tribal
sovereignty.
   Miley said the commission would decide whether to appeal after a
final judgment is issued.

<HEAD>Army Wants To Build New Laboratory In Utah, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army wants to go ahead and build a new
biological warfare test laboratory in Utah despite strong public
opposition, administration officials said Tuesday.
   The Army has temporarily shelved its proposal to construct the
facility at Dugway Proving Grounds but plans to seek the money
again next year, the officials testified to a trio of House
subcommittees.
   They said the United States has unilaterally renounced any use
of biological weapons but still needs to conduct research in the
field because of germ weapons that might be developed by nations
like the Soviet Union.
   ``We certainly have the responsibility to the soldier to protect
him and her against those who would use biological weapons,'' said
Thomas Welch, deputy assistant secretary of defense. ``We must
provide the masks, detectors, vaccines, and so on ... ''
   The controversy involves Army plans to build a $5.4 million lab
which would have a ``bio-safety level four (B-4),'' the highest
standard of protection.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, who represents the area, noted that
the lab would have the capability ``to convert these lethal
pathogens into aerosol form.''
   ``And it is this dangerous aerosol capability that is setting
off alarm bells throughout the scientific community, both
internationally and in Utah, as to the public safety and wisdom of
building the Dugway facility,'' Owens said.
   Officially, the United States shut down its biological weapons
program, which was based at Fort Detrick, Md., in 1969 and
announced that future research in the field would be limited to
``defensive'' purposes.
   The United States is also a party to a 1972 treaty banning
possession of biological weapons, but the pact lacks enforcement or
verification provisions.
   Welch and other administration officials repeatedly emphasized
Tuesday that the Army's research program was only defensive and the
United States would not use germ weapons.
   ``It would be impossible for us to use biological weapons
because we don't have them,'' said Welch. ``We would never use
biological weapons against anybody.''
   But legislators questioned Welch closely about the Army research
program. Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., noted that ``the line between
offensive and defensive biological agents seems fuzzy at best.''
   Welch noted that while the lab would be constructed to a B-4
standard, the Army's planned experiments could be done in a B-3
lab. The higher safety level is sought as a public protection, he
said.
   Army Col. Walter Busby, who oversees the testing program, said
there are ``no plans to use genetically engineered material'' in
the Dugway facility.
   Some of the biological agents tested at Dugway are shipped
through regular mails, officials said.
   Lynn Hansen, assistant director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said the Soviet Union has ``an active research
program'' to build germ weapons.
   ``In contrast to the openness we have practiced regarding our
military programs, the Soviets, to date, have never officially
acknowledged even having a biological weapons program,'' Hansen
said.
   Welch also said the U.S. program is open to inspection. But some
parts of it remain secret because ``we do not want to expose our
vulnerabilities in any area,'' he said.
   The officials testified at a joint hearing of the House Foreign
Affairs arms control subcommittee, the Interior subcommittee on
energy and the environment, and the Armed Services subcommittee on
military installations and facilities.

<HEAD>Syndicated Astrologer Carroll Righter Dead At 88</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS two grafs after 6th pvs, ``He began xxx, with two

<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carroll Righter, astrologist to
movie stars and writer of a syndicated daily advice column for 166
newspapers around the world, has died. He was 88.
   Righter died Saturday at St. John's Medical Center, two days
after being admitted with cancer of the prostate, said hospital
spokeman Armen Markarian.
   A native of Philadelphia, Righter once studied to become a
lawyer, but charted a new course after a sports injury. He studied
his own astrological chart and saw he had ``physical protection in
the Southwest,'' he once said.
   Before moving West, Righter was introduced to astrologer
Evangeline Adams, who had counseled such people as Enrico Caruso
and Britain's King Edward VII.
   ``She told me I had the perfect chart for becoming an
astrologer,'' said Righter, who liked to be called the ``gregarious
Aquarius.''
   He began doing charts for Hollywood notables in 1938 and became
a columnist in 1950.
   Righter was mentioned in President Reagan's 1965 autobiography,
``Where's The Rest Of Me?'' and was one of several astrologers
consulted by Nancy Reagan, according to an article in today's
editions of The Washington Post.
   According to that article and a similar story in today's
editions of The Philadelphia Inquirer, a new book by former White
House chief of staff Donald T. Regan claims Mrs. Reagan turned to
astrologers to help determine the president's schedule.
   Righter claimed he warned Marlene Dietrich to avoid working on a
studio set one day because she might get hurt. His advice was not
heeded and Dietrich broke an ankle while reaching out to save a
falling child.
   Word of the accident and Righter's advice led other celebrities
to the astrologer's Hollywood doorstep, ensuring his fame.
   Among those who sought his advice were Arlene Dahl, Rhonda
Fleming, Jane Withers, Joan Fontaine and Grace Kelly.
   Good friend and fellow astrologer Thomas S. Pierson will take
over Righter's column, but said the aging master had completed his
predictions through October.
   ``He liked to work six months or a year ahead of time,'' said
Pierson, who is married to Miss Withers.
   Righter worked out of his Hollywood home, using an old manual
typewriter and thesaurus, and surrounded himself with photographs
of his famous clientele.
   Although he often forgot the names of people he had met, he
reportedly never forgot their birth signs and would address them as
``Miss Virgo'' or ``Mr. Aries,'' friends said.
   Righter also wrote several books, including ``Astrology and
You,'' the ``Astrological Guide to Health and Diet'' and the
``Astrological Guide to Marriage and Family Relations.''
   Pierson said Righter, who never married, predicted his own death.
   ``He knew it would be difficult because the sun had gone into
the sign of Taurus, a difficult period for an Aquarius,'' Pierson
said. ``He admitted he probably wouldn't get through.''

   A woman who went into business as an
``optimism consultant'' has had to close her office because she was
not optimistic enough in estimating her prospects.
   Inga Lill Enbom shut her ``Optimism Center'' in Lulea when
demands for her lectures kept her traveling too much, the national
news agency TT reported Tuesday.
   ``I virtually never had time to spend in my beautiful office in
Lulea and realized the pointlessness of having space that was not
any use,'' she said.
   Her message is that positive thinking is a prerequisite for
solving any problem or getting results. Her clients include
schools, government institutions, companies, clubs and professional
organizations.

   Members of Illinois Innovators and
Inventors, or I-Cubed, say they're just ordinary folks, unlike the
mad scientist stereotypes who often appear on the big screen.
   Through the group's exposure, some members say, they hope to
change the image of inventors as eccentric, hyperactive, wild-eyed
and wild-haired people in unkempt clothing, bursting with ideas but
absent-minded.
   Susan Burgess of I-Cubed, which provides pointers and business
information for inventors, recently said the biggest misconception
people have about inventors is ``they're all weirdos _ and they're
not.''
   ``They don't all sit around in their basements and shout
`Eureka!' all the time,'' Ms. Burgess said.
   But group members do come up with novel ideas.
   Take Robert Biby of Troy, for instance, who created a portable,
quiet air conditioner to keep police officers cool on hot
stakeouts. And there's Mark Derby of O'Fallon, who invented a
bear-proof food-storage box for campers.
   Author and group member Dennis Shinn, who has compiled two books
of ``1,001 Names For Your Pet'' _ that's 2,002 names _ said
inventors are just plain folks.
   ``Once I-Cubed gets proper exposure, I think people will realize
inventors are not mad scientists,'' Shinn said.
   ``They just have ideas they want to let the public know about.''
   Based in offices overlooking Tower Lake at Southern Illinois
University at Edwardsville, I-Cubed was created in August 1986 to
help inventors turn ideas into finished products.

   Dallas billionaire Ross Perot says he asked the
Rev. Jesse Jackson to help free American hostages held in Beirut
and financed a 1985 trip by the Democratic presidential contender,
according to a report published today.
   Perot said the National Security Council asked him to contact
Jackson to negotiate for the hostages' release.
   ``We had one hostage, (CIA agent William) Buckley, who knew too
much and it was very important to get him back. Somebody asked who
had a track record on getting somebody out of Beirut, and Jackson
was the only one who had,'' Perot told The Dallas Morning News.
   Perot said he met with Jackson before the Chicago civil rights
leader left on his misson to London and Rome. Perot paid Jackson's
expenses _ roughly $30,000 _ and sent an associate along to ``make
sure he had everything he needed.''
   The Dallas businessman and philanthropist praised the Democratic
presidential candidate for his efforts.
   ``The list of people who take a chance like this is very
short,'' Perot said. ``The list of people who have news conferences
and shed tears is very long. He never blinked, he went.''
   An account of the deal between Perot and Jackson is contained in
``Guts and Glory: The Rise and Fall of Oliver North,'' a new
biography on the former NSC aide.
   The biography by Ben Bradlee Jr., a reporter for The Boston
Globe, says that North and Perot sought out Jackson because he had
successfully persuaded Syria to release Navy airman Robert Goodman
in 1983.
   On several other occasions, North enlisted Perot to help ransom
American hostages in Iran, but NSC officials did not want to
approach Jackson for help, Perot said.
   Jackson told Perot shortly after his return that one of the
American hostages would be freed soon, Perot said. A few days
later, Jeremy Levin, the Beirut bureau chief of Cable News Network,
escaped from his captors.
   ``The guy did what he was asked to do by our government and he
never grandstanded,'' Perot said. ``His record is two-for-two.''
   In December 1986, the Detroit Free Press reported that Perot
financed Jackson's trip, but Perot would not confirm it at the time.

<HEAD>Experiment Tries to Curb Melaleuca Threat to Everglades</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Everglades will disappear if the melaleuca tree
is not curbed, but an experimental herbicide program could help
stop the spread of the thirsty Australian import, experts said
Tuesday.
   Aerial spraying began last week in the Loxahatchee National
Wildlife Refuge in Palm Beach County, but will take up to 10 months
to evaluate, said the park's chief biologist, Mark Maffei.
   The melaleuca was imported in 1906 to sow in the Everglades,
which was then seen as just ``a mucky wasteland,'' said biologist
Julia Morton of the University of Miami. Those bringing in the tree
hoped it would turn the land into a productive timbering area.
   The idea worked only too well, and by the time scientists and
the public realized the enormous environmental value of the
Everglades, the melaleuca was beginning to wipe parts of the
habitat out.
   The thirsty Australian tree soaks up water rapidly, and thrives
in fertilizer-enriched waters that now flow into the Everglades.
The proliferation of melaleuca crowds out the native plants, which
evolved in an era when the water had few nutrients.
   ``It's now invaded a half-million acres, and 40,000 acres are
solid melaleuca,'' Ms. Morton said. She refers to the tall, thin
trees with papery bark as ``weed trees.''
   If the tree is not stopped, the Everglades will eventually
disappear under a forest of melaleuca, biologists fear. The tree is
hard to control because it grows rapidly and because it has an
unusual defense mechanism: It sends out a load of airborne seeds at
the first sign of heat from a fire or even the chop of an ax.
   Maffei said the melaleuca and the deteriorating water quality
are the Everglades' two biggest environmental problems.
   Since 1985, Loxahatchee and other Everglades-area parks have
been using ``hack and squirt'' methods to control the tree, said
Maffei.
   That labor-intensive process involves hacking each tree and
injecting an herbicide. Trees are also uprooted and seedlings are
pulled and burned.
   The method has eliminated about 50,000 melaleuca, but Maffei
estimates hundreds of thousands remain in his park alone.
   Last week's spraying test could be a first step in finding a
cheaper, faster method of controlling the melaleuca. Utility
companies have been using the spray to control growth along their
transmission lines with good results, Maffei said.
   But a refuge is not a utility company, and the effects of the
aerial spraying must be carefully evaluated, he said.
   ``We have to worry about the other plants, the wildlife and the
period of time the chemical stays in the habitat,'' Maffei said.
   Something must be done, however, he said.
   ``If we don't stop the melaleuca, we are going to lose all the
native habitat anyway,'' said the biologist.

   The tanks rolled north of Israel's self-designated security zone
and backed up hundreds of heavily armed troops who combed Lebanon's
rugged southern foothills, searching for Palestinian guerrillas.
   Lebanese police said Syrian forces went on ``maximum alert'' as
Israeli fighters neared Syrian troops. No clashes were reported.
   The operation was part of a push into the southeastern Arkoub
region that began Monday evening. The army said the incursion aimed
at smashing anti-Israeli guerrilla groups responsible for recent
raids into northern Israel.
   In the pre-dawn darkness, before helicopter gunships began troop
transport, Israeli artillery shelled areas around Ain Ata and
several nearby villages. No one was reported hurt.
   Then about 500 Israeli soldiers, armed with automatic weapons
and rocket launchers, were flown to the northern edge of Ain Ata, a
police spokesman said.
   Six Israeli tanks and nine armored personnel carriers later
rolled into the town, about 1{ miles north of Israel's
self-designated security zone in south Lebanon.
   Israel created the zone in 1985 after it withdrew its army,
which had occupied Lebanon since 1982.
   Israeli troops conducted what appeared to be a house-to-house
search in the town, said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity in line with standing regulations.
   Before the search began Israeli troops sealed off all approaches
to Ain Ata and five surrounding villages. Helicopters dropped
leaflets calling on the population to cooperate in the search for
guerrillas.
   Only villagers who work for the Lebanese regular army were
allowed to leave. This reporter, who lives in Ain Ata, was also
allowed to leave after he showed his Associated Press card.
   Israeli troops also entered five other Arkoub villages policed
by a Norwegian battalion of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in south
Lebanon and conducted a 10-hour search for guerrillas, U.N.
officials said.
   They said the Israelis finished the search in the midafternoon.
It was not clear whether anyone was detained.
   Later Tuesday, about 400 ground troops were seen entering
Lebanon from Metulla, in the far northeastern corner of Israel.
Some flashed ``V'' for victory signs. Others sang Israeli
nationalist songs.
   A police spokesman said the Syrian command ordered its estimated
16,000 troops in the nearby Bekaa Valley on maximum alert. Ain Ata
is four miles from Syrian positions.
   ``There have been no clashes, but the Syrians have their tanks
dug in on hills overlooking the Israeli operational zone,'' the
police spokesman said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel's military
operation in Lebanon would not lead to a prolonged entanglement or
provoke a confrontation with Syria.
   ``There's totally no danger of entanglement in Lebanon,'' Shamir
told Israel radio. ``I am certain that the Israeli army took into
account all the possibilities.''
   He described the operation as part of Israel's policy of
conducting sweeps in south Lebanon and added: ``It is a usual
action of watching and securing the area from attacks by
terrorists.''
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said
in a statement that he ``deplores this further violation of
Lebanese sovereignty.'' He also called for the withdrawal of
Israeli troops.
   In Washington, the Reagan administration called for withdrawal
of all foreign forces from Lebanon.
   Lebanon's central government in Beirut, its power eroded by 13
years of civil war between pro-Syrian Moslems and Israel-allied
Christians, ordered its U.N. Ambassador, Rashid Fakhoury, to lodge
a ``strongly worded complaint'' against the Israeli action with the
Security Council.
   An Israeli commander in Lebanon, who was not identified by name,
said on Israel radio that he told soldiers:
   ``This operation is not a night-long operation in which you go
in now and return in the morning. Don't be speedy in pressing the
trigger ... but if you do shoot, you mean it seriously and shoot in
order to kill.''
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the United Nations force in south
Lebanon, said it appeared 1,500 to 2,000 Israeli troops were
involved in the operation. But Israeli sources said fewer than
1,000 were taking part.
   The operation was Israel's largest in Lebanon since February
1986, when it sent more than 1,000 troops and dozens of tanks into
south Lebanon to search for two soldiers captured by Lebanese
guerrillas. The soldiers were never found.
   The 100-square-mile Arkoub was the main base of Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas for cross-border
attacks into Israel before Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   The region was then known as Fatahland, after Arafat's
mainstream Fatah guerrilla faction. Palestinian and leftist
guerrillas have lately been active again in the Arkoub and have
conducted several raids into Israel.
   Israeli officials say the increase in cross-border raids is
linked to the five-month Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Israeli incursion followed two such raids last week in which
two Israeli soldiers and five guerrillas were killed.
   Syria, Lebanon's main power broker, maintains 25,000 troops in
the Bekaa and northern Lebanon under a 1976 mandate from the Arab
League to try to end Lebanon's civil war.

   President Reagan said today that ``no policy
or decision'' he's made has been influenced by astrology, but the
White House confirmed that Nancy Reagan follows astrology and
checks it in terms of the president's activities.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reagans were
not happy about the sudden focus on astrology and the first couple.
``They both feel it's unfortunate and a distraction and hardly
relevant to the business of government,'' he said.
   ``It's true that Mrs. Reagan has an interest in astrology,''
Fitzwater added. ``She has for some time, particularly following
the assassination attempt in March of 1981. She was very concerned
for her husband's welfare, and astrology has been a part of her
concern in terms of his activities.''
   Fitzwater said he did not know whether the president himself had
consulted any astrologers, but noted that Reagan has mentioned
``lucky numbers'' in speeches and has jokingly referred to Abraham
Lincoln's ghost living in the family quarters.
   One newspaper said that Mrs. Reagan had insisted on the date and
time for the signing of the U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating
intermediate-range nuclear missiles after consulting an astrologer.
``I don't know in any detailed sense'' if that is true, Fitzwater
said.
   Meanwhile, a Los Angeles astrologer asserted in an interview
that Reagan ``has used astrology throughout his career, using
astrology to pick his inauguration and other big events.''
   The astrologer, Joyce Jillson, also claimed she helped Reagan's
first presidential campaign choose George Bush as his running mate.
She did not provide specific evidence to back up her claim.
Moreover, she said she ``spent a lot of time'' at the White House
after the assassination attempt.
   Asked about her statement, Fitzwater said, ``I wouldn't be
surprised we start hearing from all kinds of astrologers because of
this.'' He said they would be ``coming out of the walls.''
   Former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan, in a new
book, claims Mrs. Reagan turned to astrologers to help determine
the president's schedule.
   Reagan, asked about the reports while signing a proclamation in
the Roosevelt Room, said he was making it a policy not to comment
on books by former White House staffers.
   However, he added, ``no policy or decision in my mind has ever
been influenced by astrology.''
   Asked if astrology played a part in shaping his schedule, Reagan
said with a smile, ``You know I'm still looking for the fellas that
tell me every day what I'm going to do.''
   On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Jim Wright was asked what he
thought about the Reagans using astrologists. He replied with a
grin: ``It's all right with me. I'm glad he consults somebody.''
   ``We should check whether (astrologer) Jeanne Dixon recommended
a veto of the trade bill,'' added House Majority Whip Tony Coelho,
D-Calif.
   Wright added, ``It's a full moon out there. Now that's what
brings the crazies out.''
   Current and former White House aides, meanwhile, expressed
skepticism about the reports.
   Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press secretary, said ``I'm not
aware that any changes were made'' in the president's schedule
because of astrological forecasts.
   Asked whether the first family made decisions based on
astrology, she replied, ``Don't you read your horoscope?''
   Lyn Nofziger, a former White House aide and associate of the
Reagans for more than two decades, said, ``I have never once heard
her allude to astrology or to the stars or to the moon or to the
sign of the ram.''
   He said the president liked to read his horoscope and ``laughed
about it and kidded about it, but I have never seen him take the
stuff seriously.
   ``I can never recall a single time when we did something
politically because somebody said the stars are wrong,'' added
Nofziger.
   Michael K. Deaver, another longtime Reagan associate and
one-time deputy presidential chief of staff, said, ``I'm not
interested in commenting on it.''
   Ms. Jillson, a Los Angeles astrologer whose daily horoscope is
distributed to more than 100 newspapers by Tribune Media Services,
said today that the Reagans have regulary consulted with
astrologers.
   ``It's an input that they receive. I don't like to use the word
rely,'' Ms. Jillson said.
   ``The president has used astrology throughout his career, using
astrology to pick his inauguration and other big events. Look at
when he holds his news conferences. They're usually during a full
moon. He chooses those times to do it,'' she said.
   Ms. Jillson says she list politicians among her clientele,
including Washington lawmakers, aides and campaign officials. She
refused to reveal their names. Asked point-blank whether she had
done consulting for the Reagans, she replied, ``I never discuss
clients.''
   However, she said she was at the White House after Reagan's
assassination attempt in 1981 and helped unidentified campaign
officials in the choosing of Bush as vice president in 1980.
   ``I have been to the White House. I spent a lot of time at the
White House after the assassination attempt in March,'' Ms. Jillson
said.
   ``There was talk that I did charts for all eight (vice
presidential) candidates. I don't deny that. I determined the only
winnable choice was George Bush.''
   Regan is expected to document examples in which Mrs. Reagan used
astrology to determine the timing of speeches, major events and
announcements in his soon-to-be-released book, The Washington Post
and The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in today's editions.
   The Inquirer, citing unidentified White House sources, said Mrs.
Reagan insisted that the president and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev sign the INF treaty at 1:30 p.m. on Dec. 8. According to
the sources, Mrs. Reagan was adamant about the time even when aides
suggested rescheduling the event.
   Newsweek magazine and NBC News reported on Monday that the
scheduling of major events had sometimes been changed because the
Reagans said an astrologer had indicated another time would be
better.
   The president was aware of the practice and approved of it, the
Post said.
   Mrs. Reagan consulted a number of astrologers, including Carroll
Righter, a Los Angeles astrologer mentioned in Reagan's 1965
autobiography, ``Where's The Rest Of Me?'', the Post said.
   Righter, who prepared astrological stars for several Hollywood
stars, died Saturday at the age of 88.
   Using the signs of the zodiac, on which horoscopes are based,
Reagan, born on Feb. 6, is an Aquarius. His wife, born on July 6,
is a Cancer.

   A man pulled a gun and opened fire at a Post
Office window today after he was told his Social Security check
could not be found, and two postal workers injured before the
assailant himself was wounded, officials said.
   Jim Bordenet, a postal spokesman, said that when the shots were
fired about 40 customers and employees ``hit the floor.'' There
were no other injuries and the entire incident lasted about one
minute, he said.
   The clerk at the general delivery window was treated at the
scene for a scalp wound, while a postal security officer, who
exchanged shots with the gunman, was hit in the upper arm and taken
to a hospital.
   Bordenet identified the gunman as Kurt Malcolm Allen, 45, of
Seattle. Allen, who had been hit in the buttocks, was arrested by
police officers outside the post office, Bordenet said.
   Allen was taken by ambulance to Harborview Medical Center where
he was listed in satisfactory condition.
   Bordenet said the incident began shortly after Allen entered the
post office about 9 a.m. in search of his Social Security check.
   Allen appeared angry when the check could not be found and
confronted Fatish Kumar Varma, who was staffing the general
delivery window, Bordenet said.
   ``The guy became more and more angry ... Varma tried to calm
him,'' Bordenet said.
   But the man pulled a gun, shooting at Varma, who ducked,
Bordenet said. Varma was shot from ``point blank'' range. ``He was
very lucky,'' Bordenet said.
   Amzie Woodruff, a postal security officer, confronted Allen, who
fired several shots with a handgun, Bordenet said. Woodruff
returned fire and hit Allen, Bordenet and Harborview officials said.

   The House Judiciary Committee approved by
voice vote Tuesday legislation to impose federal criminal sanctions
against major contractors who are convicted of defrauding the U.S.
government.
   The measure, introduced by Rep. Bill Hughes, D-N.J., chairman of
the Judiciary crime subcommittee, also establishes a new system of
rewards and job protections for so-called ``whistleblowers'' in
private industry who provide information leading to convictions in
fraud cases.
   Hughes said the legislation is intended to crack down on a
procurement fraud problem which is robbing the government of
hundreds of millions of dollars a year and, in some cases, costing
lives.
   He said the proposed law would give the Justice Department a
more precise tool to use against contractors who attempt to defraud
the government on contracts of $1 million or more.

   The State Department warned American diplomats
and businesses around the world Tuesday to guard against terrorist
retaliation for U.S. military action against Iran in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``The government of Iran has practiced terrorism for the past
nine years,'' spokesman Charles E. Redman said. ``Senior Iranian
officials in recent weeks have threatened terrorist acts in
retaliation for U.S. actions in the gulf.''
   ``The U.S. takes all such threats seriously and has advised
posts to take appropriate precautions,'' Redman said.
   A warning was sent last Wednesday to U.S. diplomatic missions,
military installations and American companies operating abroad. The
government keeps the private concerns informed of security
conditions because they also have been targets of anti-American
action.
   State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
quoted the warning as saying: ``The U.S. government possesses
information which leads it to believe that the government of Iran
will authorize terrorist attacks against U.S. targets in the very
near future. We further believe that these attacks will be
deliberately designed to cause U.S. fatalities and or destruction
to U.S. facilities.''
   It said the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Europe were the most
likely areas for attack, ``although no area can be completely
precluded as an area of operation.''
   Since the increase of U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf, notably
the buildup of naval forces protecting shipping in the waterway,
American posts abroad have been under a general alert to guard
against terrorism.
   The sense of danger was heightened after April 18, when the
United States sank or crippled several Iranian ships and destroyed
two oil platforms in the gulf, reportedly killing 44 Iranians. The
military action prompted Iranian threats.
   The day after the attack, Iranian President Ali Khamenei said
``we declare that we will forcefully respond to America's bullying
in attacking oil platforms and killing innocent people.''
   Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashami said, ``American
interests in the world, whether in Europe, Western or Middle
Eastern countries or even inside the United States, should be
directly attacked by the forces of the Islamic revolution in the
world and the Hezbollah cells in various countries.''
   Hezbollah is the Iranian-sponsored group identified by the
United States as the kidnappers of several Americans in Beirut.
   The Tehran daily newspaper Keyhan quoted an unidentified
spokesman for the Iranian War Information Headquarters as saying on
Monday:
   ``If the U.S. intends to perpetrate a new mischief, it will
without any doubt, taste the bitterness of our hit-backs that will
not be confined to the Persian Gulf. We will retaliate (against)
U.S. mischief in any fields, and U.S. interests throughout the
world will be attacked by Muslims who sympathize with the Islamic
revolution.''

<HEAD>Doctors Separate Siamese Twins Joined At Head</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors separated 17-month-old
Siamese twins, joined at the head, in an intricate operation
Tuesday that took 7{ hours, officials at Soweto's Baragwanath
hospital reported.
   They described the surgery by a 40-member medical team on Mpho
and Mphonyana Mathibela as successful. The hospital is in the huge
black township outside Johannesburg.
   Sophie Mathibela, mother of the girls, said: ``I feel so happy.
... I want to sleep a little, pray and thank God for all he has
done.''
   A statement by the hospital said Mpho, the stronger of the two,
was doing well but Mphonyana suffered extensive blood loss and was
in critical condition. It did not elaborate.
   Last September, doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore,
Md., separated West German twins joined at the head. The two boys,
Benjamin and Patrick Binder, survived and were released in March,
but are said to have some physical and mental problems.
   Johns Hopkins doctors advised those at Baragwanath on the
difficulties they were likely to face.
   Members of the medical team performed two operations on the
girls last October in preparation for Tuesday's surgery.
   In those operations, doctors partially clamped a shared major
blood vessel in the twins' heads in hopes that lesser blood vessels
would take over its functions.
   Dr. Robert Lipschitz, chief of the surgical team, told a news
conference last Friday chances for success were not good.
   ``This is going to be a ... lengthy, intricate operation which
carries many dangers with it,'' he said. ``The prognosis is still
very grave.''
   Ms. Mathibela, an unmarried, 33-year-old domestic worker who
earns about $60 a month, gave birth to the twins Dec. 7, 1986.
   She attended a prayer service in the hospital chapel Tuesday
morning. About 100 people, most of them nurses and patients, said
prayers and sang hymns for the girls.
   The mother said she had been horrified by giving birth to
Siamese twins and refused to see the girls for three days, but
``once persuaded to see them, I immediately accepted and loved my
little gifts from God.''
   They had a combined weight of 33 pounds before the surgery. Mpho
appears to be developing normally and recently began to speak, but
Mphonyana is slightly smaller and does not appear to be as
advanced, said officials at Baragwanath, the main hospital in
Soweto.
   Ms. Mathibela was asked to make a $5 contribution to the costs
of the operations and related care, which will total hundreds of
thousands. The costs are being absorbed by the hospital and the
Witwatersrand University medical school.
   The Sowetan, a daily newspaper that covers the black township,
established a trust fund for the twins and the equivalent of about
$26,000 has been raised.

   Jesse Jackson and his wife Jacqueline reported
income of nearly $210,000 during 1987 and paid one-fourth of that
in federal income taxes, according to copies of their tax returns
released today.
   Jackson's Democratic presidential campaign released copies of
his returns for 1984 through 1987.
   The bulk of the Jacksons' income last year, $159,000, came from
Personalities International Inc., a corporation headed by Mrs.
Jackson that provides management for personalities, and which
handles Jackson's earnings from speeches and publications.
   They reported Jackson received $46,535 for unspecified business
services. Together with dividends, interest and other income, their
1987 unadjusted gross income was $209,358. They paid $53,631 in
federal taxes.
   The Jacksons' total income was up from $59,453 in 1984, the year
of his first presidential campaign.

<HEAD>Healthy Breakfast Tied to Higher Test Scores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A healthy breakfast helped Lawrence
students score higher on tests, according to a study released
Tuesday.
   About 1,000 children in third through sixth grades from six
schools were involved in the study conducted by two Boston
pediatricians.
   Alan Meyers and Michael Weitzman of Boston City Hospital
presented their findings Tuesday in Washington, D.C., at the annual
research meeting of the Ambulatory Pediatric Association. They hope
to encourage colleagues to push for a national breakfast program.
   ``Only a handful of states besides Massachusetts mandate the
breakfast program,'' said Meyers. ``We are trying to give these
kids every break they can have. It looks like there may be some
benefit here.''
   Massachusetts ordered communities with large numbers of poor
families to begin school breakfasts in January 1987. The Lawrence
study began three months after the law took effect. Test scores
from 335 children in the program were compared to scores from 688
children who were not. Almost all the children were from poor
families.
   Among the results:
   _ Test scores showed greater improvement for children in the
breakfast program. Their scores went up 13.5 percent the following
year, compared to 11 percent for children not in the program.
   _ Children in the program were late or absent less frequently,
and breakfast eaters made fewer mistakes in the morning.
   School lunches are now available to most U.S. children, but
breakfast is offered to about 40 percent.
   The study estimates about 600,000 children skip breakfast every
day. Cost is a problem. The federal government spent $400 million
in 1986 to serve breakfast to 33,000 public school students, Meyers
said.

<HEAD>Junior High Girls Admit Trying To Give Poison To Vice Principal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FOREST LAKE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three girls accused of conspiring to
kill an assistant principal by putting lye in his coffee have
pleaded guilty to a reduced charge, officials said.
   A seventh-grader and two ninth-graders at Forest Lake Southwest
Junior High School in east-central Minnesota admitted to juvenile
delinquency petitions _ the juvenile court equivalent of guilty
pleas _ accusing them of conspiracy to commit bodily harm by
adulteration.
   ``It means they conspired to put poison in their assistant
principal's coffee cup, but it wasn't intended to kill him,''
Washington County Juvenile Court Judge J.E. Cass said.
   On Feb. 25, Vice Principal Robert Espelien became suspicious
when he saw a brownish-tan substance, which tests later showed was
lye, floating in his coffee cup. Espelien did not drink the coffee.
   The Washington County attorney's office filed juvenile petitions
accusing the students of conspiring to commit murder in the first
degree. The girls were suspended from school and later expelled for
the remainder of the 1987-88 term.
   In Minnesota, juvenile court matters are usually kept
confidential, but in certain situations judges have discretion to
disclose some facts of a case.
   Cass said he decided to release some information because of
widespread public interest in the case, but declined to reveal
what, if any, penalties were applied.
   ``I wish I could release more information,'' Cass said. ``These
cases don't have a lot of value as deterrents to crime unless the
public knows what happened in court.''

   Lines snaked outside federal immigration centers in cities
around the country Tuesday, as thousands of undocumented aliens
applied for legal residency status a day ahead of the deadline for
the yearlong program.
   To accommodate late applicants, all 107 offices of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service will remain open until
midnight Wednesday, the deadline for the yearlong amnesty program.
Many district offices extended hours Tuesday, too.
   In Baltimore, the line of applicants stretched around the block
Tuesday morning, as people waited for the district office to open,
said Louis D. Crocetti, acting deputy district director.
   Two weeks ago, Crocetti said his office was processing 15 to 20
applications a day. Now it's more than 200 a day.
   ``I just kept procrastinating, but the time just caught up with
me,'' Anna Maldonado, 26, of Mexico said Tuesday as she waited with
750 other people at the INS office in downtown Los Angeles.
   Her sister, Carmen, who applied for amnesty in January,
persuaded her to apply, she said.
   ``The applications are finally coming in,'' said INS spokesman
James Jasey in New York, where more than 500 applicants stood in
line at midday outside the Manhattan office.
   As of Sunday, 1.33 million applications had been received,
according to the INS. An additional 464,000 people are seeking
legal status under a separate program for seasonal agricultural
workers. The deadline for that program is Nov. 30.
   Applicants who file by the deadline also may request up to 60
days for submitting other documents necessary to prove they have
lived in the United States continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982.
   ``We've gotten dramatically busier in the last few days,'' said
Roger Nye, chief legalization officer for the INS office in Boston,
which handles applications from Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New
Hampshire.
   ``Our average throughout the program has been about 28
applications a day but last week we had 828, which works out to
over 160 a day. And (Monday) alone we had 329 applicants and I
expect to surpass that by a good deal today.''
   In Charlotte, N.C., the INS office received 204 applications on
Monday; it had received 454 applications in the preceding three
weeks. However, about 90 percent of the applicants came from farm
workers who have the longer deadline.
   ``We knew it was going to happen this way,'' said Ana Pardo,
chief immigration officer for North and South Carolina.
   In Los Angeles, nearly 1,000 Central American applicants for
political asylum lined up overnight at the main federal building,
mistakenly believing that they, too, faced a deadline.
   ``I had to call up a couple of federal police officers to
assist. There was a mob outside,'' guard Walter Bonner said
Tuesday. ``It was like a stampede when we opened the doors at 5
a.m.''
   The San Francisco district, which covers Nothern California, is
handling close to 4,000 applications a day, up from a high of about
600 a day in early February, according to INS spokesman John R.
Davis.
   South Florida immigration offices have mostly escaped long
lines, but local INS director Perry Rivkind said Tuesday the number
of applications had increased sharply recently.
   ``It's been running about 2,000 a day,'' he said. ``But we have
no problem taking applications.'' About 110,000 people have applied
for amnesty there, and Rivkind said he expects the total to reach
125,000.
   One reason the program has not had as great an impact in South
Florida is that the two most populous immigrant groups _ Cubans and
Haitians _ had their situation legalized under special legislation
that followed the 1980 Mariel boatlift, said Rivkind.
   Nonetheless, Rivkind said he expected a ``last-minute push''
Wednesday and promised ``we'll take everyone _ even if we have to
wake 'em up in line.''

   South-West African guerrilla leader Sam Nujoma
said Tuesday he had come to the United States to meet with the
three presidential candidates and seek their support for South
Africa's expulsion from the territory, also known as Namibia.
   Nujoma said he had been assured by campaign managers for
Democratic hopefuls Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson that he would
meet with the two candidates during his stay here. Vice President
George Bush has not responded to his request for a meeting, Nujoma
added.
   Nujoma, who heads the South-West African People's Organization
(SWAPO), also said he had received assurances from Angola that
Namibia's interests would be faithfully represented at negotiations
being held in London Tuesday between American, South African, Cuban
and Angolan representatives.
   The talks are designed to get Cuba to pull out its 37,000
soldiers from Angola, in return for a pullout of South Africa's
estimated 40,000 troops from Namibia. ``It will be a package, I am
assured of this by the Angolan government,'' he said in an
interview.
   But South Africa is doing ``all it can to strengthen its hold''
on the mineral-rich territory, stepping up a campaign of arson and
bombing attacks against Namibia's predominantly black population of
1.5 million, Nujoma said. He accused South Africa of burning down
14 Namibian church schools last month.
   ``South Africa has no intention whatsoever to leave Namibia,''
said Nujoma, who has lived in exile for 28 years, the last 12 in
Angola. The South Africans will have to be ``forced out by the
combined resistance of the Namibian people and international
pressure.''
   He commended the economic sanctions imposed by Congress on South
Africa in 1986 and urged the next U.S. administration to take
further steps to pressure South Africa into relinquishing Namibia.
   Nujoma said he had requested a meeting with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz but had not received any response. A State
Department official said she did not know of such a request.
   The United States supports a South African pullout and an
independent Namibia, but its contacts with SWAPO have been limited.
   South Africa is ruling Namibia under an expired League of
Nations mandate, in defiance of a 1978 U.N. resolution which calls
for Namibian independence.
   Nujoma also said that should the United States be willing to
supply SWAPO with weapons ``we will certainly accept it with great
pleasure.''
   Most of the group's arms and training come from the Soviet
Union, Cuba, Yugoslavia, Angola and several other members of the
Organization of African Unity, he said.
   Iran, India, and the Scandinavian countries supply humanitarian
assistance to SWAPO, Nujoma said.

<HEAD>Crowe Says Iran A Serious Foe Despite Recent Setback</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE _ The following was based on a Pentagon news pool
report.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS CORONADO IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., said
Tuesday that Iran remains a dangerous foe in the Persian Gulf
despite heavy losses in battles with the Navy two weeks ago.
   ``I believe the Iranians would clearly like to damage us, to
hurt us, to humiliate us if they could,'' Crowe, the nation's top
military commander, said during a surprise visit to the gulf.
   ``I think terrorism is one of the ways that they might try to do
it. It's a very serious threat.''
   Crowe presided at an awards ceremony on the sun-baked after deck
of the 15,000-ton USS Coronado.
   He plans to visit at least three of the 28 other U.S. warships
in the area, including the mine-damaged 3,700-ton guided missile
frigate Samuel B. Roberts, on his two-day tour.
   Iran has warned Washington not to mount new military actions in
the Persian Gulf and has threatened reprisals from anywhere in the
world.
   Crowe was interviewed by the Pentagon media pool.
   The admiral said he was disappointed at the Reagan
administration's decision against sending six fast Coast Guard
cutters to help patrol the gulf.
   ``They would have been very useful in these shallow waters
because we need fast boats with shallow drafts,'' he said. ``They
are the best patrol boats in the world and the Navy had no
substitute.''
   Crowe said he was aware of, but could not confirm, reports that
Iran may have 100 new C-801 type Chinese missiles, a much more
sophisticated missle than the land-based, anti-ship Chinese
Silkworms Tehran has deployed so far.
   He said the Pentagon still had not decided if Iran actually
fired Silkworms at U.S. ships in the April 18 battle, even though
reports from ships in the area initially identified incoming
missiles as Silkworms.
   President Reagan had warned Tehran that U.S. forces would strike
at coastal Silkworm missile batteries if they were ever fired at
American ships.
   Iran's Revolutionary Guards have used a fleet of about 50
Swedish-built Boghammer armed speed boats to harass shipping in the
gulf.
   Tehran said on Monday it has resumed boarding ships in the gulf
to determine if they are carrying cargoes to Iraq for use in the
7{-year-old war with Iran.
   Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less, commander of the Joint Task Force
Middle East, said ``the biggest headache is the opportunity they
have to put mines out there.''
   Nearly 50 mines have been found in the gulf this year, but Less
said that no new ones have been detected recently by the fleet of
allied mine sweepers that roam the gulf waterway through which 20
percent of the world's oil is shipped.
   Crowe, 63, called the recent sea battle with Iran ``unique in
the annals of U.S. Navy history'' because of the exchanges of
missile fire and praised the men for their performance.
   In a brief ceremony on the afterdeck, Crowe presented awards
that included the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star and
Air Medal to 13 pilots and crew members for bravery during the
action April 18.
   During the action, American forces attacked two Iranian oil
platforms and sank or disabled six naval craft in raids described
by Washington as a ``measured response'' to hostile acts, including
the mining of gulf waters and firing on U.S. helicopters.

   The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff said Tuesday that despite recent losses fighting the U.S.
Navy, Iran remains a dangerous force whose threats of revenge
cannot be dismissed.
   ``They have a considerable capability and they have standoff
missile capability which we are always concerned about,'' Adm.
William J. Crowe Jr. told reporters after a shipboard ceremony.
   Crowe decorated 13 U.S. Navy officers and men for actions during
the clashes between U.S. and Iranian naval forces in the Persian
Gulf April 18.
   He said that although Iran lost six naval craft including two of
its best frigates during the daylong battles, ``there are a number
of threats that the Iranian navy still represents.
   ``I believe the Iranians would clearly like to damage us, to
hurt us, to humiliate us if they could. I think terrorism is one of
the ways they might try to do it. It's a very serious threat.''
   A black-painted Iranian mine, inscribed with the famous World
War II slogan, ``Killroy was here,'' was on display as Crowe
officiated at the awards ceremony in 103-degree heat aboard the
U.S. Navy flagship Coronado.
   Meanwhile, a convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers headed up
the Persian Gulf toward Kuwait _ the third in five days as the navy
worked to get its escorted shipments of Kuwaiti oil back on a
regular schedule.
   The convoys, which had been averaging about seven a month since
the first of the year, were delayed for nearly two weeks after a
U.S. guided missile frigate hit a mine in the central gulf and mine
sweepers later found and destroyed about a dozen more.
   The mining of the frigate Samuel B. Roberts on April 14 led to
``Operation Praying Mantis,'' a series of retaliatory strikes
against Iranian oil platforms and other targets four days later.
   Two platforms were destroyed and six Iranian naval craft were
sunk or disabled in the skirmishes in the southern gulf. During the
action, the Iranians fired five missiles at U.S. ships but missed
their targets.
   A U.S. Navy helicopter carrying two crewmen was lost during the
battle.
   Crowe, interviewed by members of a Pentagon news media pool,
said two weeks of technical analysis had not established the type
of missiles fired at the three U.S. warships.
   U.S. officials earlier said they were not Chinese-made Silkworm
anti-ship missiles as electronic monitors aboard the American ships
indicated at the time.
   The admiral also said he could not confirm reports that Iran had
about 100 newer C-801 Chinese missiles, a more advanced weapon than
the 30-year-old Silkworms.
   Among those receiving citations from Crowe were navy pilots who
sank or disabled Iran's frigates Sahand and Sabaland, and others
who had roles in key parts of the actions. Awards included the
Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star and the Air Medal for
valor.
   The 13, dressed in navy whites, stood in a rank on the
helicopter deck to receive their medals. Witnesses, who included
U.S. Ambassador to Bahrain Sam H. Zakhem, said one of the sailors
collapsed in the oppressive heat, the most severe of any day this
year.
   The mine displayed on the 15,500-ton warship was one of nine
found aboard the Iran Ajr, an Iranian landing craft that was
disabled and captured by the Navy last Sept. 21 after
night-prowling U.S. helicopters discovered it sowing mines in a
shipping lane of the central gulf.
   The mines, the familiar Russian-designed horn-type ``myam
mine,'' dating back to 1908, apparently were supplied to Iran by
North Korea, U.S. sources have said.
   During his visit to the gulf region, Crowe will inspect the
mine-damaged Samuel B. Roberts, now undergoing preliminary repair
in a Dubai shipyard. The 3,700-ton, two-year-old warship is to be
returned to the Bath, Maine, shipyard where it was built, for
further work.
   Crowe also was expected to meet with top officials of gulf Arab
governments to explain the new U.S. policy, under which American
warships will be permitted to respond to requests for help from
non-U.S. flag vessels under Iranian attack.

   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. underwent surgery
today to repair an aneurysm in an artery supplying blood to his
brain, according to a spokesman at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
   Hospital spokesman Peter Esker said Biden was awake, resting
comfortably and talking with his family after the operation. He
said Biden would be hospitalized for about 10 days.
   Biden, 45, entered the Washington military hospital on Monday to
prepare for the surgery. The operation had been anticipated since
February when doctors discovered the aneurysm while repairing a
more serious aneurysm discovered earlier.
   An aneurysm is a ballooning of an artery. A weakness in the
artery wall allows the pressure of the blood to force the artery to
swell outward, like a blister. The danger is that the aneurysm will
burst. In the brain, even a mild leakage can be dangerous and
damaging.
   Biden, D-Del., is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
For a few months last year he was a Democratic presidential
candidate.

   Lying beneath a copy of the painting
that made her face famous, the sister of artist Grant Wood talks of
the glory _ and criticism _ she shared as the model for his
``American Gothic.''
   Nan Wood Graham, recognizeable despite the changes of nearly six
decades, recalled the events leading to her posing as the
stern-faced farmer's daughter for the American classic.
   ``He was honest,'' Mrs. Graham, now 88 and blind, said of her
brother, explaining why people admire or dislike the work.
   ``Other painters say, `The portrait doesn't look like him
because I painted what he's thinking.' They hide behind words
because of their lack of talent,'' she said.
   ``But Grant put it all down. He learned his trade and put down
what he saw.''
   Mrs. Graham lives in a convalescent hospital on a quiet street
of Menlo Park, about 30 miles south of San Francisco. In an
interview Monday, she remembered how ``American Gothic'' changed
her brother's life and her own.
   Wood, who had developed a straightforward style in depicting the
land and people of his native Iowa, was inspired by a house in the
town of Eldon.
   Driving by the house one day, Wood was taken with its sole
decoration, a second-story window in the form of a simple Gothic
arch.
   ``His main idea was to (show) the kind of people he thought
would live in that kind of a house,'' Mrs. Graham said.
   Wood didn't want to disturb the residents, so he asked the
Woods' family dentist, Byron McKeeby, 62, and Nan, then 30, to pose.
   In what became one of America's best-known paintings, McKeeby,
dressed in overalls and holding a pitchfork, and Nan, hair drawn
back and wearing an apron over a plain dark dress adorned only by a
cameo, stand solemnly in front of the house. The rural father and
daughter appear as practical and as plain as the white wooden
building.
   But while the painting made Wood's reputation, it also angered
many Iowa farmers.
   ``They said if farmers really looked like that, they better take
to bootlegging,'' Mrs. Graham recalled.
   She herself became the target of the farm wives' wrath.
   ``They thought that Grant was making fun of them. So they wrote
to the newspaper all sorts of insults. The worst one was `That
woman's face ... would sour milk.' ''
   At her brother's suggestion, Nan answered the critics with a
letter of her own.
   ``I said that I posed for it and I was proud that I had. Well,
the situation changed immediately. They were very apologetic and
said they didn't mean what they said,'' she said.
   ``They even began bringing farm products up to us ... and
invited Grant to vacations on their farms.'' The Wood family was
living in Cedar Rapids at that time.
   To make up for the nasty comments, Wood later painted a portait
of his sister as a present.
   ``That was my reward,'' Mrs. Graham said. ``He thought that
secretly, I was hurt.''
   She was, a little, but Mrs. Graham has no regrets about posing.
She delights in the ``glory,'' even though it meant being stopped
frequently in the street, as recently as several years ago.
   Mrs. Graham said she enjoyed fashion design and ``kind of went
into the business,'' selling her creations to a few satisfied
customers.
   ``I'm sorry I didn't take it up more seriously,'' she said.
``But I was too interested in a good time _ dates and running
around.''
   Six years before posing for ``American Gothic,'' Nan Wood
married Edward Graham. He invested in real estate, and the Grahams,
who had no children, lived all over the country.
   Wood, who continued to portray the people of the Midwest, died
of cancer in 1942. ``American Gothic'' is part of the permanent
collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.

   Thomas Sullivan Magnum went out in style,
winning first place in the Nielsen ratings and giving CBS its first
clear claim to first place this season.
   The ``Magnum, P.I.'' movie special Sunday night got a rating of
32.0 for the week ended May 1, more than eight points ahead of
second-place NBC's ``Cheers.''
   CBS knocked its competition, the ABC miniseries on Aristotle
Onassis and the NBC movie ``Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome,'' out of
the ball park. The ``Magnum'' movie ranks as the 14th-highest rated
made-for-TV movie ever.
   An original episode of ``Murder, She Wrote,'' in fifth place,
also helped CBS win the week.
   ``It goes to show what a couple of hit shows can do for you,''
said Arnold Becker, CBS vice president for television research in
Los Angeles.
   The victory for CBS was its first clear title this season. NBC
was second and ABC was third. In the previous week, CBS was third
and NBC was first. CBS tied with NBC for first for the week ended
April 10. CBS also grabbed first place in the opening round of the
May sweeps.
   ``Magnum, P.I.'' ended eight years with a two-hour movie special
that allowed Magnum, played by Tom Selleck, to get his personal
life in order, including the return of his daughter, and to rejoin
the Navy as a commander.
   The show also cleared up whether Jonathan Higgins, played by
John Hillerman, was really best-selling novelist Robin Masters. The
answer was no.
   CBS was first for the week with a rating of 13.9 in the A.C.
Nielsen Co. survey. NBC was second with 13.4 and ABC was third with
12.1. The rating is a percentage of the nation's estinated 88.6
million households with television.
   In the May sweeps, CBS took an early lead. The Arbitrons, from
April 27 to May 1: CBS 14.9, NBC 13.7, ABC 10.1. The Nielsens, from
April 28-May 1: CBS 15.8, NBC 13.8, ABC 9.0. The sweeps are periods
in which the audiences of local television stations are measured to
set their advertising rates.
   Here are the top 10 shows: CBS Sunday Movie ``Magnum, P.I.''
NBC's ``Cheers,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``A Different
World,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' NBC's ``Golden Girls,'' ABC's
``Just the 10 of Us,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' ABC movie ``Little Girl
Lost,'' and ABC ``Growing Pains'' special.
   The ``Growing Pains'' special was the opening for the new spring
series ``Just the 10 of Us.'' ``Little Girl Lost'' was ABC's
highest-rated movie of the year.
   The movie pilot of the ABC series ``China Beach'' was in 12th
place; the first episode was 21st.
   The ABC Sunday miniseries ``The Richest Man in the World: The
Story of Aristotle Onassis'' placed 37th. The NBC Sunday movie
``Mad Mad: Beyond Thunderdome'' was 57th.
   The five bottom shows were: ABC's ``Ohara,'' ABC's ``Hotel,''
ABC's ``Buck James,'' CBS' ``Houston Knights'' and ABC's ``Max
Headroom.''
   The shows on the Fox Broadcasting Co. network got higher ratings
than some of the network shows. ``America's Most Wanted'' did
better than ``Houston Knights'' and Fox's ``Married With Children''
and ``21 Jump Street'' came in ahead of ``Max Headroom.''
   The two-hour movie pilot for Fox's ``Dirty Dozen'' got a 3.6
rating, more than a full rating point behind ``Max Headroom.''
   ABC came in first among the evening news shows, moving ahead of
CBS. NBC stayed in third place. The ratings: ABC 10.4, CBS 9.6, NBC
8.6.

<HEAD>Ousted Moscow Official Joins Chorus Of Commentary On Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted Moscow Communist Party boss Boris N.
Yeltsin returned to the spotlight Tuesday to join a chorus of
critics of the status quo and to support Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's economic restructuring drive.
   In an article in the daily Construction Gazette, Yeltsin called
on Soviet workers to make the reforms work. He also warned the
Kremlin leadership that it should be careful not to deceive the
people and make them lose faith.
   Yeltsin, who gained wide popularity in the capital with his
raids on food stores and personal inspection of public transit, was
fired as Moscow party leader on Nov. 11 after he criticized the
slow pace of reforms during a closed-door meeting of the party
Central Committee.
   His ouster sent a chill through the ranks of reformists, who
worried that Yeltsin's removal signaled strong resistance to
Gorbachev's efforts at allowing more openness about problems
plaguing Soviet society.
   A week after losing the party job, Yeltsin was named first
deputy chairman of the State Construction Committee, which carries
ministerial rank but falls far short of the influence he enjoyed as
Moscow party leader.
   Construction Gazette sought Yeltsin's comments in connection
with a front-page article on woes in the Soviet contruction
industry, which is having to conform to the same cost-cutting and
efficiency measures as the rest of the economy under the
``perestroika,'' or rebuilding, campaign. It made no reference to
his former party job.
   Yeltsin told the newspaper that Gorbachev's reforms are at a
``decisive phase,'' and that the leadership should be careful to
fulfill the hopes and expectations of the working people.
   ``This hope must not be deceived, or then it will not be easy to
restore faith to the people, to elevate them to great tasks,''
Yeltsin said.
   Success, he said, depends on ``the support of the wide masses of
workers who hope for changes for the better in their lives and link
them with perestroika.''
   He said the reforms could produce some long-needed improvements
in the near future, including better housing, more modern medical
facilities and more schools and kindergartens.
   Housing is still an acute problem in the Soviet Union, where one
family in five lives in dormitories or communal dwellings. A party
program has called for the construction of enough new housing so
each family will have its own home or apartment by the year 2000.
   The Construction Gazette article was the first mass-circulation
Soviet publication to quote Yeltsin since his departure from the
party job. Last month, the inaugural German-language edition of the
weekly Moscow News carried an interview with him. That publication
is printed and distributed abroad.
   Yeltsin's public return came a day after the party daily Pravda
published on its front page a letter from another government
official, who criticized his fellow party members for pursuing
careerist ambitions over the ideals set down by Soviet founder
Vladimir I. Lenin.
   The official, identified as V. Selivanov of the Ministry of the
Aviation Industry, contended that party members have tainted
Lenin's postulate that ``The party is the mind, honor and
conscience of our epoch.''
   He called for improvements within the party as well as industry
and society as part of the restructuring campaign and introduction
of more democracy in Soviet life.
   Tuesday night's edition of the government newspaper Izvestia
carried a lengthy criticism of Soviet industry and agriculture.
   Prominent author Chingiz Aitmatov said Soviets continue to
justify poor production with weak excuses about losses suffered
during World War II, although countries like Japan and West Germany
hit even harder long ago outdistanced Soviet performance.
   Aitmatov, a popular writer whose literary works attack
totalitarianism, said Gorbachev's reforms hold out the only hopes
for improving Soviet farm and factory output.
   The commentaries on democratic and economic reforms appear to be
part of the preparations for next month's party conference, at
which Gorbachev will seek broader endorsement for his campaigns and
likely remove some of the more conservative forces fighting the
changes he has advocated.
   The criticism of social and economic progress to date voiced by
Yeltsin, Selivanov and Aitmatov, and their calls for support for
Gorbachev's reforms, embrace the leader's two main themes of
greater openness and a wholesale rebuilding of the nation.

   President Roh Tae-woo is ready to
share power with the opposition in the National Assembly after his
party's losses in legislative elections, party officials said
Tuesday.
   Officials of Roh's Democratic Justice Party said they wanted to
reach an agreement with the opposition soon so the new National
Assembly can hold its opening session around May 20.
   ``We would favorably consider an opposition demand that the
parliamentary leadership be shared by parties according to their
assembly seats,'' the governing party's floor leader, Kim
Yoon-hwan, said after meeting with senior party leaders.
   Opposition candidates made a strong showing in legislative
elections a week ago, stripping the government party of its
parliamentary majority for the first time in South Korea's modern
history.
   The three opposition parties took 164 seats in the 299-member
assembly. Roh's party won 125 seats, 25 shy of a simple majority. A
handful of independent candidates also won seats.
   Kim, who was appointed floor leader in a shakeup of the party's
leadership on Monday, said formal discussions of the new Assembly's
leadership could start after opposition parties hold their national
conventions next week.
   Kim said the government party wants to hold the speakership but
would cede the two vice speaker's posts to the opposition.
Traditionally, only one vice speaker's post has been left to the
opposition.
   The chairmanships of 13 assembly committees should also be
shared with the opposition, Kim said. In the past, all committees
were headed by governing party members.
   After the legislative elections, the president said he would
``humbly'' accept the outcome. He added he would work with the
opposition to continue to carry out his promises for democratic
reforms.
   In a first move to reorganize the government camp after the
election, Roh replaced the head of his party with a moderate senior
politician. Other senior party posts also were filled with
moderates.
   Government officials said Roh was expected to shake up his
Cabinet, probably next week, but leave Prime Minister Lee Hyun-hae
in place.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, whose Party for Peace and
Democracy emerged as the No. 1 opposition force in the elections,
said he would like to delay debates on controversial issues if they
would disrupt the 1988 Olympics in Seoul.

   Moslem guerrillas killed a town
official and five Philippine employees of an American-run company
in two separate incidents, officials said Tuesday.
   Rebels on Monday shot and killed Vice Mayor Hadji Jallao of
Patikul on Sulu Island, about 600 miles south of Manila, according
to the military's Southern Command.
   The assailants made off with the official's bag, which contained
about $700, the command said. His 14-year-old companion was wounded.
   On nearby Basilan Island, Moslem rebels ambushed a truck of the
American-run Sime-Darby Rubber Co. last Thursday and killed five
farmworkers, the mayor of the town of Lamitan said.
   Mayor Wilfredo Furigay said the workers were returning from the
fields when they were attacked. He said the rebels were extorting
money from plantation owners and transport operators.
   Moslem rebels are fighting for a separate state in the southern
Philippines.

<HEAD>Government Set To Kick Off AIDS Alert Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials on Wednesday will kick off
an intensive three-week campaign to alert Americans about AIDS,
focused around the mailing of a pamphlet on the deadly disease to
every household in the nation.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen, Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop and other top administration health leaders
scheduled a news conference to officially unveil the booklet, whose
contents were being kept secret Tuesday.
   The promotional campaign _ including television spots and
posters in each of the nation's post offices _ is designed to alert
Americans to be looking for the historic pamphlet when it starts
showing up in mailboxes May 26.
   It will be the first time the U.S. government has sent a health
advisory directly to every American with a mailing address.
   The secrecy surrounding the actual content of the document stems
from decision by department officials to apply a strict reading to
congressional directions ordering that a national mailing be
undertaken by June 30.
   That language in the omnibus budget bill covering the current
fiscal year said the mailing was to be prepared and ``distributed
without necessary clearance of the content by any official,
organization or office.''
   Although health department officials have been wary of
discussing preparation of the document, they have acknowledged that
they interpreted the wording to mean that the pamphlet's content
should not be subject to prior scrutiny either by the White House
or Congress itself.
   Congress called for a similar mailing last year, but with less
explicit language. That project was never completed, in part
because of objections raised by some White House officials.
   One of the reasons given was that because President Reagan had
just appointed a White House AIDS commission to make
recommendations on overall AIDS policy, it would be appropriate for
the panel to review any mailing.
   However, the commission did not get into the issue at the time
on grounds that it was just beginning its work and was not ready to
examine specific inititives. The panel was not asked to review the
current mailing and did not ask to be involved.
   ``The commission has not formally or informally been involved in
the planning or preparation or writing of this booklet,'' spokesman
Tom Brandt said Tuesday in an interview.
   He said retired Navy Adm. James Watkins and the panel's
executive director ``are familiar with some elements of it, but
like everybody else in town they are waiting to see it and hope it
is successful.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious,
incurable isease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering
it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons.
   The disease's chief victims have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug users, with a small percentage of cases attributed
to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and
spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500
Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000 have died since
June 1981, according to the CDC.
   HHS spokesman Chuck Kline said the pamphlet will be ``as
complete as it can be within a relatively constrained format,
discussing AIDS in terms of how you can get AIDS, how you can't get
AIDS, the various precautions that can be taken, beginning of
course with avoiding risky behavior.''
   He said there are sections on AIDS and children, AIDS and
dating, babies with AIDS ``and on people with AIDS and the rights
they have and the obligations owed to them.''
   Asked specifically whether it will mention condoms, Kline said:
``This particular mailer addresses all aspects of AIDS and how it
is communicated and how one can avoid _ or if not avoid, at least
provide the best protection for the circumstances.''
   Since 1986, when he issued a 36-page surgeon general's report on
AIDS, Koop has been the administration's most vocal advocate of
condom use for sexually active people who are not in monogomous
relationships.
   That booklet has been distributed to an estimated 19 million
Americans _ many via mail from individual members of Congress who
requested copies to mail to their constituents. The basic themes
laid down in the 1986 report have been repeated in subsequent
Public Health Service documents.
   The outspoken Koop's planned presence at the Wednesday
announcement was an indication the mailing will adhere to the
approach he has been taking on AIDS education and prevention.
   His spokesman, Jim Brown, declined to say what role Koop had
played in preparation of the mailer or whether it will state the
surgeon general's position on condom use.
   ``It would be really difficult to leave out the surgeon general
who has been the voice of this administration speaking out on AIDS
since he was first asked to do the (1986) report by the
president,'' Brown said in an interview.
   Brown noted that Dr. Robert Windom, the No. 2 official in the
health department, and HHS Undersecretary Donald Newman will be
making a simultaneous announcement of the mailing Wednesday in
Geneva at the World Health Organization.
   ``We discovered when we were in London in January (for an AIDS
conference attended by health ministers from almost every country
in the world) that there was a great deal of concern about what the
United States was doing,'' Brown said. ``We thought this was a good
opportunity to show them what we're doing now in addition to all
the things we have done before.''

<TEXT>
   Declaring that ``America's cultural literacy
is at stake,'' federal arts agency chief Frank Hodsoll said Tuesday
he will make a nationwide tour to urge educators to give elementary
school child at least 4{ hours of arts instruction weekly.
   Hodsoll also wants to require high school students to complete
the equivalent of two full years of art courses before they can
graduate, twice as much as Education Secretary William J. Bennett
proposed last December as part of his model high school curriculum.
   If Hodsoll has his way, all junior high school students will be
required to spend at least 15 percent of the school year studying
the arts, exclusive of English studies, with special emphasis on
design and the media arts such as television and movies.
   The proposals aimed at making the arts an integral part of the
school curriculum from kindergarten through the 12th grade were
contained in a 173-page report issued Tuesday by the National
Endowment for the Arts on the state of arts education in America.
   ``The problem is, basic arts education does not exist in the
United States today,'' concluded the endowment, an independent
federal agency which underwrites a wide variety of artistic
projects with a current budget of $167.7 million.
   The report argued that the arts are no less important than
reading, writing and arithmetic, by helping youngsters understand
civilization, develop creativity, learn communications skills and
make critical choices about ``what is good and bad.''
   Nevertheless, the report said, many Americans still view the
arts as a subject not worthy of serious study, and sometimes as
``potentially threatening or even blasphemous.'' Moreover, it said,
school administrators cannot agree on what arts education is.
   It cited a survey conducted three years ago which found that 61
percent of American adults had not attended a live cultural
performance or visited an art gallery or museum in the previous
year.
   Hodsoll, the endowment chairman, told a news conference he will
begin a series of regional meetings around the country next week to
campaign for expanded arts instruction in the schools.
   The first session will be held Monday in St. Louis, where
Hodsoll will confer with state and local education and arts
officials from Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, Nebraska and
Kansas. Conferences tentatively are planned for next fall in New
England, the South and the West Coast.
   Hodsoll acknowledged that his stress on the arts ``will be a
problem in some school districts'' that put primary emphasis on
preparing students to meet foreign competition in science and
technology.
   But he and the endowment report noted that the high-tech
Japanese have made the arts a basic part of their school
curriculum. Hodsoll argued that study of the arts ``helps us to be
masters, not servants, of technology.''
   The endowment study, commissioned by Congress in 1985 and titled
``Toward Civilization,'' prescribed stiffer curriculum
requirements, improved teacher training and credentials standards,
testing and evaluation to provide all students _ not just the
talented or college-bound _ with a thorough education in their
artistic heritage.
   ``Without knowledge and understanding of such supreme
achievements, we are culturally illiterate,'' the report said.
   The report proposed that high schools require two years of art
courses or other approved courses that incorporate the arts for a
graduation diploma, and that they offer optional arts courses for
talented students who want them.
   It said school administrators might consider extending the
school day to seven periods to accommodate the new requirements.

<HEAD>Reagan Decries Attempts at Racial Quotas for Asian College
Applicants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Tuesday the government
will not tolerate informal quotas that exclude some people of Asian
and Pacific heritage from attending colleges or universities.
   Reagan made the statement at a signing ceremony in the Roosevelt
Room for a proclamation designating the week beginning May 8 as
Asian-Pacific American Heritage Week.
   ``I know there's a growing concern that some universities may be
discriminating against citizens of Asian and Pacific heritage,
accepting a lower percentage of these applicants than get admitted
from other groups, despite their academic credentials,'' Reagan
said. He did not cite any examples of discrimination.
   He said the denial of access to higher education when a person
is entitled to it based on merit is ``a repudiation of everything
America stands for.
   ``Let everyone be clear, especially all recipients of federal
education funds, that the use of informal exclusionary racial
quotas or any practice of racial discrimination against any
individual violates the law, is morally wrong and will not be
tolerated.''
   Reagan also recalled that a citizen of Chinese-American descent,
Vincent Chin, was beaten to death in Detroit several years ago by
two men enraged over Japanese car imports.
   ``Political differences over trade policy are one thing,''
Reagan said, ``and we can debate them. But racially tainted appeals
cross a very dangerous line.
   ``They're an affront to this country and they threaten the
tranquility and safety of all of us here at home.''

<HEAD>Man Who Survived Persian Gulf Attack Dies In Burning Car</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who survived an attack on an oil tanker
in the Persian Gulf last month has been found dead in his burned
car, authorities said.
   Lawrence Glass Jr. of Selma, who was featured on the front page
of Sunday's Selma Times-Journal for being among the last to leave
the tanker after dousing flames on the vessel, was found dead
Sunday morning.
   The cause of the fire was unknown, state Fire Marshal Roy
Thornell said Tuesday.
   ``I don't think it was an accident,'' said Glass's father,
Lawrence Sr. ``The heat and the way his car had been pulled off the
road leads me to suspect foul play.''
   Doris Teague, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Public
Safety, said she could not comment on any investigation.
   Glass, 36, was at the Linden Country Club on Saturday afternoon
and met a friend later before leaving around midnight, according to
his father. He said his son smoked but that the friend said he was
not intoxicated when he left the house.
   Thomaston Fire Chief Jeff Laduron said the car was parked beside
Alabama Highway 66 and it appeared Glass ``may have pulled off the
road and gone to sleep and it caught fire.''
   In the interview published Sunday in the Selma newspaper, Glass
said Iranian Revolutionary Guard gunboats on April 18 attacked the
oil tanker on which he was safety engineer. While other crew
members were evacuated, Glass remained aboard to put out fires on
the vessel, which was carrying 353,000 barrels of oil.
   Glass, who worked 35 days on board the oil tanker and then had
35 days off, told the newspaper he hoped to get hazardous duty pay
when he returned to the Persian Gulf in a few weeks.
   Glass, whose survivors include a wife and son, had worked in the
Persian Gulf since 1981.

   Anti-abortion demonstrators shut a medical
office where abortions are performed for the second consecutive day
Tuesday and their protest produced 422 arrests.
   ``We have completed our objective,'' said Lowell Patterson,
spokesman for Operation Rescue, which organized the demonstration.
``The facility was closed for the day and no babies were killed.''
   Protestors from various anti-abortion groups from 20 states
converged on the Women's Medical Office in the borough of Queens
after 8 a.m. and laid down on the sidewalk and street.
   Dozens of officers made arrests, lifting demonstrators by
stretchers and loading them onto buses. They were taken to a park,
charged with disorderly conduct and released, said Officer Janice
Swinney, a police spokesman.
   Two men from a smaller group of pro-choice demonstrators also
were arrested after scuffling with police who were separating the
two groups.
   A man who said he was a doctor answered the phone at the private
clinic Tuesday morning and confirmed the center was closed because
of the protest, which lasted for several hours.
   Police arrested 503 people for disorderly conduct Monday after
Operation Rescue staged a similar demonstration outside a Manhattan
doctor's office.
   During both protests, the demonstrators prayed and sang hymns as
police made arrests.
   Patterson said the group would hold a news conference Wednesday
and demonstrate again Thursday and Friday.

   The meeting occurred as Chileans are preparing for a yes-or-no

expected to be President Augusto Pinochet.
   Aylwin expressed confidence that opposition leaders have the
votes to defeat the expected Pinochet candidacy, which would force

   He said opposition parties have formed a united front against

   ``The agreement of 14 parties in support of a ``no'' vote is

<TEXT>
   The United States said Tuesday it gave more
favorable treatment to the World Health Organization than to other
U.N. agencies and paid its full 1987 budget assessment of $62.8
million.
   Don Newman, undersecretary of health and human services, said in
a speech to the WHO annual assembly: ``The United States has been
able to pay its full assessment for the year 1987.
   ``Through this payment, WHO received favorable treatment over
that accorded to many other organizations in the United Nations
system, including the United Nations itself.''
   He did not elaborate, but sources said privately the Food and
Agricultural Organization, based in Rome, and the U.N. General
Assembly also probably would be paid the full U.S. assessments.
   The United States is assessed about 25 percent of the budgets of
the United Nations and its agencies.
   Payments have been held up by congressional stipulations that
contributions depend on the effectiveness of an agency and its
fairness to the United States, and that overall U.S. payments be
reduced because of the American budget deficit.
   WHO officials and health experts in the United States have said
lack of funds threatened important programs. Warren Furth,
assistant director-general, told reporters in December the lack of
money was certain to affect such life-preserving work as child
immunization.
   Newman did not say when Washington paid its WHO assessment but
U.S. spokesman Art Skop said the decision was made ``very
recently.''
   About 1,200 delegates from the health agency's 166 member
nations are in Geneva for the 41st general assembly. The two-week
meeting began Monday.

   Development of rural America, its small towns
and farms, should rest on diversification and the energies of local
people, a report by the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Roland R. Vautour, undersecretary for small community and rural
development, said cooperative federal efforts now under way are
helping rural communities regain economic stability.
   Vautour said rural communities suffered from inflation in the
late 1970s, global economic recession and farmland value losses in
the early 1980s and from a rise in foreign agricultural production.
   ``In the past, rural economic development has been dependent on
farm policy and income,'' he said. ``We now recognize that the
future growth and stability of the rural economy is dependent on
diversification at the local level, both in farm production and in
the other businss segments of community and state economies.''
   The 19-page report itself added: ``The current federal
initiative (on rural development) stresses the need for rural
America to look within for development possibilities. America's
small and rural communities need to realize there are simply not
enough branch plants of major manufacturers to go around. Rural
America must draw upon its own strengths and use them to promote
development.''
   Field hearings are being planned so that Vautour can ``listen to
the needs and concerns of the local officials, residents, students,
teachers, business people and senior citizens,'' the report said.
   The report outlined rural economic development programs
available at USDA and at other federal agencies.

<TEXT>
   Ten days of Andy Warhol-mania ended Tuesday when
Sotheby's auction house brought down the last gavel on its sale of
the late artist's personal collection. The grand total: $25.3
million.
   The sale, which featured more than 10,000 items owned by Warhol,
attracted an estimated 60,000 people to the Sotheby galleries and
set tongues wagging and jaws dropping throughout the art world.
   Proceeds from the auction vastly exceeded Sotheby's official
pre-auction estimate of $9 million to $13 million. While auction
house officials admitted that they purposely underestimated the
collection's value, they expressed surprise over the extent of the
miscalculation.
   ``Our feeling when we figured the estimates was that we wouldn't
add any `Warhol factor,''' said Diana D. Brooks, president of
Sotheby's North America. ``I think what we're seeing today is an
indication not only of the `Warhol factor' but of a very strong art
market.''
   For whatever reason, buyers were willing to pay dearly for just
about anything owned by Warhol, who died in February 1987 and owned
many, many things.
   Sales figures included $2,640 for three plastic watches bearing
the likenesses of Fred Flintstone, Judy Jetson and Gumby; $23,000
for a pair of cookie jars; $55,000 for a set of Salvador Dali ear
clips; and $605,000 for a Roy Lichtenstein painting, ``Sailboats.''
   Proceeds from the auction go to the Andy Warhol Foundation for
the Visual Arts, which was established by the artist to support
cultural institutions.
   The highest-priced item at the sale was an untitled 1967
painting by Cy Twombley that fetched $990,000 _ a record for a work
by that artist. It was one of many records set during the marathon
sale.
   Works of art routinely sold for double or triple _ or more _
their estimated value. A David Hockney drawing of Warhol, valued at
$60,000 to $80,000, sold for $330,000 _ an example of the ``Warhol
factor'' working overtime.
   ``It's a joke to attempt to buy here,'' complained one Toronto
art dealer, Geert von der Veen. ``I don't think there are many
dealers who could touch those prices _ or want to. You'd look
crazy.''
   ``I think the prices have no relation to the value,'' said
another dealer, Ames Brown of Manchester, Vt. ``The Warhol
imprimatur is just inflating prices irrationally.''
   Von der Veen and Brown both said that private collectors, not
art dealers, were doing most of the buying at the Warhol auction _
something Sotheby's officials disputed.
   ``For those of us who buy for resale, or for investment, it's
not a very attractive auction,'' said Brown.
   But for others, the Warhol auction was exceedingly attractive.
   ``It's not an exaggeration to say this was a historic event,''
said Jeffrey Deitch, vice president of the Citibank Private Banking
Group, who buys art on behalf of bank clients.
   ``A lot of the prices sound high to the casual bidder, but
they're not insanely high,'' Deitch said. ``For instance, in the
auction of the Warhol furniture, many of the pieces went for what
you'd pay for new furniture.''
   Anyway, he said, ``I think it sends an interesting signal that
our culture values these things, and I think that as a culture we
can feel very good that works of art are valued to this extent.''
   Deitch predicted that anything associated with Warhol would
continue to escalate in value as more people come to appreciate the
artist, who remains controversial in death as he was in life.
   ``It's just beginning,'' he said. ``Just beginning.''

   A predominantly white suburb should have the
right to ``control its own possessions'' by barring non-residents
from its parks, a lawyer for the town said Tuesday.
   A three-judge state Court of Appeals panel heard arguments on an
appeal of a 1986 ruling overturning a referendum in Dearborn. In
November 1985, the voters in the town, located on Detroit's western
border, had approved a measure that would ban non-residents from 35
of its 37 parks.
   The American Civil Liberties Union challenged the law, saying it
effectively discriminated against blacks from neighboring Detroit.
   William Saxton, representing Dearborn, said Tuesday that the
ruling should be overturned because the same argument could be used
to strike down a number of other laws that had potential
discriminatory effects.
   ``The plaintiffs are making an abhorrent argument, ...'' he said
in an interview outside the hearing. ``The city has a right to
control its own possessions.''
   But Wayne State University law Professor Robert Sedler, who
argued in behalf of the ACLU, said the ordinance ``is going to make
the Dearborn parks all white.''
   However, he added, the case is limited and should apply only to
Dearborn parks.
   ``Our view is a very narrow one,'' he said.
   In September 1986, Wayne County Circuit Judge Marvin Stempien
ruled that the ban was unconstitutional because of its possible
discriminatory effect and its proposed random checks of park users
for identity documents.
   Citing two of parks that were particularly close to
predominantly black Detroit neighborhoods, the judge said: ``The
impact of the non-resident provisions ... is to deny the use of
both Ford Woods Park and Crowley Park to almost every potential
black user within the ... service area.''
   The 1980 census showed that of about 90,000 people living in
Dearborn, fewer than 100 were black. Detroit's population at the
time was about 63 percent black.
   Nearly a year before the ruling, the Dearborn City Council voted
4-3 to reject the parks ordinance. But a petition drive put the
matter on the Nov. 5, 1985, election ballot, and residents approved
it in a 17,790 to 13,976 vote.
   Attorneys said an appeals ruling may be made within 120 days.

   Fifteen Rutgers University students
have been indicted in the drinking-related death of a fraternity
pledge, authorities said Tuesday.
   The students, including seven officers of the now-closed Lambda
Chi Alpha fraternity, were charged with aggravated hazing, which
carries a penalty of up to 18 months in prison and a $7,500 fine
upon conviction.
   Middlesex County Prosecutor Alan Rockoff said that as first
offenders, the students probably would not face prison.
   A grand jury in Middlesex County returned the indictment Friday,
but it was not announced until Tuesday because prosecutors wanted
to tell the students and their families first.
   The 15 students did not have to post bail, Rockoff said. They
are to appear May 20 before Superior Court Judge George J. Nicola
in New Brunswick.
   Among those facing charges is fraternity chapter President Roy
P. Dudak, 20, of Florence; Vice President Glen L. Kelley, 20, of
Sewickley, Pa.; and rush chairman David M. Selenko, 20, of Old
Bridge, according to the indictment.
   Rockoff said the officers were not charged as a result of their
positions but were among fraternity members who allegedly
endangered the life of James Callahan, 18, of North Bergen.
   Callahan died after a fraternity pledge party at the Lambda Chi
Alpha fraternity house Feb. 12. Tests revealed Callahan had four
times the legal amount of alcohol in his body when he slipped into
a coma.
   Robert Ochs, vice president of public safety at Rutgers, said a
university investigation continues and that the 15 students named
in the indictment could face school charges, the most serious being
expulsion.
   Also on Tuesday, Rutgers football player Robert Lowther of
Wadsworth, Ohio, died in a car accident in which the driver had
twice the legal amount of blood alcohol in his system, Rockoff said.
   The car, driven by Rutgers linebacker Robert P. Speidel, 21, of
Wayne, had veered into oncoming traffic and crashed head-on into a
truck, Rockoff said.
   Tests on Speidel, who remained hospitalized in critical
condition Tuesday, showed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.253
percent, Rockoff said. People are considered legally intoxicated in
New Jersey when blood alcohol content reaches 0.10 percent.
   Speidel turned 21 on Tuesday, making him younger than the legal
drinking age Monday, Rockoff said.
   Another passenger in the car, linebacker Paul Garea, 19, from
Hamden, Conn., was in serious condition Tuesday.
   Rockoff said tests were being conducted on Lowther's body, but
authorities say a preliminary investigation revealed that the three
began drinking Monday afternoon in a dormitory.
   No charges had been filed Tuesday, Rockoff said.

<HEAD>Food Labeling System Called Confusing, Inadequate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's food labeling and information
system is confusing, inadequate and in need of an overhaul,
according to a congressional report released Tuesday.
   ``The food information system lacks common criteria. In
addition, controversies surround the nutritional issues that
underlie regulatory decisions,'' the General Accounting Office said
in its report.
   ``Consumers need the clearest, most consistent information
possible,'' the report said. But the current system sends
``confused signals'' to consumers, it said.
   The report was requested by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and
investigations subcommittee. Dingell asked GAO to investigate
conflicting regulations on the use of cheese substitutes in frozen
pizza toppings.
   The Agriculture Department, which regulates meat-topped frozen
pizza, requires disclosure on the front panel of the pizza box if
less than 10 percent of the cheese on the pizza is ``traditional''
cheese.
   The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates all other
frozen pizza, requires front-panel disclosure if a pizza topping is
not 100 percent real cheese.
   GAO reported in 1980 that FDA and the Agriculture Department had
119 regulations covering consumer economic protection and product
safety. In 1982, GAO said the piecemeal labeling system had led to
regulatory inconsistencies and consumer confusion.
   The latest report said efforts to develop a workable approach to
collecting and disseminating food information have lagged behind
``the explosion of manufactured food products'' _ nearly 3,400 in
1986 compared with 1,000 in 1982.

   Authorities accused a computer operator
from a company that helps run the state lottery of forging a
winning $15.2 million ticket and another man with trading it in for
the jackpot.
   Mark S. Herbst, 33 of Harrisburg, was arraigned Tuesday, less
than a week after he traded in the ticket for the first $469,989
installment of the prize from a Super 7 drawing last July 15. He
was jailed in lieu of $50,000 bail.
   Jailed in lieu of bail Monday night was computer operator Henry
Arthur Rich, also 33 of Harrisburg, who tried to flee, arresting
officers said.
   Both men were charged with theft by unlawful taking, theft by
deception, criminal conspiracy and forgery, said Robert Gentzel, a
spokesman for state Attorney General LeRoy Zimmerman. Rich also was
charged with unlawful use of a computer and tampering with public
information.
   If convicted, Herbst could be jailed for up to 31 years and
fined $70,000, Zimmerman said. Rich could face 40 years in prison
and $90,000 in fines.
   There was ``no current evidence of participation by others, or
of other fraudulent tickets being turned in, either here or in the
state of Delaware, where Rich had access to that state's mainframe
lottery computer,'' Zimmerman said at a news conference.
   Zimmerman alleged Rich used a computer at his firm, Control Data
Corp., to identify unclaimed jackpots and to print a copy of the
unclaimed winning ticket, which he gave to Herbst to cash in. He
contended Rich obtained some security codes and other information
about the winning ticket from the lottery's main computer, which he
had access to as a troubleshooter.
   Rich was responsible for troubleshooting the lotterry's main
computer.
   Spokesmen at Control Data said Tuesday they had been told by the
state Revenue Department not to comment. And Gov. Robert P. Casey
said late in the day that he had postponed final approval of a
proposed contract renewal for Control Data pending review of
security safeguards.
   When Herbst claimed the jackpot Thursday, he said he had been
using the ticket as a bookmark and checked the numbers after seeing
a newspaper story about the unclaimed prize.
   Terri LaFleur, associate editor of Gaming and Wagering Business
magazine, said security violations in lottery games are rare
because of the precautions.
   James Scroggins, the lottery's executive director, said some of
his colleagues had doubts about the ticket even before Herbst
received his check. The doubts centered on the finding that the
bogus ticket was printed on a blank from a Scranton lottery-ticket
outlet, while a computer check showed the actual winner was sold in
Bucks County.
   Scroggins said he decided to award the prize because past
discrepancies of that type were explained by merchants lending
blank tickets to other sellers.
   Less than an hour after Herbst left a news conference, however,
the officials decided the ticket wasn't real and contacted
Zimmerman. Later that day, the Revenue Department, which operates
the lottery, asked Herbst's bank to stop payment on the check and
state prosecutors asked the bank to stall Herbst if he tried to
withdraw the money.
   Scroggins said Herbst was ``not unlike any other big winner I'd
ever seen. He was very nervous.''
   Zimmerman said agents from his office confronted Herbst on
Sunday, and Herbst admitted he knew the ticket was not genuine.
According to an affidavit used to obtain arrest warrants, Herbst
also told the agents Rich was expecting $5,000 from him Monday.
   On Monday night, Zimmerman said, Herbst gave Rich $5,000
provided to him by investigators. Rich was armed and tried to flee
when agents moved in, but was captured without incident, Zimmerman
said.
   Scroggins said additional security measures, which he refused to
disclose, would have eventually uncovered the forgery.
   This is the second fixing case to plague the Pennsylvania
Lottery. The April 24, 1980, drawing of the Daily Number was fixed
by altering pingpong balls used to pick the winning digits.
   The so-called 6-6-6 case, named after the winning numbers, also
resulted in tighter security for the televised drawings. Scroggins
said new procedures would also be implemented because of the new
case.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Impose Transport Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas on Tuesday
imposed a nationwide road transport ban that forced workers to walk
to their jobs or pay high fares to truck drivers.
   The ban, the third this year, reduced traffic on intercity roads
and highways by up to 90 percent, according to several dispatchers
and broadcast reports from the provinces. City traffic appeared to
be about a third of that on a normal day.
   Only two privately owned city buses were seen in a tour of the
capital and the surrounding area. Several state-owned buses with
soldiers aboard for protection were providing transport, as were
some army trucks.
   But most Salvadorans either walked or boarded overcrowded
pickups and vans converted to public transport by their owners. The
drivers charged an average of two colones (40 cents) per trip, or
about six times the average bus fare.
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, who
have waged an 8-year campaign against the U.S.-backed government,
warned drivers to heed the measure. They did not say how long it
would last.
   On the clandestine Radio Venceremos, the rebels said they were
taking down license plate numbers of vehicles violating the ban and
would retaliate with sabotage.
   The guerrillas said the ban was a response to increased
repression by security forces.
   Police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security
reasons, said a taxi was commandeered then burned Tuesday morning
by urban commandos in northeastern San Salvador.
   During transport bans in February and March, four people died,
11 were wounded and 15 vehicles were burned or shot.
   As was the case during the previous bans, the guerrillas on
Tuesday stepped up their sabotage against the state-owned electric
utility. Bombs toppled several utility posts or transmission
towers, cutting electricity to wide swatches of this nation of 5
million.
   Gen. Adolfo Blandon, chief of the joint chiefs of staff, said
all leaves for members of the 56,000-strong armed forces had been
canceled to provide security along the nation's thoroughfares.
   Several citizens condemned the transport ban.
   ``The ones most hurt are the humble people who use public
transport,'' said a middle-aged man who refused to give his name
for fear of the guerrillas.

   There's a world of difference between
riding a thoroughbred horse and driving a car, but there is also
one similarity: Let either one get out of control and you have a
problem.
   ``These horses are a little bit crazy,'' said Lisa C. Schulte, a
former history teacher who is owner of Hawkeye Hill Racing School.
``Students who have had a horse run off with them say it's like
being in a Formula One race car with the throttle stuck open, very
little steering and no brakes.''
   About 70 percent of those in the Hawkeye Hill riding program
wash out because they can't master the powerful, high-spirited
animals from the saddle. But since they also study stable
management before planting their feet in the stirrups, employment
after graduation usually isn't a problem. The school has a 40-page
list of stables looking for help.
   ``These are people who write or call in orders and say, `I need
a groom or an exercise rider,' '' said the 43-year-old Ms. Schulte,
who started the school in 1979.
   The 68-acre complex has two training tracks, barns, a dormitory
and a classroom. Ten groups of 12 students per year take a home
correspondence course before arriving for the minimum one-month
course in exercise riding _ how to give racehorses their workouts _
that many students hope will lead up the ladder to a jockey's life.
   The state-accredited campus is an alternative to the traditional
school for jockeys: the school of hard knocks. People wanting to
become jockeys usually are handed a pitchfork instead of the reins
and have to work their way up.
   ``Unless you have good connections such as parents who are
trainers or who are wealthy horse owners, it's very hard to get a
job at the track,'' Ms. Schulte said. ``So this gives them a good
foundation of hands-on experience with thoroughbred race horses.''
   Brad Hopp, 18, of Kahoka, Mo., graduated from the school in
March and was back this week to prepare for his test to get an
apprentice jockey license.
   ``I was getting run away with quite a bit, and now I feel I can
ride about anything out there ...,'' said Hopp, whose family owns
thoroughbreds. ``There was my way of riding and their way or
riding, and theirs was better.''
   Jane Evans said the program would help her train the
thoroughbreds she owns at her farm near Carlisle, Mass. Unlike most
of the students, who are in their late teens or 20s, Mrs. Evans has
several grown children.
   Summer and fall are the busiest times at the school 50 miles
north of Louisville, but business picks up around Derby time. This
year's Kentucky Derby is set for Saturday.
   ``Many of the foreign students come especially for the Derby,''
Ms. Schulte said. ``They come from Europe and South America.
They've also come from the Middle East. They're wanting to learn
about American ways of training race horses and riding, and about
American racetracks.''
   The school has 50 horses graded in riding difficulty from ``the
ones you could put your grandma on, to the real hair-raising
horses,'' Ms. Schulte said.
   The only thing harder to handle than an out-of-control horse
might be a class of junior high school students, the former teacher
said.
   ``Get you about 30 of them and put (the students) in a situation
where they don't want to be,'' she said. ``After that,
thoroughbreds are a challenge, but a pleasure.''

<HEAD>More Cities Failed to Meet Ozone Standards Last Year</HEAD>

   More areas have failed to meet federal clean
air standards for ozone, a major component of smog, but carbon
monoxide pollution has cleared up slightly, the Evironmental
Protection Agency said Tuesday.
   EPA's annual list of areas violating national clean air
standards for the two pollutants shows 68 cities not meeting the
ozone goals last year, an increase of six from the year before, and
59 out of compliance for carbon monoxide, a decrease of six.
   Twenty cities appeared on both lists, so 107 cities and rural
areas containing 135 million people, according to the National
Clean Air Coalition, violate one standard or both. The 24 largest
metropolitan areas were on one or both lists, leaving Kansas City
the largest area in compliance.
   Both pollutants are influenced by the weather, and for that
reason EPA uses more than a year's data in judging compliance _
three years for ozone and two years for carbon monoxide. The ozone
tabulations cover the years 1985-87 and the carbon monoxide 1986-87.
   If, for example, only 1986 data had been used, 50 cities would
have flunked the carbon monoxide test. If 1987 readings alone had
been used, 37 cities would have failed. But to be in compliance, a
city must make the cut both years.
   The influence of weather on ozone is more pronounced.
Pittsburgh, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Mich., and Richmond, Va., are
listed as violators this year, but not last year. All four were on
the 1986 list using 1983-1985 data.
   The relevant ozone readings for those four areas for 1985-1987
are similar to those for 1983-1985, possibly because their summers
were similar in 1983 and 1987, EPA spokesman Chris Rice said.
   ``We had a hot, dry summer in the East, which tends to push up
ozone levels,'' Rice said. ``It was much like the summer of 1983,
except confined to the East.''
   This year's lists are perhaps more important than most because
Congress will use them in deciding if and how to revise the Clean
Air Act. While revisions are being considered, Congress barred EPA
from imposing penalties on any non-complying areas before Aug. 31.
   EPA contends that it may not impose penalties for sheer failure
to meet numerical standards, but must do so for areas that fail to
work toward compliance. Penalties for at least 14 areas were held
up by the congressional action.
   Those penalties can be the suspension of federal highway, sewer
and air pollution program aid.
   Aug. 31 is now the deadline for complying with the standards,
which no one expects or believes possible for many cities. Various
proposals in Congress would extend the deadlines according to the
severity of pollution and efforts needed to clean it up.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, sponsor of one bill that has
cleared the Senate Environment Committee, said in a statement the
new report ``demonstrates that the ozone nonattainment problem
continues to worsen'' and that his bill is needed.
   He was echoed by Richard Ayres, chairman of the National Clean
Air Coalition, a grouping of environmental and other organizations,
who said the new data ``confirm that we are no longer winning the
battle against air pollution and we need a revitalized Clean Air
Act.''
   Carbon monoxide interferes with the oxygen-carrying capacity of
the blood. Ozone, the major component of smog, worsens breathing
problems.
   Motor vehicles are involved in producing both pollutants.
   Carbon monoxide is emitted directly in the exhaust. As cars
built before 1981, when the latest emission standards took effect,
are retired, urban air should get cleaner regardless of the weather.
   EPA says average carbon monoxide concentrations have been
improving by about 4 percent a year since the mid-1970s. The agency
expects all but a handful of cities _ four to six, according to
Rice _ eventually to meet clean air standards for carbon monoxide
without special effort.
   Ozone compliance is more difficult, in part because it is not
emitted in exhaust.
   Ozone is formed by chemical reactions in sunlight between oxides
of nitrogen _ still another pollutant emitted by all fossil fuel
combustion, including vehicle fuels _ and volatile compounds like
gasoline vapor, both from tailpipes and from normal evaporation in
fuel systems.
   These reactions can proceed downwind of the source of the raw
materials, which accounts for the presence of several rural
counties, five of them in Maine, on the ozone non-compliance list.
Ozone raw materials for the Maine counties were emitted somewhere
upwind in the Boston-Washington corridor.
   Though many areas will improve as old cars are junked, far more
will remain out of compliance than will be true for carbon
monoxide, EPA believes. Some 25 or more cities will be unable to
comply with tighter controls on stationary sources of other,
non-gasoline compounds like solvents, EPA says.
   By a wide margin, the Los Angeles area is again worst for ozone
pollution, in part because of the mountains around the city that
keep polluted air from moving away. The area has peak ozone
concentrations nearly three times the standard and an estimated 143
days of violation per year.
   The second worst city is Bakersfield, Calif., with peaks 50
percent above the standard and 35 days of violations per year. Four
other California cities _ San Diego, Fresno, Modesto and Visalia _
have more than 10 days above the standard.
   Outside of California, only Houston, Atlanta and Philadelphia
have more than 10 days of violation per year.

   The United States is pleased by recent
measures of cooperation between South Africa and Mozambique, the
State Department said Tuesday.
   Specifically, the department praised a new agreement between the
two countries for electric power supply from the Cabora Bassa Dam
in Mozambique to the eastern part of South Africa's Transvaal
province.
   ``We are pleased by the recent steps taken by the governments of
Mozambique and South Africa to reduce tensions and expand
cooperation, through such means as restoring the Cabora Bassa
electrical power system which links the two countries,'' said
spokesman Charles Redman.
   He added that ``we encourage both governments to follow through
on this and other efforts to work toward accommodation.''
   South Africa is also negotiating to train and equip as many as
three battalions of Mozambican troops, according to a South African
official quoted in a New York Times report from Maputo.
   The official, Timo Beukes, said the training would cost about
$14 million annually and South Africa would also supply ration
packs, vehicles, uniforms, radios and mine detectors.
   The reported agreement constitutes a reversal of South Africa's
traditional support for the RENAMO guerrilla group seeking to
overthrow the leftist-oriented government of Joaquim Chissano.
   In Cape Town, Roland Darroll, a spokesman for the Department of
Foreign Affairs, denied that South Africa was negotiating to train
Mozambican troops.
   He did say that South Africa was considering non-lethal military
aid for Mozambique to help protect the hydroelectric project, but
that no decision had been made yet.

   After years of competitive feuding with cable
television, the broadcast networks and Hollywood are looking at the
rapidly growing medium as an opportunity rather than an enemy.
   As part of that trend, the National Broadcasting Co. broke into
the cable industry Monday by buying a cable channel to produce
business and sports programs.
   Long the poor cousin of broadcast television, cable has grown
into a $12 billion a year industry that is steadily siphoning
viewers from the networks and cutting into Hollywood's profits.
   Now, the broadcast networks are looking at cable as a way to
reclaim some of that audience with their existing resources _ like
NBC with its news and sports operations.
   And Hollywood is seeing in cable a new source of programming
revenue and a place where producers can work more creatively.
   ``We've been waiting 20 years for this,'' said John Malone,
president of Tele-Communications Inc.
   TCI, the nation's largest cable company which is buying Tulsa,
Okla.-based Tempo Enterprises Inc., has agreed to sell NBC a part
of Tempo, a cable outlet carried on systems with 12 million
subscribers.
   NBC President Bob Wright said the move was ``an important step
in our efforts to broaden NBC's business base.'' He said that while
helping the cable industry, the venture will strengthen NBC, the
nation's top-rated broadcast network.
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc., which owns ABC-TV, has already moved
into cable. It owns 80 percent of the ESPN cable network.
   With Hollywood as a backdrop, the National Cable Television
Association's annual convention, which ended here Tuesday, provided
a convenient opportunity for big-name movie producers like Steven
Spielberg to make a pitch to the nation's largest cable companies.
   ``They view cable as the thing of the future,'' said James S.
Cownie, president of Heritage Communications of Des Moines, Iowa,
and chairman of the cable association. ``They look at cable as a
hybrid of the little screen and the big screen, and something that
is not restricted editorially or with time constraints.''
   At the request of MCA-TV Group President Robert Harris, whose
company owns Universal Television Productions, Cownie organized a
group of executives from the country's 30 largest cable companies
to talk with Spielberg, ``Miami Vice'' executive producer Michael
Mann and other producers about a joint programming venture.
   ``We haven't given them specific ideas yet,'' Spielberg told USA
Today after the closed-door meeting Sunday. ``But this was to let
them know we would like to get in on the new frontier.''
   The convention also provided further evidence of broadcast
companies' interest in cable TV, with the presence of Fox
Broadcasting Co. and the National Association of Public TV
Stations. Both had booths on the convention floor.
   Fox is proposing ways cable and broadcast can work in
cooperative promotional ventures, and public TV stations have a
vital interest in being carried by cable systems as more Americans
are added to cable systems.
   More than half the nation's approximately 90 million TV
households subscribe to cable, and more than 80 percent of
households are wired for it.
   Speaking to financial analysts Monday, TCI's Malone said he was
``thrilled'' that Hollywood producers are interested in the
opportunities cable offers.
   Malone said producers ``are finding out that cable offers a new
dimension for them to be creative, to try things.''
   He said that while the cable industry doesn't have nearly the
broadcast networks' programming budgets _ more than $1 billion each
_ cable can offer other things the networks cannot, like editorial
freedom.
   ``I think you're going to see a lot of big stars willing to do
work (at lower cost) because they've got a message,'' Malone said.
   And cable, financed mostly by subscribers rather than
advertising, is better able than the broadcast networks to run
programs that aren't big ratings producers, he said.
   ``We have the staying power to deal with smaller audiences,'' he
said. ``The networks can't afford to give up'' any share of the
audience they reach because of the impact that has on ad revenues.

<TEXT>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, says he may skip
the Republican National Convention in August if former Arizona Gov.
Evan Mecham is a member of the state's delegation.
   ``I'd have to think long and hard about that, but my inclination
would be not to be (a delegate),'' McCain said in Tucson Monday.
   Mecham said in a telephone interview from his Glendale office
that McCain ``must have a guilty conscience if he can't be around
me.''
   Arizona's 33 delegates to the national convention will be chosen
at the state GOP convention May 14 in Phoenix. Mecham will be one
of 717 regional delegates from which the delegation will be picked.
   McCain, a supporter of Vice President George Bush, said the news
media will be searching for more interesting news stories in New
Orleans than the vice president's virtual lockup on the GOP
nomination.
   ``It's going to be a dull convention, obviously,'' he said.
``And there would be enormous media attention to Gov. Mecham.''

<HEAD>Secret Service Stops Jackson's Plan to Stay With Miner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans by Democratic presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson to spend a night with a Mingo County coal
miner were undone by bad roads, campaign officials say.
   Jackson was to stay with miner Scott Cisco of Meador, but the
plans fell through when the Secret Service objected to the
treacherous roads in the area.
   Cisco, 27, said he first thought officials were pulling his leg
when they asked whether Jackson could stay at his home in the coal
town of 300. He consented to the visit after he realized the call
was no joke.
   ``What else could I do?'' he said.
   Cisco, who plans to vote for Jackson in November, pointed out a
bright side to the canceled visit _ he doesn't have to worry about
what he would serve for dinner.
   ``When I thought of that I just threw my hands up in the air and
said, `Oh God help me.' I'd hate to serve him TV dinners,'' he said.

<HEAD>Democrats Move to Erase Alaska Oil Curbs in Trade Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats moved to erase the trade bill's
curbs on Alaska oil exports Tuesday even before the measure reached
President Reagan's desk and a threatened presidential veto.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the move was designed to
offer Reagan a compromise and thus perhaps avert a veto of the
1,000-page bill which won final approval from the Senate last week.
   Republicans countered that the real reason was to win over the
votes of Alaska's GOP senators for a veto override.
   The move to drop the Alaska provision was contained in a
resolution authorizing technical corrections in the bill.
   The bill cleared the Senate last week by a vote of 63-36 last
week _ three short of the number needed to override Reagan's
threatened veto.
   The House is expected to take up the resolution this week and
senators will deal with it next week when they return from a recess.
   One of the curbs would enable Alaska to export 50,000 barrels of
crude a day to Canada but would require that the oil be transported
to a West Coast port first in American vessels.
   The provision is a favorite of politically influential maritime
unions, and a similar feature is contained in the current
U.S.-Canada free trade agreement. The other provision would limit
exports from new refineries to 70,000 barrels a day and half of
total production.
   At a news conference, Wright portrayed the move as designed to
keep the trade bill from going down the drain through a Reagan veto.
   The president has been concerned about a provision that would
require all but the smallest employers to give 60-day notice of
plant closings and large-scale layoffs. But more recently he has
also reportedly found fault with the Alaska provisions.
   ``We're trying to meet him (Reagan) halfway if we can,'' Wright
told reporters. `` ... We're trying in every way to appeal to his
better nature.''
   Before the plan won committee approval, Rep. James H. Quillen,
R-Tenn., described it as ``a ploy to change some votes in the
Senate in order to override a possible presidential veto.''
   ``I don't think this committee ought to be used for this
purpose,'' Quillen said.
   Alaska's Republican senators, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski,
voted against the trade bill because of its resrictions on oil
exports. Democrats believed that they would have supported the
measure had the curbs been dropped.
   Stevens said at one point, however, that he could not guarantee
support for the bill even if the Alaska provisions were stripped
out.
   House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., took the floor
earlier and accused Wright of trying to ``win at all costs.''
   ``I am told there is a proposed new rule in the works that will
allow the majority to delete the Alaskan oil provisions in a
last-ditch attempt to manipulate a veto override in the Senate,''
Michel said.
   ``Is there nothing left of the integrity of our rules and
procedures?'' Michel said. ``Good policy is the product of good
legislation produced honestly and openly in a deliberative manner.''

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Says Noriega May Step Down in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian officials have told opposition
party leaders that military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega is
considering stepping down as defense chief on Aug. 12, an
opposition spokesman said Tuesday.
   Guillermo Cochez, a spokesman for Panama's Christian Democratic
Party, also quoted President Manuel Solis Palma as saying that an
agreement on Panama's political future may be signed this week.
   Cochez said the Aug. 12 departure date for Noriega is under
consideration because that is the fifth anniversary of his
accession as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Reagan administration officials refused to discuss Cochez's
comments, noting that a government-wide news blackout on the
Panamanian issue has been imposed.
   But Panama's political future has been the subject of continuing
negotiations between U.S. officials and a variety of Panamanians,
both in and out of government.
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams met Tuesday with
Panama's Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a leader of the anti-Noriega
forces in exile. There was no report on the meeting.
   Cochez and Aurelio Barria, a leader of another group opposed to
Noriega, spoke to reporters at the National Democratic Institute
for International Affairs, which is affiliated with the Democratic
Party.
   The administration, in a policy shift, said last week it is no
longer insisting that Noriega leave Panama and would settle for his
resignation as defense chief as a prelude to a transition to
democratic rule.
   Word of the policy shift has angered the Panamanian opposition,
which maintains that the country's political future is for
Panamanians to decide, not the United States.
   ``The U.S. has no right to decide if a Panamanian can stay or
not in the country,'' Barria said.
   Cochez said Noriega would be able to maintain control in Panama
if he stays in the country even without a formal title.
   Any agreement allowing Noriega to remain on would mean ``treason
against the Panamanian people,'' he said.
   ``We are completely convinced Noriega is a murderer, we are
completely convinced he is involved in drugs,'' Cochez said.
   Noriega has been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida
on drug-smuggling charges.

   A homemade bomb was discovered
Tuesday at a British army base and detonated by explosives experts,
a military spokesman said.
   Col. Rob Stewart, of the 1st British Army Corps, said the
two-pound bomb was attached to a car in a civilian parking lot at
the base, located near the north-central town of Bielefeld.
   No one claimed responsibility for planting the bomb.
   On Sunday, three off-duty British airmen were killed in bombing
and shooting attacks in the Dutch towns of Roermond and
Nieuwbergen. Those assaults were claimed by the Irish Republican
Army.
   Stewart told The Associated Press that the explosives were found
Tuesday by a soldier during a routine afternoon inspection and that
experts blew up the bomb.
   A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense in London, who spoke on
condition of anonymity in line with British practice, said the bomb
was discovered near Ripon Barracks, the headquarters of the 1st
British Corps in Bielefeld.
   He said an ammunitions technical officer carried out two
controlled explosions.
   The discovery of the bomb Tuesday ``does emphasize that all
those responsible for the safety of our servicemen must continue to
take very great care,'' said British Minister of Defense Ian
Stewart.
   He spoke to reporters at the Royal Air Force barracks in
Wildenrath, near the Dutch border, where he was visiting two people
who were wounded in Sunday's attacks.
   Meanwhile, West German border police said a report on Britain's
Independent Television that police were looking for a brown car
with the license number SH71BR in connection with the attacks was
no longer valid.
   Police spokesman Harry Klabbers in the Netherlands also said the
car had been cleared of any connection with Sunday's incidents.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to drive the British from Northern
Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the
mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Cardinal Fails in Plea to Dissuade Reagan Visit to Moscow
Monastery</HEAD>

   President Reagan said Tuesday he will go to an
Orthodox monastery in Moscow during his summit visit despite a
Ukrainian Catholic leader's plea that he cancel the event as a sign
of support for religious freedom.
   ``He said he already made plans and he has to go,'' Myroslav
Cardinal Lubachivsky told reporters after meeting privately with
the president at the White House and declaring that Ukrainian
Catholics continue to suffer persecution.
   The cardinal added that the president promised to ``be firm
about the issues'' of religious freedom in his discussions with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Being there, he will mention that freedom of the churches is
necessary for all the people,'' Cardinal Lubachivsky said.
   He said Reagan also pledged to try to meet with Ukrainian
Catholic leaders while in the Soviet Union May 29 to June 2.
   Addressing a White House conference on religious rights in the
Soviet Union just before his meeting with Reagan, the cardinal said
that ``the age of suffering has not passed'' for Christians in the
Soviet Union.
   ``Today, we hear so much about glasnost and perestroika,'' he
said. ``But, Mr. Gorbachev's reforms have yet to touch the
Ukrainian Catholic Church. Our priests are punished or fined for
celebrating the liturgy in private homes, and the faithful live in
constant fear of imprisonment. Such violations of basic human
rights simply must not exist.
   ``Therefore, in the name of all that is sacred, I implore you
... to advise the president to reconsider his trip to the Danilov
monastery at this time,'' he said. ``The symbolism of this event
would lend credence to the atheistic Kremlin's usurping of the
1,000-year-old Ukrainian Christian legacy.''
   The monastery on the outskirts of Moscow, the central building
of which is more than 700 years old, is being restored with
government financial help. The building is noted for splendid
religious decoration of gold and jewels.
   The cardinal also said he urged the president to meet with
Ukrainian religious leaders of the underground church during his
trip to Moscow ``as a public manifestation of U.S. support for the
resurrection of our banned Ukrainian churches.''
   Reagan, in his speech at the conference, said, ``I promise you
that the witness of faith you brought here today will not be
confined to these four walls or forgotten when this meeting is
ended.
   ``I will carry it in my heart when I travel to the Soviet Union
at the end of this month and I will say that the most fitting way
to mark the millenium of Christianity in Kiev ... would be granting
the rights of all the peoples and all the creeds of the Soviet
Union to worship their god in their own way.''
   While noting the 1,000th anniversary of Christianity in the
Soviet Union, Reagan also said, ``The rights of Soviet Jews have
taken up much of our official time and this is very close to my
heart. Our hope is for doors to open completely to emigration and
to full freedom for all faiths.''

<HEAD>Loss of Power In Jumbo Jet Linked to Dry Fuel Tanks</HEAD>

   Three engines on a United Airlines jumbo jet
lost power over the Pacific Ocean because three of the Boeing 747's
fuel tanks ran dry, aviation sources said Tuesday.
   The huge jetliner with 258 passengers and crew aboard landed
safely at the Narita airport in Japan on only one engine Monday
after its flight from Los Angeles. No one was injured.
   As the plane cruised at 39,000 feet, the pilot reported losing
the first engine 1 hour and 15 minutes from the airport, the second
30 minutes later and the third just before landing at the airport
40 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   United said in a statement that the three engines lost power,
but a spokesman for the airline declined to speculate on what
caused the power loss because the investigation has yet to be
completed.
   ``The airplane has been thoroughly inspected. We have not found
a mechanical problem ... At this point the plane is airworthy,''
United spokesman Robert Doughty said in Chicago. He said the
aircraft was being flown from Japan to United's maintenance
facility at San Francisco for further examination.
   During the Monday flight, the pilot of the jumbo jet had told
the airport control tower that he had shut two engines down because
of a ``malfunction'' and asked for clearance for an expedited
landing. Later another engine lost power.
   But aviation sources familiar with the incident said Tuesday
that the power loss has been traced to three empty fuel tanks
feeding the three engines. It was not certain whether the tanks ran
dry because of a mechanical problem or because of an error by the
flight crew.
   When the plane landed, investigators found about 20,000 pounds
of fuel in the tank feeding the engine that was still operating,
said industry and government sources who spoke on condition they
not be identified further.
   The incident is being investigated by Japanese authorities, but
U.S. air safety investigators also are interested in the case.
Drucella Anderson, a spokeswoman for the National Transportation
Safety Board, said staffers plan to talk to crew members when they
return to the United States.
   In a Boeing 747, which has a maximum fuel capacity of 320,000
pounds, fuel is routinely transfered among its four wing tanks so
that the plane maintains proper balance during a long trans-Pacific
flight, aviation sources said.
   According to the manufacturer, the Boeing 747-100 of the type
involved in the incident burns about 23,500 pounds of fuel an hour.
   ``Each of the four engines is independent and has its own fuel
lines drawing from the tanks in the wing,'' said David Jimenez, a
spokesman for the Boeing Co. ``You can interchange fuel from tank
to tank.''
   Jimenez would not speculate how three of the four tanks aboard
Flight 97 would have run out of fuel, while more than 20,000 pounds
of fuel remained in the fourth tank.
   Had that amount of fuel been evenly distributed the jumbo jet
would have had no problems flying to its destination, one aviation
source suggested.
   Industry sources said it is possible that a fuel line or filter
became clogged or a valve failed to open preventing the fuel from
shifting properly. Another possibility is that the flight crew
shifted too much fuel into the fourth tank and was unable to
transfer it back to the other tanks.
   Normally, the flight engineer in the three-person cockpit has
the responsibility of keep track of the fuel loads and transfering
fuel from tank to tank as necessary to keep proper aircraft balance.
   In newer Boeing 747s the fuel transfer is conducted
automatically by the aircrafts' computerized flight system, but in
most older planes such as the 747-100 series the shifting of fuel
is conducted manually, said Elizabeth Reese, a Boeing spokeswoman.
   She said she did not know specifically whether the fuel transfer
was manual or automatic aboard the United jet. The aircraft has a
variety of gauges to tell the flight crew how much fuel has been
burned, fuel remaining and the fuel flow rates for each tank, she
said.

<DATELINE>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have identified details of a
key part of a gene responsible for male sexual development, a step
that could eventually help doctors treat prostate cancer and
diagnose infertility in men.
   The gene allows body cells to create surface structures called
receptors, to which male sex hormones attach themselves.
   That binding triggers sex-related functions in the cells, said
Frank French, head of the laboratories of reproductive biology at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
   ``It's like a switch,'' French said. ``When the switch is turned
on, it causes genes to stimulate certain characteristic functions
of the cell.''
   The work, reported last month in the journal Science, was
carried out by French and colleagues at the university.
   The finding is ``a very major discovery _ it's like getting the
rest of the words to `Hamlet','' said Donald Coffey, director of
research at the Brady Urological Institute at Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore and chairman of the National Cancer
Institute's prostate cancer program.
   The North Carolina researchers used the information to create
special proteins called antibodies, which detected the presence of
the sex hormone receptors in laboratory animals.
   A test based on these antibodies may one day help doctors choose
proper therapy for prostate cancer, French said.
   The test, called an androgen receptor assay, would tell whether
prostate cells still have the receptor on their surfaces. The
receptor disappears in advanced cases of prostate cancer, French
said.
   Once the receptor is gone, hormone therapy to fight inoperable
prostate cancer would be useless, said Coffey.
   ``We'll know not to waste time with hormone therapy if it's not
going to work,'' Coffey said.
   Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in
men. An estimated 96,000 men get it each year in the United States,
and 27,000 die from it, according to the National Cancer Institute.
   The receptor test also may ultimately prove helpful in
determining the cause of infertility in some men, French said.
   Without the receptor, a man would appear female because his
cells would not respond to male sex hormone, French said. However,
in some men, the receptor is present but its binding ability is
impaired _ resulting in normal development but infertility.

   Soldiers shot three Palestinians to death
Tuesday during anti-occupation rioting in the West Bank. Israeli
police raided a prominent Arab daily newspaper and arrested its
managing editor.
   Three Arabs were reported wounded in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where rebellion against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8. At
least 180 Palestinians have been killed, and an Israeli soldier and
Jewish settler have been slain.
   The Israelis have closed two Arab newspapers and the Palestine
Press Service news agency in the five months and arrested 22
reporters, both Arabs and Israelis, who sympathize with the
Palestinians.
   In south Lebanon, Israeli tanks pushed to within a few miles of
Syrian positions, reinforcing Israeli soldiers who searched the
rugged hills for Palestinian guerrillas in an operation that began
Monday night. Syrian forces went on full alert.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the Israeli forces would not
remain in the area long or provoke the Syrians. ``There's totally
no danger of entanglement in Lebanon,'' he said on Israel radio.
   Shamir said later in northern Galilee that the operation was not
aimed at expanding Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone,'' a
six- to 10-mile-wide strip in southern Lebanon.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Shamir's rival in the coalition
government, said the operation was within ``the routine framework
of preventing infiltrations into Israel.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin toured south Lebanon and later
indicated the push will continue at least until Wednesday evening.
He said other incursions may follow _ ``any time we shall find it
necessary ... (because of) terror from Lebanon.''
   Rabin told Israel TV that Israeli troops were ``tens of
kilometers'' from the main Syrian army positions. A kilometer is
slightly more than six-tenths of a mile.
   Col. Ranaan Gissin, deputy army spokesman, said the Syrians
understood the action posed no threat to them.
   The operation against Palestinian bases in south Lebanon came
after weeks of guerrilla raids into Israel, including two last
week. Israel blamed Syria because the guerrillas came from the
Bekaa Valley, which the Syrian army controls.
   Protesters burned tires and hurled stones at soldiers Tuesday in
Beni Naim, a West Bank village two miles east of Hebron, and the
troopers opened fire, killing two, the army reported.
   Soldiers also shot and killed a Palestinian rioter in the Balata
refugee camp near Nablus, said Israel radio and officials at
Ittihad Hospital in Nablus. Arab reports identified him as Khaled
Rifki Amiza, 23.
   Family members said the victims in Beni Naim were Omar Mohammed
Manasra and Nidal Salim Harasha, both 18.
   Daoud Manasra, a cousin of one victim, said he saw 12 army jeeps
enter the village during the protest and two helicopters hover
overhead.
   He said about 5,000 villagers waved outlawed Palestinian flags
and black flags of mourning at a funeral for the two young men,
chanting: ``With our body and soul we will redeem you, Palestine!''
and ``Palestine is Arab!''
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the daily Al Fajr, said plainclothes
and riot police entered its offices in Arab east Jerusalem on
Monday night, arrested managing editor Hatem Abdul Khader and took
the names of other employees.
   Security forces confirmed the raid and said Abdul Khader would
be jailed for six months without trial under emergency regulations.
   Siniora told The Associated Press: ``I feel all these oppressive
measures will backlash against the peace process. Journalists
apparently are being singled out for special attention.''
   He said it was not clear why Abdul Khader, managing editor for
six years, was detained.
   Palestinians in the Gaza Strip mounted a commercial strike,
following instructions in an underground leaflet issued Friday. The
army said it put four refugee camps under curfew.
   An army report said soldiers shot and wounded an 18-year-old
Arab who tried to keep workers from traveling to jobs in Israel.
   Another was wounded by Israeli gunfire at a protest in Gaza
City, and soldiers wounded a Palestinian during a clash in Ajul
near Ramallah in the West Bank, hospital officials said.
   A prayer leader at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque was jailed for six
months without trial, said a member of Jerusalem's Islamic Council.
The leader, Muhamed Fouad Abu Zeid, also directed the Islamic
Council in Jenin, a West Bank town.

   President Reagan asked Congress on Tuesday to
grant a two-year extension of a fishery agreement between the
United States and East Germany.
   The agreement was first signed in 1983 and has been renewed
periodically.
   ``United States fishing industry interests have urged prompt
consideration of this agreement, and, similarly, I request that the
Congress give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early
date to avoid disruption of ongoing cooperative fishing ventures,''
Reagan said.
   His proposal would extend the agreement from July 1, 1988, until
July 1, 1990.

<TEXT>
   A prominent writer said Tuesday the Soviets are
still blaming the devastation of World War II for their poor
performance in agriculture and industry, while Japan and West
Germany have rebuilt and prospered.
   Chingiz Aitmatov wrote in the government newspaper Izvestia that
the Soviet Union has fared worse than the vanquished nations in
postwar economic recovery.
   He said dictator Josef Stalin began the practice of ignoring the
real causes of slow development and blaming it on the war.
   More than 20 million Soviet citizens died in the war and about
one-quarter of the housing and industry in the European part of the
country was destroyed.
   Stalin launched a rebuilding campaign that replaced many
factories wrecked in the war, but housing remains a serious problem
and farms still fail to produce enough food for the country.
   ``Sometimes it is necessary to compare how quickly and
powerfully has been the economic rebirth of the capitulated nations
West Germany and Japan, which were brought to ruins, thoroughly
destroyed, dismantled to the last nut,'' Aitmatov wrote.
   He said Soviet officials also remain reluctant to credit the
United States and Britain for their help in winning the war.
Aitmatov specifically mentioned nearly 15,000 warplanes provided to
the Soviet Union.
   Aitmatov is a severe critic of totalitarianism and the
dehumanizing influences of Stalinism. He condemned the
collectivization of the 1930s that removed peasants from the land
and noted that, half a century later, the government must buy grain
abroad.
   Soviet planners should take a lesson from reforms carried out in
China, where ``no one is particularly sad about the failure of
communes,'' he said. Aitmatov's point seemed to be that more family
farms would improve output.
   Embracing the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he
said more democracy and openness were the only hope for a better
future.

D'Amore.''
   The popular tenor was quoted Tuesday as telling Milan's Corriere
della Sera newspaper that he expects 150,000 people at the June 21
performance.
   Pavarotti was recently scheduled to appear in the opera at La
Scala but withdrew at the last minute, blaming a cold. There were
also reports of differences between the tenor and the conductor.
   In the Central Park production, American singer Kathleen Battle
will play Adina in Gaetano Donizetti's work while Marcello Panni
will conduct the orchestra of New York's Metropolitan Opera House,
Pavarotti said.

<HEAD>Authorities Now Processing Exit Applications `Reasonably Fast'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities are now processing
emigration applications ``reasonably fast'' and Jews who wish to
leave should take advantage of the opportunity in case the
situation changes, a high-ranking U.S. official said Tuesday.
   Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights
and humanitarian affairs, also said he saw some signs of growing
religious toleration in the Soviet Union.
   Schifter, in remarks to the National Conference on Soviet Jewry,
said he believed a huge percentage of the Soviet Union's two
million Jews would emigrate if given the chance.
   Most have not applied, knowing they would be subject to
discrimination in employment and other opportunities during the
long _ often unending _ period while waiting for approval.
   Schifter said, however, ``It looks as if a good many people
could get their cases processed reasonably fast if they were to
apply right now. They're afraid and they're afraid quite rightfully
because anything can turn in the Soviet Union with a very short
time and they can find themselves in great difficulty after that.
   ``A good many of them also are not fully aware today of what the
possibilities are: that you can indeed fill out the forms, get them
filed and there's a chance within six weeks or two months perhaps
to get your application processed,'' he said.
   Schifter said Soviet Jews should be assured ``that the
possibilities are there now and they ought to take advantage of it
if this is what they want to do.''
   After reaching a high point of 51,320 exit permits in 1979,
Soviet emigration declined to 914 in 1986. It rebounded to 8,155 in
1987 and will go even higher this year if the monthly figures hold
up. In March, for example, 986 Jews emigrated, the highest monthly
total since 1981, according to the Conference on Soviet Jewry.
   The United States has been urging the Soviets to allow freer
emigration and religious freedom. Schifter said a pledge by
Gorbachev last week to show more tolerance toward religion
represented ``somewhat of an opening.''
   He also said it appeared that for the past half year the Soviets
have not enforced laws prohibiting adult Jewish education classes.
Schifter expressed some optimism that the Soviets will permit the
importation of bibles.
   Schifter did not appear particularly concerned about Gorbachev's
condemnation, during a visit by Secretary of State George P. Shultz
last month, of the Reagan administration's continued criticism of
Soviet human rights practices.
   ``He gets annoyed about these things,'' Schifter said of
Gorbachev. ``He is a person who has a short fuse on matters of this
kind. But the fact of the matter is that they are moving in this
area.''
   President Reagan is expected to continue raising the issues when
he goes to Moscow for the May 29-June 2 summit.
   Shultz told the Soviet Jewry conference that during his visit to
Moscow in April, he raised several human rights concerns, but
concentrated on Jewish emigration. He said the United States is
seeking improvements on five aspects of the issue:
   _Processing time. ``There are too many bureaucratic delays,''
Shultz said of the application process. ``While they can't admit it
they (Soviet leaders) see it as a real problem.''
   _Applications denied for security reasons. Many Jews'
applications are rejected on grounds they hold state secrets, even
those who haven't worked in defense plants for decades. There's
been no movement from the Soviets on this, ``but at least the
problem is up there on the table,'' Shultz said.
   _Family restrictions. The Soviets deny applications to those who
do not have close relatives in the West, a practice that violates
human rights accords the Soviets have signed, Shultz said.
   _Ill applicants. The Soviets should loosen up on applications
from people seeking medical care elsewhere, the secretary said.
   _Parental veto. Under Soviet law, the parents of an applicant
can veto the granting of a permit, even if the child is an adult.
``They're looking into it,'' Shultz said.

   East German Jews on Tuesday accused their
departing American rabbi of high living and improper performance of
duties and said they were looking for another man to become the
communist nation's only rabbi.
   One local Jew, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some
community members had begun calling Isaac Neuman ``the Hollywood
rabbi.''
   Numerous telephone calls to Neuman's home were unanswered
Tuesday. However, Neuman said on Sunday that such issues as his
apartment and car were not part of the tensions that prompted him
to decide to leave.
   A statement from the East Berlin Jewish community, carried by
the official ADN news agency, responded to criticisms made by
Neuman when he announced last weekend he was leaving May 16 after
only eight months.
   The 65-year-old rabbi from Champaign, Ill., had complained of
what he called anti-Semitism in East Germany and interference in
his work from local Jewish leadership.
   Tuesday's statement from local Jewish leaders said, ``His
current assertion that anti-Semitic tendencies in the press ...
have caused his return were never raised in his discussions with
the community.''
   East Germany officially maintains it has wiped out anti-Semitism
in its nearly four decades of existence.
   The statement also charged Neuman with improperly carrying out
some of his duties, such as dealing with the elderly and preparing
youths for Bar Mitzvah.
   The Polish-born Neuman, a Nazi prisoner during World War II, in
September became the first rabbi in 21 years for this nation's
Jewish community of about 450 people.
   There was no official word on a replacement for Neuman.
   Community members who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Neuman would be succeeded by Chicago Rabbi Ernst M. Lorge. Others
sources close to the community said Lorge would be appointed only
on an interim basis, while a young rabbi was sought as a permanent
replacement.
   Lorge, 71, said Tuesday in Chicago he had received no official
invitation to come to East Germany. ``If I do, I would have to
think about it,'' he said.
   He said he did not want to stay in East Germay year-round but
might accept a short-term arrangement.
   Lorge was born in Mainz, Germany, and emigrated to the United
States fleeing Nazi persecution in 1936.
   Neuman, explaining his reasons for leaving in an interview
Tuesday, said, ``I am unhappy about East Germany and
anti-Semitism.''
   He criticized the East German news media's depiction of
Palestinian unrest in Israel.
   ``Sometimes the way Israel is depicted is in a Nazi-like
fashion,'' he said. ``They have cut anti-Semitism but have not
succeeded in uprooting it.''
   He also complained about interference in his work. His main
objections focused on the local Jewish community president, Peter
Kirchner, who signed the statement distributed Tuesday by the East
German news agency.
   ``The assertion that Rabbi Neuman was hindered in carrying out
his functions by members, or the community representatives, or
other people must be rejected with emphasis,'' the statement said.
   East Berlin Jewish community members, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said there had long been criticism of Neuman and his
lifestyle.
   ``He would drive to West Berlin every day to get fresh
tomatoes,'' said one local Jew.
   Community members said Neuman was provided with a large
apartment and a car during his tenure.
   The community supported Neuman with funds provided by the
government.
   The East German Jewish community includes less than 350
officially registered members and about 100 other worshipers,
Neuman said. However, some estimates say that there are as many as
2,500 non-practicing Jews in East Germany.

<HEAD>Markey Urges NRC To Reject Rules Change for Seabrook Low-Power
License</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A congressional critic of nuclear power urged
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Tuesday to reject a staff
proposal that would permit atomic reactors to operate at low power
without an alarm system to warn nearby residents in case of an
emergency.
   The recommendation, scheduled for a preliminary commission vote
shortly, is aimed at the Seabrook, N.H., plant. The Atomic Safety
and Licensing Appeal Board has blocked a low-power license for
Seabrook because of the lack of a warning system for neighboring
communities in nearby Massachusetts.
   ``During fuel loading and low-power operation, the potential for
an accident still exists, including the possibility of a reactor
reaching a critical level,'' Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said
in a letter to NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr.
   ``While the magnitude of the risk may be lower (than at full
power), it is no lower than it was in 1982 when the NRC examined
the issue in detail and adopted existing standards,'' Markey wrote.
   Critics say Seabrook officials want to quickly secure a
low-power license because they fear they will lose their chance to
operate the $5.4 billion plant if Massachusetts Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis is elected president.
   Dukakis has led the fight against Seabrook and his refusal to
cooperate in emergency evacuation planning for the six Bay State
municipalities has delayed the licensing process.
   ``It's clear that they're trying to push this through because
they don't know what the future holds for the NRC,'' said Markey
aide Cathy Hurwit.
   NRC spokesman Robert Newlin said the commission was expected to
vote soon on whether to make the recommendation a ``proposed
rule.'' That would be subject to a public comment period, but not
necessarily a hearing, and a final commission vote, Newlin said.
   NRC officials say the current rules do not specifically require
an off-site warning system to obtain a low-power license, and that
the rules change would only ``clarify'' the regulations.
   But a 1982 commission ``explanation'' of the rule does specify
an off-site system, and that clearly has been the interpretation of
the licensing appeals board.
   The board ruled in February that a low-power license for
Seabrook ``is precluded unless and until the applicants have
submitted substitute public notification plans for the
Massachusetts communities'' within the emergency zone.
   Seabrook has proposed an alternate alert system that would use
truck-mounted sirens, backed up by siren-equipped helicopters,
according to plant spokesman Rob Williams.
   Williams said Seabrook officials plan to use that system during
low-power operation, but with the rules change would not need to
wait for regulatory approval of the system. Approval would be
needed eventually for a full-power license.

   A widow whose husband smoked and died of
lung cancer can pursue a wrongful death lawsuit against a tobacco
company and a retailer that sold cigarettes, the Minnesota Court of
Appeals ruled Tuesday.
   A three-judge panel unanimously overturned a district court
ruling in May 1987 that Ann Forster's claim was pre-empted by the
Federal Cigarette and Advertising Act.
   In March 1985, Mrs. Forster and her husband, John, sued R.J.
Reynolds Co., manufacturers of Camel cigarettes, and Erickson
Petroleum Corp., owner of Holiday Station Stores. The Forsters
claimed the retailer sold Forster the cigarettes.
   Forster, who was diagnosed as having inoperable lung cancer in
November 1984, died of the disease in June 1985, and the suit,
originally filed as a product liability case, was amended to a
wrongful death action. The lawsuit alleges that cigarettes caused
the lung cancer.
   Judge Thomas Kalitowski, who wrote the majority opinion, said
the U.S. Supreme Court historically has taken a narrow view of
federal pre-emption.
   In overturning the lower court, Kalitowski said: ``Our holding
is founded on the strong presumption, basic to our system of
federalism, that state police powers are not superseded by federal
actions'' without ``clear and unmistakable congressional intent or
absolute necessity.''
   ``We recognize appellants' claims may be difficult to prove,''
the ruling said. ``However, the difficulty of proof should not
preclude the basic right to present claims.''

   The House on Tuesday urged President Reagan to
maintain at least 20 missile-firing submarines as part of any
U.S.-Soviet agreement to cut back strategic nuclear weapons.
   The voice-vote decision came as the chamber adopted an amendment
to a bill authorizing the Pentagon budget for the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1.
   Both nations are now negotiating to achieve a Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks (START) treaty that could provide reductions of up
to 50 percent in each country's stockpile of long-range atomic
weapons.
   Those stockpiles are made up of submarine-launched missiles,
land-based missiles and bombers. Under the proposed treaty, both
sides would be required to reduce and restructure their arsenals.
   The United States now has more than half its strategic firepower
aboard 36 missile-firing subs, including 28 Poseidon-class boats
and eight of the giant Trident-class subs. Seven more Tridents are
under construction, while a 16th is authorized in the bill now on
the House floor.
   The United States hasn't yet decided how to restack its
stockpile under a START treaty, but the amendment offered by Rep.
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., said at least 20 submarines should be
retained.
   ``Our ability to prevent nuclear war depends more than anything
else on the maintenance of a survivable nuclear deterrent,'' said
Solarz, who added that subs are virtually invulnerable to attack
while they are at sea.
   ``It is in our interest to have the maximum number of submarines
possible,'' Solarz said.
   As it worked through the bill, the chamber also gave voice vote
approval to an amendment banning the sending of any Coast Guard
vessels to help the Navy patrol the Persian Gulf.
   Supporters of the amendment had said a day earlier they planned
to drop the proposal in the wake of a Pentagon announcement that
the deployment plan was being shelved. But as the issue arose
Tuesday, a procedural snare meant it was easier to simply approve
the amendment than to bypass it.
   In another decision, the House voted 213-195 to give federal
contractors more freedom to set pay scales.
   The vote approved an amendment overhauling the Davis-Bacon Act,
the 1931 law which requires that employees covered by contracts on
federal jobs worth more than $2,000 should be paid the prevailing
local wage rate, a figure determined by the Labor Department. The
rate is commonly the same rate paid union workers.
   The measure approved Tuesday would raise the threshold figure
from $2,000 to $50,000.
   The vote came shortly before the chamber rejected, 210-204, a
move that would have raised the Davis-Bacon threshold from $2,000
to $250,000.
   The Davis-Bacon law was enacted during the Great Depression amid
worries that construction companies would hire cheap labor.
   Tuesday's votes on the bill went generally along party lines,
with Democrats backing the $50,000 threshold and Republicans
supporting the $250,000 threshold.
   There have been a number of attempts during the Reagan
administration to change the law by critics who contend that the
$2,000 figure is outdated. Organized labor has strongly supported
the Davis-Bacon law.
   The amendment approved Tuesday was essentially the same measure
passed last Aug. 4 by the House Education and Labor Committee. That
bill hasn't yet come to the floor, but committee leaders said they
offered it as an amendment to the Pentagon budget bill in an effort
to forestall the amendment proposing a $250,000 threshold.
   Neither the START nor the Davis-Bacon amendments adopted Tuesday
is part of the Pentagon budget bill which the Senate will be
considering next week.
   Differences between the measures that eventually pass each
chamber will be worked out in a House-Senate conference committee.
   Both measures authorize $299.5 billion in Pentagon spending for
the next fiscal year.

<TEXT>
   Scientists expressed dismay Tuesday that some
White House decisions might have been based on astrology, with one
saying, ``That's not the type of guidance we need from the federal
government.''
   Andrew Fraknoi, an astronomy professor at San Francisco State
University and executive officer of the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific, said that the claims of astrology have been subjected to
dozens of scientific tests and have been found totally without
foundation.
   In one test, he said, two scientists examined more than 3,000
predictions by astrologers and found that they were correct less
than 10 percent of the time.
   ``If the predictions are wrong 90 percent of the time, that's
not the type of guidance we need from the federal government,''
Fraknoi said in a telephone interview from his San Francisco office.
   Meanwhile, an organization of scientists called the Committee
for the Scientific Investigation of the Claims of the Paranormal
said in a statement:
   ``We are dismayed by reports that the White House has consulted
astrologists. We are concerned by the apparent return to medieval
superstitition. Dozens of tests in recent years by scientists can
find little, if any, evidence for astrological claims. Horoscopes
have been shown under the most rigorous scientific analysis to fail
completely in predicting future events.''
   The committee also asked the White House ``to confirm to what
extent astrologers have been advisers of presidents. The public has
the right to know who these astrologers are and what
recommendations they have made. We ask that their claims and
alleged authorities be subjected to scientific scrutiny.''
   The issue was raised by reports that former White House chief of
staff Donald T. Regan wrote in an upcoming book that Nancy Reagan
consulted astrologers to determine the timing of presidential
speeches and announcements.
   President Reagan said Tuesday that he has never based any policy
or decision on astrological forecasts, but the White House
acknowledged that Mrs. Reagan has consulted an astrologer to help
schedule the president's activities.
   Fraknoi said modern astrology uses the positions of the Uranus
and Neptune in making predictions, and yet, these planets were not
even discovered when the concept of astrology was established in
ancient times.
   Furthermore, he said, the astrological predictions presumably
are based on the alignment of planets against a background of the
stars. Yet, since the astrology system was established in ancient
times, the Earth's position has shifted slightly so that the
constellations no longer are in the same relative viewing position.
In effect, the signs of the Zodiac viewed now are not those seen by
the ancients, he said.
   Franknoi said the concepts of astrology are based on the idea
that the influence of the stars and planets have some effect on
infants as they are born. Hence, the gravitational and tidal effect
of Mars, for instance, are supposed to influence the life of a
child, he said.
   But calculations by scientists show that the obstetrican who
delivers a baby has a six times greater gravitational influence on
a child than the planet Mars, Fraknoi said. And the tidal effect of
the obstetrican is greater by a factor of 2 trillion.
   ``Scientists have been warning for years that the uncritical
prominence given to astrology may have a deleterious effect on the
public,'' said the statement from the Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of the Claims of the Paranormal. ``... The intrusion
of astrology into the highest levels of national security thinking
now is a cause for further concern.
   ``If the United States is to continue its leadership in
scientific research, it is vital that the public have a clear
understanding of the difference between science and pseudoscience,
and that decisions be based on the real world without resorting to
mystical fortune telling and other primitive forms of
prognostication,'' the statement said.
   The organization has hundreds of scientists as members,
including such familiar names as Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov.

   Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., scheduled a news
conference in his district Wednesday after remaining in seclusion
following the death of his top aide last weekend in a plunge from
the 24th floor of a New York City hotel.
   The session with reporters was announced Tuesday by Katie
Tucker, who also told reporters that she has been elevated from
press secretary to chief of staff.
   Ms.Tucker will replace Tom Pappas, who police said apparently
jumped to his death Sunday from his room in the Helmsley Palace
Hotel after leaving a note.
   ``Congressman Roy Dyson will introduce Ms. Tucker to the people
of the First District on Wednesday, May 4 at 2 p.m. at the Southern
Maryland Electric Cooperative in Hughesville, Md.,'' said Ms.
Tucker's statement.
   Ms. Tucker returned to Dyson's office as press secretary just a
week ago. She had worked there as press secretary and legislative
assistant in 1985.
   While Dyson did not attend a session of the House of
Representatives on Tuesday, the House approved an amendment offered
by him to the defense authorization bill. The amendment would
require the secretary of the Navy to establish a ``Tethered
Aerostat Radar Surveillance System'' near the Patuxent Naval Air
Station that could be used by the Defense and Treasury departments
in drug surveillance operations.
   Dyson also missed a meeting of the House Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee, but voted by proxy on amendments to a bill
that would open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil
drillers. A check of the proxy by The Associated Press showed that
it was signed by Dyson last week.
   Pappas was Dyson's closest aide and top adviser from the time
Dyson was elected to the state legislature in 1974. His death came
the same day The Washington Post published an article quoting
former aides as saying that Pappas pressured male staffers to
socialize with him.
   The staffers said the pressure did not go beyond demands that
they attend parties and social functions with Pappas.
   There also have been numerous articles recently concerning
payments made from Dyson's campaign funds to a media relations
company owned by Pappas. Payments to Pappenbauer Associates totaled
$119,642 since 1980, a revised Dyson campaign report showed.
   Democratic leaders in the congressional district say they don't
believe Dyson's prospects for being re-elected to a fifth term in
November will be jeopardized by publicity surrounding the death of
Pappas and the campaign payments to him.
   They say, however, that the extent of the damage will depend on
how Dyson confronts his problems.
   ``There are a lot of folks who need some direction. I think he
needs to make a statement,'' state Delegate Daniel Long, a Dyson
supporter, said Tuesday.
   Long said, however, he doesn't blame Dyson for going into
seclusion.
   ``He has lost his friend, his mentor, his campaign manager, his
top aide,'' he said.

   A man convicted of murdering seven women and
letting their bodies rot faces life in prison rather than death
under an unusual sentence handed down Tuesday.
   Common Pleas Judge Robert A. Latrone issued six death sentences
against Harrison ``Marty'' Graham but ordered him first to serve up
to 14 years in prison on seven counts of abuse of a corpse and life
in prison for the remaining murder.
   Latrone, who ordered the sentences to run consecutively,
explained that he chose life in prison over the death penalty on
the first murder count because of a mitigating circumstance _ the
lack of a previous record. But the conviction on the first count
legally qualified as an aggravating circumstance on the second
through seventh murder counts, necessitating the death penalty in
those six cases.
   Graham could not apply for parole during the life sentence,
however, without putting the death sentence into effect, defense
attorney Joel Moldovsky said.
   Graham, whose attorney said he was mentally retarded, sat
motionlessly through the sentencing, a half-smoked cigarette tucked
behind his ear.
   Moldovsky called the sentence ``unusually compassionate and
brilliant.''
   But Assistant District Attorney Roger King, who characterized
Graham as a ``serial killer'' during the trial, questioned the
legality of the order.
   ``It would appear that the greater sentence would come first,''
he said, meaning the death penalty.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reviews all death sentences.
   Last week, Latrone convicted Graham of seven counts of murder
and abuse of a corpse. Graham waived his right to a jury trial,
leaving the decisions, including sentencing, solely to the judge.
   Police found the bodies of seven women in August 1987, after
Graham was evicted from his apartment because of a putrid stench.
Officers found six rotting bodies in Graham's bedroom, leg and foot
bones outside his apartment and a torso in a neighboring house's
basement.
   At his mother's urging, Graham surrendered to police a week
after the bodies were discovered.
   In a statement his lawyer unsuccessfully contested, Graham told
police he strangled the women while having sex and after feeding
them drugs and alcohol. He said that when the bodies began piling
up in his apartment, he began experiencing trouble with ``fur-ball
bugs,'' or maggots, and with birds feeding on the remains outside
the window.
   The 28-year-old Graham did not testify during the six-week trial.
   Moldovsky, who had argued his client did not know right from
wrong and might have killed the women accidentally or because of
drug or alcohol use, said he would consult with Graham's family
before deciding whether to appeal.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush told a victory
rally on Tuesday his clinching of the Republican presidential
nomination was just a first step, while his son told campaign
workers to ``go out and kick some Mike Dukakis.''
   Bush celebrated his mathematical lock on the nomination at an
``Over the Top'' party at a Washington hotel.
   The vice president said surpassing the 1,139 delegates needed
for nomination _ which he actually did in last week's Pennsylvania
primary _ ``wrapped this thing up sooner than I think any of us
thought might take place.''
   Bush was was expected to pick up another 132 delegates in
Tuesday's winner-take-all GOP primaries in Ohio, Indiana and the
District of Columbia.
   ``It all boiled down to working together,'' Bush told his
campaign staff and volunteer workers.
   ``And yet,'' he added, ``I don't feel any finality to what has
happened now at all. We've passed the first step, a tremendously
important step... But now we've got a long way to go.''
   George Bush Jr., sharing the platform with his father, told the
group: ``Our dad needs a real job.''
   ``Sometimes sons can say things a father can't. We want you to
go out there and kick some Mike Dukakis, and kick him hard,'' he
said.
   The younger Bush's remarks about the Democratic front-runner
were a play on Bush's celebrated off-color gloat to New Jersey
longshoremen in which he characterized his performance in his 1984
debate with Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro.
   The vice president declared to rousing cheers that ``the party
is united.''
   ``I don't believe there are any deep divisions in this party at
all,'' he said. ``Let Mike Dukakis go around here talking about
pink slips, despair, pessimism in the United States. I'll be the
guy out there talking about hope and opportunity and challenge.''
   Republican Party Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf told the gathering:
``Tonight we officially celebrate the fact that George Bush will be
our nominee following the convention in New Orleans.''
   Although Bush campaign aides earlier had said there was a
possibility that President Reagan would attend the rally to
formally voice his endorsement of Bush, the president was not in
attendance.
   ``It never really jelled,'' said Bush spokesman Peter Teeley.
   However, campaign and White House aides suggested that it was
likely Reagan's endorsement would come soon, perhaps within the
week.
   Campaigning earlier in Morgantown, W.Va., Bush said that
Americans have gotten ``a little fat, dumb and happy'' about the
nation's energy needs and growing dependence on foreign oil.
   At West Virginia University, Bush watched university scientists
display a model of a ``circulating fluidized bed'' that eases the
mining process by converting minerals to liquids.
   In his speech after leaving the research facility, he quipped,
``At one point, some guy was going into all this fluoride bed thing
and the doctor said, `Do you understand that?' and I said, `Hell,
no. The last thing I understood was when the guy said hello.' But
it was impressive.''
   Earlier, he said the acid rain problem that Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney recently discussed with President Reagan
made it even more urgent to find clean ways to burn coal.
   ``There's no way you can make an energy model for the future
without coal as a very important part,'' he said.
   Bush called his trip to West Virginia, which has its primary
next Tuesday, ``a relatively non-political visit,'' and avoided
partisan remarks in his speech.
   Asked by reporters about barbs he has traded with Dukakis, Bush
said, ``I found myself going back at him a little more than I
wanted to.''
   On picking a vice president, Bush said he wanted someone loyal
whom he could trust.
   When a reporter said that sounded like Bush himself, he replied,
``That's just fine with me. And he ought to be prepared to take a
helluva lot of flak for handling it that way.''

<HEAD>Contra Indians Surrender, Government Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 200 rebel Indians backed
by the United States surrendered their weapons and agreed to join
the Sandinistas, the government newspaper El Nuevo Diario said
Tuesday.
   It said the Indians agreed to stop military actions against the
Sandinistas and to ``not allow the presence of guerrilla groups in
the territory.''
   The Indians, like other Contra groups operating from Honduras
and Costa Rica, had U.S. backing and fought the leftist Sandinista
government since 1981.
   Tens of thousands of Miskito, Rama and Sumo Indians left their
tribal homelands beginning in 1981 after the government tried to
impose Marxism in the area and said it would move them to
relocation camps.
   Many Indians crossed the Rio Coco and sought refuge in Honduras
rather than move to relocation camps. Thousands took up arms,
creating rebel movements which, like the larger Nicaraguan
Resistance, received U.S. aid.
   Most of the refugees have returned to their native 75-mile-long
region along the Atlantic seaboard. The region is considered a
national security area and foreigners are barred unless they have
Interior Ministry permission.
   The Sandinistas some years ago acknowledged their errors with
the Indians and sought their support.
   By March 1, nearly 7,000 had returned from Honduran refugee
camps, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
   The government has not been as successful with other Contra
groups. A fragile interim truce has been in place since April 1 as
Contras and Sadinista leaders negotiate a permanent peace accord.

<HEAD>Chicago Elections Board Sets 1989 Special Mayoral Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city elections board voted unanimously
Tuesday to hold a special mayoral election in spring 1989 to choose
a successor to the late Mayor Harold Washington, whose term would
have ended in 1991.
   ``We're proceeding with the 1989 election unless we're ordered
to the contrary by the court,'' said Tom Leach, a spokesman for the
city Board of Elections Commissioners.
   The board had voted April 24 to hold a special mayoral election
in April 1989 if City Clerk Walter Kozubowski declared that
Washington's death in late November created a vacancy in the
position.
   Kozubowski said at the time he wouldn't issue such a declaration
unless ordered to do so by a court. But on Monday, he apparently
changed his mind and provided the elections board with the
documentation, Leach said.
   ``The board decided to accept the declaration of a vacancy from
the city clerk and decided to go ahead with the 1989 election
unless we're ordered not to by the courts,'' Leach said.
   Circuit Judge Eugene Wachowski said last week he expected to
rule on the issue at a hearing Friday.
   Supporters of acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer and Alderman Tim Evans,
a rival and potential mayoral candidate, have been feuding over
when the next mayoral election should be held.
   Evans hailed Tuesday's decision as ``a great victory for all of
Chicago.''
   ``We have never doubted that 1989 is the legally correct time
for a special election,'' he said in a statement issued from
Atlanta, where he is attending a meeting of city finance officers.
   ``Now, however belatedly, the board of elections has heard the
voices of the people and has followed the dictates of law. It is a
great victory for all of Chicago, one that is certain to be upheld
by the courts,'' Evans said.
   Sawyer's press secretary, Monroe Anderson, did not return a
telephone call seeking comment.
   Under the plan approved Tuesday, Leach said, a primary election
would be held Feb. 28, followed by a general election April 4,
1989, that also would be used to choose a 6th Ward alderman to
succeed acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer.
   Sawyer was elected Washington's successor by the City Council
shortly after the city's first black mayor died of a heart attack
in late November.
   Both sides filed lawsuits asking the Cook County Circuit Court
to decide the issue. Evans forces have sought a 1989 special
election, while Sawyer's allies have been fighting for the 1991
election.
   ``Naturally, it's going to be fought out in the court,'' Leach
said Tuesday.
   He said the elections board would not contest any court decision
dictating when the next mayoral election should be held.
   ``We take a neutral position. We don't fight anything,'' Leach
said.

<HEAD>Meese Says Police Need Worldwide Links</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III said Tuesday
that police worldwide need to cooperate more closely because
terrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking have reached
international dimensions.
   ``It is not unusual for a person to commit a crime and be half a
world away in the next few hours,'' Meese told the fifth annual
meeting of the International Association of Police Chiefs.
   He predicted that many local police cars in the United States
would be equipped with minicomputers with access to international
computers.
   Meese cited possible links between a fatal bombing outside a
U.S. military club in Naples, Italy, and the arrest of a Japanese
man carrying pipe bombs on the New Jersey Turnpike.
   He said U.S. investigators determined that the man, Yu Kikumura,
was ``a known member'' of the Japanese Red Army, a terrorist group
whose members were blamed for detonating a car bomb on April 14
outside the Naples USO club.
   Meese said such incidents require ``the highest level in the
sharing of intelligence between governments.''
   Italian officials issued arrest warrants for two fugitive
members of the Japanese Red Army in the Naples bombing. The attack
killed four Italians and an American servicewoman.
   Meese also told the law enforcenment officials from 60 countries
that crime in the United States is climbing and that the spread and
sale of drugs ``seems to be getting worse instead of better.''
   Recalling his trip last month to Latin America, Meese said he
flew over a coca field 75 miles wide and 200 miles long, proving
the pervasive spread of cocaine production in the area.
   He said drug production now has ``a potential for undermining
governments.''
   Before the opening of the three-day meeting in Rome, Meese met
with Justice Minister Giuliano Vassali to discuss improving
extradition procedures between Italy and the United States and to
organize joint education programs for police and other law
enforcement agencies.
   Meese said he granted an Italian request to consider
transferring an Italian convicted of subversion, Silvia Baraldini,
now in a high security prison in Lexington, Ky., to another
facility currently under construction.
   Members of parliament have asked that her prison conditions be
improved.

<HEAD>Toyota Announces Program to Fix Brake Pedal Pulsation in Camrys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota announced Tuesday that owners of about
380,000 Camrys are entitled to have a brake pedal pulsation problem
repaired free.
   The voluntary recall, which is available to owners of 1983-1986
Camrys and certain early 1987 Camrys, is designed to correct a
brake pedal pulsation problem that some owners have complained
about, said Debra Sanchez, a spokeswoman for Toyota Motor Sales
U.S.A. Inc. in Torrance, Calif.
   Brake pedal pulsation can be felt by drivers when their foot is
on the pedal, but it does not affect braking effectiveness or
steering control, Sanchez said. Brake pedal pulsation is caused by
movement of the brake pads as they pass over the brake disc, she
said.
   Later this month, Toyota plans to notify owners of the cars in
phases based on model years. The problem will be fixed at no charge
to the customer for a period of 12 months from the date of
notification, the company said.
   The action comes in the wake of a class-action lawsuit filed in
California state court by two public interest law firms seeking
free repairs and reimbursement for car owners who have paid to have
their Camrys fixed or checked.
   ``We're impressed with this step they're taking. There's no
question it's a major commitment,'' John Phillips of the Center for
Law in the Public Interest said of Toyota's announcement.
   Attorneys will pursue the suit, however, because, ``We've
alleged that they've engaged in a secret warranty for this defect
by notifying the dealers and not notifying the owners,'' Phillips
said.
   The Center for Auto Safety in Washington, D.C., joined in the
suit filed April 20 in Los Angeles County Superior Court.

   Afghan and Soviet forces routinely killed and
tortured civilian refugees fleeing to Pakistan from the war in
Afghanistan, a human rights group charged Tuesday.
   Amnesty International, in a report called ``Afghanistan:
Unlawful Killings and Torture,'' also said civilians were killed or
tortured in reprisals for the actions of Afghan rebels fighting the
Soviet-backed government in Kabul.
   Amnesty International said its main concern was the alleged
killing of ``clearly helpless'' civilians, particularly refugees.
   It cited one instance in which 100 families were attacked twice
on their 300-mile trek out of the country. Killed were 24 refugees,
including seven children under the age of six, it said.
   ``Amnesty International has compiled evidence of what appears to
be a policy of deliberate killings by Soviet and Afghan government
forces of Afghan refugees found traveling toward Pakistan,'' said
the report.
   The London-based rights group said soliders have attacked
``buses and groups of women, children and men moving on foot and on
horseback,'' many of whom were fleeing Soviet and Afghan bombing
and shelling of their villages in retaliation for guerrilla attacks.
   Amnesty International said its representatives visited refugees
in Pakistan and India and obtained information from witnesses to
the attacks.
   The nine-page report dealt with 1987 and early 1988.
   The human rights group said the Afghan government should make
every effort to investigate the allegations during the withdrawal
of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, scheduled to begin this month.
The Soviets have been in the country since 1979 supporting the
government.
   ``We are worried that ... during this interim period, if firm
measures are not taken by the Kabul government, there could be
further human rights violations, especially killings and torture,''
said Jawid Laiq of Amnesty.
   ``There appears to be a policy to attack refugees,'' he said.
``We feel that this has occurred fairly often although we can't put
a number on it.''
   About 3 million Afghan refugees have fled across the border to
Pakistan, where the Moslem guerrillas fighting the Kabul government
have bases.
   United Nations officials have estimated that 2.2 million other
Afghan refugees live in Iran.
   Under an accord signed last month, the Soviet army is to begin a
nine-month withdrawal of its 115,000 troops in Afghanistan. The
guerrillas say they will ignore the agreement and fight on.
   Amnesty International also cited reports of the summary
executions of civilians who remained in their homes during the war,
and the torture of others taken into custody.
   The report said, however, information suggests that ``torture
may not be as systematic and as routine a form of interrogation as
it was till early 1986.''

<TEXT>
   Sandinista police detained five hunger
strike sympathizers on Tuesday when they tried to talk to reporters
in the area where workers were on the ninth day of a fast to demand
higher pay.
   The officers, members of the Interior Ministry's Special Forces
unit, cited a ban on unauthorized public activities.
   Police have taken at least 40 people into custody during the
past week in connection with the hunger strike by more than 30
construction workers and car mechanics.
   Sandinista policewomen, wearing black berets and toting rubber
truncheons, cordoned off the front of the headquarters of the
General Workers Federation, a coalition of socialist
anti-government unions, and kept journalists away.
   The five sympathizers stood around the corner from the union
hall and told reporters that authorities would not let them get
close to the union building, where some hunger strikers peered
through locked gates.
   Police pushed through the journalists, grabbed the five and
shoved them into three different vehicles.
   ``This is an unauthorized public act,'' said a Sandinista police
officer who refused to give his name.
   Police last Friday night permitted a group of Sandinsta students
to hold a rally at the same spot where the arrests were made.
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge last week reportedly punched in
the mouth the director of an anti-government radio station for
broadcasting what Borge said was wrong information about the
strike. The Sandinista newspaper Barricada reported the altercation.
   About 1,500 construction workers and auto mechanics have been on
strike since the end of February for higher salaries and improved
working conditions.
   The wildcat strikes are an embarrassment to the leftist
Sandinista government.
   Such strikes were illegal for almost six years under a state of
emergency that was lifted in January.
   President Daniel Ortega removed the restrictions as part of a
regional peace plan which includes calls for democratic reforms.
Ortega and the presidents of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and
Costa Rica signed the agreement last August.
   Public demonstrations are allowed only with Interior Ministry
permission.
   The state-run telephone company meanwhile cut off service to
about 6,000 offices and homes in Managua because of overdue bills
totaling $1.8 million.
   The cutoff left the national banking system, embassies,
state-run enterprises, government offices and thousands of homes in
the capital without telephone service. There are a total of 29,000
phones in Managua, a city of about 900,000 people.
   Hundreds of Nicaraguans went to the Nicaraguan
Telecommunications and Postal Institute protesting the shutoff and
saying they had paid their bills.
   A telephone company spokeswoman, Maritza Flores, acknowledged
that some phones were disconnected because of ``computer
problems,'' but said other customers had not paid their bills for
several months.
   The cutoff came Saturday and was reported in local newspapers
Tuesday.

   The United Methodist governing conference has

which would mean an addition of four bishops to the nation's

   The measure allows the three jurisdictions in which the
episcopal areas lie to divide the areas if they choose, although
determinations still must be made about funding and
constitutionality of the change.
   The episcopal areas that could be affected are Dallas-Fort
Worth, Texas; Birmingham, Ala; Atlanta; and Indiana.

   Showers and thunderstorms covered much of the central United
States Tuesday and pelted Arkansas and Missouri with hail, after
areas of Kansas and Nebraska soaked up more than 5 inches of rain.
   Sunny skies prevailed over the northern Midwest states, and
temperatures soared into the upper 70s in central and northern
Minnesota.
   The heaviest thunderstorms hit northern Arkansas, Missouri and
eastern Kansas.
   In northeast Arkansas, walnut-size hail was reported near
Pocahontas and one-inch hail fell in Lawrence County. Marble-size
hail was reported in several parts of central Missouri.
   Showers and thunderstorms also stretched from western Tennessee
to the Missouri Valley into eastern South Dakota. There were also a
few showers over eastern Pennsylvania and eastern Maryland and over
the central Gulf Coast.
   Rain tapered off during the morning over Kansas and Nebraska. In
the 24 hours ending at 8 a.m. EDT Tuesday, McDonald, Kan. reported
5} inches of rain and 4 inches were recorded during the same period
over parts of central Nebraska.
   Skies were sunny over Michigan and Wisconsin and temperatures
climbed well into the 70s in Minnesota. International Falls, Minn.,
on the Canadian border, registered a balmy 77 degrees at 3 p.m. EDT.
   Skies were cloudy and temperatures stayed in the 40s and 50s
over the northern and central Plains. Temperatures in New England
also stayed cool in the 50s.
   Showers continued along coastal sections of the Pacific
Northwest with some snow at the higher elevations. A snow advisory
was in effect for the Oregon Cascades.
   Sunny skies and warm temperatures prevailed from central Texas
to southern California.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 37 degrees at
Yellowstone, Wyo., to 89 degrees at Cotulla, Texas, and Chase Naval
Air Station, Beeville, Texas.
   The low for the nation Tuesday morning was 7 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Showers and thunderstorms were forecast Wednesday to extend from
the Middle Atlantic states to the Carolinas and into the Tennessee
and Ohio Valleys. Showers and thunderstorms also were predicted to
stretch from the northern Pacific Coast to the northern Rockies and
into northern Nevada.
   High temperatures were predicted to be in the 50s in Washington,
Oregon, western Idaho, northwest Nevada and northern California.
Highs were forecast in the 80s in Florida, the Gulf Coast and most
of Texas, and into the 90s in the desert southwest. Highs elsewhere
were forecast to be in the 60s or 70s.

   More than 7,000 strikers at the Lenin
shipyard, where Solidarity was born eight years ago, demanded
Tuesday that the outlawed union federation be made legal again. The
government called that ``not negotiable.''
   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, 44, spoke to the strikers
several times, but said he would not lead the strike.
   ``I am not your leader. I'm tired,'' said the man who vaulted
the shipyard fence in 1980 and took charge of a labor revolt that
brought down a government. ``You need a new Walesa, many more new
Walesas.''
   ``You declared this strike,'' he said. ``I'm with you and I'll
always be with you. I can advise you. I have some experience.
   ``If we don't achieve a real reform this time, then we will have
a bloody revolution.''
   A striker offered a loaf of bread, a Polish gesture of
hospitality. Walesa broke off a piece and munched on it.
   Four thousand ship-repair workers and 1,000 port workers at
another Gdansk shipyard stayed off the job Tuesday in sympathy with
the strikers at the Lenin shipyard, said Joanna Wojciechowicz, a
Solidarity activist in Gdansk.
   The report could not be independently confirmed. There was no
answer at the ship repair yard.
   In Warsaw, meanwhile, protesters marched in the streets in
support of the strikers, an opposition spokesman said. They were
dispersed by police.
   Walesa, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, still works at the
shipyard as an electrician but is on sick leave this week,
complaining of back pains and low blood sugar.
   On the first day of the shipyard strike Monday, workers asked
that a local Solidarity chapter be approved, but on Tuesday
demanded reinstatement of the union nationwide. Solidarity, the
first independent union in the Soviet bloc, was crushed and
outlawed after martial law was declared Dec. 13, 1981.
   A large poster at the gate listed the other demands: higher pay,
release of political prisoners and reinstatement of fired activists.
   Polish workers want pay raises of up to 60 percent to compensate
for price increases of 42 percent that resulted from reduction of
subsidies by the Communist government.
   The labor trouble, which has lasted more than a week, is the
worst in Poland since the crackdown on Solidarity. The biggest
strike is by 15,000 workers at the Nowa Huta steel complex in the
south, the nation's largest industrial plant.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said of the demand for
nationwide recognition of Solidarity: ``This is not a question that
can be an object of negotiations. It is not negotiable.''
   During a Warsaw news conference, he said strike leaders were
``professional politicians'' working for Western powers.
   Despite his protests, Walesa was emerging Tuesday as the
dominant figure among the Gdansk strikers.
   ``We lost eight years,'' he said through a loudspeaker. ``Here,
in the birthplace of Solidarity, I state to the authorities that
they are deepening the losses, they are forcing Solidarity to lead
the nation onto the road to reforms.''
   In Poland, strikers customarily occupy their places of work.
When police cordoned off the shipyard Tuesday, Walesa stayed inside
with the strikers, said his adviser, the Rev. Henryk Jankowski.
   Strikes began April 25 with a wildcat action by transit workers
in Bydgoszcz that was settled the same day with pay raises of at
least 50 percent. The Nowa Huta strike began the next day.
   On Friday, thousand of employees at the Stalowa Wola heavy
machinery plant quit working but the strike was settled Saturday by
promises of higher pay.
   Government and opposition spokesmen confirmed a brief work
stoppage Tuesday at a railroad car plant in Wroclaw, and opposition
spokesmen said about 1,000 miners occupied a copper mine in western
Poland for eight hours. Jerzy Jarmuzek, manager of the Rudna mine,
said only 150 workers were involved.
   University students in Krakow, Poznan and Gdansk struck in
sympathy with the workers, according to opposition spokesmen in the
three cities.
   Police have rounded up about a dozen dissident leaders and
apparently cut off the telephones of others. Sources said some
people were staying away from home for fear of detention.
   Walesa told reporters that Bogdan Lis, a Gdansk regional
Solidarity chief, and eight other regional leaders were detained.
Other prominent figures reported arrested were dissident
intellectual Adam Michnik and Leszek Moczulski, leader of the
rightist opposition Confederation of Independent Poland.
   Urban called the detentions ``preventive.''
   The strike at the 12,000-worker Lenin shipyard began Monday soon
after the breakfast break and grew to between 7,000 and 8,000
people by Tuesday morning, said Alojzy Szablewski, chairman of the
strike committee.
   On Tuesday, the shipyard cranes were idle and only transport,
power and some other essential operations appeared to be
functioning.
   Hundreds of strikers were at the main gates, wearing Solidarity
badges and arm bands. The gate was festooned with yellow flowers,
Solidarity banners, and pictures of Pope John Paul II, a native of
Poland, and the Black Madonna, Poland's revered icon.
   Some workers sat atop the gate, which bore a huge sign saying
``Occupation Strike.'' Others climbed on the roofs of buildings to
hear Walesa speak.
   Cheers of ``Solidarity!'' and ``Lech, Lech!'' rose on both sides
of the gate when Walesa arrived.

   Democratic presidential contender Jesse
Jackson scored an easy win in the District of Columbia's primary on
Tuesday, telling backers: ``We're moving right along.''
   Earlier, he had urged supporters in the capital to ``vote with a
passion.''
   It was his first primary election victory since he won Puerto
Rico in March. Jackson also swept the District of Columbia primary
in 1984.
   Jackson did not fare as well in the day's two other contests,
losing to Michael Dukakis in Indiana and Ohio.
   As voters were going to the polls in the nation's capital,
Jackson spoke to the group of ministers, and joked about moving
into the White House.
   ``Today we stopped by Washington to pick out some furniture for
our new house,'' he said.
   Later, in Atlanta, Jackson spoke at the National Machinists
Union convention, where he was enthusiastically received by several
thousand unionists.
   Jackson focused his speech on labor issues, telling the group he
had stood with union members on many picket lines and plant
closings. It has been a consistent theme in recent weeks as Jackson
campaigned in industrial-state primaries.
   ``I'm a working person,'' he said.
   Jackson spoke of his plan to reinvest public pension funds in
domestic infrastructure projects which would provide jobs for
Americans and counter the current rash of jobs that corporations
are taking to cheap foreign labor markets.
   His speech was interrupted by thunderous applause and shouts at
several points.
   ``Do I make sense?'' he asked them.
   ``Yes,'' screamed the workers.
   ``Then vote for me,'' Jackson said. ``I stood with you. Now you
stand with me. When I win, you win.''
   Jackson had headed into the three primaries sounding a combative
note, accusing front-runner Dukakis on Monday of running a
play-it-safe ``Teflon'' campaign.
   Addressing a crowd of 11,000 people at Ohio State, Jackson
continued to portray himself as the candidate of specific proposals
and budget plans, accusing Dukakis of being vague.
   ``So far Dukakis has operated with caution when we must operate
with clarity and courage and candor,'' he told reporters Monday.

   Ohio Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, one of the most liberal members of
Congress, easily won the Democratic nomination for a third term
Tuesday, paving the way for a big-money battle against Cleveland's
Republican Mayor George Voinovich.
   In two other state primaries, Indiana Secretary of State Evan
Bayh and North Carolina Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan captured Democratic
nominations for governor and will seek to reclaim their states' top
post from Republicans.
   With 26 percent of the Ohio vote counted, Metzenbaum had 261,416
votes or 82.3 percent, and his lone opponent, Ralph Applegate, who
runs a Columbus lawn-care business, had 56,359 votes or 17.7
percent.
   In Indiana, with 35 percent of precincts reporting, Bayh had
156,731 votes or 82.3 percent, former Kokomo Mayor Stephen J. Daily
had 22,183 votes or 11.6 percent and Senate Minority Leader Frank
L. O'Bannon had 11,499 votes or 6.0 percent.
   Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz, 52, was unopposed for the Republican
nomination.
   Bayh, 32-year-old son of former Sen. Birch E. Bayh, was aided by
one of the most famous names in Indiana politics in his bid to end
20 years of Republican rule. Gov. Robert D. Orr was barred by state
law from seeking a third term.
   O'Bannon is Bayh's choice for lieutenant governor, but he put
his name on the ballot as a precaution when it appeared Bayh might
be ruled ineligible because of a five-year residency requirement.
But the state Supreme Court ruled last week that Bayh met the
qualifications.
   ``This campaign begins tonight and it will be as important as
any in the history of Indiana,'' said Bayh in claiming victory.
   Indiana also has a Senate race this year, but neither Republican
Sen. Richard G. Lugar nor Democratic attorney Jack Wickes had
primary challenges.
   In North Carolina, with 21 percent of the vote in, Jordan had
70,197 votes or 80 percent. Next came Billy Martin, a
service-station employee not related to governor, with 9,751 votes
or 11 percent; then Carroll W. Crawford of Mount Ulla, a former Ku
Klux Klansman, with 3,921 votes or 4 percent; James T. LLoyd of
Salisbury with 1,786 votes or 2 percent, and Bruce Friedman, an
anti-nuclear activist from Sylva, with 1,765 votes or 2 percent.
   Jordan called the viictory ``the highest honor and the best
opportunity the North Carolina people have ever given me,'' and
predicted his campaign against GOP Gov. Jim Martin would be ``a
classic race.''
   Martin, only the second Republican this century to hold the
office, had no primary opposition as he sought a second term.
   Metzenbaum, 70, has consistently drawn top ratings from the
liberal Americans for Democratic Action based on his voting record,
and as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee he helped lead
the fight against the Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork.
   Voinovich, 51, who was unopposed for the GOP nomination, is a
moderate who recently came out in support of the trade bill which
President Reagan pledges to veto.
   Voinovich used the occasion to formally open his central Ohio
headquarters in the state capital, and predicted a hard-hitting,
cliff-hanger race in November against Metzenbaum.
   ``You mark my words. The most focused-on race in the United
States is going to be Metzenbaum-Voinovich. This will be a
barn-burner,'' Voinovich said in Columbus.
   Metzenbaum, who spent the night in Cleveland, issued a statement
saying he was honored that Democrats had given him an overwhelming
vote of confidence.
   ``And as I've said before,'' he added, ``when the votes are
counted in November, I'm confident that 1988 will be a very
disappointing year for Republican candidates named George.'
   Ohio also had two lively congressional races. A GOP primary in
the northwestern 5th District matched Ohio Senate President Paul
Gillmor against Robert Latta, son of Rep. Delbert Latta who is
retiring after 30 years in Washington. A third Republican, Rex
Damschroder, was also in the race, while Thomas Murray ran
unopposed for the district's Democratic nomination.
   In the Cleveland area's 20th District, six-term Rep. Mary Rose
Oakar faced a Democratic primary challenge from former Cleveland
Mayor Dennis Kucinich. Michael Sajna, a Republican write-in
candidate, was unopposed for the GOP nod.

   Even before the primary, Voinovich and Metzenbaum squared off by
spending thousands on television ads questioning each other's
commitments to Social Security, retirement benefits and challenging
disclosure of personal financial information.
   Federal Election Commission reports showed that as of March 31
Metzenbaum had raised $4.4 million, the third-highest amount of any
incumbent senator seeking re-election this year.
   Voinovich, who raised $2.9 million by the same date, had
initially criticized his rival for collecting money out of state.
But he recently announced a fundraising drive of his own in major
cities around the country.
   In Indiana, Mutz, a 20-year veteran of the General Assembly and
executive branch, sought to make an issue of Bayh's youth and
experience, saying ``We're not talking about electing somebody
class president here.''
   Bayh responded that age was ``not relevant'' and said the
governorship was ``not just some kind of gold watch that someone is
awarded after 20 years of service.''
   A poll published Sunday by the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette showed
Bayh with a 45 percent to 32 percent advantage over Mutz.
   The Democrats are on the losing side of current polls in North
Carolina, where the Greensboro News & Record reported that a recent
survey showed Jordan trailing Martin 47 percent to 39 percent with
14 percent undecided.
   Jordan has attacked Martin as trying to take credit for
Democrats' accomplishments. Martin claims that in his first three
years, more than 300,000 new jobs have come into the state ``from
poultry to high tech.''
   Jordan drew criticism in March when he told black newspaper
executives he agreed with them on some issues that he wouldn't
discuss publicly because he could not win ``without the white
redneck vote in eastern North Carolina.''
   Jordan said he hadn't meant to be derogatory and considered
himself a redneck.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Charges Illegal Sale Of Korean-Made M-16 Rifles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American M-16 rifles made in Korea have been
sold illegally by a Korean manufacturer to at least one nation and
maybe more, a House investigations subcommittee charged Tuesday.
   The United States and Korea signed an agreement in 1971 allowing
M-16s to be manufactured in Korea, but the pact prohibited sales to
third countries without U.S. approval and set a production cap.
   The plant was set up with the help of Colt Industries Firearms
Division of Hartford, Conn., the maker of the Army rifle, and run
by the Korean government. But the Korean Defense Ministry
transferred the operation and ownership to a private company,
Daewoo Precision Industries, in 1982.
   Following the transfer, Daewoo refused to pay Colt the per-rifle
royalties it had been receiving under contract, according to Ronald
Stilwell, Colt vice president for military administration. Colt has
sued both the company and the Korean government.
   Colt began reporting to U.S. officials suspicions that the
Korean company was exceeding the production cap, according to
Warren Nelson, a House Armed Services Committee aide.
   Later, U.S. government investigators uncovered ``solid''
evidence of unauthorized sales to one country and ``hints'' of
sales to other nations, Nelson said.
   ``We now have evidence that M-16s made in Korea have ended up in
the hands of at least one other country, in my judgment, a country
to whom the United States would have forbidden any sales,'' said
Rep. Bill Nichols, D-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services
investigation subcommittee.
   Nichols said in a statement that there also is evidence that the
Korean company exceeded its production cap.
   Nelson said the identity of the third country was classified and
could not be released. He said the subcommittee was working to have
that information declassified in time for a hearing Thursday on the
M-16 investigation.
   Colt has learned independently that the Korean firm has sold
parts to Indonesia through a Singapore intermediary, according to
Stilwell.
   Nichols compared the case to the sale of sensitive U.S.
submarine technology by Toshiba Corp., a Japanese company, to the
Soviet Union.
   ``Here is another problem with a private foreign firm that owes
no allegiance to the United States or broad defense interests,''
the congressman said.
   ``As with the case of the Toshiba sale of precision instruments
to the Soviet Union, Daewoo appears more interested in the pursuit
of private profit than the interests of our mutual defense
alliance,'' he said.
   Nelson said a General Accounting Office report on the allegedly
illegal sales will be presented to the subcommittee at Thursday's
hearing.
   Others scheduled to testify include Colt representatives, Glenn
A. Rudd, deputy director of the Defense Security Assistance Agency,
and Regina Eltz, director of the Office of Security Assistance at
the State Department.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic front-runner Michael S. Dukakis refused
to lay claim to the presidential nomination after primary wins
Tuesday in Ohio and Indiana but said ``it's going to be difficult''
for rival Jesse Jackson to overtake him now.
   ``I feel great about today and the results today,'' the
Massachusetts governor told a Boston news conference after racking
up big wins in two of Tuesday's three primary contests. Jackson won
the District of Columbia primary.
   ``We've got to keep working,'' Dukakis said, reminding backers
he was still more than 500 delegates short of the 2,081 needed to
nominate.
   Despite a series of primary wins over Jackson, Dukakis said the
race for the nomination is not over. He vowed to campaign
aggressively through the final day of the primary season _ June 7 _
when voters in New Jersey and California cast ballots.
   ``I think it's going to be difficult,'' he said when asked if
Jackson had a chance to win the fight for the nomination. Asked if
he thought Jackson would view the latest primary results as a
trend, Dukakis smiled and said: ``I hope so.''
   Jackson has been increasingly critical of Dukakis in recent
days, but the governor declined to say whether he thought his rival
should tone it down.
   ``He's going to have to make that judgment,'' Dukakis said.
``I'm going to try to keep this as positive as I can. I don't mind
disagreement on issues. I just hope we can both continue to
campaign with the respect we've had for each other in the past
year.''
   Asked whether he believed President Reagan was delaying an
endorsement of Vice President George Bush to keep the media
spotlight on the almost-certain Republican nominee, Dukakis laughed
and said, ``You mean the astrology endorsement?''
   The White House acknowledged Tuesday that Nancy Reagan checks
the positions of the sun, the moon and the stars in terms of
scheduling the president's activities. However, Reagan said he has
never based any policy or decision ``in my mind'' on astrological
forecasts.

<HEAD>Government Ethics Office Probing Letter Sent by Meese for Japan
Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Government Ethics launched an
investigation Tuesday into a letter signed by Attorney General
Edwin Meese III and sent to 30,000 people encouraging them to
attend a conference in Japan, the head of the office said Tuesday
night.
   ``It started today,'' said Frank Q. Nebeker, head of the ethics
office. ``As a judge, I have received invitations of this sort in
year's past. I don't know at this point what this one is.''
   Nebeker, a former judge on the District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, said he was not sure what the problems might be with the
mailing, adding, ``We're attempting to ascertain what the facts
are.''
   In the letter, Meese is soliciting attendance at a meeting for
which the U.S. sponsor is a profit-making organization.
   The presidential order on ethics that is policed by the ethics
office forbids federal officials from engaging in any conduct that
might present the appearance of a conflict of interest or of losing
objectivity in governmental decision making or favoritism. The
appearance of such a problem is enough to trigger an investigation,
even when such problems don't exist in reality.
   It is a crime to use the Justice Department seal for
non-authorized purposes.
   Meese's letters on Office of the Attorney General stationery
with the Justice Department seal invited the recipients to join him
at a legal and economic conference in Japan on Aug. 29 to Sept. 1.
Meese will be heading the U.S. delegation to the conference called,
``The U.S.-Japan Bilateral Session: A New Era in Legal and Economic
Relations.''
   The meeting is sponsored in part by the Citizen Ambassador
Program of People to People International, according to the letter.
   While People to People International is a non-profit
organization set up originally in the State Department by
then-President Dwight Eisenhower, the Citizen Ambassador Program is
a profit-making organization, the chairman of that firm said
Tuesday night.
   ``Yes, the Citizen Ambassador Program is for-profit, which is
how Eisenhower established the program with the intention of making
it self-supporting,'' Norm Swanson said in a telephone interview
from his home in Spokane, Wash.
   Swanson said the letter went to about 30,000 people whose names
were ``provided by everyone from the American Bar Association, the
advisory committees on both sides, to the American Chamber of
Commerce in Japan.''
   Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland said the department
was unaware that a profit-making organization was involved, but he
contended that even if it were, Meese's involvement might still be
justified due to the department's interest in international legal
questions.
   ``People to People International came to us and represented
themselves as a non-profit, tax-exempt organization,'' Eastland
said. ``To the extent that they're linked to some group that is
profit-making, that was not known by those making decisions on the
attorney general's participation.
   ``In the event it turns out a profit-making entity is involved,
it could be argued that the department could engage in a joint
venture so long as it was in the department's interest, and
obviously we have an interest in international legal questions,''
he said.
   Eastland said legal and ethics authorities in the department
reviewed both this letter and a similar one sent by Meese for a
conference sponsored by People to People International last summer
in China to make sure it was all right for the attorney general to
participate. The attorney general also hosted the American
delegation in China last year. In both cases, Meese's expenses will
be paid by the department, he said.
   The two-page letter from Meese was dated April 26 and says, in
part, ``Although attended and assisted by senior officials of the
governments of both Japan and the United States, the conference is
fittingly a non-governmental one administered on behalf of the
Japanese by Japan's Federation of Economic Organizations
(Keidanren) and on the American side by the Citizen Ambassador
Program of the People to People International organization.''
   ``I invite and encourage your participation. Sincerely Edwin
Meese III, Attorney General.''
   The letter was accompanied by an engraved invitation and a
response card to be sent to the Citizen Ambassador Program in
Spokane which would provide details on the trip.
   Swanson said he could not say how much profit might be involved
for his firm, which is quoting participants a cost of $3,240,
including transportation and lodging and an $800 registration fee
set by the Japanese organizing committee.
   ``I wish I knew,'' he said. ``It's not large. It depends on the
participation in the conference. Those profits are used to
encourage further exchanges, as they have for the last 35 years.''
   Meese's wife, Ursula, was paid by People to People International
to go on last summer's China trip, Swanson said.
   ``Her way to China was paid last year by People to People
International in return for the frankly exhausting role that she
fulfilled in being head of the women's contingent for the
conference,'' Swanson said. ``This was an economic law conference
in China which Mr. Meese hosted last year and which was very much
the precursor to the Japanese meeting.''
   Eastland said department regulations allow for payments for
spouses to be reimbursed by an outside entity, profit-making or
non-profit making, if certain conditions are met. In this case, the

<HEAD>In Ohio and Indiana, Dukakis Voters Receptive to Gore as
Running-Mate</HEAD>

   Nearly one-third of Michael Dukakis' supporters
in the Ohio and Indiana primaries Tuesday said they would favor
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. as his running mate if he wins the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Even more, about 40 percent in each state, said they favored
someone other than Gore or Jesse Jackson as the vice presidential
candidate, and only a small share favored Jackson for the No. 2
spot, ABC News exit polls said.
   As he did in Pennsylvania last week, Dukakis won all groups
except blacks in both states. But while the Massachusetts governor
commanded strong support in Indiana, in Ohio more of his backers
had reservations.
   Moreover, voters expressed some unfamiliarity with Dukakis. A
plurality of Democrats in Ohio and a majority in Indiana said his
ideology was ``just about right'' as opposed to too liberal and too
conservative, but another 34 percent in Ohio and 28 percent in
Indiana said they didn't know.
   ``Dukakis is still somewhat of an unknown ideologically,'' said
Doug Muzzio, a poll analyst for ABC News. ``A lot of people still
don't have a handle on him, this late in the primary season.''
   Muzzio said 33 percent of the voters in Ohio and 41 percent in
Indiana said Jackson was too liberal.
   Dukakis encountered mixed results in his new effort to draw
black votes from Jackson. In Indiana, a CBS News-New York Times
poll said Dukakis got about 12 percent of the black vote. The ABC
poll put it at 8 percent.
   In Ohio, the CBS-Times poll said Dukakis got just 4 percent of
the black vote, a share that was more in line with the earlier
contests, in which black support for Jackson has been nearly
unanimous.
   ``In Indiana and Ohio he tried to pick up more black support,
and he's doing better in Indiana _ but only a little better,'' said
CBS poll analyst Brian Becker. Among other groups, he said,
``Dukakis is winning across the board.''
   While Dukakis won few black votes, Jackson won limited white
support _ 15 percent in Ohio and about 10 percent in Indiana, the
CBS-Times poll said.
   In Indiana, 51 percent of Dukakis' voters said they backed him
strongly, to 39 percent who had some reservations. In Ohio,
however, 45 percent of the Dukakis voters said they had some
reservations about him, and 41 percent were strong.
   Large shares of Dukakis voters in both states viewed Jackson
unfavorably, and only 60 percent of Dukakis' own supporters said
they would back him with Jackson on the ticket, the CBS-Times polls
said. Similarly, 60 percent of Dukakis voters said Jackson should
not be offered the vice presidential slot.
   The ABC polls said only about 15 percent of Dukakis voters in
Ohio and Indiana favored Jackson over Gore or someone else for the
vice presidential nomination. Just over 30 percent favored Gore and
about 40 percent said someone else.
   Sixty-five percent of the Dukakis voters in Indiana and 59
percent in Ohio had an unfavorable view of Jackson, the CBS-Times
poll said.
   As has been the case in other states, Dukakis fared better with
Jackson voters that Jackson did with Dukakis voters. In Indiana the
CBS-Times poll said 54 percent of Jackson voters had a favorable
view of Dukakis, to 38 percent unfavorable. In Ohio the split was
48 favorable, 41 unfavorable.
   The ABC poll found that about 60 percent of Jackson's voters in
both states said they would vote for Dukakis if he were the nominee
against Bush, and just about 6 percent said they would back Bush.
   While about a third said they would not vote, ``based on
previous history that will split disproportionately for Dukakis,''
said Muzzio said. ``Blacks aren't voting for Dukakis now, but given
a choice of Dukakis in the future will vote for him
overwhelmingly.''
   The margin of sampling error for the polls was 3 percentage
points.

<HEAD>Conrail Announces $58 Million Settlement in Amtrak Crash Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consolidated Rail Corp. said Tuesday it has
tentatively agreed to pay $58 million to families of people killed
in Amtrak's worst accident, the 1987 collision of a passenger train
with Conrail engines in Chase, Md.
   The agreement was reached with attorneys representing the
estates of the victims and is subject to the approval of Conrail's
directors and various courts, according to a Conrail statement.
   Conrail spokesman Don Holloschutz said he did not know how many
of the victims' families the agreement covers.
   The $58 million would be in addition to the $7.5 million Conrail
has agreed to place in escrow as a part of a proposed settlement
with those injured in the collision, he said.
   Conrail said it did not concede liability for the accident in
the proposed settlements.
   On Jan. 4, 1987, former Conrail engineer Rick L. Gates missed a
track signal and drove three linked Conrail locomotives into the
path of a 660-passenger Amtrak train traveling an estimated 125 mph.
   The accident, the worst in Amtrak's history, killed 16 people
and injured more than 175.
   Conrail is suing to force Amtrak to cover payments for the
passenger injuries and deaths, contending that a prior agreement
required Amtrak to cover the payments.
   If that suit fails, Conrail will pursue its claims against its
insurers, according to the company.
   Gates, who wasn't injured in the accident, was sentenced earlier
this year in Baltimore County Circuit Court to five years in prison
after pleading guilty to manslaughter. Gates' brakeman at the time
of the crash, Edward Cromwell, was granted immunity from criminal
action after agreeing to help prosecutors.
   Gates, an acknowledged alcoholic, has admitted smoking marijuana
on the train but the court ruled that it could not determine if he
was under the influence of the drug at the time of the accident.
   Gates also faces charges in U.S. District Court in Baltimore for
conspiracy, obstruction of an agency investigation, and lying to
investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board about
drug use.

   Religious beliefs do not excuse four
polygamist clan members from blame for a church bombing and
standoff with police that they claim were mandated by God, a
prosecutor said Tuesday.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Lambert, in closing arguments
capping the federal trial of the four defendants, admonished jurors
not to ask themselves what they would do if they felt divinely
inspired to break the law.
   ``There is no revelation exception to the laws of the United
States,'' he said.
   Lambert was among a trio of prosecutors wrapping up their cases
against clan matriarch Vickie Singer; her son-in-law, Addam Swapp;
Swapp's brother, Jonathan Swapp; and Mrs. Singer's son, John
Timothy Singer. They are charged in the Jan. 16 bombing of the
Mormon Church's Kamas Stake Center and an ensuing 13-day standoff
at their Marion farm.
   The prosecutors were followed by summations from defense
attorneys. After instructions from U.S. District Judge Bruce
Jenkins, the jury was expected to begin deliberating sometime
Wednesday.
   Clan members have said they believe God ordered the bombing as a
sign of the impending collapse of church, state and nation, and
that he guided them through the siege. The standoff ended in a
shootout that killed state Corrections Lt. Fred House and wounded
Addam Swapp.
   U.S. Attorney Brent Ward said Mrs. Singer, 45, was as much a
part of the bombing as Addam Swapp, who admitted on the witness
stand that he planted the dynamite. He was the only one of the four
defendants to testify.
   While conceding that Mrs. Singer never actually took part in the
bombing, Ward contended that she aided Swapp, making her ``just as
guilty of committing that crime herself.''
   ``They were just waiting for the day. This was the biggest thing
in their lives since John Singer pulled a gun on lawmen several
years ago,'' Ward said.
   The prosecutor's reference to John Singer, the slain polygamist
husband of Mrs. Singer, drew hard stares from his widow. Singer was
gunned down in 1979 at the same farm by lawmen serving arrest
warrants stemming from his refusal to send his children to public
schools.
   However, Mrs. Singer's attorney, Kathyrn Collard, countered that
prosecutors had ``simply no evidence that Vickie Singer committed
any of these crimes that she is accused of.''
   Collard said Mrs. Singer consistently stated that during the
standoff, she would simply pray and ``trust in the Lord.... Hardly
the words of a hardened criminal bent on killing FBI agents.''
   Ward cited Mrs. Singer's telephone statements to an FBI hostage
negotiator and a reporter the day of the bombing. He also referred
to her diary and ``prayer cards'' which asked for a divine blessing
on the 87 sticks of dynamite.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Schwendiman focused on the
attempted murder and assault charges, devoting much of his time to
evidence against John Timothy Singer, 21.
   Schwendiman argued that Singer decided to kill lawmen when he
took aim at the doorway of a nearby building where a six-man FBI
team, House and another dog handler had secretly hidden themselves
the night before.
   Five bullets from Singer's .30-caliber carbine, including the
slug that killed House, were found embedded in the doorway and
walls of the building, Schwendiman said.
   State authorities have said they will file murder charges after
the federal trial is over.
   The federal indictment charged the defendants with maliciously
damaging the church building with an explosive device; use of a
bomb; attempted murder of federal agents; assaulting, resisting and
impeding federal officers; possession of a bomb; possession of a
sawed-off shotgun; and use of a firearm linked to the charges
involving the federal agents.
   Mrs. Singer is charged with all counts, while Addam Swapp faces
all but the shotgun-posession charge. John Timothy Singer and
Jonathan Swapp both are charged with the assault, attempted murder
and firearms violations.
   Charges against two other family members _ who are both
daughters of Mrs. Singer and wives of Addam Swapp _ were dropped.
   In his defense summation, Addam Swapp's attorney, Bill Morrison,
told jurors that his client had expected a violent confrontation
from authorities following the bombing, but he didn't plan one.
   Morrison also said the testimony of FBI agents about the
shootout contained inconsitencies.

<HEAD>Johnny Carson Says `Tonight Show' To Resume Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Tonight Show'' will resume production
May 11 with Johnny Carson writing his own material after talks with
striking scriptwriters failed, the entertainer said Tuesday.
   Carson is believed to be the first independent producer to defy
the strike by the Writers Guild of America, which began March 7. He
will write his opening monologue and guest introductions, with no
striking writers returning to work, his statement said.
   Carson's attorney, Ed Hookstratten, said he was ``stupefied by
the WGA's apparent lack of desire to negotiate in good faith.''
   WGA spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said Tuesday that union
negotiators talked with Carson's production company earlier in the
day and added that, ``We are ready and willing to continue to
negotiate in good faith.''
   Because Carson is not a guild member, he would not violate the
strike by writing his own material, Ms. Rhoden said.
   In his statement, Carson said he had ``exhausted every
possibility of reaching an agreement'' and was concerned about his
show's staff.
   ``There are numerous `Tonight Show' staff members, many have
been with us for over 20 years, who are in danger of losing their
jobs if this strike goes on much longer. I can't let that happen. I
also can't turn my back on the `Tonight Show' audience, who've
remained loyal these past 25 years. It's time to go back to work.''
   Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, welcomed
Carson's decision. The network has been airing reruns during the
strike.
   ``TV and NBC are not the same without him,'' Tartikoff said.
   Ms. Rhoden said Carson Tonight Inc., the entertainer's
production company, had met with the guild six times since March
23, with the last formal session on April 28. The company has been
seeking a waiver from the strike or an independent agreement with
the guild.
   Hookstratten said the production company had agreed to nearly
all of the union's contract conditions before the guild informed
Carson last week that it would not ratify any independent contracts
until at least 10 percent of its 9,000 members had been offered
jobs by independent producers.
   The guild has approved only two independent contracts so far,
with the ``New Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and Ivan Reitman
Productions, makers of the movie ``Ghostbusters.''
   The main issues in the writers' strike against television and
movie producers are payment for foreign broadcasts and reruns and
the writers' degree of creative control they have over their work.
There have been no formal negotiations since mediated talks broke
off March 10.

   A woman accused of killing her husband and a
stranger with cyanide-spiked painkillers was betrayed by her greed
and carelessness, a prosecutor told jurors in the nation's first
product-tampering death trial.
   But in closing arguments Monday, Stella Nickell's lawyer called
the government's case a ``house of cards'' built on the testimony
of Mrs. Nickell's daughter, who said her mother had talked for
months about killing her husband.
   The jury today was expected to begin deliberations in the U.S.
District Court trial.
   Mrs. Nickell, 44, of Auburn, is charged with two counts of
causing death by tampering with a product involved in interstate
commerce and three counts of tampering. If convicted, she could
face life in prison.
   She is accused in the June 1986 death of her husband, Bruce
Nickell, 52, and of Sue Katherine Snow, 40, of Auburn, who died the
same month. Prosecutors allege Mrs. Nickell placed cyanide-laced
pain relievers on shelves in local stores to make her husband's
sudden death appear random.

supply stores reported brisk sales of water-saving devices.
   San Francisco residents have been told to cut consumption by 25

   Cable television's rapid growth is making it
a big-time player in the entertainment industry, and the broadcast
networks and Hollywood producers like Steven Spielberg want a piece
of the action.
   As part of that trend, NBC on Monday announced plans to buy a
cable television network, and said it would use it to offer
business and sports programs.
   As the broadcast networks scout for cable properties they can
operate with existing resources, movie producers are looking at
cable TV as a place they can work more creatively.
   ``They view cable as the thing of the future,'' said James S.
Cownie, president of Heritage Communications of Des Moines, Iowa.
   ``They look at cable as a hybrid of the little screen and the
big screen, and something that is not restricted editorially or
with time constraints.''

   More than 7,000 strikers at the Lenin
shipyard, where Solidarity was born eight years ago, demanded
Tuesday that the outlawed union federation be made legal again. The
government called that ``not negotiable.''
   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, 44, spoke to the strikers
several times, but said he would not lead the strike. ``I am not
your leader. I'm tired.''
   On the first day of the shipyard strike Monday, workers asked
that a local Solidarity chapter be approved, but on Tuesday
demanded reinstatement of the union nationwide. Solidarity, the
first independent union in the Soviet bloc, was crushed and
outlawed after martial law was declared Dec. 13, 1981.

   EPA's annual list of areas violating national clean air
standards for the two pollutants shows 68 cities not meeting the
ozone goals last year, an increase of six from the year before, and
59 out of compliance for carbon monoxide, a decrease of six.
   Twenty cities appeared on both lists, so 107 cities and rural
areas containing 135 million people, according to the National
Clean Air Coalition, violate one standard or both. The 24 largest
metropolitan areas were on one or both lists, leaving Kansas City

<HEAD>Priest Preaches Gospel Hard For Some To Swallow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOLIET, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his preaching from the Bible, a Roman
Catholic priest goes literally by the book, telling parishioners
they must sell all worldly possessions and give their money to the
poor.
   For this literal interpretation of the Gospel, the Rev. Michael
Collins has been forced to leave three northern Illinois parishes.
   ``It's scary for me but as much as I would like to tell people
what they want to hear, I've got a God who tells me to tell people
what they've got to hear,'' said the 28-year-old priest.
   He currently is at St. Ann's Catholic Church in Crest Hill near
Joliet, but has no regular congregation and no assignment at least
until June.
   Until then, leaders of the Diocese of Joliet want him to write a
book outlining his beliefs so they can check it against Catholic
doctrine.
   ``Christianity means living like Christ lived, giving like
Christ gave and forgiving like Christ forgave. Nothing less. Jesus
didn't say `Make a truce with me.' He said `surrender,''' Collins
said.
   He isn't ready to make a truce.
   ``My message is scary,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It
says when you've got nothing left but the Lord, you've got all you
need.''
   Collins, lanky and bearded with long hair, said his message was
hard for some to swallow. ``The Gospel should bring comfort to the
discomfortable and discomfort to the comfortable,'' he said.
   After St. Mary of the Lake seminary in Mundelein, Collins first
attracted attention while serving as a deacon at St. Theresa's
Catholic Church in Kankakee in 1984 and 1985.
   His homilies shocked the congregation, he recalled.
   Despite adverse reaction to his strong teachings, Collins was
ordained and given a five-year assignment as an associate pastor in
a Bolingbrook church he declined to name.
   He lasted five months and left because of a personality
conflict, he said.
   His next scheduled five-year assignment was St. Ann's Catholic
Church in Oswego. Among the ideas he pushed there was closing the
parish for a month so the priests could fast and pray.
   ``There was a lot of excitment and turmoil,'' said Collins.
``And about a year after I arrived they asked me to leave.''
   Then he was assigned to the fast growing, upper-middle-income
suburb of Naperville, not far from where he grew up in Elmhurst.
   ``These are my people out there,'' he said. ``I should be just
like them but the values of the suburbs are symptomatic of the
deeper conflicts inside us. We cling to status and material
things.''
   So Collins suggested Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church turn
the building over to the homeless.
   A letter to a local newspaper denounced him as ``a zealot ...
attempting to change the character of the entire parish.''
   Parishioner Randy Schultz said many in the congregation thought
his message was better suited for missionary work.
   Some churchgoers sided with Collins.
   ``He said things a lot of Catholics are longing to hear,'' said
Maggie Thomas.
   Yet Collins said he left Naperville because he didn't want to
further divide the parish, and retreated to Crest Hill to write his
book.

   Ministry to single adults ``is the next
great frontier of the church'' but they so far are mostly ignored
and wrongly stereotyped, says the Rev. Jerry Hayner.
   The Southern Baptist pastor from Raleigh, N.C., told family
ministry consultants that single adults often get dubbed as weird,
confused, incomplete, maladjusted or losers, and added: ``Jesus
Christ was not weird. He was not confused, incomplete or

<HEAD>A `Long Day's Journey Into Night' That Plays Better On Television</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Somehow, they don't seem made for each other.
   Imagine: Eugene O'Neill, America's greatest and windiest
playwright, and television, the medium that shrank the country's
attention span.
   But director Jonathan Miller's rapid-fire revival of O'Neill's
``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' works better on the tube than it
did in the theater.
   The production, tonight's offering from ``American Playhouse''
on PBS, was seen on Broadway two years ago. It stars Jack Lemmon as
the tyrannical James Tyrone and Bethel Leslie as his drug-addled
wife Mary. Their sons are played by Peter Gallagher, who appeared
in the television movie ``The Murder of Mary Phagan,'' and Kevin
Spacey, before he turned into one of TV's more memorable villains
on ``Wiseguy.''
   Miller created quite a fuss in New York with his revved-up
version of what is considered O'Neill's greatest and most
autobiographical play. By overlapping dialogue and a little
cutting, Miller slashed the running time from four hours to three.
   ``The real topic of the play is a series of tellings and
listenings, of tellings and half-listenings, of tellings and
failing to listen,'' Miller said in an interview with the British
theater magazine Plays and Players.
   Everyone talks in ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' which takes
place over one long summer night in 1912, and the conversations are
acrimonious, self-serving and ultimately heart-breaking.
   James Tyrone is a vainglorious husband and father. Mary is a
defeated woman, taking refuge in morphine. Her older son, Jamey, a
half-hearted actor, finds his solace in liquor, while the younger
boy, Edmund, a would-be writer modeled after O'Neill himself, finds
his career threated by tuberculosis. They blame each other, never
themselves.
   In the theater, the simultaneous conversations turned to mush.
On television, close-ups keep the audience in touch.
   Lemmon and Miss Leslie are more successful on the small screen,
too, revealing depths that were missing from their theater
performances. Lemmon captures the preening, self-centered qualities
that destroy Tyrone's wife and turn his sons against him. If the
ultimate tragedy eludes him, he gives the character a degree of
credibility.
   Miss Leslie is a surprise. She seemed strangely muted on stage,
unable to project the unbearable sadness of a woman overwhelmed by
life. That desperation comes across in the television version and
even acquires a delicate, other- worldly character.
   Spacey and Gallagher were the strongest actors on stage and
their strengths still are evident here. Spacey is particularly
moving as the bitter son who realizes he has failed and can do
nothing about it.
   This year is the centennial of O'Neill's birth and ``Long Day's
Journey Into Night'' will be very much a part of worldwide
festivities. A revival directed by Ingmar Bergman just opened in
Stockholm to rave reviews.
   Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst will star in a revival this
summer on Broadway directed by Jose Quintero.
   The Broadway production and cast will alternate performances
with ``Ah, Wilderness!,'' O'Neill's only comedy.
   ``Ah, Wilderness!'' represents a sunny, innocent family life
that O'Neill wished for but never found. ``Long Day's Journey'' was
the other side of his psyche. Miller's television production
explores it with uncommon and unnerving grace.

<HEAD>Writers Strike Leaves Cliffhangers Hanging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   We take you to our cliffhanger desk for these
late bulletins: Sonny Crockett flips out on NBC's ``Miami Vice,''
Valene Ewing Gibson does herself in on CBS' ``Knots Landing'' and
J.R. Ewing declares war on the entire world in ``Dallas'' on CBS.
   It's that time of the year when television gives series viewers
something to chew on over the summer.
   The biggest cliffhanger of all, however, is whether these shows
will be back in the fall to save their heroes and heroines. The
strike by the Writers Guild of America has the television and film
industry in a quandary. Since the writers walked out March 7, not a
word has been written. In some cases, the writers didn't even wrap
up this season's action, much less get to next season's cliffhanger
resolutions.
   Here are the details:
   ABC's ``Moonlighting'' was forced to cancel its big
season-ender, which would have featured a sequence in 3-D. The
Coca-Cola Co., which owns the new 3-D process and had planned
special commercials for the final show, was left holding 40 million
3-D glasses.
   NBC's ``L.A. Law'' couldn't do its two final episodes because of
the strike. But in the final show tonight, Leland McKenzie (Richard
Dysart) is approached by a young female attorney with designs on
him.
   ``Miami Vice'' ends Friday with Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson)
suffering amnesia from a blow on the head and believes he is his
undercover alter ego, drug dealer Sonny Burnett. He goes on a
rampage and not even his partner, Ricardo Tubbs (Philip Michael
Thomas), can pull him out of it.
   His wife, played by singer Sheena Easton, was killed by a bad
guy last week. The season ends with Sonny speeding away from his
friends in his boat.
   On ``Knots Landing,'' Valene (Joan Van Ark) is forced to commit
suicide in a ``Fatal Attraction'' kind of ending May 12. Her
ex-husband's girlfriend, Jill Bennett (Teri Austin), has become
crazed by his continuing interest in Valene and schemes to make her
kill herself.
   ``The final 20-25 minutes of the show is just Jill and Valene,
and it's all filmed in sequence,'' said Sheryl Feuerstein, a
spokeswoman for Lorimar-Telepictures. ``For all intents and
purposes, Valene Gibson will be dead. We have no idea how this is
going to be resolved because the writers can't work on it.''
   In ``Dallas,'' J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) declares war on
everybody in his effort to re-establish Ewing Oil. He puts brother
Bobby (Patrick Duffy) at the top of his enemies list when he learns
Bobby owns the rights to the family title. The Justice Department
had disbanded Ewing Oil and turned its assets over to Weststar.
   J.R. takes his son, John Ross, and hides him in a boarding
school to hurt his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), and her boyfriend,
Nicholas Pearce (Jack Scalia). J.R. also feuds with his mother,
Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes), because she has given half of the
Southfork ranch to her second husband, Clayton Farlow (Howard Keel).
   But there's more: Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval) receives some
startling news about his sister, Pam. Pam Ewing left the show with
the departure of actress Victoria Principal, although she was seen
briefly, swathed in bandages after a disfiguring car crash, at the
beginning of the season.
   On CBS' ``Falcon Crest,'' Angela (Jane Wyman) meets a mysterious
person in a church. It could be Chase Gioberti (Robert Foxworth).
Chase disappeared when his car plunged into San Francisco Bay last
season and Foxworth left the show. The final show will be shown
Friday, May 13.
   NBC's ``St. Elsewhere'' will not have a cliffhanger, but plenty
happens in the final shows as the medical drama wraps up its final
season. The last show will be Wednesday, May 25.
   ``Some people will die, some people will leave and some people
will return,'' said Brian Robinette, a spokesman for NBC. ``There
are a lot of entrances, exits and a surprise ending.''
   ``St. Elsewhere'' returned two weeks ago with six new episodes.
The May 18 show will feature five former stars of ``The Steve Allen
Show'' as parents: Steve Allen, Jayne Meadows, Louie Nye, Tom
Poston and Bill Dana.

   HEAVY MOTIVATION: ``Acting is much more difficult than
weight-training,'' says former Mr. Universe Lou Ferrigno. ``You can
go to the gym, want to lift 200 pounds, set your mind to it and do
it. But acting comes from a deeper spot within _ your emotions, and
you can't push it. Some days it works and some days it doesn't.''
Ferrigno will reprise his role as the Incredible Hulk in NBC's
``The Incredible Hulk Returns'' on Sunday, May 22. ...
   NEW ODD COUPLE: Comedian George Carlin, who spent years battling
the censors over his brand of humor, has joined forces with a
G-rated partner. ``It's me and Mickey Mouse,'' said Carlin, who
stars in the Disney Sunday Movie ``Justin Case,'' which ABC will
televise May 15 and 22.

   Robert Altman almost declined to direct the
television version of ``The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,'' until he
realized how many people were glued to their TV sets every day for
the Iran-Contra hearings.
   ``I thought, if I can do the same thing, maybe they've trained
an audience for me,'' Altman said.
   Trained or not, audiences seeking fine drama will do well to
catch ``The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' Sunday on CBS. The play is
still riveting, Altman's direction is poetic, and the performances
by his distinguished young cast are superb all the way around.
   Altman, best-known for his feature films (``M-A-S-H,''
``Nashville'') and a veteran of filming stage works (``Streamers,''
``Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean''), said he at
first had no interest in the project because of the 1954 Edward
Dmytryk film classic ``The Caine Mutiny,'' which starred Humphrey
Bogart as quintessential petty tyrant Capt. Queeg.
   This is not a remake of the movie, but rather the Broadway play
Herman Wouk adapted from his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The
movie was based on the entire novel. The play is just the
court-martial, the dramatic core of the book.
   Altman, who co-produced the piece, intentionally cast a younger
Queeg than audiences who remember Bogart will expect, Brad Davis
(``Midnight Express'').
   ``Queeg was 37 years old in that book, and Brad Davis is 38,''
said Altman. ``I tried to bring all those ages down to what was
real.''
   It was a wise move. Davis makes the role his own.
   Eric Bogosian, a New York actor and playwright (``Talk Radio''),
will be new to most viewers, though he's done guest shots on such
network shows as ``Crime Story'' and ``Miami Vice.'' He's excellent
as Lt. Greenwald, the reluctant defense attorney.
   Jeff Daniels plays Lt. Maryk, the not-too-bright young officer
on trial for mutiny for relieving Queeg of command in a typhoon.
   Peter Gallagher (``The Murder of Mary Phagan'') plays Lt. Cmdr.
Challee, the prosecutor who gets more than he bargained for.
   Kevin J. O'Connor has a small but meaty role as Lt. Keefer, the
non-committal witness who turns out to be a pivotal character in
the drama.
   Michael Murphy, who stars in the HBO series Altman is directing,
``Tanner '88,'' plays Capt. Blakely, the judge.
   ``The tragic figure in that case to me was Challee,'' said
Altman. ``He's the guy who felt betrayed.''
   As the court-martial opens, Challee is so sure of his case
against Maryk, he has talked his friend, Greenwald, into serving as
defense attorney. At first Greenwald is contemptuous of his own
client and seems almost negligent in his defense.
   But Greenwald wants to win, and as the court-martial progresses,
he takes his distasteful task to heart, expertly baiting Queeg
until the captain breaks down on the stand before the shocked but
sympathetic court-martial.
   Altman didn't get much of an audience for his first network TV
projects, the Harold Pinter plays ``The Dumbwaiter'' and ``The
Room'' for ABC.
   ``The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' is a lot more accessible to a
large audience. As evidenced by viewer interest in the Iran-Contra
and Bork hearings and the success of television shows about
lawyers, there's a natural drama to the courtroom setting.
   Altman enhances Wouk's piece with a unique brand of realism. The
camera roams around the courtroom like an eye, picking up details
here and there, like Queeg's incessant clicking of two steel ball
bearings to calm his nerves. True to the Altman style, characters
talk over each other in asides that can't quite be made out, until
a conversation finally predominates.
   In the first half of the drama, a band practices outside on the
parade field, providing patriotic background music for the
prosecution's case. When the defense takes over the next day, it is
raining.
   In an especially poetic moment, after Queeg has been excused
from the stand, Altman's camera stays on him in a very long shot as
he leaves the far end of the building, a lost and broken man.
   ``I think at the end after it's all over there'll be a lot of
that, `What was that? Who's the bad guy?' That's what I want,''
said Altman, who seems to have already gotten the only review he
needs:
   ``I got a nice letter from Herman Wouk who said it was the first
time any of his work had ever been translated even close to his
satisfaction,'' Altman said. ``I have it in my jacket.''

   ``And we are going forward with research on a new Orient Express
that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from Dulles
Airport, accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound, attaining
low Earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within two hours.''
   _ Ronald Reagan, State of the Union address, Feb. 4, 1986.

   The idea has a nice ring to
it: Tokyo in two hours. Zooming over the Earth at 25 times the
speed of sound. Crossing the Pacific in an airplane so
revolutionary the space shuttle and the Concorde become old hat.
   Third millenium, here we come.
   That airplane, or something like it, is taking shape at this and
other NASA centers in bits and pieces: a model is assaulted in a
wind tunnel by 4,800 mph blasts in temperatures hundreds of degrees
below zero; an electron beam illuminates air flow around a
scaled-down plane; a sleek cylinder zips through a water trough
3,000-feet long, sensitive to every nuance of resistance; a
photograph captures shock wave and heat patterns in ghostly hues of
green, orange, yellow, blue and magenta; the most powerful computer
ever built ingests world-class problems and spits out answers; a
standard airplane circles over Chesapeake Bay, piloted not from the
standard cockpit in front, but from a second, all-electronic one,
in its passenger section.
   The ``Little A'' in NASA _ the aeronautics part of National
Aeronautics and Space Administration _ is not as flashy as the
``Big S'' and gets only 7 percent of the agency's budget, but its
accomplishments brush our lives in thousands of ways.
   A poultry plant in Marietta, Ga., is quieter because of NASA
aeronautics; water quality in many places is improved because of
aeronautics technology; firemen wear better protective clothing.
   ``We are called the space agency by many, probably including
yourself,'' Jeremiah F. Creedon, the director for flight systems at
the Langley Research Center, tells a visitor, a bit of resignation
in his voice. ``Many of us here think the A is a large one.''
   Langley's work is divided roughly 60 percent aeronautics, 40
percent space, with a hefty dose of military work in both. With
other NASA research centers _ Ames and Dryden in California and
Lewis in Ohio _ its business is to develop technology and pass it
on, without cost, to aircraft companies. The federal government has
played that role from the start of its involvement 70 years ago.
   The agency has never built an airplane, but few planes fly today
without engines, designs, materials and structures conceived at
NASA. ``We are doing research that benefits the country,'' says
Creedon. ``It is available to Boeing, Lockheed and McDonnell
Douglas, whoever wants to build transport or high performance
aircraft.'' No single company alone could afford NASA's $2 billion
investment in wind tunnels.
   Here at Langley, they don't talk about the ``Orient Express.''
It's either the NASP, the National Aerospace Plane, or better yet
the X-30, next in a string of experimental planes that began with
Chuck Yeager's X-1, breaker of the sound barrier.
   When President Reagan made his rosy prediction about the Orient
Express, a week after the Challenger space shuttle disaster,
engineers had already taken years to decide the X-30 was possible.
Reagan's one-paragraph announcement signaled the start of Phase 2,
perfecting the technology, which will last until the summer of
1990, when engineers will take a hard look at where they stand and
decide whether to build the X-30. Phase 3, in the mid-'90s, would
see the aerospace plane begin flight tests that would finish as the
21st century begins.
   That's the timetable for the largest experimental aircraft
project ever undertaken by the United States. It will cost $3.3
billion. Clearly NASA and the Air Force, which is sharing the cost,
have something more practical in mind than building one or two
prototype planes, merely to prove it can be done.
   The military and package-delivery firms such as Federal Express
and UPS are the only ones likely to have use for a plane flying 25
times the speed of sound _ fast enough to get into orbit. But the
aerospace plane will provide the technology for the somewhat slower
but far more useful aircraft of the future.

   ``There is tremendous potential for all kinds of vehicles
operating at high Mach numbers,'' says Douglas Dwoyer, manager of
hypersonic technology at Langley. ``The National Aerospace program
is aimed at an experimental aircraft to demonstrate technologies
for this family of hypersonic aircraft.''
   The speed of sound, which varies with temperature and density of
air, is represented by a Mach number. Airplanes that fly below Mach
1 are subsonic; those that fly faster are supersonic. Those that
fly more than five times the speed of sound, above Mach 5, are
designated hypersonic. To escape the atmosphere into orbit, a plane
must achieve Mach 25.
   So far the big airplane manufacturers have little interest in
building passenger aircraft that fly at Mach 25, no matter what the
president said. They do want, for the years 2000 to 2010, a
supersonic airplane capable of flying at Mach 2 to Mach 3.5. At
Mach 2.7, a trip from Los Angeles to Tokyo would take just under
four hours, compared with 12 to 14 hours subsonic. The ideal Mach
number is one of the big questions facing the engineers.
   The United States researched a supersonic transport, the SST, in
the 1960s, but dropped the program in 1970 because of costs. The
space shuttle had been designed, the Apollo moon program was
winding down and there seemed no need for space missions requiring
re-entry with the accompanying hypersonic speeds.
   In addition, the price of jet fuel, which had been 10 cents a
gallon when research started, jumped to $1.30.
   While American interest dropped, the British and French produced
the Concorde, a plane capable of twice the speed of sound. But its
birth coincided with heightened environmental concerns, and the
sonic boom scared people; many governments, including the United
States, barred it from flying over land.
   Moreover, the Concorde was designed with '60s technology and
carries barely enough fuel to make it across the Atlantic.
   ``Concorde is restricted to over-water flights under 2,200-miles
long, and there aren't many oceans that small,'' says Roy Harris
Jr., director of aeronautics at Langley. ``I think Concorde is
designed too small, it can carry only 100 people and it's cramped.
All our studies say you really want 200 to 250 passengers for an
economically viable SST.''
   Harris sees a real need for an SST. ``If you look at the
demographics of air travel, the Pacific rim is the fastest growing
international market,'' he says. ``It's growing at a rate twice
that of the market between the U.S. and Europe.''
   The United States is not alone in its SST interest. The British
have a project called Hotol that's vaguely similar to the X-30, and
the French are working on the Hermes space plane, which requires
hypersonic technology for re-entry. There is big interest in the
Soviet Union in the engines that will power hypersonic flight, and
the Japanese are talking about building a shuttle.
   Despite such competition, the United States treats its
aeronautics limb as a poor relative. In a $9 billion NASA budget,
the spending for this year's aeronautics R&D is $430 million, with
$53 million of that earmarked for the aerospace plane.
   Harris says if the United States wants to develop a supersonic
transport to be ready in the first decade of the 21st century, it
will have to commit $800 million over the next five to seven years.
Current spending is $3 million a year.
   Money is a sensitive issue at Langley. Until 1970, the U.S. jet
transport industry had 90 percent of the long-range market. Now
that percentage is down to 70. Aerospace exports grew from $1.7
billion in 1960 to $25 billion in 1987, but imports increased from
$61 million to $7.9 billion _ in large part due to the success of
the French Airbus.

<HEAD>Candide: Leonard Bernstein's 30-Year-Old Dream</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leonard Bernstein's musical,
``Candide,'' is whistling a happy tune in a Scottish Opera
production that aims to be the fullest version yet of this show.
   ``The joy here is we're actually doing what Lenny (Bernstein)
wanted for 30 years,'' said John Mauceri, music director of
Scottish Opera, about the company's new ``Candide,'' which opens
May 19 at Glasgow's Theater Royal.
   It's the first time the piece will be seen in Britain since a
pared-down, 13-instrument version played the Edinburgh Festival in
1981. Co-directed by Jonathan Miller and John Wells and boasting an
orchestra of 60, it transfers in December to London's Old Vic
Theater, where Miller is artistic director.
   American tenor Mark Beudert sings the title role of the
eternally hopeful Candide who learns to be properly skeptical of
this ``best of all possible worlds.'' The show is adapted from
Voltaire's 1759 French novel about the limits of optimism during
the European Enlightenment.
   Mauceri, an American who assumed his post with Scottish Opera
last August, said the current ``Candide'' has a melodic and
thematic breadth that will surprise those accustomed to its earlier
versions.
   ``The two things Lenny objected to (before) were the placement
of the songs and its constant silliness,'' said Mauceri, who became
acquainted with the work when Bernstein asked him to conduct the
1974 Broadway revival.
   ``There's a greater seriousness of purpose in this `Candide,'''
he said. ``(But) at the end of the day, why we're doing it is
because of its wonderful score.''
   That score, with such tunes as ``Glitter and Be Gay'' and ``Oh,
Happy We,'' is the unassailable strength of a show that has had a
patchy on-stage past.
   Its 1956 New York premier, with Broadway veteran Barbara Cook as
Candide's beloved Cunegonde, lasted just 73 performances, despite a
book by playwright Lillian Hellman and direction by Tyrone Guthrie.
It subsequently flopped in London in 1961.
   The jazzy 1974 revival, rewritten by Hugh Wheeler and directed
by Harold Prince, won five Tony awards and ran for 740
performances. But it suffered from what Mauceri called ``a Marx
Brothers tone'' that violated Voltaire's pungent satire.
   A third version, with lyrics by the American poet laureate
Richard Wilbur, joined the New York City Opera repertoire in 1982.
   The Glasgow production embraces all three in what Mauceri calls
``a framework (for `Candide') in which all the viable songs
actually fit.''
   ``People are becoming more and more aware that his music is
really good,'' Mauceri said of Bernstein, who turns 70 on August 25.
   Co-director Jonathan Miller said he was intrigued by the
peculiar history of the show.
   ``It's like trying to darn an enormous spider web,'' said
Miller, whose varied directing credits include Verdi's
``Rigoletto,'' updated to New York's Little Italy in the 1950s, for
the English National Opera and a speedy staging of Eugene O'Neill's
``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' on Broadway and in London.
   Neither Miller nor Mauceri said they paid much heed to the
debate over whether musicals belong in the opera house.
   ``I see the two as a continuum,'' said Mauceri, who won a Tony
award for co-producing the 1983 Broadway revival of Rodgers and
Hart's 1934 ``On Your Toes.''
   ```Dreamgirls' should not be produced by an opera house, but `My
Fair Lady' could be,'' he said.
   Miller compared the two genres to ``different animal species, as
opposed to being totally distinct.''
   ``I'm not sure `Candide' is an opera at all,'' Miller said. ``I
don't quite know what it is; one doesn't have to make up one's
mind.''

<HEAD>1987 Crash: `An Interesting Non-event'?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   After 5{ years of expansion, the economy is
gaining a second wind. The evidence is not easy to accept, since it
appears at odds with history, but it also appears incontrovertible.
   Inflation is in check. A million jobs have been created in three
months. Wages are steady rather than inflationary. Productivity,
which many thought to be waning, continues to improve.
Manufacturing is strong.
   The consumer, thought by many to have run out of cash and desire
earlier this year, has been helped by rising personal income.
Corporate earnings are coming in stronger than anticipated.
   While the trade deficit continues, and even grew worse in the
latest period reported, it also seems destined for improvement.
Corporations have lost their fear of expanding; production of
manufactured export items is growing.
   Many companies also are benefitting from earlier programs aimed
at improving efficiency. Labor-management cooperation has improved.
And the bulge of inexperienced workers that had lowered
productivity now has been absorbed.
   That old bugaboo, the budget deficit, remains. So do the old
worries about the dollar, inflation, recession, competitiveness,
access to markets, a low savings rate, high household debt and
dependence on foreign investors.
   But the big fear of financial and economic calamity hasn't
followed the stock market collapse. It remains a factor in almost
every stock market newsletter and economic commentary, expressed as
a fear but not as a fact.
   Overall, according to an economic update presented this spring
by the Univeristy of Michigan's Survey Research Center, ``it now
looks as if the great crash of 1987 will be recorded as an
interesting non-event.''
   Stock market prices did have their sharpest one-day decline in
history but, according to the report, there appears to have been
very little cumulative consequence of that event on the real
economy.
   Among the more remarkable aspects of the economy's performance
has been its propensity to steer down the middle between boom and
bust. Month after month prices, wages, interest rates and
productivity gains have been moderate.
   As the good news is recognized, if reluctantly by some
pessimists, it appears that a growing number of economists have
pushed back their estimates of the next recession's onset.
   Six months ago, the recession was forecast for now. But now it
is forecast for no sooner than very late this year or 1989 _ or
even 1990, which is about as far out on the limb chronologically
that any economist dares to stand.
   Reviewing the more recent analyses from banks, brokers,
businesses and academe, it becomes clear that the big unknowns
being discussed today are less economic than political: Elections,
trade policies, wars, oil availability.
   How could the stock market crash be an economic ``non-event''
rather than a forecast of things to come?
   For one thing, very few families had large holdings of common
stocks. One study, for example, shows that less than 2 percent of
households had more than $100,000 of direct holdings.
   More and more, the crash is being viewed in technical rather
than economic terms, as an event that had little significance as an
omen of things to come but as an internal failure of the market
mechanism itself.
   While it still has an impact on the thinking of many people,
that impact seems to be waning. And helping to put it in the past
are those encouraging economic statistics that suggest continued
moderate growth.

<HEAD>Detour From Judaism Revises Ancient Religion Without God</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WATERTOWN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One Sunday a month, about 50 Jews gather
here for what they consider a religious service. But they neither
pray nor worship God. Without chants or ritual, they sit in a big
circle of folding chairs and talk about what it means to be Jewish.
   They call themselves Humanistic Jews. Agnostics and atheists
largely in their 30s and 40s, they're devoted to discovering their
Jewish moral roots and adapting a 5,000-year-old religion to the
late 20th century.
   Their approach echoes the anti-establishment themes of the
l960's. Services at Kahal B'raira _ meaning ``community of choice''
_ even resemble the old rap sessions.
   ``We just grab a cup of coffee and start talking,'' said John
Lisman, 43, a biology professor and president of the Humanistic
congregation in Watertown.
   The subject might be how to talk to children about God,
intermarriage or the Jewish sanctuary movement and Nicaragua.
   Lisman joined the congregation because he wanted to educate his
son and daughter in their heritage but not in the old-fashioned way.
   ``We aren't strongly religious but we still felt our Jewishness
is a very strong part of us,'' Lisman said.
   While most of America's 10,000 Humanistic Jews are products of
the alienated generation of the `60s, members also include older
Jews who don't believe in God yet want to hold on to the ancient
religion on their own terms.
   Humanistic Judaism was founded in 1963 in Michigan by a
disgruntled Reform rabbi named Sherwin Wine. When national news
magazines learned about what they labeled an atheistic rabbi, some
traditional Jews were alarmed.
   But the divergence never caught on in a big way and in the
intervening 25 years this detour from conventional Judaism remains
little known.
   To observers and even some participants, Humanistic Judaism
seems an eccentric holdout from the alienated era in which it was
born.
   It's the Jewish answer to the God-is-dead movement that followed
World War II, said Professor Eugene Borowitz, a theolgian at Hebrew
Union College seminary in New York. ``The Greeks called it a
failure of nerve.''
   Like other Jewish scholars, Borowitz regards Humanistic Judaism
as inconsequential. ``It doesn't seem to be getting very far,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   ``In the 1960s, there were some people who were very angered by
it because of a sense that it was too blatant a betrayal of
Judaism,'' Borowitz said. ``But to the overwhelming majority of the
Jewish community, secularism doesn't seem to be the wave of the
future.''
   Nevertheless, from eight founding families, Humanistic Judaism
has grown to about 30 congregations nationwide, three big enough to
build synagogues in Chicago, Cincinnati and Farmington Hills, Mich.
Overseas, it claims another 20,000 adherents in 10 countries from
Argentina to Australia.
   Small as its following is, Humanistic Judaism aims to be an
alternative to the traditions of Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and
Reconstructionist Judaism.
   ``The others are God-oriented,'' said Wine. ``We're
people-oriented. We believe in the power of people to solve human
problems.''
   Humanistic tenets hold that Judaism is not a religion but a
historical culture, that reason _ not faith _ is the route to truth
and that the only reality is the natural world.
   ``Our philosophy of life is not prayer or worship but ethics and
morality,'' Wine said.
   At a recent morning service of Kahal B'raira, the subject was
the Jewish way of death. Rabbi Beverly Lerner, a believer who was
hired to advise the group, gave a lecture on Jewish customs of
burial and grieving through the ages. She also answered a chorus of
questions.
   One man asked about cremation. It isn't kosher, she said,
especially since the Holocaust and the Nazi crematoria.
   A woman asked about whether miscarried babies can get a funeral
and learned that in Judaism babies aren't considered fully human
until they are 30 days old.
   At the end of the 90-minute service and a buzz of similar
questions, a committee was assigned to devise a Humanistic funeral
service.
   ``People who don't believe in a traditional God, have the same
need to be meaningful,'' Ms. Lerner reminded them.
   Humanistic Jews are obeying an impulse common to many.
   Surveys show that while the 5.8 million American Jews
increasingly forgo the weekly rituals practiced by their parents,
about 85 percent still observe the main holidays on the Jewish
calendar.
   Sylvia Barack Fishman, a Brandeis University researcher in
Jewish studies, said, ``There's a very strong desire not to break
ties with the past.
   ``American Jews today are more comfortable with their Jewishness
than they were 30 years ago. But they want to (express their
Judaism) creatively. And that's why you get these strange hybrid
rituals of the Humanists. I would call it creative revision of the
Jewish past.''

   Protests still are flooding the Federal
Communications Commission, falsely charging an attempt by atheist
Madalyn Murray O'Hair to ban religious broadcasting.
   The commission repeatedly has explained there was no such
effort, but for 11 years, the protest letters have come in at a
rate of more than a million a year, along with phone calls, says
FCC information specialist Sharon Jenkins.
   She says the FCC lately has begun tracking the origin of phone
calls, hoping to find the source of the campaign and put an end to
it, but so far the monitoring has been inconclusive.
   ``We don't know who'' started the drive, ``or how or why,'' she

   History is repeating itself on
the Isle of Man as William the Conqueror and his cohorts prepare
once again for the Battle of Hastings in 1066.
   Only this time William will be an actor wearing chain mail and
there will be television cameras looking on, reporting the war as
it happens.
   With an 11-week shoot on 18 European locations, ``Timeline'' is
using on-camera reporters and an anchorman, all played by
professional actors, to turn the distant past into the stuff of
today's nightly news.
   ``It's a way to give history the immediacy and excitement of a
fast-breaking news story,'' said Leo Eaton, the director and
executive producer.
   The six-hour $2.2 million series applies the tenets of broadcast
news to over 400 years of medieval history.
   The show, featuring about 280 speaking parts and up to 5,000
extras, is to be aired on public television in the United States in
January and later on Britain's Channel 4.
   ``It's dramatized but it's not drama; it's history, but it's not
a history lesson,'' Eaton said in an interview before flying to the
Isle of Man, a picturesque if blustery island in the Irish Sea 30
miles west of England.
   In the present segment, the first to be shot, it's September 25,
1066, and the Manx village of Peel, population 2,500, is standing
in for the French coastal town of St. Valery-sur-Somme.
   The Norman duke, William, is waiting for the winds to change so
that his troops can sail across the English Channel and fight the
Battle of Hastings on October 14, 1066.
   ``Everybody's sitting about bored, ready to go,'' said
production designer Peter Wooley, as a motley group of local extras
and actors rehearsed their scenes amid the ruins of a hilltop
castle on the island's western coast.
   ``In the pivotal scene, the wind does change,'' Wooley said.
``Instead of William the Conqueror, he should have been called
William the Lucky.''
   The series will cover such events as the Black Death, which
wiped out one-third of the world populace during the 14th and 15th
centuries, and the conquest of Istanbul, then Constantinople, in
1453.
   Eaton said he avoided recent events in choosing what to
dramatize.
   ``We first set down the parameters to cover the coming of
Christianity and the Roman Empire up to the Industrial
Revolution,'' said the director, an Oxford graduate who began his
career as a tea-boy on the set of the hit TV series ``The
Avengers.''
   ``Beyond that, history gets complicated; you can no longer
simplify it in quite this way.''
   The show's historical adviser, Janet Meisel, disagreed: ``A
medievalist would say the further back you go, the more complicated
history gets.''
   She said the complications make history interesting.
   ``We are lulled by similarities in thinking, `Ah yes, they
(historical figures) are just like us,' but they really weren't,''
said Meisel, wrapped in a scarf and a winter coat against the
coastal chill.
   ``The past is not like the present; that's what makes it a
useful intellectual exercise.''
   On sabbatical from the University of Texas at Austin, where she
is a professor of medieval history, Meisel said she approved of the
show's efforts to make history accessible.
   ``I know there are some historians who really object to the
idea,'' she said. ``(But) I guess my feeling is that history is so
badly taught, as long as we have the football coach or the
basketball coach _ whichever one isn't teaching English _ teach
history, I'd like to see history that looks right and is right and
entertaining.''
   Meisel said her task was to verify matters ranging from
historical methodology to horns.
   ``Did Vikings remove the horns on cattle or not?'' she said.
``We have this pseudo-Viking from a university whose particular
field is agricultural animals in the Middle Ages who's saying you
cannot have lopped-off horns.
   ``But I can show you Anglo-Saxon laws where people were in fact
required to lop off the horns of cattle so you do not gore your
neighbors, or your neighbors' cattle.''
   For locals such as blacksmith David Daley, ``Timeline'' is an
opportunity to recreate his real-life profession on-screen.
   ``It's good fun; the island could do with something like this to
put it on the map,'' the 42-year-old Daley said.
   His wife, Gillian, has a bit part in the show as well, playing
what Daley described as ``a lusty maiden, or something.''
   Co-producer Gary Witt had nothing but praise for his cast:
   ``We're smearing mud on their costumes, and they're letting us
do it. God love 'em,'' he said.

<HEAD>Many in Namibia Wary of South Africa's Motives</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ In a far-off garrison town,
blacks complain of abuse and atrocities by South African soldiers
based there. Here in Windhoek white secretaries take memos from
black Cabinet members and pour their tea.
   Officially, South Africa's vision of South-West Africa's future
reflects the hilltop harmony of Windhoek, the territory's capital,
rather than the garrison town, Oshakati, near wartorn Angola to the
north.
   But many South-West Africans, moderates as well as militants,
are deeply suspicious of South Africa's intentions toward Africa's
last colony, also known as Namibia.
   These suspicions were heightened in early April when President
P.W. Botha of South Africa came for a visit and proposed new powers
for his chief representative in the territory. The proposal was
seen as weakening the ``transitional'' government installed by
South Africa in 1985 to lay the groundwork for independence.
   Moderates who hold a majority on the coalition Cabinet accused
Botha of undermining their efforts to gain credibility as an
alternative to the pro-independence guerrillas of the South-West
African People's Organization, SWAPO.
   ``Actions like this won't help force SWAPO to the bargaining
table,'' said the Cabinet's chairman, Moses Katjiuongua, a black,
who has threatened to quit. ``We're trying to get people to talk to
us, but you don't talk to people who don't have power.''
   SWAPO, meanwhile, carries on in its 22-year-old bush war for
independence despite heavy losses and South Africa's overwhelming
military advantage. Guerrilla leaders and many others are skeptical
of South Africa's professed willingness to allow United
Nations-supervised independence elections in the territory upon the
withdrawal of Cuban troops helping fight a pro-Western faction in
neighboring Angola.
   The United Nations, which formally recognizes the name Namibia,
has designated SWAPO as the ``sole and authentic'' representative
of the South-West African people, atlhough more than 40 political
parties operate in the territory. By all accounts, SWAPO would be
the likely winner in a U.N.-run election because of its strong
support in the Ovambo region around Oshakati, where about half the
territory's 1.3 million people live.
   But widespread doubts persist that South Africa would agree to
elections in which the Marxist-oriented SWAPO leaders had the edge.
   On at least one major issue, South-West Africa's moderates and
militants share common ground. Both want an end to apartheid-style
laws that create ethnically based political structures and enable
the 78,000 whites to maintain segregated schools and hospitals.
   Botha, although hinting at some flexibility on the issue, has
made it clear he wants to protect the ``group rights'' of whites.
   The president's chief representative in the territory,
Administrator-General Louis Pienaar, says whites should have the
option of joining a non-racial system or maintaining a segregated
administration to finance and run their own affairs.
   ``The whites are only 6 percent of the population, but they
manage the infrastructure and the economy,'' Pienaar maintained.
``They can't be written off because of their small numbers.''
   This attitude irks white moderates such as Dirk Mudge, the
minister of finance and government affairs, who opposes ethnic
politics and holds that whites don't need discriminatory laws to
preserve their culture.
   But conservative whites are pressing Botha to maintain some type
of political apartheid, and the increasingly powerful far-right in
South Africa is likely to create an uproar if non-racialism becomes
law in the territory.
   ``It's discrimination that makes so many people hostile to South
Africa,'' said Katjiuongua, the Cabinet chairman. ``I want to be a
national leader, not an ethnic leader.''
   As big as France and Italy combined, mineral-rich South-West
Africa has been administered by South Africa since the end of World
War I, under a League of Nations mandate. In the early 1970s the
United Nations formally declared it a territory illegally occupied
by South Africa and has called repeatedly for independence
elections that would include SWAPO.
   The new powers extended to Administrator-General Pienaar
authorize him to act against news media and organizations deemed to
be ``subversive,'' but for now a relatively high degree of
political freedom exists. SWAPO is allowed to function as a
political organization, and a pro-SWAPO weekly newspaper, The
Namibian, regularly reports on alleged atrocities by the security

   During Botha's visit, SWAPO supporters demonstrated in downtown
Windhoek, displaying placards with slogans such as ``Botha: Stop
Sucking Our Blood.'' The police kept a low profile.
   Not everyone blames South Africa for the many divisions within
South-West Africa, but the widespread sentiment is that
heavy-handed moves by Botha's government won't improve the
situation.

   World oil prices fell sharply after an
OPEC conference ended with no agreement on a proposed 2 percent cut
in the group's oil production.
   However, oil ministers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait said Monday
they expected prices to stabilize near current levels despite the
breakdown of talks among Organization of Petroleum Exporting

   Orders to U.S. factories rose a surprising 1.6
percent in March as strong export demand and heavy defense orders
reversed weakness in the previous two months, the government has

   The Commerce Department said Monday that orders for durable and

   The Supreme Court, in an antitrust ruling that
could make bargain-hunting more difficult, said manufacturers do
not always act illegally when they agree with retailers to stop
supplying discount stores.
   The court said Monday that such action by a manufacturer becomes
illegal only when ``it includes some agreement on price or price
levels.''
   The ruling makes it easier for manufacturers to avoid antitrust
liability when, acting on requests from competing retailers, they
stop doing business with stores that cut prices.

<HEAD>Productivity Up Nearly 1 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic activity is proceeding at a healthy pace, according to
a trio of government reports indicating rising factory orders and
construction spending in March, and growing first-quarter
productivity.
   The Labor Department said Monday that productivity of U.S.
industry _ its efficiency in producing goods and services _ rose by
an annual rate of 0.9 percent during the first quarter. The gain
reversed a 1 percent decline in the final three months of 1987.
   Excluding agriculture and government, the businesses responsible
for three-fourths of the nation's economic activity raised their
output of goods and services by 2.7 percent with only a 1.7 percent
increase in hours worked.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said factory orders rose 1.6
percent in March. The increase, to a seasonally adjusted $216.08
billion after no change in February and a decrease in January, was
seen as coming from both domestic and foreign markets.
   The Commerce Department also reported construction spending rose
by 1.5 percent, much of it on government building and highway
projects. The jump was led by a 5.4 percent surge in government
projects, some of the result of Congress overriding President
Reagan's veto of an $88 billion highway bill last year.
   On Wall Street, blue-chip stocks staged a modest rally, but the
rest of the market lagged in a sluggish session. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials rose 10.94 to 2,043.27 but declining
issues outnumbered advances by more than 4 to 3 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The dollar was mixed against major currencies. Bond prices fell.
   Oil futures prices turned sharply lower in a wave of selling
prompted by the failure of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to set temporary production cuts. On the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West Texas Intermediate,
the U.S. benchmark crude, slid to $17.14 per barrel, down 85 cents
from Friday's close.
   The productivity gains were surprising to most economists in the
wake of employment reports showing the creation of nearly 1 million
new jobs the first three months of 1988.
   The reports showed wages and benefits increased at an annual
rate of 3.4 percent in the first quarter, raising the labor costs
associated with each service or product by 2.4 percent annually.
   Those unit labor costs had soared at an annual rate of 4.5
percent in the final quarter of 1987, triggering fears among
several analysts that the nation was on the verge of wage-driven
inflation.
   ``Productivity is the cushion you can put in between wage
increases and price increases; this is good news for inflation,''
said David Wyss, an economist for Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass.
   After taking inflation into account, the first quarter wage
gains gave workers no new purchasing power. Still, it was the first
time since the last quarter of 1986 that they have even kept pace
with inflation.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Slide In Reaction to OPEC News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Oil futures prices have turned sharply lower in
response to OPEC's failure to set temporary production cuts in four
days of negotiations.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate oil, the U.S. benchmark crude, slid to $17.14
per barrel on Monday, down 85 cents from Friday's close.
   Most of the ground was lost early in the day as traders reacted
to the news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
had suspended talks over proposals to cut its output in conjunction
witheindependent producers.
   Prices stabilized temporarily in the afternoon, then slipped
again in a late spurt of nervous selling.
   Prices for refined products also tumbled. Wholesale prices for
unleaded gasoline fell 2.24 cents per gallon to 49.37 cents, while
heating oil dropped 2.42 cents to 45.95 per gallon.
   OPEC ministers broke off their talks with several outside oil
producers after Saudi Arabia scuttled a plan for cutting production
temporarily.
   Analysts said the suspension of the talks and the Saudis'
reluctance to agree to the cuts caused a violent shift of sentiment
in the futures markets, where prices had recently advanced on the
expectation of a global move to reduce production.

   The stalemate that doomed OPEC's latest
meeting also has dimmed prospects for creating a new global
alliance of oil producers.
   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries says
it will press ahead with efforts to establish closer ties with
other oil producers. But the going is likely to be slow.
   OPEC wants to persuade as many independent producers as possible
to join the cartel in restraining production as a means of boosting
prices to OPEC's official target of $18 dollars a barrel.
   Hisham Nazer, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, said Monday in
Vienna there was ``unanimous recognition in OPEC'' that it alone
cannot keep supplies low enough to prevent prices from lagging.
   Last week, a group of six independent producers led by Mexico
met with a committee of six OPEC oil ministers and presented an
offer: we'll cut our oil exports by 5 percent if you do likewise.
   The two groups issued a joint communique declaring ``the
beginning of a new stage of cooperation'' among some of the world's
biggest oil-producing countries.
   But that's as far as it went. The non-OPEC officials left town
and all 13 OPEC ministers spent four days debating the offer, only
to suspend the talks after falling into a bitter impasse.
   Cartel leaders said they were not explicitly rejecting the
non-OPEC offer, they just wanted more time to think it over.
   The offer, by Mexico, Egypt, China, Oman, Malaysia and Oman, was
for two months of production cuts starting May 1.
   Now that the starting date has passed and the OPEC leaders have
gone home, there is little chance that the two groups will get back
to considering joint production cuts before next year. That's
because oil demand is expected to rise in the second half of this
year, eliminating the incentive on both sides to grapple with the
problem of sharing any cutbacks.
   This is likely to be welcomed in Washington. Energy Secretary
John Herrington has campaigned publicly against what he called
efforts to create a ``world OPEC.''
   Even so, OPEC says it will try to sustain a dialogue with
non-OPEC exporters, including the Soviet Union, which ranks as the
world's largest oil producer. The United States is the world's No.
2 producer.
   ``It is important that we keep talking to them,'' Rilwanu
Lukman, the OPEC president, said of the six independent exporters
who met in Vienna. ``The opportunity given to us is one that we
cannot take lightly.''
   The reasons are obvious. OPEC's capacity for influencing oil
prices gradually has been eroded by the emergence of new oil
producers in all corners of the globe.
   Ironically, it was the sudden and severe increases in OPEC oil
prices in the 1970s that created the financial incentive for
countries to step up their search for oil. In recent years Norway,
China, Angola, Colombia and many other nations have become oil
exporters.
   As production outside its control steadily rose, OPEC
reluctantly chose to cut its output in a vain attempt to prevent
prices from falling.
   Today the cartel pumps about 17.5 million barrels a day,
compared with a peak in 1978 of 31 million barrels daily. In that
same period, non-OPEC output has jumped from about 22 million
barrels daily to more than 28 million.
   This year alone, non-OPEC oil output is expected to rise by
800,000 barrels a day. OPEC's output probably will not grow at all.
   All oil exporters naturally want as high a price for their
product as possible. But they seem to have little prospect for
overcoming the political and economic differences that make formal
cooperation with OPEC hard to achieve.
   ``There just isn't a community of interest between them,'' said
Paul McDonald, a London-based oil consultant. ``You're either a
member of OPEC or not; nobody's knocking down the door to join
OPEC.''

<HEAD>Interest of Six-Month Bonds Drops Below 7 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. savings bonds will earn interest at a
rate of 6.90 percent over the next six months, the lowest return in
a year, according to the Treasury Department.
   The department said the new rate, which took effect Monday, is
down from a 7.17 percent rate of return earned in the last six
months and is the lowest rate since savings bonds earned 5.90
percent from May to November of last year.
   Interest on savings bonds is adjusted twice a year, on May 1 and
Nov. 1, to reflect open market interest rates. The rate is based on
85 percent of the yield on five-year Treasury securities, which
have averaged 8.12 percent over the past six months.
   Since the government switched to market rates for savings bonds
in November 1982, the rate of return has averaged 8.5 percent.
Investors who hold their bonds for at least five years earn the
average of the half-year rates.
   In addition, investors are guaranteed a minimum interest rate,
regardless of what the market rates do. That minimum guaranteed
rate is currently 6 percent. But for bonds purchased before Nov. 1,
1986, the minimum is 7.5 percent.
   Jerrold B. Speers, executive director the savings bond division,
predicted that sales would be boosted in the months ahead by a new
bonds-by-phone service, which begins Tuesday.
   Investors can call a toll-free number, 1-800-US-BONDS, and
charge the purchase on their VISA or MasterCard accounts.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities shot up in the government's latest auction with rates on
three-month bills climbing to the highest level since the October
stock market collapse.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.13 percent on Monday, up from 5.92
percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.41 percent, up from 6.28 percent
last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills averaged 6.84
percent on Oct. 19, the day of the stock market collapse, and
six-month bills averaged 6.48 percent on Dec. 21.
   Concerns raised by rising interest rates have been cited as one
of the factors contributing to the stock market collapse last fall.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 6.31 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,845.00 and 6.72 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,675.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 7.07 percent last week
from 7.03 percent the previous week.

Television, and hoped to have new business and sports programming
on it later this year or early in 1989.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   ``We believe this is an important step in our efforts to broaden
NBC's business base,'' said NBC President Robert Wright, who for
some time has been looking to get the company into cable.
   Tempo, which is based in Tulsa, Okla., and has about 12 million
subscribers, is being acquired by Tele-Communications Inc., the
Denver area-based company that is the nation's biggest cable
television operator.
   A statement issued by NBC said that in addition to giving up its
prospective interest in Tempo, Tele-Communications had agreed to
offer the new programming services on its own cable systems and on
affiliates that serve 8 million cable subscribers.
   John Malone, president of Tele-Communications, said, ``We feel
NBC's proposed services will be very appealing options for the
cable viewer and believe the rest of the cable industry will be
enthusiastic about this opportunity.''
   The announcement said NBC, Tempo and Tele-Communications hoped
to sign final agreements by the end of May. In the meantime, NBC
said, it would discuss affilation agreements for the new programs
with other cable operators.
   NBC's Wright frequently has expressed an interest in getting the
company into cable television since GE acquired NBC in 1986.
   NBC began talks last fall about buying a stake in Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. but those negotiations were suspended in
January. More recently, NBC said it had informally discussed with
Turner and other cable operators the possibility of selling
broadcast rights to some events in the Summer Olympics. NBC owns
the rights to broadcast the games.
   NBC also recently announced it had agreed to produce a new
comedy to be aired on the Disney cable channel.
   This would not be the first corporate link between an
over-the-air broadcast network and a cable service. Capital
Cities-ABC Inc., which owns the ABC Television network, also owns
80 percent of the ESPN cable network.
   Tempo Television provides programming aimed mainly at viewers
over age 45 in four categories _ entertainment, travel,
sports-outdoors and how-to information.
   NBC's plans call for it to replace that programming with
business and financial news on weekdays and sports programming in
the evening and on weekends, according to spokesman Joe Rutledge.
   The business news and financial information service would
present consumer-oriented features and information dealing with the
market, business trends and the economy, the announcement said.
   The sports-programming service would include live and taped
coverage of sports events, interviews with sports figures,
sports-oriented talk shows and magazine-format sports shows.
   Both services would rely on existing NBC operations, but would
be distinct from NBC Television network programming, Rutledge said.
   Wright said the venture ``promises to strengthen NBC, thereby
preserving our long-term ability to provide first-class programming
to our over-the-air broadcast audience.''

   Bargainers for the United Auto
Workers and Chrysler Corp. have returned to national contract talks
after settling nagging issues that included the payment of millions
of dollars owed to former American Motors Corp. workers.
   UAW President Owen Bieber said Monday that the union had stalled
national contract talks to force the company to settle
Wisconsin-worker issues that had been in limbo since Chrysler
bought AMC last August.
   ``We had to get this piece settled before we could settle the
rest,'' Bieber said. ``...Now we can get down to the bigger
things.''
   The national contract covers 66,000 hourly and salaried Chrysler
workers in 15 states.
   The two sides tentatively agreed Monday on a separate master
pact covering about 7,000 former AMC workers in Wisconsin. They
also reached a four-year local agreement covering 6,500 of the
workers, including 5,500 at the Kenosha, Wis., assembly plant
slated for closing and 1,000 at a Kenosha engine plant that will
remain open.
   The master Wisconsin pact will give Kenosha workers about 88
percent, or $57 million, of nearly $65 million that AMC owed them
when it was purchased by Chrysler.
   Workers will receive 100 percent of the money they loaned AMC in
concessions in 1982 but will not get interest as AMC had promised,
said Chrysler spokesman Lloyd Northard.
   About 9,000 workers will be eligible for payments averaging
$6,000 to $8,000 apiece, said Ed Steagall, president of UAW Local
72 representing Kenosha workers.
   Under the same pact, about 200 Milwaukee parts depot workers and
425 laid off from a stamping plant there will receive most of the
more than $5 million AMC owed them.
   Bieber said the master pact also would guarantee laid-off
workers six months of supplemental unemployment benefits, which are
paid in addition to regular unemployment compensation to provide 95
percent of regular pay.
   Talks on Chrysler's national contract, which expires Sept. 14,
opened April 18. Last week, the Wisconsin talks were moved to
Detroit so bargainers for both sides could negotiate all contracts
simultaneously.
   The tentative Kenosha local contract appears similar to a
five-year agreement reached in October covering Jeep plant workers
in Toledo, Ohio. Both pacts give the company more flexibility in
using workers.
   Steagall said about 20 percent of the Kenosha workers would be
able to retire early and laid-off Kenosha workers will have first
crack at any new jobs at the engine plant there.
   The UAW and Chrysler agreed to negotiate over a new contract
five months early _ working under the broad, job-protecting pattern
set in contracts in place at General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co. _ because of growing friction this year in their working
relationship.
   Sore spots included Chrysler's January announcement of the
Kenosha assembly plant closing _ a sudden reversal of promises that
the plant would run five more years _ and Chrysler's aborted
attempt to sell its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary.
   Chrysler agreed to early talks in March, but negotiations almost
died following last week's announcement of Chairman Lee Iacocca's
$17.9 million 1987 earnings and other executive compensation and
confirmation of plans to shift Chrysler K-car production to Mexico
in July.
   Chrysler backed off of the K-car move last week, announcing that
production would stay in Detroit until year's end.

<HEAD>USG Offers Recap As Alternative to Desert Partners Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp. would take on $2.2 billion in new debt
under a defensive recapitalization and business restructuring plan
it has proposed to counter an unwanted $2.32 billion buyout offer
by the investment group Desert Partners L.P.
   Under its plan, USG would borrow $2.2 billion to pay its
shareholders $37 in cash, debentures with a face value of $5 and a
share of stock in the recapitalized corporation for each of their
51.5 million common shares, company officials said Monday.
   USG, a Chicago-based manufacturer of building products, also
said it would raise money to pay off the debt by selling its
Masonite Corp. and Kinkead businesses and focusing operations on
its core building products businesses.
   The plan will be submitted June 24 to a vote of shareholders,
who also will be asked to rollover certain USG shares held in
company employee benefit plans into new shares of common stock, the
company said.
   As expected, Desert Partners' reaction was negative.
   ``From what we have seen, USG's proposal appears to be highly
conditional and does not have financing in place. We note that USG
proposes to move shares into an employee plan,'' said Desert
Partners' spokesman Tom Davies.
   ``It's not clear, however, what are the implications of that
move with respect to control of the company. We believe that the
USG shareholders might prefer contrary to USG's recap, our fully
financed $45 per share proposal,'' Davies said in a telephone
interview Monday night.
   Earlier Monday, Desert Partners had tried to lure USG to the
bargaining table by offering to increase its bid for the
Chicago-based manufacturer to $2.32 billion if the two sides can
reach a friendly deal.
   Desert Partners, a partnership headed by two Texas oilmen, said
in a statement that it was willing to pay $45 for each of 39
million USG shares if the USG's management agreed to support the
offer.
   The remaining 12.5 million shares would be acquired for
subordinated discount debentures carrying a market value of $45
each, giving the deal a total value of about $2.32 billion.
   The partnership, led by oilmen Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E.
Brown, previously offered $42 a share in a hostile tender offer.
That bid, including debt securities and warrants valued at $42
each, has a value of about $2.2 billion and remains in effect.
   Desert Partners owns about 9.9 percent of USG's shares and said
that as of Friday, about 19.3 million shares, or 37.5 percent, had
been tendered under its $42-a-share offer.
   Analysts said that Desert Partners' latest proposal was rather
conservative and that a bid of $50 a share would far more
attractive to USG, a manufacturer of paper, plaster and wood
products. In takeover overtures last year, Desert Partners
indicated it was willing to pay $50 a share for the company.
   On composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, USG rose 50
cents to close at $41.50 a share Monday.
   In proposing a friendly resolution, Desert Partners' chief
financial officer, Joel L. Reed, said that ``all aspects of our
proposal, including price, are negotiable.''
   Among the big bargaining chips USG executives control is the
company's ``poison-pill'' defense, which is designed to hinder an
unwanted takeover. Last week a federal judge in Chicago denied a
request from Desert Partners to prevent USG from using the defense
measure. Desert Partners said it intended to appeal the ruling.
   ``The poison pill is a way for management to negotiate,'' said
Lawrence Horan, a vice president at the investment firm Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``What (Desert Partners) is trying to do is get USG management
to negotiate, not to sit there and say the company's not up for
sale,'' he added.
   The standoff appears headed for a showdown at USG's annual
meeting May 11. Desert Partners has nominated a slate of six
candidates to USG's 15-member board.
   ``We believe the stockholders will demonstrate their support of
good-faith negotiations by voting for the Desert Partners director
candidates,'' Reed said.

<HEAD>Remy Martin Drops Out Of Bidding For Benedictine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E. Remy Martin and Compagnie announced that it has
decided to drop its hostile bid for control of the liqueur and
luxury products group Benedictine SA in the face of a higher offer
from SAF Martini and Rossi.
   ``After studying the profitability aspects of a higher bid, we
have decided to drop out of the running,'' a Remy Martin
spokeswoman said Tuesday. ``That leaves Martini and Rossi as the
sole bidder, and we wish them luck.''
   Remy Martin's decision to give up the bidding came as little
surprise to Paris stock analysts, who had suggested that the French
cognac group's heavy debt burden was likely to prevent it from
winning a bidding war with the Swiss-based Martini and Rossi.
   Under French stock market rules, Remy Martin's wholly owned
subsidiary Remy and Associes unit would have had to offer at least
five percent more per share than Martini and Rossi's bid of 7,700
francs, or $1,350, to stay in the running.
   That would have worked out to 8,085 francs, or $1,418 dollars,
per share, and would have put the minimum cost of a sweetened Remy
Martin offer at 1.132 billion francs, or $199 million, on the basis
of Benedictine's current capital.
   And if Benedictine carried out a defensive capital boost it had
planned to make to friendly institutions, it would have worked out
to 1.199 billion francs, or $210 million.
   Benedictine's product range includes peppermint and
herbal-flavored liqueurs and anise-flavored apperitifs. The company
also has perfume and watch operations.

<HEAD>Boeing In Running For Biggest Jetliner Order Ever</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co.'s product line is being pitted against
a mix of McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus Industrie planes for
what could be the largest single jetliner order ever, industry
officials said.
   International Lease Finance Corp. expects to choose next week
between 100 and 120 planes in an order expected to exceed $4
billion. The Beverly Hills, Calif., company buys commercial
aircraft to lease to airlines around the world.
   Steven Udvar-Hazy, president of International Lease Finance,
said quality control at Boeing is a consideration in his company's
purchase decisions. After complaints recently from Japan Air Lines,
All Nippon Airways and British Airways, Boeing ``is working those
problems and making corrections,'' he said Monday.
   An incident in which a section of fuselage ripped away last week
on a 737 flying over Hawaii also is a factor, along with economics,
Udvar-Hazy said.
   ``These are all factors. We are looking for the best product,
the most reliable and with good economic terms,'' he said.
   He said his company's board of directors plans to make a
decision on the order next Tuesday. Company officials were to meet
with Boeing executives in Seattle today.
   ``We like to have the most popular aircraft in the fleet, what
airlines demand and what they feel comfortable with,'' Udvar-Hazy
said.
   Boeing planes being considered include the 737-500, 737-300,
737-400, 757-200, 767-300ER and 747-400.
   Udvar-Hazy said the leasing company also is negotiating with
McDonnell Douglas and Airbus, a European aerospace consortium.
   It's a ``strong possibility'' the order will be either for all
Boeing aircraft or for a split between McDonnell Douglas and
Airbus, Udvar-Hazy said. He said a three-way deal is ``highly
unlikely.''
   A $4 billion firm order would be larger than any in Boeing
history. The company's largest order was for $4.1 billion worth of
747-400 jumbo jets in 1986 from British Airways, but that included
options for 12 planes as well as 16 firm orders.
   The International Lease fleet is about 70 percent Boeing, and
its customers include both domestic and foreign airlines.
   Neither McDonnell Douglas nor Airbus alone offers the variety of
aircraft sizes and ranges necessary to satisfy International
Lease's airline clients, but together they could produce a
selection comparable to the Boeing offering, Udvar-Hazy said.
   Airbus planes being considered are the A230, A330 and A310 twin
jets and the four-engine, long-range A340. St. Louis-based
McDonnell Douglas is offering its twin-engine MD-80 and MD-90s
series, plus the proposed MD-11 wide-bodied jetliner, which has not
yet flown.
   Some industry analysts said they expected Boeing to get the nod.
   Boeing's ability to deliver planes on time is the key factor,
they said. Airbus' production capacity is nowhere near Boeing's.
Last year Airbus produced 32 planes, compared with Boeing's 273.
   ``With the value of the dollar where it is, I don't see how it
(International Lease) can't not buy Boeing planes,'' said Tom
Lloyd-Butler, an aerospace analyst with Montgomery Securities in
San Francisco.
   ``If there is a disadvantage to splitting an order between the
three manufacturers, it's also probably true that there's no
advantage to splitting it between Airbus and McDonnell Douglas,''
said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
in New York.

<HEAD>First National Bank Sued for Pension Plan Bias</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has filed a lawsuit
against First National Bank of Chicago, charging the bank with
discriminating against men and women through various features of
its pension plan.
   The lawsuit, filed Monday by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, asks that First National change its pension plans and
pay monetary damages to employees.
   No specific damages were mentioned in the lawsuit, but EEOC
spokesman John Rowe said the amount would be ``very substantial.''
   The lawsuit involves one claim of discrimination against men and
two against women.
   The claim of discrimination against men is based on a provision
in the pension plans that calculates pension amounts for each
employee at retirement using a percentage of that person's earnings.
   Rowe said the men are credited with a lower percentage than
women for employment before 1965.
   The commission claims that the bank in 1970, in an effort to
correct the problem, lowered women's pension benefits to be equal
to those of men, a move the EEOC says is illegal.
   A third claim involves the use of sex-based mortality tables for
calculating pension benefits. The commission said such tables
result in lower monthly benefits for women because women retirees
on average live longer than men.
   Rowe said the bank stopped using the sex-based mortality tables
about four years ago but didn't change its practices for prior
periods of employment.

<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. shareholders have rejected a New
York-based investor group's bid to replace four company directors
and seek to sell the personal care giant, the company reported
today.
   A preliminary count of about 87 million shares voting in the
proxy election indicate the four Gillette directors received 52
percent support to 48 percent backing the Coniston Group's slate
for the three-year terms, Gillette said.
   Coniston said it would request a recount.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Gillete fell $2.25 a
share to $39 after the announcement.
   Coniston launched a proxy battle in February, pledging that if
its candidates were elected to the board, it would try to convince
the other eight directors to sell Boston-based Gillette.
   The proxy ballots were submitted during Gillette's April 21
annual meeting and were counted by Delaware-based Corporation Trust
Co.
   Coniston, which controls 6.76 million shares, about 5.8 percent
of the 115.5 million shares outstanding, plans to call for an
immediate recount of the ballots, said Coniston principal Augustus
K. Oliver, one of the four Coniston candidates.
   Oliver said the group's projections were higher than 48 percent.
   ``We submitted a lot more votes than we seem to be getting
credit for,'' said Oliver. ``It puzzles us, and we'll try to figure
out exactly how many people were on our side.''
   In addition to Oliver, other Coniston candidates included
Coniston principals Paul E. Tierney Jr. and Keith R. Gollust and
former cable television executive David Strassler.
   In 1986, Gillette headed off several takeover attempts by Revlon
Group Inc. by signing a 10-year pact and buying back Revlon's
shares for nearly $580 million.
   ``We are very pleased that the results of the preliminary count
indicate majority support for the Gillette directors' platform to
maximize stockholder value by continuing the company's plan to
generate sustainable profitable growth above industry averages,''
said Gillette Chairman and Chief Executive Colman M. Mockler Jr. in
a prepared statement released today.
   Mockler was among the four challenged directors. The others are
Lawrence E. Fouraker, Herbert H. Jacobi and Joseph F. Turley.
   Gillette spokeswoman Joan Fitzgerald said the proxy ballot
announcement should have no affect on ongoing litigation filed by
Gillette and Coniston last month in U.S. District Court.
   A pre-trial hearing is scheduled Wednesday on the suits before
Judge Rya Zobel, who previously refused to issue a temporary
restraining order to block Coniston's proxy slate.
   Gillette claims Coniston failed to fully disclose all its
financial backers. In a countersuit, Coniston charged Gillette
issued false and misleading information about Coniston to
shareholders.
   Oliver said Coniston may request a new director election as part
of the ``equitable relief'' sought in the countersuit.

   Stock prices held steady in moderate trading,
supported somewhat by a firming bond market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.98 to 2,046.25 by

   ``There's not much going on,'' said Larry Wachtel, first vice

   Trading volume was sluggish partly because because of a delay
the opening of the futures pits in Chicago. Stock-index futures
trading had not yet begun when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
halted activity after a water main flooded the basement and
disrupted telephone contact with the outside world.
   The exchange had no estimate on when the problem would be
corrected.
   ``That's kept all the program trading out of the market today,''

``All the people who read off the spread between index futures and
the cash market haven't been a factor.''
   On Monday, blue chips rose while the rest of the market sagged,

<HEAD>China to Start Futures Markets This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China plans to open up to five futures markets in
the southern city of Canton later this year, becoming the first
socialist country to take such a step, according to a report
published Tuesday.
   The English-language China Daily quoted unnamed sources as
saying preparations were under way to set up three to five pilot
markets in Canton, one of China's most important business centers.
   Chinese leaders hope the markets will stabilize the economy and
prevent drastic price increases that have become a main complaint
of Chinese citizens, the newspaper said.
   A futures market allows traders and producers to negotiate a set
price for what they think a commodity will be worth at a future
date. The producer is guaranteed that price regardless of
subsequent fluctuations in the market.
   The report said officials from the cities of Beijing and Wuhan
and the provinces of Guangdong, Henan, Jilin and Hunan met in
mid-April to discuss plans for the futures markets, but did not say
what commodities would be traded.
   This is the latest development in China's decade-long economic
reform that has increasingly turned to capitalistic practices in
its attempt to strengthen and enliven the economy.
   The official Economic Daily earlier this year described how a
futures market would solve the problem of gluts and shortages,
which often are the result of farmers' inability to forecast the
market.
   Both papers acknowledged that China's backward communications
and transport systems will be a problem, but the China Daily said,
``... The country cannot wait until everything is ready before
carrying out the plans.''
   The paper said Chinese leaders want to learn from the experience
of foreign countries in futures markets and that experts from Hong
Kong will be consulted.
   It said no decision has been made yet on whether foreigners will
be allowed to trade in the markets.

   French fashion mogul Pierre Cardin
met President Corazon Aquino on Tuesday to discuss the possibility
of setting up a garment factory in the Philippines.
   ``This is the country of the future in this part of Asia,''
Cardin told reporters after the meeting. ``In 10 years, I am sure
it will become a leader in textile manufacturing.''
   He said the Philippines showed strong potential to become a
regional leader in fashion and textile manufacturing.
   Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion said Cardin was
interested in licensing Philippine firms to manufacture clothing
for export under his label.

<HEAD>Union Carbide Sues Insurers Over Pollution Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. has filed suit against
at least 115 of its insurers in an effort to force them to provide
coverage for cleanup, legal and study costs stemming from pollution
sites around the country.
   The chemical giant filed two suits last week, one in Superior
Court in Danbury, where it is based, and the other in state
Superior Court in Newark, N.J. Union Carbide didn't disclose how
much money it has spent on pollution defense or cleanup, and
company spokesman Edward Van Den Ameele wouldn't say.
   Defendants in the suits include Aetna Casualty and Surety Co.,
and subsidiaries of Travelers Corp., Hartford Insurance Group and
Cigna Corp. There are also unnamed defendants in the suits.
   Robert D. Chesler, a company attorney in Roseland, N.J., said
Union Carbide still hasn't determined all of the insurance carriers
that provided coverage.
   Some of the pollution occurred at Union Carbide plants, while
other problems cited in the Connecticut suit stem from the
company's disposal of its wastes at other sites.
   In the New Jersey suit, the company seeks coverage for seven
pollution sites in that state.
   The sites were identified by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency and state environmental departments. None are in
Connecticut.
   Spokesmen for the insurance companies declined to comment on the
suits, citing company policies on not discussing matters that are
in litigation.
   Union Carbide is among a growing number of companies suing their
insurers over whether liability policies cover contamination of
property and groundwater due to seepage of hazardous wastes.
   United Technologies Corp., for example, recently sued more than
240 of its insurers from the past 37 years to obtain coverage for
134 pollution sites.
   The Connecticut suit seeks insurance for sites or situations
including:
   _Three pesticide dumping sites in Aberdeen, N.C., where Union
Carbide shipped hazardous wastes from 1962 to 1970.
   _The Laskin landfill in Jefferson, Ohio, where Union Carbide
sent 60,000 to 70,000 gallons of waste oil from 1976 through 1981.
   _The Northside landfill in Zionsville, Ind., to which Union
Carbide sent 1.8 million gallons of calcium silicate and asbestos
from 1974 to 1980.
   _Union Carbide's plant in Marietta, Ohio, which made phel, a
strong, corrosive, poison, from 1951 to 1971.
   _Union Carbide's plant in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, where graphite
electrodes are made.
   _A suit charged that the pesticide Temik Aldicarb, made by Union
Carbide, polluted residential wells after it was applied to potato
fields in Suffolk County, N.Y., from 1975 through 1979. A
settlement was reached in 1984 and the new suit doesn't give
details. Union Carbide says it continues to incur costs for
testing, monitoring and legal fees.
   _Contamination of soil and groundwater from uranium milling at
Union Carbide's Uravan site in Montrose, Calif., from 1923 to 1984.
The company signed an agreement last year to pay the state $2.8
million.
   Union Carbide also believes insurance should cover pollution
problems from Institute, W.Va., where it operates a private
trucking facility on an old landfill; Seadrift and Texas City,
Texas; and Ponce, Puerto Rico.

<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. is waiting for the
United Rubber Workers union to set the next course of action, now
that a proposed three-year contract for 15,000 union employees at
Goodyear plants in the United States has been defeated, a Goodyear
spokesman said today.
   ``Lacking a ratification, we agree with the union on working on
a day-to-day basis,'' John Perduyn said.
   URW spokesman Curt Brown said Monday night that the vote against
the agreement by the union's largest branch, Local 12 in Gadsden,
Ala., was pivotal. The local, which has 2,900 members, voted 1,764
to 348 Monday against ratification.
   Six of the URW's 11 Goodyear locals approved the proposed deal,
but a majority of the membership of all 11 locals was opposed to it.
   Local 2 in Akron approved the agreement Sunday by a 3-to-1 ratio.
   Brown did not reveal the final vote total among all 11 locals.
   The tentative agreement was reached in Cincinnati on April 21 at
2 a.m., two hours after the old contract had expired.
   Brown said he has heard that some locals were upset that the
agreement did not contain a wage increase, although it included
improved benefit and job security provisions.
   Brown said URW President Milan Stone will contact the Goodyear
section of the union's international policy committee and ask to
convene a meeting in Akron, probably on Friday, to determine the
URW's next step.
   ``We are not planning on a strike at this time,'' Brown said. He
said the policy committee may ``ask the company to come back in for
a meeting. ... We will work day-to-day while we chart a new
course.''
   In addition to the local in Gadsden, other locals voting against
the contract offer are in Union City, Tenn.; Danville, Md.;
Madisonville, Ky.; and Marysville, Ohio.
   Locals voting with Akron in favor of the contract are in
Lincoln, Neb.; Topeka, Kan.; Sun Prairie, Wis.; New Bedford, Mass.;
and St. Marys, Ohio.

   Shares in Control Data Corp. rose sharply
Tuesday on Wall Street following a report that the Belzberg family
of Canada may be considering making a bid for the computer company.
   In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Control Data
stood at $26.37{ per share, up $1.50 from Monday, but down slightly
from its $26.50 per-share opening.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Belzbergs had
acquired a stake of less than 5 percent of the Bloomington,
Minn.-based concern's 41.7 million common shares outstanding.
   The article said the Belzbergs had been meeting with investment
bankers to discuss the feasability of making a takeover bid for the
company. But it also noted that the family had slowed its takeover
activities in recent months, selling back shares to target
companies on several occasions.
   A spokesman for First City Financial Corp., the Belzberg's main
financial arm, declined to comment on the matter, the Journal said.
   On Tuesday, Frank Ryan, vice president of communications for
Control Data, told The Associated Press: ``It is our policy not to
comment on rumors. That's the only response we can give you.''

<HEAD>Equity Swaps Possible Way to Reduce Huge Latin Debt</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto RIO1 of May 2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It looked like the movie ``Wall
Street.'' Brokers wearing yellow ``yuppie'' ties, waving I.D. tags
and shouting into walkie-talkies, jostled one another to make bids
on the floor of the Rio Stock Exchange.
   But the object of the bidding was not stocks, bonds, commodities
or precious metals. It was part of Brazil's mountainous foreign
debt of $121 billion.
   Thoughout Latin America, which as a whole owes the rest of the
world $410 billion and has been unable to pay it back, so-called
``debt-for-equity swaps'' are being tried as a way to break the
impasse.
   Not everyone is enthusiastic about the idea, which involves
trading big debts for generally smaller amounts of equity in local
enterprises.
   Some countries say the swaps cause inflation and lead to
``foreign domination'' of their economies. Some major creditor
banks, mostly U.S. ones, which sank billions into Latin loans, say
the swaps force them to cancel their debt at too hefty a discount.
   On the other hand, many small banks _ in Europe, Japan, the
Middle East and American cities such as Cleveland, Pittsburgh and
Dallas _ see the swaps as a way to salvage at least some of the
money they sunk into the region in the 1970s.
   ``Swaps will never be a total solution to the debt crisis. But
they certainly are a step in the right direction,'' said Maarten L.
Pronk, the Rio representative of Holland's NMB Bank, currently the
world's No. 1 middleman in debt-for-equity trades. ``There are
pluses and minuses on both sides, but the overall result is very
interesting.''
   In Brazil, which has just begun monthly debt auctions, equity
trades could reduce the country's foreign debt by as much as $4
billion this year, officials estimate.
   In a typical transaction, a company hoping to start or expand a
Brazilian business purchases a certain amount of the country's debt
from a creditor bankat a steep discount and then brings that debt
to market to bid against other companies on a repayment plan from
the central bank of Brazil.
   Successful bidders _ the ones who accept the biggest discounts
from the central bank _ get repaid in local currency, which is to
be invested in their local enterprises. The benefit to the
companies comes in the difference between what they paid for the
debt and what the central bank agrees to repay them. For example, a
company might purchase debt at 50 cents on the dollar and then win
a bid of 70 cents on the dollar from the central bank in the
auction.
   The government regulates the auctions, screens the types of
projects to be funded and sets quotas on the amount of debt it will
repay. While the process helps ease the national debt burden, the
regulations are designed to control the inflationary effects of the
swaps, which infuse the economy with fresh capital and increase the
money in circulation.
   Brazil, like most other countries, also protects its end of the
deal by requiring investors to keep their assets in the country for
a period of years.
   ``The Rio debt auction was a complete success,'' Sergio
Barcellos, the president of the Rio stock exchange, said in an
interview.
   Another aggressive debt swapper is Chile, which still owes an
estimated $21.7 billion but has traded off $3 billion worth.
   Thanks to such deals, U.S., Australian, New Zealand and Middle
Eastern private interests have bought into Chilean mining
companies, private pension funds, fruit-growing firms and fishing
companies.
   Some critics complain that encouraging foreign interests to swap
debt for equity could lead to a ``denationalization'' of the Latin
American economy. But in Chile, the authoritarian regime of
President Gen. Augusto Pinochet says the swaps will continue,
especially since the country is writing off debt at the rate of 59
to 61 cents on the dollar.
   Mexico, the No. 2 Third World debtor owing $105 billion, swapped
some $2 billion of debt for local assets but stopped the program
last year when the inflation rate hit a record 159.2 percent.
   Under the Mexican swaps, made at a discount of around 30
percent, Nissan Motor Co., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp.,
Volkswagen, American Express and Club Med acquired or increased
holdings in the country.
   Argentina, third among Latin debtors with $55 billion owed, this
year held two debt-for-equity auctions and authorized 15 specific
debt-swap deals. In these projects, $241 million worth of debt is
to be canceled in exchange for $139 million worth of ownership in
two breweries, a soft drink bottling plant, a beer bottling
company, an auto parts firm and a manufacturer of insulin.
   But Juan Ciminari, the secretary of industry and foreign trade,
echoed Mexico's worries about inflation. With Argentina's inflation
rate running over 200 percent a year, the swap program could get
tripped up, he said.
   Small, poor Bolivia has succeeded in reducing its $900 million
debt to foreign banks by swapping part of it for local assets _ at
the bargain-basement rate of 11 cents on the dollar. But there is
controversy, because of fear foreigners will gain control of
traditionally state-run companies.
   Venezuela has gone timidly into debt swaps. Uruguay says it
intends to start them. Colombia and Paraguay haven't shown much
interest in such operations, while Peru, which has openly refused
to repay most of its $16.7 billion debt, doesn't consider swaps at
all.
   Also generally in the anti-swap camp are the giant U.S. banks
that tied up billions of dollars in Latin American loans. Citibank,
Chase Manhattan, Morgan Guaranty Trust and Manufacturers Hanover
are, in principle, against huge discounts on the money owed to them.

<HEAD>Improved Farm Outlook Helps Revive Equipment Sales</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Farmers around the country are out kicking
the tires on new tractors again, and equipment sales are rebounding
from post-Depression lows so quickly many manufacturers are having
trouble keeping up.
   ``The situation has changed dramatically,'' said Dick
Unverferth, president of Unverferth Manufacturing, a Kalida, Ohio,
company that makes tillage and grain-handling equipment and special
farm vehicle wheels.
   ``It went from a pretty sick apple to one where we're on
overtime and have been on overtime for quite a while,'' said
Unverferth, who heads the Farm Equipment Manufacturers Association,
a 330-member trade group of small manufacturers.
   While manufacturers anticipated an upswing with an improved farm
economy, most misjudged its size and momentum.
   ``I never thought things would turn around to this magnitude
this quickly,'' said Bud Fleischer, who runs a Columbus, Neb.,
company that makes tillage and planting equipment.
   ``I thought it would be a gradual turnaround, something you
could adjust to,'' he said. ``We went from moderate production to
extremely heavy production.
   ``Unless something happens to change things drastically in the
next six weeks, this could be a record year in sales for this
company,'' Fleischer said.
   The sales spurt has left farmers waiting months for new tractors
and equipment as manufacturers attempt to fill an unexpected
backlog of orders.
   Steel has become a precious metal because of the manufacturing
push. Prices are up 20 percent to 45 percent for some tubing and
steel bars that are in short supply. Machinery makers also report
problems getting bearings.
   In addition to farmer income, factors propelling the surge
include a nearly depleted inventory of good used equipment, better
commodity prices, stronger export sales of grain and a continuing
moderation of interest expenses and costs for fuel, fertilizer and
other materials.
   Farm Equipment and Industrial Institute monthly sales surveys
show a strong recovery. In March, manufacturers sold 9,876 tractors
compared with 7,712 the same month a year earlier. For the first
quarter of this year, 22,986 tractors have been sold compared with
18,061 in the same period a year ago.
   Sales of combines and hay and forage equipment also are up
sharply in the first quarter.
   After record or near-record sales in the late 1970s as farmers
expanded their operations, equipment manufacturers and dealers were
hit hard when the farm recession began. During the early 1980s,
many farmers quit buying new equipment and either made used
equipment purchases or just tried to get by with additional
maintenance or repair.
   Dozens of little companies that made specialized machinery
folded or scrambled to get into other product areas.
   Even the big manufacturers were hard hit. A hallowed name in
agricultural equipment for decades, International Harvester Co.,
sold its farm machinery division to J.I. Case in 1984 so it could
concentrate on making more profitable heavy trucks.
   At Deere & Co., the No. 1 ag equipment maker in the United
States, farm machinery sales peaked in 1981. When they began
declining, company profits followed. In fiscal 1986, Deere lost
$229 million, its first loss since the Great Depression.
   As the slump bottomed out, sales and manufacturing capacity
dipped to around 50 percent of previous levels, said James
Ebbinghaus, vice president of the Farm and Industrial Equipment
Institute. The institute represents large manufacturers who provide
more than 90 percent of all the farm equipment and machinery made
nationwide.
   ``About a year ago things started to turn around,'' Ebbinghaus
said. ``Sales stopped their decline and leveled off or started back
up.''
   He said by the end of 1987, early-year losses had been recouped
and the industry stood about even with its position at the end of
1986.
   U.S. Department of Agriculture economists are predicting a
modest increase in sales during 1988.
   ``The big news is there isn't expected to be a decline for the
first time in several years,'' said Stan Daberkow, a USDA Economic
Research Service economist.
   Preliminary USDA statistics show 1987 was the eighth consecutive
year of declining farm equipment expenditures. But when final
figures are released in July, they are expected to show a less
severe decrease than in previous years, Daberkow said.
   He and other ag economists say the improvement in net farm cash
income _ the difference between gross income and expenses _ finally
is affecting equipment sales. For two years or more, farmers who
saw their incomes improve have used the money to pay off debts,
most economists agree.
   The outlook of many farmers began changing about eight months
ago, according to economists and other equipment industry analysts.
   ``It's as positive now as it's been in a long period of time,''
Ebbinghaus said.
   Deere & Co. broke a string of five straight quarterly losses in
the second quarter of fiscal 1987. The company hasn't had a losing
quarter since and it has been calling back laid-off workers.
   ``We expect the recovery to continue,'' said Deere spokesman
Brian Alm. ``We have what we call `cautious optimism.' We've been
through so much for so long we almost don't want to get too excited
too soon.''

   Stock prices advanced in moderate activity
today, supported by heavy dividend trading and a firmer bond market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.79 to 2,052.06 by
noon on Wall Street.
   Advancers outnumbered decliners by roughly 3 to 2 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 763 issues
higher, 529 lower and 523 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 101.66 million shares at mid-day.
   Much of the session's early activity centered on heavy trading
in American Electric Power, which goes ex-dividend today. The stock
led the Big Board's most-active list, rising \ to 27].
   ``Without that, volume would be extraordinarily low,'' noted
Michael Metz, vice president and technical analyst at Oppenheimer &
Co.
   Trading volume also was sluggish because of a delay the opening
of the futures pits in Chicago, where the futures on the Standard &
Poor's 500 index are traded.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange halted activity for more than
two and a half hours after a water main flooded the basement and
disrupted telephone contact with the outside world.
   ``That's kept all the program trading out of the market,'' said
Peter Vandenberg, a trader at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``All the
people who read off the spread between index futures and the cash
market haven't been a factor.''
   Some analysts welcomed the respite. On Wall Street, ``it's a
refreshing case of a stock market rather than a casino,'' Metz said.
   Stocks drew some marginal support from the credit market, where
Treasury issues were unchanged to slightly firmer.
   Among other actively traded blue-chip issues, USG was up 3 to
44{ on news that the company has offered a $45-per-share
restructuring in response to advances by Desert Partners.
   Gillette was off 1} to 39{. The company said a preliminary

company.
   Elsewhere, Exxon was up ] to 45; General Electric was off \ to

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

   Trading halted for more than 2{ hours today on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after a sprinkler system flooded
the exchange's telecommunications room, disabling its automated
price quotation system, officials said.
   Exchange officials called the halt at 8:05 a.m. CDT., 45 minutes
after the opening of trading in foreign currency and Treasury bill
futures. Trading resumed at 10:45 a.m. CDT.
   Trading in stock-index and agricultural futures had not yet
opened when the halt was called.
   Officials did not know the cause of sprinkler system's
malfunction. The telecommunications room is located on the second
floor of the exchange building, just below the trading floor.
   ``It's back in service,'' said Andrew Yemma, an exchange
spokesman. ``We don't know what caused it but it leaked a whole lot
of water.''
   The flood affected the exchange's high-speed telephone lines,
which carry price quotes to subscribers of market-information
services around the world.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is the major market for Standard
& Poor's 500 stock-index futures, the most popular contract of its
type.
   The exchange is also the nation's biggest market for cattle and

   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting a variety of weather
information, analysts said.
   Beneficial rain fell overnight in Missouri, Nebraska and extreme
southwestern Iowa, and was headed today for central and southern
Illinois. The improvement in growing conditions lent a weaker tone
to corn futures.
   But longer-range forecasts predicted dryness and below-normal
temperatures in the east, and moisture and above-normal
temperatures in the west.
   ``It's indecisive at this point,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``Generally, rain is needed
in the east. They've been having some moisture in the west.''
   The long-term outlook for grain and soybean prices remained
bullish, however, Lespinasse said.
   ``I think we're going to gyrate back and forth and consolidate
the recent big gains before ultimately moving higher,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 4\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.02 a bushel; corn was \ cent to
} cent lower with May at $2.04} a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2{
cents higher with May at $1.61 a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower
to 2 cents higher with May at $6.89 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange after opening about 2{ hours late due to
flooding in the exchange's telcommunications room.

<HEAD>Stock Exchange Requires Reports on Program Trades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday began
requiring members to submit daily reports of their program trades,
a move designed to help the exchange analyze market volatility.
   Under the new rule, NYSE members and member firms must submit a
log of program trades made for customers or for their own accounts,
including trades executed in other markets, by the close of the
second business day following the trades, the exchange said in a
statement.
   Members are not required, however, to identify customers for
whom program trades were executed.
   Program trading has been blamed for much of the market
volatility at the time of the October stock market crash. The
submission of daily data will ``enable the NYSE to more routinely
monitor and analyze program trading activity.''
   Analysts were not surprised by the new rule, which had been
announced previously.
   ``It's going to require more forms, more paperwork, more time,
and it's going to cost money,'' noted Perrin Long, an analyst at
Lipper Analytical Services.
   But many said they support the move. ``It's a good idea because
a lot of movement in the market is attributed to program trading
that isn't,'' said Robert Gordon, president of Twenty First
Securities Corp. He hopes the rule will dispell some concern over
program trading activity.
   Analysts agree a separate possibility under consideration that
would require members to identify within 48 hours all customers for
whom any business was conducted has far more serious implications.
   ``That proposal will come up against a great deal of
resistance,'' Long said.

<HEAD>State Oil Regulator Wants To Keep OPEC Contacts Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kent Hance, one of Texas' three oil
regulators, says the state benefited from his attendance at last
week's OPEC meeting, and he plans to keep those contacts open
despite the criticism the trip drew.
   ``We're not trying to join OPEC, and we're not always going to
agree with them,'' said Kent Hance, who sits on the three-member
Texas Railroad Commission. ``But when President Reagan tried to get
nuclear arms stability, he had to deal with the Russians, who are
our enemies.''
   Hance did not participate in meetings held by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, but rather visited with some
individual oil ministers during his stay in Vienna, Austria.
   ``The critical thing is _ we're living in a world where someone
else sets the price for our commodity. We have to have input,'' he
said in an interview Monday.
   Not everyone agreed. One group called Monday for Hance to be
prosecuted on charges of violating the Logan Act, which bans
private citizens from interfering with U.S. foreign policy.
   The Citizen Labor Energy Coalition, which says it has 12 million
members who favor low energy prices, wrote U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese urging that he prosecute Hance.
   ``It would appear that Commissioner Hance's efforts to assist
OPEC in fixing world oil prices are in direct opposition to U.S.
foreign and economic policy,'' the letter said. ``Commissioner
Hance is carrying on a blatant campaign to assist OPEC in raising
world oil prices and damaging U.S. economic interests.''
   The OPEC meeting ended Monday with no agreement on a proposed 2
percent cut in the group's oil production, a move aimed at
stabilizing prices that have undergone big fluctuations since late
1985.
   The proposal was made after six non-OPEC oil countries offered
to reduce their production if OPEC made a similar cut.
   ``I am disappointed that ... they did not reach an agreement.''
Hance said. ``I figured that if they didn't, prices would slide a
little temporarily and then they would come back.''
   Despite the meeting's breakdown, however, Hance said he agreed
with predictions that world oil prices would stabilize near recent
levels.
   In fact, prices did take a hard fall amid market disappointment
at the meeting's failure _ but not low enough to match levels that
existed before the OPEC session was called early last month.
   At the New York Mercantile Exchange, for example, West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, fell 85 cents a barrel to
$17.14 Monday. In early April, it had traded in high $16 range.
   For 40 years, the Texas Railroad Commission helped set world oil
prices. The commission has monitored oil output since an oil price
crash in the 1930s, and under state law the agency has authority to
restrict production to avoid waste and to protect reserves.
   Hance made no apologies for his trip, which also drew criticism
from the Reagan administration. He said Texas officials should
attend the next OPEC session in June because ``what happens in
Vienna at the OPEC meetings will have more impact on our economy
than anything that will happen in Austin or in Washington.''
   Hance invited OPEC's president, plus oil officials from several
other nations, to visit Texas and learn more about the Railroad
Commission's production monitoring system.
   ``Indonesia is coming Wednesday,'' he said, adding that OPEC's
president or his representative likely would visit the state this
summer.

   Stock prices advanced today, supported by heavy
dividend trading, activity in takeover issues and a firmer bond
market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.76 to 2,056.03
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancers outnumbered decliners by roughly 3 to 2 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 833 issues
higher, 556 lower and 519 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 134.4 million shares at mid-afternoon.
   Much of the session's activity centered on heavy trading in
American Electric Power, which goes ex-dividend today. The stock
led the Big Board's most-active list, rising ] to 27{, and
accounted for about a third of total volume.
   ``Without that, volume would be extraordinarily low,'' noted
Michael Metz, vice president and technical analyst at Oppenheimer &
Co.
   The rest of the session's activity is occurring ``primarily in
takeover deals, real or imagined,'' said Alfred Goldman, a vice
president at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Otherwise, however, ``we're basically in a trendless market that
is drifting upward,'' he said. ``Everybody is waiting for something
to get this market out of its six-week-old lethargy.''
   Program traders were shut out of the market in the early going
because of a water main break at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the futures on the Standard & Poor's 500 index are traded.
Activity was halted for more than two and a half hours.
   Some analysts welcomed the respite. On Wall Street, ``it's a
refreshing case of a stock market rather than a casino,'' Metz said.
   Arbitragers remained mostly on the sidelines once futures
activity resumed, analysts said.
   Separately, stocks drew some marginal support from the credit
market, where Treasury issues were unchanged to slightly firmer.
   Among other actively traded blue-chip issues, USG was up 2~ to
44] on news that the company has offered a $45-per-share
restructuring in response to advances by Desert Partners.
   Gillette was off 1| to 39|. The company said a preliminary
report shows its slate of candidates won board seats in a proxy
fight waged by Coniston Partners.
   Control Data was up 1} to 26| following reports that Canada's
Belzberg family may be considering making a bid for the computer
company.
   Elsewhere, Woolworth was up 1~ at 59[; Genentech was down 1{ at

   Park Communications Inc. said Tuesday that it
has acquired the Commonwealth-Journal, a daily newspaper in
Somerset, Ky.
   Park, a diversified media company based in Ithaca, N.Y., said it
purchased the five-day daily and Sunday paper, its companion
paid-weekly newspaper, McCreary County Record, and two
controlled-distribution weeklies: Shopper Stopper and Lake
Cumberland Advisor.
   The purchase price wasn't disclosed.
   Together, the four publications serve more than 32,000 homes in
six southcentral Kentucky counties.
   George A. Joplin III, president of Commonwealth-Journal Co.,
said the newspaper had been operated by his family for 60 years but
that his health required that he withdraw from the operation.
   The Commonwealth-Journal is Park's first daily newspaper in
Kentucky.
   Park owns and operates 39 daily newspapers, 82 other
publications, seven television stations and 19 radio stations in 23
states.

<TEXT>
   Share prices ended mixed Tuesday on the London
Stock Exchange, with gains in most international stocks the only
feature in an otherwise torpid market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished at
1,807.2, up 5 points, or 0.3 percent, from Friday's close.
   British financial markets were closed Monday for a bank holiday.
   Volume was a light 335 million shares, down from 417.5 million
shares on Friday.
   Although Wall Street opened slightly higher Tuesday, dealers
said the New York market wasn't providing needed direction for
London traders.
   The greatest gains in London were in the dollar-earning stocks,
which rose on expectations that the U.S. dollar might bounce back,
capping the British pound's recent rise, dealers said.
   The outlook for a higher dollar was based on market belief that
short-term U.S. interest rates might rise, they said.

<HEAD>Opposition to Dalkon Shield Payoff Plan Is Challenged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition that has urged Dalkon Shield
claimants to vote against A.H. Robins Co.'s reorganization plan is
ignoring the advice of their own lawyers, a Robins spokesman said
Tuesday.
   ``They overlook the fact that the very committee that has
represented them for over two years is urging that the plan and the
system for settling claims be adopted,'' said spokesman Roscoe E.
Puckett Jr.
   At a Washington news conference Monday, Karen Hicks, president
of the Dalkon Shield Information Network, called Robins' proposed
plan of reorganization ``inadequate, unfair and contrary to law.''
   Ms. Hicks, representatives of consumer groups and some plaintiff
lawyers linked to Dalkon Shield lawsuits and Robins' reorganization
called for rejection of the plan, which was mailed to claimants
last week.
   The proposal includes Robins' merger with New York-based
American Home Products Corp. and a Dalkon Shield trust fund of at
least $2.475 billion.
   Puckett expressed puzzlement at the opposition.
   ``Our view is that we have a consensus of all the groups
involved in the case,'' he said. ``The reason for that is this plan
is fair.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. of Richmond, who is
overseeing Robins' Chapter 11 reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, in December placed the $2.475 billion value on an estimated
195,000 Dalkon Shield claims before the court.
   ``It is important to remember that Judge Merhige has said that
the Dalkon Shield trust fund represents more money than anyone ever
thought would be available,'' Puckett said.
   A letter mailed by the claimants' committee to women who contend
they were injured by the birth control device said that ``as a
result of interest earnings, the funds available under the plan to
pay Dalkon Shield claims and expenses will exceed $2.475 billion.
... We recommend that you vote to accept the plan of
reorganization.''
   ``The plan is not perfect,'' the letter said. ``However, on
balance, the plan offers claimants the most money and the best
terms that could be achieved without a long and uncertain legal
fight.
   ``This is an opportunity to receive compensation for your claim
sooner and with greater certainty than if we were to continue the
litigation,'' the committee's letter said.
   Robins, a pharmaceutical manufacturer based in Richmond, sold
the intrauterine device in the the early 1970s. Robins filed for
reorganization under federal bankruptcy law in August 1985 as
lawsuits mounted against the Dalkon Shield.

   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank moved to
put his stamp on the nation's mail Tuesday, juggling Postal Service
managers and turning his personal attention to technology and
planning.
   ``Change is inevitable. If we are to be successful, the U.S.
Postal Service must anticipate change and manage it effectively,''
Frank told the opening session of the Third Conference on Advanced
Technology.
   Postal managers from around the world convened at the session to
see the latest in sorting and canceling machines, lasers that read
ZIP codes and even automated postal clerks.
   Frank, who brought automated bank tellers to supermarkets and
discount stores when he headed a California savings and loan
association, told the conference that he hopes to do the same for
the postal system.
   ``We plan to locate automated postal tellers in high traffic
areas like shoping malls, transportation stations and large office
buildings,'' he said.
   Earlier Tuesday, Frank, known for his hands-on management style
as a banker before taking over leadership of the Postal Service on
March 1, told the agency's Board of Governors that he is separating
the finance and planning divisions.
   He named Richard J. Strasser as assistant postmaster general for
planning, and said Strasser will report directly to him on projects
for the development and improvement of the agency.
   The Postal Service announced, meanwhile, that it suffered a loss
of $635 million for the accounting period from Dec. 19 to March 11,
above the $586 million deficit it had predicted for that period.
Higher postage rates intended to put the service back in the black
took effect April 3.
   At its meeting, the Board of Governors also disclosed that it
has rejected a proposal to offer a lower ``bill-payer'' postage
rate.
   That idea had been suggested by the independent Postal Rate
Commission. It proposed a discount for people using pre-printed
reply envelopes, such as those for use paying bills, which are
addressed to a post office box.
   Such envelopes do save the Postal Service money, primarily
because they go to a box rather than having to be delivered to a
customer, the board said. But the governors concluded that the
bill-payer rate would be unfair to others sending mail to post
office boxes, since they would still have to pay the full rate.
   In other personnel moves, Frank broadened the Postal Service's
top management by naming two associate postmasters general to work
with him and Deputy Postmaster General Michael Coughlin.
   Kenneth J. Hunter was promoted to associate for systems,
succeeding the late Fletcher F. Acord who died earlier this year.
This includes responsibility for personnel, marketing,
communications, facilities and procurement.
   Edward E. Horgan Jr., who has been in charge of facilities, was
given the newly created position of associate postmaster general
for international affairs.
   Horgan will launch the new job by coordinating the 1989 meeting
of the Universal Postal Union, the international group that
coordinates mail service between nations. It will be the
organization's first meeting in the United States in 92 years.
   Frank, who succeeded Preston R. Tisch as Postal Service chief,
announced that consumer advocate Ann Robinson's duties will be
expanded to include measurement of postal performance.
   In addition, he named Mitchell H. Gordon to head administrative
services and Gordon C. Morison as acting head of marketing and
communications.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in an see-saw session
influenced by conflicting interpretations of long-range weather
forecasts.
   ``If we had closed 15 minutes earlier, we would have closed
higher,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. ``It's just been back and forth all day long.''
   Forecasts called for beneficial rains Tuesday in Missouri,
Nebraska and extreme southwestern Iowa, and a good chance for rain
Wednesday in central and southern Illinois. Those forecasts gave
the markets their negative tone.
   But six-to-10 day forecasts called for dryness and below-normal
temperatures in the east with wetter weather and above-normal
temperatures in the west.
   Traders had a hard time deciding whether the long-range
forecasts implied better or worse growing conditions, Lespinasse
said.
   ``The weather is ambiguous and the market reflected that
ambiguity today,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $2.97{ a bushel; corn was unchanged

<HEAD>Gillette Announces Narrow Victory In Proxy Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. said Tuesday that its shareholders
narrowly rejected a bid by a group of New York investors to replace
four company directors and seek a buyer for Gillette's global
personal care empire.
   Analysts said most of the support for Gillette came from
individual shareholders interested in retaining a stable investment
and confused by the lack of definite sale plan by Coniston.
   A preliminary count of about 87 million shares voting in the
proxy election indicate that the four Gillette directors received
52 percent support, Gillette said. It said that tally exceeded the
48 percent of shareholder votes backing Coniston Group's slate of
directors for the three-year terms.
   The announcement culminates a proxy battle launched in February
by New York-based Coniston, which pledged to convince the other
eight directors to sell Gillette if its candidates were elected to
the board. Possible suitors included Revlon Group Inc., which ended
a series of takeover attempts in 1986 after Gillette paid about
$580 million to repurchase its shares.
   The proxy ballots were submitted during Gillette's April 21
annual meeting in Andover, Mass.
   After the ballots were cast both sides had claimed victory, with
Coniston noting support from many large institutional shareholders.
   Coniston principal Augustus K. Oliver vowed Tuesday to
immediately file a recount request, saying their ballot projections
were higher.
   ``We submitted a lot more votes than we seem to be getting
credit for,'' said Oliver. ``It puzzles us, and we'll try to figure
out exactly how many people were on our side.''
   Oliver also said Coniston attorneys may request a new election
as part of the ``equitable relief'' sought in a countersuit filed
last month in U.S. District Court claiming Gillette issued false
and misleading statements about Coniston during the three-month
proxy battle.
   A pre-trial hearing is scheduled Wednesday before Judge Rya
Zobel, who previously refused to issue a temporary restraining
order to block Coniston's proxy slate.
   In a suit filed last month, Gillette claims Coniston failed to
fully disclose all its financial backers in documents submitted to
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In a prepared statement Tuesday, Gillette Chairman Colman M.
Mockler Jr. said the outcome shows shareholder support for
Gillette's performance since a 1986 restructuring, which included
2,400 layoffs and sale of several unprofitable divisions.
   At the annual meeting, several shareholders lauded Gillette
management's long-term plans and questioned Coniston's ultimate
intentions.
   ``Coniston never really had any definite plan on the table,''
said Pavlos Alexandrakis, an analyst at Argus Research in New York.
``There were no real buyers and no tender offer made. All they were
saying is that we'll have four people on a 12-member board and
we'll have some clout.''
   Mary Ann Winter, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New
York, said most shareholders are reluctant to give up their
investment in Gillette, which produces steady stock dividends.
   ``Here's a company with an annual growth rate of about 10
percent and stockholders do not want to give that up for a one-time
cash payment,'' said Winter. ``Institutional investors, on the
other hand, are looking for a profit each quarter ...''
   Coniston, a diversified investment firm, controls 6.76 million
Gillette shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's 115.5
million shares outstanding.
   Last year, Coniston forced a major restructuring of Allegis
Corp. following a takeover attempt.
   Gillette spokeswoman Joan Fitzgerald said the company has no
comment on reports that officials had conducted negotiations with
several potential buyers.
   As a way to dilute the influence of Coniston's slate, Gillette
on April 20 amended its bylaws to increase the number of directors
needed to call a special meeting from two to seven.

   Southdown Inc. and Moore McCormack Resources Inc.
announced Tuesday that they will sell a Moore McCormack energy

   The two resource companies said the proceeds from the sale of
Moore McCormack Energy Inc. will be used to help pay off loans made

   Trading halted for more than 2{ hours Tuesday on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after water from a burst pipe
flooded the exchange's telecommunications room, disabling its
automated price quotation system.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is the leading U.S. market for
stock-index and livestock futures, and the trading shutdown had a
quieting effect on the nation's other financial markets, analysts
said.
   ``We don't know what caused it but it leaked a whole lot of
water,'' exchange spokesman Andrew Yemma said after trading resumed
at 10:45 a.m. CDT.
   Exchange officials called the trading halt at 8:05 a.m. CDT., 45
minutes after the opening of trading in foreign currency and
Treasury bill futures. Trading in stock-index and agricultural
futures had not yet opened when the halt was called, Yemma said.
   A large water pipe in the sprinkler system burst and flooded the
second-floor telecommunications room, located just below the
exchange's trading floor, he said.
   The water disabled the exchange's high-speed telephone lines,
which carry price quotes to subscribers of market-information
services around the world.
   The exchange's computers were not damaged, so trading could have
continued but ``the customers and users of the market wouldn't have
known what the prices were,'' Yemma said.
   During the trading halt, stock market players were unable to
hedge their equity investments via the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange's popular Standard & Poor's 500 futures contract. That may
have limited trading activity on the New York Stock Exchange,
analysts said.
   ``You're definitely not going to see anybody make a big play
without the futures open,'' said Arthur Liming, an analyst with LNS
Financial Group in Chicago.
   While the Merc was down, he said, ``There was one or two things
less to watch on what was a quiet day to begin with.''
   Yemma said it was impossible to calculate the dollar value of
the loss of volume at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Chicago's MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which trades smaller
versions of the most popular futures contracts offered by other
exchanges, may have benefited from the Merc's problems, however.
   Spokesman William Murschel said the MidAm halted trading in its
stock-index, livestock, foreign currency and Treasury bill futures
at the same time as the Mercantile Exchange, then resumed trading
in those contracts at 10 a.m. CDT when it appeared the Merc might
be closed for a day or more.
   ``When the MidAm reopened, it really became the marketplace for
those contracts that were affected by the CME, so there was an
alternative marketplace available,'' Murschel said. ``It was the
MidAm's day in the sun.''

   The United States Tuesday asked South
Korea to protect American intellectual property rights and lift
sales restrictions on foreign cigarettes, government officials said.
   In the second day of a scheduled three-day trade meeting which
opened in Seoul on Monday, the United States also asked South Korea
to open its advertising and insurance markets, the officials said.
   ``The meeting was very useful. There were detailed discussions
on almost all pending issues,'' a South Korean official said after
Tuesday's talks.
   The 19-member U.S. delegation, headed by Peter Allgier,
assistant chief of the U.S. Trade Representative Office, demanded
that South Korea protect 911 U.S. chemical products which are
patented but not marketed, retroactive to Jan. 1, 1987, the
officials said.
   South Korea promised to reply to the U.S. request before the
Seoul meeting ends on Wednesday, they said.
   U.S. officials also called for the South Korean government to
tighten control on pirated books under a 1985 agreement, in which
Seoul officials promised to protect the U.S. copyrights, the
officials said.
   The United States took a critical stand on South Korea's
cigarette sales system and demanded that the prices of imported
foreign cigarettes be lowered to the level of domestic brands, they
said.
   Imported American cigarettes sell for $1.76 a pack compared with
81 cents a pack for the most expensive local brand.
   The United States also asked South Korea to permit cigarette
advertisements through all news media, but South Korea said the
advertisements would be limited to magazines, the officials said.

   The stock market advanced today, but most of its
gains were concentrated in blue-chip takeover targets and in
dividend-related trading.
   Analysts said that aside from pockets of activity, trading was a
bit lackluster. But they noted the market's improvement was more
apparent than in previous weeks.
   Much of the session's activity centered on heavy trading in
American Electric Power, which goes ex-dividend today.
   Takeover stocks also helped drive the market higher. Analysts
said these issues heated up in anticipation that cash will soon be
freed up as a handful of other takeover deals come to a close.
   Program traders were shut out of the market in the early going
because of a water main break at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the futures on the Standard & Poor's 500 index are traded.
Activity was halted for more than two and a half hours.
   Some analysts welcomed the respite. On Wall Street, ``it's a
refreshing case of a stock market rather than a casino,'' Metz said.
   Arbitragers remained mostly on the sidelines once futures
activity resumed, analysts said.

<HEAD>Kodak Reports $260 Million in Quarterly Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co.'s earnings rose 46
percent in the first quarter of 1988, to $260 million from $178
million a year ago, the company said Tuesday.
   The photographic giant said the increase was due to increases in
sales volume, the weak dollar, and earnings from Sterling Drug
Inc., which Kodak acquired in February.
   On a per share basis, Kodak earned 80 cents in the first three
months of the year, compared to 53 cents during the first quarter
of 1987.
   Sales increased 25 percent to $3.33 billion from $2.65 billion
last year.
   Analysts said the results were better than expected.
   The only surprise in the report was a 2 percent earnings drop in
the company's imaging segment, which includes photography and
copiers, according to Charles Ryan, of Merrill Lynch & Co. in New
York.
   Ryan said the decline was due to repackaging of certain film
products and increased advertising expenses.
   He said, however, the expenditures would pay off later.
   Another analyst, Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
New York, said a large portion of the per share earnings increase,
27 cents, was due to the declining value of the dollar, which makes
foreign profits worth more in dollar terms.
   Glazer said it was a ``low quality source'' of earnings gain.
   He said the sale of assets in France resulted in another 4 cents
of the per-share gain.
   Both analysts noted strong gains in the company's chemicals
segment and the Sterling Drug subsidiary.
   Sales rose in each of Kodak's three segments. Sales in its
imaging segment were $2 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.
Chemical sales were $654 million, up from $588 million. And sales
in health products were $640 million, up from $274 million.
   Sales outside the United States were healthy _ up 23 percent in
the imaging segment, up 16 percent in chemicals, and up 104 percent
in health.

<HEAD>Staley Rejects British Firm's Sweetened Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Staley Continental Inc. announced
Tuesday its board rejected a sweetened $1.42 billion takeover bid
from British sugar producer Tate & Lyle PLC and may consider other
offers.
   Staley Chairman Donald E. Nordlund said several unidentified
``third parties'' are interested in acquiring the company, based in
this northwest Chicago suburb.
   ``The company is continuing discussions with certain third
parties and expects to enter into negotiations,'' Nordlund said in
a statement issued by the company.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday, Staley shares
advanced 50 cents to $38.375.
   Staley's board recommended that the company's stockholders
reject the $35-a-share bid, which was made last week and approved
Tuesday by Tate & Lyle shareholders meeting in London.
   When it first moved to take over Staley last month, the British
company offered $32 per share of common stock.
   Staley, the United States' second-larged refiner of corn
sweeteners behind Decatur-based Archer Daniels Midland Co., urged
its stockholders April 21 to reject the first offer.
   In its statement Tuesday, Staley said its financial advisers _
First Boston Corp. and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets _ had
concluded the revised Tate offer was ``inadequate.''
   Staley's board did not make a recommendation on Tate's offers of
$53.15 a share for depositary preferred stock or $105 a share for
cumulative preference stock.
   But the company's statement noted the British company's takeover
bid was conditioned on receiving a minimum number of common-stock
shares and that Staley's board has recommended rejecting the common
stock bid.
   In a related matter, Staley's board extended its ``poison pill''
anti-takeover defense until May 10 at 5 p.m. Tate's revised bid
expires at midnight (EDT) on that date.
   Spokesmen for the companies did not return telephone messages
Tuesday seeking comment. But industry analysts have said Staley has
a fair market value of about $40 a share.
   After Tate's first offer, Clinton Mayer III, an analyst in New
York with Bear Stearns Inc., said that if he were a Staley
stockholder, he probably wouldn't sell for less than $40.
   Tate & Lyle owns about 5 percent of Staley's stock and wants to
acquire the entire company for its A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.
subsidiary, which produces corn sweeteners.
   Staley was based in Decatur, Ill., until about three years ago
when it moved its headquarters to Rolling Meadows. The British
company has promised to move Staley's headquarters back to the
central Illinois city if its takeover succeeds.
   Staley Continental also owns CFS Continental Inc., a leading
food-service supplier.

<HEAD>Dollar is Mixed, Gold Declines in Lackluster Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar rose narrowly on domestic markets but
fell overseas Tuesday with little news to influence trading.
   Gold prices slipped. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $443.25 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
$445 at the same time Monday.
   ``It is a very sleepy, featureless market,'' said Robert Ryan,
senior foreign exchange trader with Irving Trust Co.
   There were few developments to sway trading, Ryan said. However,
one trader said the dollar managed a late rally because of rumors
of buying interest among Japanese investors.
   Overseas trading was subdued because markets in Japan were
closed for a national holiday.
   Dealers in Europe said the dollar would likely continue to
fluctuate within a narrow range at least until the scheduled
release Friday of U.S. unemployment data. The market also looked
ahead to the May 17 release of U.S. merchandise trade figures for
March, dealers said.
   In London, the British pound edged up to $1.8715 from $1.8645.
In later New York trading, the pound slipped to $1.86825 from
$1.87225 late Monday.
   The dollar was quoted in London at 124.83 Japanese yen, down
from 125.33 yen in Tokyo on Monday. In New York, the dollar rose to
125.155 yen from 124.825 yen late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
rates, included: 1.67955 West German marks, up from 1.67825;
1.39875 Swiss francs, up from 1.39735; 5.7105 French francs, up
from 5.7000; 1,249.375 Italian lire, up from 1,1248.83; and 1.23575
Canadian dollars, up from 1.23255.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday's late
prices, included: 1.6770 West German marks, down from 1.6810;
1.3945 Swiss francs, down from 1.4015; 5.6935 French francs, down
from 5.7153; 1.8795 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8860; 1,247.50
Italian lire, down from 1,251.60; 1.2294 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2315.
   Gold bullion slipped to $443.50 on the Commodity Exchange in New
York from $445.60 late Monday. In Zurich, gold was quoted at a late
bid price of $446.00 a troy ounce, unchanged from Monday's late bid
price.
   In London, the metal was quoted at $445.50 an ounce. The city's
bullion markets were closed Monday. Gold closed at $449.25 on
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $446.57, down
from $450.30.
   Silver bullion closed on the Comex in New York at $6.298 a troy
ounce, down from $6.353 late Monday. Silver traded in London at
$6.39 a troy ounce, down from $6.45 on Friday.

<HEAD>Jury Clears Sturgis, Deadlocked On Others In Continental Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury acquitted an Oklahoma oil
contractor Tuesday on charges of scheming to defraud Continental
Illinois National Bank & Trust Co., but failed to reach a verdict
on two bank executives charged in the case.
   U.S. District Judge Milton Shadur declared a mistrial after
jurors said they were ``hopelessly deadlocked.''
   The government maintained during the 6{-week trial that former
banker William Patterson manipulated his two debt-plagued
co-defendants, John Lytle and Jere Sturgis, in a scheme involving
high-risk energy loans to save his own failing bank by defrauding
Continental.
   But the panel found Sturgis, an independent oil contractor from
Tulsa, Okla., innocent of wire-fraud charges. Patterson and Lytle
were charged with wire fraud and misapplication of funds.
   Continental came to the brink of collapse in 1984 in part
because of troubled energy loans, but the Chicago bank survived
with help from a $4.5 billion federal rescue plan.
   ``What can I say? The dream came true,'' Sturgis said after the
innocent verdict was read. ``I'm getting on the first plane'' back
to Oklahoma.
   Lytle, a former Continental vice president who headed the
Chicago bank's energy-lending division, said, ``I am very
disappointed (about the mistrial). I had hoped for a resolution.''
   Outside the courtroom neither Patterson, a vice president at
Penn Square bank in Oklahoma City until its collapse in 1982, nor
his lawyer, Warren Bickford, had anything to say to reporters.
   But in Oklahoma City, another Patterson attorney, Burck Bailey,
said he also was disappointed. ``We were hopeful that the jury
would return a verdict of not guilty, but of course, we're pleased
on the other hand that there was no guilty verdict returned,''
Bailey said.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said he would huddle for a few days
with assistant prosecutors Joseph Duffy and Mark Rotert before
deciding whether to seek another trial.
   ``When the jury speaks, we respect the verdict,'' Valukas said.
``We sent up the best trial lawyers to try an extraordinarily
complex case. They did a good job. ''
   James Streiker, Lytle's attorney, said, ``There's a good
possibility there will be a retrial.''
   The case went to the jury April 26 and jurors began their fifth
day of deliberations shortly after 9 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
   Federal prosecutors had contended Patterson was the central
figure in the alleged fraud scheme and controlled Lytle and
Sturgis, who were financially dependent on him and Penn Square for
loans.
   The government charged that Lytle, caught in spiraling personal
debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle, accepted kickbacks from
Patterson in exchange for funding or attempting to fund high-risk
energy loans from Continental for Penn Square customers between
July 1981 and July 1982.
   The indictment cited Lytle's involvement in $44 million in loans
made by Continental to 12 Penn Square customers, many without any
documentation. It did not say how much eventually was recovered by
the Chicago bank.
   Attorneys for Lytle and Patterson had argued that Continental
was saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an
aggressive lending policy, not because of a fraud scheme.
   Lytle and Sturgis were accused of engaging in a related
``buyback'' investment scheme that began with Lytle buying into
Sturgis' operations in May 1981.
   Sturgis bought Lytle out less than a year later at triple the
original investment to improve his chances of getting a Continental
loan through the Chicago banker, prosecutors said.
   Patterson arranged for a $3 million loan to Sturgis from Penn
Square that enabled him to buy out Lytle's $150,000 investment for
$475,000, the government said.
   The ``buy-back'' scheme was devised as a way for Lytle to clear
much of his personal debt and for Sturgis, who was then being
pursued by creditors over $100 million in business loans, to find a
new lending source, prosecutors said in closing arguments.

<HEAD>Gold Falls To 6-Week Low; Drop To $400 Predicted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices dipped to their lowest levels in more than
six weeks Tuesday, bolstering bearish projections and prompting
speculation that the metal's price could tumble as low as $400 a
troy ounce in coming months.
   On other markets, energy futures rallied, cattle futures climbed
while pork futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were lower and
stock-index futures advanced.
   It was not the depth of gold's decline but the fact that it fell
at all that analysts found remarkable. Oil prices rallied Tuesday
and inflation-sensitive gold would ordinarily have done the same.
   ``I've been saying gold is in a bear market and today's action
certainly proves it,'' said Peter Cardillo, commodity trading
adviser with Joesphthal & Co. in New York. ``We could have had an
up day with the price of oil rebounding, but the market just
ignored that and traded on its own.''
   Gold settled $2.10 lower across the board on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in June at
$445.10 a troy ounce, the lowest price for a lead futures contract
since March 17, when the April contract settled at $444.90.
   The overall strength of the economy and the fading prospects for
higher inflation have the precious metals markets on the defensive,
analysts said.
   Craig Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
called Tuesday's trading ``another small disaster'' for both gold
and silver futures.
   ``This is sort of a continuation of what has been a steady
erosion over the last couple of months in both of these markets,''
he said.
   Silver settled 5 cents to 5.5 cents lower with May at $6.298 a
troy ounce.
   Energy futures advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange in a
technical recovery from Monday's plunge, which had been a reaction
to the failure of OPEC oil ministers to agree on production cuts,
analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 26 cents
higher with June at $17.37 a barrel; heating oil was .09 cent lower
to .82 cent higher with June at 46.77 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .75 cent to .91 cent higher with June at 50.28 cents a
gallon.
   Cattle futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
while pork futures were mixed.
   The cattle market is struggling between the reality of high cash
prices and the implication of recent government reports that large
numbers of cattle are being fattened for slaughter, said Chuck
Levitt, an analyst in Chicago with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Hog futures were caught Tuesday between the higher cattle
futures prices and sharply lower pork-belly futures linked to a
glut of frozen bellies, Levitt said.
   The opening of livestock trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange was delayed about 2{ hours Tuesday when water from a burst
pipe flooded the exchange's telecommunications room, forcing a halt
to trading.
   Live cattle settled .43 cent to .92 cent higher with June at
71.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .93 cent higher
with May at 79.45 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .33
cent higher with June at 49.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were unchanged to .85 cent lower with May at 51.25 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade in an up-and-down session influenced by conflicting
interpretations of long-range weather forecasts, analysts said.
   Forecasts called for beneficial rains Tuesday in Missouri,
Nebraska and extreme southwestern Iowa, and a good chance for rain
Wednesday in central and southern Illinois. Those forecasts gave
the markets their negative tone.
   But six-to-10 day forecasts called for dryness and below-normal
temperatures in the east with wetter weather and above-normal
temperatures in the west.
   Traders had a hard time deciding whether the long-range
forecasts implied better or worse growing conditions, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat settled { cent to 4{ cents lower with May at $2.97} a
bushel; corn was unchanged to } cent lower with May at $2.04} a
bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 1} cents lower with May at $1.57\ a
bushel; soybeans were \ cent to 2{ cents lower with May at $6.89\ a

   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's stock
index settled 1 point higher at 262.70.

   The stock market gained ground Tuesday, largely
on the strength of takeover issues and heavy dividend-related
trading in one stock.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.09 to close at
2,058.36. The key index rose nearly 11 points in the previous
session.
   Advancers outnumbered decliners by roughly 3 to 2 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 897 issues up,
580 down and 513 unchanged. Broader market gauges also advanced.
   Big Board volume totaled 176.92 million shares, against 136.47
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index rose
0.74 to 148.57.
   Much of the session's activity centered on heavy trading in
American Electric Power, which went ex-dividend Tuesday. The stock
led the Big Board's most-active list, rising [ to 27\, and
accounted for about a quarter of total trading volume.
   Takeover speculation, for ``real or imaginary'' reasons, drove
trading in a handful of other blue-chip issues, noted Alfred
Goldman, vice president at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   In addition to being fueld by the rumor mill, analysts said
takeover issues heated up in anticipation that cash will soon be
freed up from other deals. As the takeovers of Federated Department
Stores Inc. and textile giant J.P. Stevens & Co. move toward
settlements, funds are likely to flow into other ``possible
deal-type'' stocks, said Eugene Peroni, chief market strategist at
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
   ``This is going to free up a lot of capital that will find its
way back to the arbitrage circuit,'' he said.
   Despite the rather narrow focus of activity, analysts noted that
the market's overall tone is improving. ``The Dow has been
producing much more encouraging technical signs that suggest we are

   Some analysts welcomed the absence of program plays. ``It's a
refreshing case of a stock market rather than a casino,'' said
Michael Metz, vice president and technical analyst at Oppenheimer &
Co.
   Arbitragers remained mostly on the sidelines once futures
activity resumed, analysts said.

including trades executed in other markets, by the close of the
second business day following the trades, the exchange said in a
statement Tuesday.
   Members are not required, however, to identify customers for

<HEAD>Koppers Attorneys Accuse Shearson Of Using Inside Information</HEAD>

   Koppers Co. accused Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. on Tuesday of improperly trading Koppers stock on the basis of
inside information about the $1.7 billion hostile takeover attempt
by Shearson and British industrialist Brian Beazer.
   A court document filed by Koppers attorneys said Shearson
brokers accumulated Koppers stock from January through early March
for managed discretionary customer accounts.
   During the same period, which ended the day before the Beazer
group announced a buyout offer, large amounts of Koppers stock were
sold for Shearson discretionary accounts and for discretionary and
managed discretionary accounts of Shearson's E.F. Hutton unit.
   ``Based on information disclosed, Shearson's managed accounts
performed as if they had a pipeline directly into the tender
offer,'' the attorneys said in court documents filed in U.S.
District Court in Pittsburgh.
   ``It is factually obvious that Shearson's preferential customers
were enriched at the expense of all other discretionary accounts,''
the documents stated.
   The allegations were included in a motion filed in connection
with Koppers' federal suit to block the Beazer group's takeover
attempt.
   BNS Inc., formed by Beazer, Shearson and National Westminster
Bank, has offered $60 a share to acquire the Pittsburgh-based
chemical and construction company.
   The investor group owns or has been tendered about 66 percent of
Koppers outstanding common shares, but is barred from purchasing
the tendered stock by two injunctions issued by federal judges in
Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Eastern Seeks Clarification of Order Barring Shuttle Sale</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS new grafs 2-6 with new FAA probe, edits throughout</NOTE>

   Eastern Airlines has asked a federal judge to
clarify his order barring the financially troubled carrier from
selling its Northeast shuttle service to another subsidiary of its
parent, Texas Air Corp.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating
Machinist union charges that the Miami-based carrier is guessing
the weight of cargo aboard its aircraft.
   ``We've been looking into the allegations for about a week and a
half,'' FAA spokesman Roger Myers said Tuesday. ``We have not found
any irregularities yet.''
   The FAA has already fined Eastern $823,500 for safety violations
and is conducting an inspection of its fleet.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the airline ``is absolutely
safe in all phases of its operations'' and accused the Machinists
of using safety issues as a smokescreen to obscure economic issues
in contract negotiations.
   In Washington, the motion by Eastern, which was filed last week
under seal in U.S. District Court, appears to have been made in an
attempt to ensure that a planned business transaction would not
violate a series of orders issued by District Judge John H. Pratt.
   In March, Pratt held Eastern in contempt of a July 2, 1987,
order issued in a labor dispute for taking steps to sell the
Eastern Air Shuttle to a newly created subsidiary of Texas Air
Corp. for $225 million. The service operates between New York and
Washington and New York and Boston.
   Pratt barred Eastern from taking any further steps to sell the
shuttle, ruling the transaction would violate the status quo in
working conditions he had ordered last summer.
   The proposed sale was opposed by the Machinists union, which
charged the company was trying to undermine the union's ability to
represent shuttle employees by transferring the operation to
another subsidiary.
   Matell refused to comment Tuesday on why the airlines filed the
motion, saying only: ``The entire letter is under seal and we do
not care to clarify.''
   Court documents requesting that the clarification motion be
placed under seal said Eastern was trying to protect ``confidential
and proprietary information about its business plans.''
   ``Eastern would be placed at a serious and irreparable
competitive disadvantage if the information contained in the motion
and memorandum and supporting affidavits is made public,'' the
company's deputy general counsel, Michael J. Smith, said in a sworn
affidavit.
   ``Disclosure of the information could impair Eastern's ability
to manage its operations and to resolve its financial
difficulties.''
   In a reply to Eastern's request, attorneys for the Machinists
said the union did not agree with the airline's interpretation of
Pratt's order.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here is scheduled to hear
arguments Thursday on Eastern's appeal of Pratt's order barring the
shuttle sale.
