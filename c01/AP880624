   LaToya Jackson rode a motorcycle onto the
stage and dazzled President Reagan and the audience with a gaudy
demonstration of modern rock 'n' roll song and dance Friday night
to mark the 20th anniversary of the restoration of Ford's Theater.
   An array of celebrities _ including yesteryear rock 'n' roll
stars Fabian, Frankie Avalon and Bobby Rydell _ took part in the
gala benefit performance to help raise money for the theater's
endowment fund.
   Among the other performers were singer Rosemary Clooney, actress
Shirley Jones and comedian Sid Caesar.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, came onto the stage at the end of
the show, and Reagan talked about the theater that was closed in
1865 after President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated.
   The theater remained closed for over a century until it was
reopened, after renovation, in 1968.
   Reagan said the theater long has represented a place ``to
refresh, to uplift, to give joy.''

   A man accused of poaching thousands of city
pigeons won't be prosecuted unless he persists in pursuing pigeons,
Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said.
   ``We've decided not to press charges. He's given us his promise
to cease and desist his pigeon activities,'' Stern said Thursday.
   Domiano Parasmo, 73, of Brooklyn was taken into custody by a
park enforcement patrolman on Wednesday and given a summons for
violating parks regulations that made it a crime to trap birds or
animals in the parks.
   Authorities say the man caught thousands of the birds and sold
them to poultry markets.
   Parasmo has been issued summonses by the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals three times and in each case,
the hearing judge dismissed the charges.
   There is no law against trapping wildlife on city streets, as
long as it is done humanely; however, Park Department regulations
forbid removing or harming birds in city parks.

<TEXT>
   Actor-director Spike Lee has been sued by the
actress who played the female lead in his movie ``School Daze,''
who says she has not received artistic credit or money for singing
in the film.
   Tisha Campbell, 19, said in the $350,000 suit filed Thursday in
state Supreme Court that her career was damaged because Lee and
others refused to give her the singing credit.
   Lee's lawyer, Arthur Klein, said he had no comment on the suit,
which also names as defendants EMI Records, Columbia Pictures and
Lee's company, 40 Acres and a Mule Productions Inc.
   Miss Campbell has a solo on the ``School Daze'' soundtrack album
and performs a song with someone else, said Jules Kurz, one of her
attorneys. The Screen Actors Guild contract requires that she get a
separate contract for her singing, Kurz said.
   ``All we really wanted was a fair royalty,'' Kurz said, ``but
Lee basically refused to negotiate that point.''
   The soundtrack album has been on the Billboard magazine Top 100
albums list since April, and a single from the album has been in
the Top 100 about three weeks, said another Campbell attorney,
Bruce Colfin.
   Miss Campbell has appeared on television in ``The Cosby Show''
and ``Rags to Riches.'' Her stage work includes ``Little Shop of
Horrors'' and ``Mama I Want to Sing.''

   Rock star Prince will be in Europe next
month, and he's bringing 90 people and 100 tons of equipment along
for the trip, a spokesman says.
   Prince plans to begin his European tour with four performances
beginning July 8 in Paris, Bob Merlis, vice president of publicity

   Concerts will follow in Milan, Italy; Antwerp, Belgium; London;
Helsinki, Finland; Stockholm, Sweden; Rotterdam, the Netherlands;
Copenhagen, Denmark, and Modena, Italy, Merlis said. More dates may
be added.
   Prince will perform in the round, with an elaborate stage
featuring three or four settings controlled by hydraulics, Merlis
said.
   He'll be taking 100 tons of stage equipment, and the tour
entourage of 90 people will include a 50-member technical crew, the
spokesman said.
   Prince, who toured Europe last year, plans to begin a U.S. tour
in mid-September, followed by a tour of the Far East, probably in
December and January, Merlis said.

<DATELINE>GRASSY KEY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chance to swim with a pod of
dolphins and even hop a ride on a passing dorsal fin has tourists
lining up at attractions in the Florida Keys, but some
environmental activists worry the animals will be exploited.
   Three attractions and a resort in the Keys charge as much as $50
each to tourists who have been on waiting lists for more than a
month to take their 15-minute ``dolphin encounter.''
   ``Where else are you able to get up close and feel the dolphin's
skin and experience its gentleness and the way it uses its
echo-location systems?'' said Mike Wood, curator of Theater of the
Seas ocean park in Islamorada. ``People leave here with a whole new
appreciation for these animals. It's a tremendous educational
experience.''
   Stormy and Genie, the attraction's two 7-foot-long Atlantic
bottlenose dolphins, have splashed along with 12 swimmers every day
for the past year. They appear to relish the human contact _
nuzzling kisses on the cheeks of young women, wagging their
powerful tails to stand in the water and ``dance,'' and even flying
out of the water to turn somersaults above swimmers' heads.
   The dolphins chirp and click after each task until the trainer
has rewarded them with fish. The wide-eyed tourists come away with
spectacular photographs and a few minutes they'll never forget.
   ``This is something I've wanted to do my whole life and now I
can say I've done it,'' Alan Larosee of North Providence, R.I.,
said as he climbed out of the oceanside, landlocked lagoon.
   But the environmental group Greenpeace is not as enthusiastic.
   It views any public display of dolphins for profit as
exploitative and is calling for government regulation of swim
programs.
   ``The dolphin swims in the Keys have been very popular and
that's been encouraging several big resorts around the country to
think about capturing dolphins for a program of their own,'' said
Lesley Scheele of the Fort Lauderdale chapter of Greenpeace.
   ``Our concern is that this could escalate to the point where
everybody trying to lure a tourist is applying to capture dolphins
for a swim program,'' she said. ``This could end up putting a major
strain on wild populations.''
   Dolphins have been a protected species since 1972 under the
Marine Mammal Protection Act, which allows for the tightly
controlled capture of dolphins for public display.
   But the law doesn't specifically address ``dolphin encounters''
or how they should be operated.
   ``I've seen some places where they dump 10 people in the water
and they're all grabbing at one dolphin _ all the animal wants to
do is get away,'' said Chip Hershaw, a trainer at the non-profit
Dolphin Research Center on Grassy Key, which has operated a swim
program for three years.
   ``There's a right way and and wrong way to go about it,'' he
said.
   Theater of the Seas, Dolphin Research Center and Dolphins Plus
in Key Largo are the only places that have been granted federal
display permits along with special experimental permits to run the
swim programs, while Hawk's Cay Resort operates dolphin swims with
only a display permit, said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the
National Marine Fisheries Service in Washington, D.C.
   The regulatory agency has conducted public hearings on the issue
here and in Washington and has appointed an expert panel to come up
with a set of dolphin encounter guidelines, Gorman said.
   Until those rules are issued, expected by mid-summer, the
fisheries service has ordered a moratorium on any more dolphin swim
programs. That has delayed plans by a Hyatt Hotel in Hawaii to
capture six dolphins for swims with guests, Gorman said.
   ``Ideally, we'd like to see the dolphin swims restricted to only
non-profit research facilities, places where there's a real
educational mission,'' said Ms. Scheele of Greenpeace. ``Anytime
profit is the main motive there's a possibility of abuse.''
   The group has also recommended that any swim facility be set up
to allow dolphins to come and go from the wild freely and not be
forced to interact with humans, said Bo Bricklemyer, a Greenpeace
attorney in Washington.
   There may also be health risks when humans swim with dolphins,
Ms. Scheele said, since it is not known exactly what is causing a
virus that has killed hundreds of dolphins in the last year along
the East Coast. She said there has been no proof that dolphins and
humans have exchanged such viruses.
   Wood of Theater of the Seas agrees there should be some
regulation, but he feels many checks are already in place to
protect dolphins and said for-profit attractions can help in that
effort.
   ``The whole idea that we're out to rape the oceans of all the
dolphins is incredibly misleading,'' he said. ``The federal
government nowadays makes it a long, arduous and expensive process
just to get the approval to capture a dolphin _ there's no way the
law would allow a big run on dolphins.''
   Federal law allows fewer than 100 dolphins to be taken for
scientific or public display purposes every year, yet as many as
12,500 dolphins are allowed to be ``incidentally'' killed in nets
in the commercial harvests of tuna and other fish, Gorman said.
   ``The number of dolphins that could ever be taken for swim
programs is a drop in the bucket,'' Wood said. ``Greenpeace has
their priorities way out of line here. It's programs like ours that
create the awareness to save the dolphins that are really
endangered.
   ``We're not getting rich off the dolphin swim program either,''
he said. ``If we wanted to get rich we could run this like a ride
at Disney World. We would never allow that to happen.''

   Governors from 10 parched states held an emergency meeting
Thursday to plot steps to help farmers survive the worst drought in
50 years, while forestry officials said the hot, dry ground was
increasing the danger of fires.
   By midafternoon, temperatures once again hit the middle 90s to
around 100 degrees from the central High Plains through the lower
Missouri Valley into the Tennessee Valley and mid-Atlantic states.
   The devastating combination of extreme heat and record low
rainfall also continued to stall barge traffic in the nation's
midsection, increased the threat of forest fires, and even raised
the possibility of higher beer prices. The weather eased in parts
of the Northeast, however.
   In St. Louis, the medical examiner's office said Thursday that a
99-year-old woman whose body was found in a sweltering bedroom the
previous day had died from the heat. But a worker who collapsed and
died Wednesday at an un-air-conditioned Chrysler Corp. plant in
nearby Fenton, Mo., was found to have died of heart disease
unrelated to the weather, officials said Thursday.
   The worker's death had prompted others at the plant to walk off
the job for a time, but work resumed Thursday, Chrysler said.
Workers had also walked out briefly on Tuesday.
   Records were broken in at least 25 cities, including Kansas
City, Mo., where the 102-degree reading beat the 15-year-old record
by 10 degrees. The 98 degrees in Washington, D.C., tied a record
that has stood for 114 years.
   The record high of 104 degrees at Billings, Mont., was 2 degrees
short of the all-time record of 106 degrees on July 4, 1937.
   Tucson, Ariz. reached 113 degrees, the third straight day in
which the high reading exceeded the previous all-time record of 111
degrees.
   Other cities with record highs included: Atlantic City, N.J.
(98); Bismarck, N.D. (103); Charleston, W.Va., (90); Chattanooga,
Tenn. (100); Evansville, Ind. (100); Greensboro, N.C. (97);
Huntsville, Ala. (98); Kansas City, Mo. (102); Memphis, Tenn.
(101); Minot, N.D. (100); Nashville, Tenn. (101); Norfolk, Va.
(99); Paducah, Ky. (103); Richmond, Va. (100); and Sheridan, Wyo.
(103). Records were tied in at least nine cities.
   In Chicago, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told 10
Midwestern governors that the federal government would ``do what is
needed'' to aid farmers. But one of the 10 said later that Lyng had
failed to recognize the full extent of the problem.
   Governors discussed steps to aid their struggling economies,
from the diversion of water from Lake Michigan to speed up the flow
of barge traffic on the Mississippi to long-term measures to halt
the drop in water tables in the northern and western states.
   In a speech to the governors, Lyng announced a drought hot line
for farmers and noted that existing cop insurance and disaster loan
programs were available as farmers determine the extent of crop
losses in the coming days and weeks.
   ``The situation is still fluid. ... We'll need a little bit of
time to learn what the losses are,'' he said. ``But we will do what
is needed to minimize the severity of the damage.''
   Gov. George Sinner of North Dakota, speaking at a closing news
conference, disputed Lyng's comments that the drought damage was
undetermined. Farmers in several states already had lost much of
their cash crops and others have sold off entire livestock herds
for lack of feed grain, Sinner said.
   ``Where I think he (Lyng) is wrong is in the wheat area,'' said
Sinner, a Democrat. ``That damage is done and it is very, very
severe. In the livestock feed area, that damage is done and it's
going to grow.''
   Lyng left the conference after his speech, but said he would
meet with Reagan on Friday to discuss the drought.
   Opening the conference, Illinois Gov. James Thompson said that
unless his state gets rain in the next 30 days, ``we risk the loss
of our corn crop and (soybean) crop. And all the governors here can
tell much the same story.''
   Because barge traffic along the Mississippi River is so crucial
to agriculture, Thompson proposed that the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers seek permission to divert water from Lake Michigan to
solve the problem.
   That proposal, however, drew the ire of Gov. Tommy Thompson from
neighboring Wisconsin, who said, ``It might turn out to be more
disastrous over the long term than the immediate salvation it
provides.''
   Some 1,000 barges were halted along the Mississippi in Memphis,
Tenn., area alone, and dredging of the channel continued Thursday.
   In its first ``drought advisory'' for 1988, the National Weather
Service said the outlook for the Plains and Midwest for the
remaining days of the month was for more hot and dry weather.
   But a cold front brought some relief to the Northeast.
   ``We got tremendous rain. It was a godsend,'' said Priscilla
Palmer at her farm in Pownal, Vt., where 2.2 inches of rain fell
overnight. ``Everyone looked outside and said, `Thank you, Lord.'''
   In Kentucky, the heat was blamed for exacerbating a train
derailment and chemical leak late Wednesday that drove thousands
from their homes. Phosphorus coming out of a derailed tanker burst
into flames, spreading a toxic cloud across five western Kentucky
counties. White phosphorus spontaneously burns when exposed to air
temperatures above 85 or 90 degrees, officials said.
   The weather also raised the spectre of forest fires. One of the
governors in Chicago on Thursday, George Mickelson of South Dakota,
had spent 2{ hours Wednesday viewing two large fires from the air
in the northwestern part of his state.
   U.S. Forest Service officials told him vegetation was so dry
that they couldn't get readings on their instruments, Mickelson
said. ``They have never recorded higher temperatures with lower
moisture levels. It is tinder dry,'' he said.
   Fires had burned more than 10,000 acres in the state, officials
said. There were no reports of injuries or damage to buildings.
   The drought could even increase beer prices, because of a huge
increase in the cost of barley, a prime ingredient of the sudsy
brew, industry officials said.
   Robert Weinberg, a St. Louis brewing consultant, said ``if
barley went through the roof, we're probably talking a 3 to 4
percent price increase at the retail level.''
   If not yet through the roof, perhaps, prices are at least
heading toward the rafters. Since June 6, the drought has pushed
the average price for barley from $2.55 to $2.60 per bushel to
$4.30 to $4.50, said Marge Jones, owner and publisher of the
Brewers Bulletin in Woodstock, Ill.

   A group of lawyers working out of a two-room
office behind gray brick walls in central Beijing has come to the
defense of the rising number of Chinese women who seek legal means
to redress wrongs.
   According to the law, women in China have equal status with men,
but in reality women traditionally are often looked down upon.
   They increasingly face discrimination at work, particularly in
hiring and promotions. Supervisors frequently reject women
applicants on the grounds they are not as efficient or skillful as
men.
   Accounts of wife beatings appear regularly in the Chinese press,
and cases of arranged marriages and girls being sold into marriage
have resurfaced in the countryside.
   The 18 lawyers at the Beijing 8th Lawyer Office _ 17 of whom are
women _ exclusively help women facing such problems. In the past
three years, they have counseled more than 3,000 women and handled
nearly 400 cases in court.
   On the walls of their small office near Tiananmen Square are
reminders of some of their victories.
   A set of calligraphy scrolls, commissioned by a grateful client
who won her case against a bigamist husband, hangs just inside the
door.
   ``Upright for life, your spirit lives as long as heaven and
earth,'' it says in praise of the lawyers.
   Established in 1985 by the All-China Women's Federation, the
legal center is the first and largest of its kind in China.
   Similar legal aid offices for women have opened in the southern
city of Canton (Guangzhou) and in Sichuan province, but none has as
big a staff or case load as the Beijing office.
   ``Everyone has the same goal,'' the deputy chief lawyer, Zhang
Xiaoqing, said of her colleagues. ``We want to use our legal
knowledge for the benefit of women and children.''
   In the cramped and badly lit office, Yu Lin, in her 60s,
conducted an interview one recent day with a 47-year-old divorced
woman who was fighting for custody of her 6-year-old son.
   Nearby, Tian Hui, a 24-year-old lawyer, sat at a narrow, wooden
desk carefully taking notes as a 39-year-old factory worker from
the countryside talked about her dissatisfaction with a recent
divorce settlement.
   The client fought back tears as she related how her second
husband asked for a divorce because his two children by a previous
marraige were grown and he no longer needed her.
   The district court had already granted the divorce, but she was
unhappy with the financial settlement, which awarded her husband
their six joint bank accounts, their apartment and furnishings and
bicycle.
   Women like these have a hard time getting legal aid, because
China has a shortage of lawyers _ only 20,000 to 30,000 for a
country of more than 1 billion people, Zhang said.
   The 8th Lawyer's Office is open mornings for walk-in
consultations. In the afternoons, the lawyers work on cases.
   Fees start at 50 fen (13 cents) for consultations and are never
more than 2 yuan (54 cents). The basic fee is 1 yuan (27 cents),
but about one-third of the women are too poor to pay even that.
   To represent a client in a divorce case, the lawyers charge 30
to 50 yuan ($8 to $13), based on rates set by the state, but again
about 30 percent of the women pay less or nothing.
   Some women learn of the office from a notice in the Beijing
Intermediate People's Court while others are referred by the
Women's Federation.
   ``We only take on those cases that are reasonable,'' Zhang said.
``If they have no (legal) reason for bringing up a case, we try to
explain the law to them. That's part of our work too.''
   One of their more interesting cases involved a 60-year-old
deaf-mute woman whose husband was branded a counter-revolutionary
during the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   Out of concern for his wife and two children, the man divorced
the wife and told her they would remarry if his perilous situation
improved.
   After the Cultural Revolution, he was rehabilitated, received
back pay and given compensation for his home and household goods
that were confiscated.
   The man, however, married someone else, moved to another
province and never paid child support or gave any kind of financial
assistance to his first wife for the years she reared their
children on her own.
   The 8th Lawyer's Office took her case to court, which ruled that
the man had to pay the woman 1,500 yuan ($405).

   Through nationwide radio and TV ads and a
mailing to every American household, Carole LaFavor has come to
represent the anguish of people afflicted with AIDS.
   ``Obviously women can get AIDS. I'm here to witness to that.
AIDS is not a `we,' `they' disease, it's an `us' disease,'' Ms.
LaFavor says in messages broadcast since October and in packets
mailed this month.
   In January, doctors told the 40-year-old single mother from
Minneapolis she had six weeks to live. Doctors can't explain why
they were wrong, but Ms. LaFavor says educating others gives her a
purpose.
   ``It is one of the reasons why I am alive. It is an important
vocation,'' she said.
   ``Everybody says it's important for people to see the faces and
hear the voices of the people who have the disease and so that's
why I do it. If one person can be prevented from getting the
disease by any one thing I say, it's worth it,'' she said.
   Ms. LaFavor learned she had AIDS-related complex in the fall of
1986. She says she engaged in a lot of unsafe behavior, including
sharing needles with other drug abusers, until she was caught
stealing drugs from the hospital where she worked as a registered
nurse.
   Counseling helped. And she worked a year and a half as a
chemical dependency counselor until AIDS struck and she was forced
onto medical disability.
   Six months ago, she and four other people, including another
AIDS sufferer, founded Spirits Alive, which trains people to teach
others about acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a deadly disease
for which there is no known cure.
   She also surrendered some of her privacy to appear in the public
service announcements and mailings, produced at the direction of
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
   ``If those of us who have it aren't willing to talk about it,
we're not going to be able to get the word out as effectively,''
said Ms. LaFavor, a woman with a face creased with lines who
appears older than her 40 years. She is identified only as Carole
in the mailings.
   While she agreed to be identified by her full name in an
interview, Ms. LaFavor said she was leery about having it printed
in the brochures.
   ``I was trying to protect my daughter's confidentiality. I sort
of figure I can handle the negative things, but it's not fair for
her to have to. Thankfully, that hasn't happened,'' Ms. LaFavor
said.
   Instead, she says, she has received support.
   A young friend of her 9-year-old adopted daughter, Theresa,
offered sympathy after seeing Ms. LaFavor in the public service
announcements.
   ``She said, `I hope your Mom doesn't die.' I think that's a
pretty sensitive thing for a 9-year-old child to say. Theresa felt
supported by it,'' said Ms. LaFavor, who has made arrangements for
a friend to adopt her daughter.
   Ms. LaFavor said she felt the ads were making an impact when a
woman in a hair-styling salon slipped her a note as she was leaving.
   ``She said she had seen me on TV and that for the first time it
had really caused her to stop and think about her own behavior and
about the whole issue of AIDS,'' said Ms. LaFavor.
   She received about $1,000 for the public service announcements.
For the approximately 75 speeches she has given in the last year,
mostly to health organizations and American Indian groups, Ms.
LaFavor, an Ojibwe Indian, received only payment for expenses.
   Offers to speak have increased since she made the public service
announcements, but she said she has to choose carefully because she
fatigues easily and doesn't want to spend too much time far away
from her daughter.
   Ms. LaFavor, still wiry, says she most misses running and
staying athletic since she got AIDS. Her home, decorated with
Indian art objects, is in a working-class neighborhood of south
Minneapolis.
   Ms. LaFavor was among about 30 people contacted through AIDS
education groups and interviewed last year for the broadcast
announcements and brochures. ``People who see her say they are
surprised she has AIDS, that she seems she's somebody they would
like to know,'' said Stephen Heller, vice president and creative
director at Ogilvy & Mather Advertising's Atlanta office. ``They're
surprised she has AIDS because she doesn't fit the stereotypes.''

<HEAD>Drought-Stricken Farmers Flood Auction Houses: `It's A Buyer's
Market'

<NOTE>Eds: This is one in an ongoing series of stories about the effects
of the 1988 drought on the nation.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   When Larry Mundth went to market to sell his livestock, he knew
all about the drought outside. But he wasn't quite ready for the
flood inside.
   Cattle filled the Milwaukee Stockyards, where Mundth and other
anxious farmers gathered to sell their animals in what has become
another casualty of the Midwest's worst drought in 50 years.
   Business is booming at stockyards and auction barns across the
heartland as farmers, faced with hay shortages and rising feed
prices, are liquidating their herds. The selling frenzy, meanwhile,
has pushed down livestock prices.
   ``It's not an easy ballgame to play,'' said Mundth, a Reedsburg,
Wis., farmer, who last week sold a dozen steers. ``No one
appreciates selling when it's a buyer's market. They (buyers) were
enjoying the feast.''
   ``These slaughterhouses are all filled up,'' he added. ``All of
these animals that have flooded the market ... it's very
upsetting.''
   Mundth said his steers were ready for market, but other farmers
fearing lower prices and hay shortages are sending beef cattle to
slaughter before they are mature and in some cases are selling off
dairy cattle.
   ``Some of the people look at the feed supply and feel they're
going to take whatever they can,'' said Norbert Brandt, general
manager of the Midwest Livestock Producers Cooperative in
Wisconsin. `It's a very tense situation, very demoralizing.''
   ``Some of them think prices will go down even more,'' he added.
``Every day that goes by without rain, the situation is that much
more worse.''
   The liquidation in recent weeks has been a boon to Midwest
auction houses, which charge a commission to the seller. Chuck
Levitt, a market analyst, estimated the drought may be bringing an
additional 10,000 to 15,000 cattle to market each week.
   There has also been an increase in hog and sows being
slaughtered because of higher price of feed, but the jump has not
been as great as the increase in the number of cattle.
   In southern Missouri, officials at the Ozark Regional Stockyards
last week had a record number of cattle sold. The 5,650 head was 1{
times the number sold in the same period in 1987.
   At the Milwaukee Stockyards, a 20 percent to 30 percent increase
in receipts was posted last week, said cattle salesman Bob Strauss.
   ``There's a little bit of panic selling,'' he said. ``People
need money all the time in farming. If that's all you've got, you
sell whatever sells the best.''
   But selling now means less profit. Strauss said cows early this
week were 39 cents a pound, a sharp drop from the 51-52 cents of
two weeks ago.
   Some also fear the rush to market now could have dire
consequences later.
   ``That old cow is the factory,'' said Russ Harriman, executive
vice president of the Missouri Cattlemen's Association. ``She's the
one that produces next year's calf crop. If you don't have a
factory, you don't have a calf crop, you don't have anything to
sell next year.''
   And for those who sell and want to start over, competition will
be fierce.
   ``When people all want to rebuild the herd, they're going to be
bidding against each other,'' said C. William Swank, executive vice
president of the Ohio Farm Bureau.
   To help farmers and slow the culling of herds, Ohio and some
other Midwest states have begun hotlines to match people needing
hay with those who have it.
   Swank also said while consumers will enjoy lower prices in
upcoming weeks, eventually meat supplies will shrink and shoppers
will feel the pinch.
   ``The consumers better load up their home freezers this fall,''
said Levitt, senior livestock analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in Chicago. ``Next spring's prices could be record highs.''
   Mundth, 33, said if he'd had more grain, he would have held his
steers longer. But he said he was concerned about falling prices
and estimated he already lost $1,600 by not selling 10 days sooner.
   He hopes to recoup some of his losses this fall but noted that
``our profits are so minimal, it's extremely difficult to make up
for it. ... It looks very highly unlikely this is going to be a
very good year.''

<TEXT>
   West Germany's parliament has approved
a tax reform package that will cut income taxes by about $11
billion beginning in 1990.
   The Bundestag passed the legislation Thursday by a 256-209 vote.
   Independent West German economists welcomed the tax reform
package, but have argued that it should take effect earlier than
1990 to stimulate the country's sluggish economic growth.
   Economists have also pointed out that the legislation's effects
would be partially offset by an increase in consumer tax revenues
of about $4 billion next year.
   The tax reform package goes before the Bundesrat (Upper House)
on July 8.
   One part of the legislation, pushed by Bavarian Governor Franz
Josef Strauss, has become controversial. That part exempts fuel for
private airplanes from a value-added tax.
   Strauss, head of the Christian Social Union, a partner in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government, is an devoted
amateur pilot.

   A khaki-clad Princess Diana fired two powerful
guns, detonated a dud charge and drove an armored vehicle in a mock
battle with the British Army.
   The wife of the heir to Britain's throne was so enthusiastic
about her half day on the ``front'' Thursday that soldiers said
they'd love to have her join their ranks.
   ``She seemed to thoroughly enjoy the number of bangs and noises
going off everywhere,'' said Maj. Willy Peto, an escort to the
princess during the Bridge Over the River Avon battle. ``I think
she would make an extremely good soldier.''
   The battle took place on army land on the Salisbury Plain
southwest of London.
   Diana, wearing khaki overalls and pink high-top sneakers,
laughed as she operated a 76mm cannon on a Scorpion armored vehicle
and a 30mm cannon on a Scimitar armored vehicle.
   Later, she sat in a trench as small-arms fire rang out, and
pressed a button to detonate a fake charge simulating the blowing
up of a bridge.
   She then climbed into an armored reconnaissance vehicle equipped
with air defense missiles and drove two miles across the
battlefield to a lunch of army ration steak-and-kidney pie.

   Cable mogul Ted Turner said Soviet
citizens have the same major concerns as Americans: death, tasty
food, good drinks and sex.
   ``The Soviet people are a lot like you and me ... They don't
want to die,'' the founder of Cable News Network told the Marshall
Management Association.
   ``They like to go to the beach. They like to be warm in the
winter and cool in the summer. They like to have a good meal. They
like to have a good drink. They like to'' have sex, Turner said
Wednesday night.
   Turner, whose Atlanta-based Superstation WTBS televised the
Goodwill Games from Moscow and recently aired a series on life in
the Soviet Union, said the arms race has gone on too long.
   ``It's time to bring that part of mankind's history to a close.
We ended slavery 135 years ago. We gave women the right to vote and
educated them 85 years ago and we ended segregation 25 years ago,''
he said.

   A four-pound bomb exploded in front of a
government office building in the center of this regional capital,
causing property damage but no casualties, investigators said.
   It was the third blast in recent days in Italy's Alto Adige
province, torn by ethnic tensions between its German-speaking and
Italian-speaking inhabitants.
   The investigators said Thursday that the explosion Wednesday
broke windows and damaged cars in a parking lot.
   An official of the local government said German-speaking
separatists were suspected in the attack. Since January over 20
bombings have claimed four lives in the province.
   The violence stems from tensions between the region's 300,000
ethnic Germans and 125,000 Italians. The region, also known as
South Tyrol, was stripped from Austria at the end of World War I.
   The German-speaking majority wants priority in obtaining
government jobs and more control over local broadcasting.
Extremists want an independent Tyrolian state.

   Anatoly N. Rybakov, author of ``Children of the
Arbat,'' is in the front rank of those struggling to reform the
Soviet system, a system which sent him to Siberia in the 1930s and
blocked publication of his novel for 21 years. His book, finally
published in Russian last year, has recently appeared in English
and his been critically acclaimed.

   Anatoly Naumovich Rybakov, still
energetic at 77, jumped up and pulled a bundle of papers from one
of the shelves that line the study of his cottage in the forested
writers' colony outside Moscow.
   Carefully, lovingly, the novelist laid the bundle on the desk
next to the window, untied the string and pulled out two covers of
the largest Soviet literary magazine, Novy Mir, one from 1966 and
the other from 1978.
   In the soft light, filtered through the trees, Rybakov held up
first one and then the other of the blue sheets of stiff paper,
tracing with his gnarled finger the underlined announcement that
the journal would soon publish ``Children of the Arbat,'' his novel
of the Great Terror waged by dictator Josef V. Stalin in the 1930s.
   Both times, in 1966 and 1978, publication was blocked by the men
in the Kremlin, men who rose to power under Stalin.
   Rybakov's patience paid off.
   More than 21 years after it was written, ``Children of the
Arbat'' was published last year in the literary journal Druzhba
Narodov (Friendship of Peoples), as part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
campaign to reform the tyrannical system created by Stalin.
   The novel has since appeared in hardback editions, and was
published in English in the United States last month by Little,
Brown & Co.
   The book probes more deeply than any other yet published in the
Soviet Union into Stalin's mind and methods, the pettiness and
arbitrariness that guided his followers, the innocence of his
victims and the terror he created.
   It tells the story of Sasha Pankratov, a young man of 23 who,
like Rybakov, was sentenced without trial for a crime he never
committed and sent to Siberia for three years of cold and lonely
exile.
   Rybakov grew up in the apartment building inhabited by most of
the book's characters, No. 51 Arbat Street, an old shopping street
in downtown Moscow that was at once popular among the Communist
Party elite and among fashionable young people.
   Rybakov is working on the sequel, ``1935 and Other Years,''
which will continue the story, and like ``Children of the Arbat,''
will give intimate portraits of Stalin and his lieutenants and
describe how he terrorized his deputies and the country.
   ``The entire nation lived in fear,'' said Rybakov, his craggy
features grim beneath a balding pate and gray hair. ``Only one
person thought for himself. Everyone else abandoned free thought.''
   Gorbachev and his supporters have concluded that a nation based
on such a system cannot survive in the technological age.
   During the years Rybakov waited for his blockbuster to appear in
print, he lived and worked at his peaceful dacha, or cottage, at
Peredelkino, the wooded village where the Nobel Prize-winning poet
and novelist Boris Pasternak wrote and is buried. Rybakov earned a
comfortable living by writing 11 other novels, as well as
screenplays for television and movies.
   He resisted the temptation to publish his works abroad, as
Pasternak, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and others had done. Pasternak
was ostracized, his works banned until recently, and Solzhenitsyn
was exiled to the West.
   ``I wanted to publish it in this country,'' said Rybakov. ``I
wanted to change my country. That is why I have been so patient.''
   Hardback and paperbound editions of the book are expected to
reach 3.5 million copies, he said, a phenomenal circulation in the
Soviet Union , where a run of 100,000 is considered generous for
works of fiction.
   The book disappears from stores before it reaches the shelves.
The only places it can be found in Moscow are in hotel shops open
only to foreigners and at a special store on Kropotkin Street that
accepts no rubles, only Western currency. On the black market, it
sells for 30 rubles ($51.40), more than 10 times its retail price.
   Inside the Kropotkin store, a saleswoman told an American
visitor, ``I'm sorry. We don't have `Children of the Arbat.' It
hasn't come in yet.''
   Then she lowered her voice. ``I'll get you a copy. But just
one.'' She disappeared, returning a few minutes later with the
volume.
   The written word has played a huge role in Russia since the 19th
century, when works by writers such as Pushkin and Tolstoy were a
moral and spiritual counterbalance to the authoritarian rule of the
Czars. The influence of writers in the Soviet Union is immensely
greater than that of any American author in the United States.
   ``I don't think that fiction is as important in the United
States in shaping the image of a country in the minds of the
people,'' said Rybakov, just back from a month-long trip to
America, his third visit in as many years.
   In reforming the Soviet system, said Rybakov, ``the first step
is to change the psychology of the people. Perestroika
(restructuring) started in literature, films, the mass media, the
fields that shape people's spiritual lives and thinking.''
   ``We need to reshape people's minds, and that will inevitably
lead us to economic freedom,'' said Rybakov.
   ``Children of the Arbat'' deals largely with the purges within
the Communist Party, and only mentions in passing a far bloodier
episode _ the 1929-32 collectivization of agriculture _ which
caused a famine and, according to estimates by Western scholars,
claimed 8 million lives.
   Rybakov said he will explore this in greater depth in his next
novel.
   ``My figures are even higher,'' he said.
   Although food shortages persist, six decades later Soviet
authors have only tentatively touched on the collectivization
issue. Any detailed discussion might lead to calls to return the
land to private farmers, a step reformers in China have taken.
   Rybakov lets a grin crease his leathery face: ``I am no expert
on decollectivization, but we need greater freedom in the village.''
   The smile gives way again to a look of grim determination. ``Who
will take land and cultivate it if he fears that someone will take
it away from him?''

   The party of five from the advertising agency was
not unusual, says restaurant owner Neville Blech. They reserved a
table for 1 p.m. and called at 1:40 p.m. to cancel.
   But for Blech, ``it was the last straw.'' He sued the agency in
small claims court and won, demonstrating how some British
restaurants are beginning to fight back against the problem of
no-show diners.
   ``These people are messing about with my livelihood. It's bad
news,'' says Blech, who won about $140 _ or the average gross
profit from a lunch for five at Mijanou, his posh 30-seat French
eatery.
   While few choose to sue, many are casting off customary British
reserve to fight what they say is a growing lack of consideration
among modern diners. Some say American tourists are among the worst
offenders.
   But this in turn has caused divisions, with other restaurateurs
saying no-shows are an inescapable fact of life.
   The Restaurateurs Association of Great Britain, representing 500
dining spots mostly in London, is compiling a list of repeat
offenders for its members.
   ``Certain people have already come to light'' after six weeks of
collecting information, association Chairman Roy Ackerman said in
an interview.
   He denied it was a blacklist, saying the association lets the
restaurant decide whether it wants to refuse a booking or ask for a
deposit in advance.
   Ackerman acknowledges the tactic may scare away customers or be
dodged by using a false name. But he believes the mere existence of
the list may be a deterrent.
   ``We're there to serve people, so we don't want to put people
off booking or eating out,'' he says. ``But we're trying to ask for
courtesy in exchange for our hospitality.''
   The association took action because ``it seemed to be a practice
which was growing. We had complaints from a lot of our members,''
who suspect some people double- or triple-book.
   Blech estimates he loses $8,850 annually from no-shows and
places some blame on trans-Atlantic visitors.
   ``Judging by their accents, I have to say some of the worst
offenders are American tourists,'' he says. ``They come over, pick
your name out of a guide, shop late at Harrods and decide they're
too tired to go out to eat.''
   Ackerman, however, says ``people from all walks of life'' are
guilty, adding: ``Who's going to say anything about the Americans?
We need them.''
   He says the spread of the problem is ``a natural phenomenon
because more and more people are eating out ... Competition to get
a good table at a restaurant is that much more competitive.''
   Restaurateurs say customers don't realize that when they book a
table, they are entering into a contract _ a fact of British law
that won Blech his court case.
   No-shows also don't understand how much they can hurt a
restaurant. A 40-seat eatery may not break even on a night when a
table of four or six fails to show up, says Ackerman.
   The rival 15,000-member British Hotels, Restaurants and Caterers
Association also worries about the problem, but disagrees with
drawing up a list.
   ``We don't believe it's easy to operate,'' said Robin Lees,
chief executive of the association. ``The only way to make sure is
that when the contract is made ... (the owner) has sufficient
information to come back _ either in small claims court or on the
telephone _ to say look, we had a contract.''
   Others say even that sounds too strong.
   ``If you lose a table once every few days it doesn't matter so
much,'' says Aron Misan, the French owner of Keat's eatery. ``It's
part of the business.''
   He says he calls no-shows the next day, says ``You've been a
naughty boy,'' and then this ``chap has respect for you, you keep
friends ... the other way you make enemies.''

   Phosphorus inside a derailed tank car
reignited Thursday night as workers tried the right the car, and
authorities urged a second nighttime evacuation because of a
wind-blown, toxic cloud, officials said.
   ``The intensity of the smoke has diminished significantly. It's
not without its problems, but it now appears to be taking a better
direction,'' Don Armstrong, a spokesman for the state Department of
Disaster and Emergency Services, said late Thursday night.
   Phosphorus spilled from the ruptured tanker in Wednesday night's
34-car derailment, formed a cloud and then burst into flames in the
99-degree heat, burning for more than 12 hours.
   The toxic cloud forced residents in five western Kentucky
counties to evacuate, and about 50 familes living in the immediate
area were advised to stay away from their homes Thursday.
   The new cloud, 100 yards wide and 400 feet high, was moving
southeast toward the tiny community of Apex in northeast Christian
County, where officials warned residents but evacuations were
voluntary, Armstrong said.
   He said officials believe the fire will burn itself out, but,
``We're still cautioning people to stay upwind from the smoke.''
   Earlier Thursday, officials said the crew of the derailed
freight train might have avoided the accident had it seen a 10 mph
speed limit sign.
   The speed limit was posted because of a track problem. The train
was traveling 35 mph, Tim Hensley, a spokesman for CSX
Transportation Corp., said Thursday.
   ``This probably is a factor, but we are not saying that this is
a cause,'' Hensley said. ``And it has not been developed whether it
was human error on the part of the crew, or whether they were not
provided with the information with regards to that slow order.''
   Hensley said the safety order was issued because of a
one-block-long stretch of rough track, possibly caused by heat
extension of the rails.
   Hensley said the track was supposed to have been posted with a
warning sign one mile before the rough section, but the crew
reported that they didn't see it. The only sign they said they saw
was at the point of the rough track, he said. It was too late then
to avoid the derailment.
   Residents evacuated from the path of the toxic vapor began
returning to their homes Thursday. Officials asked about 50
families in the immediate vicinity of the derailment to stay out of
the area.
   The evacuations included towns in five counties with a combined
population of about 2,500. But Red Cross workers were unable to say
immediately how many people left their homes.
   No serious injuries were reported but several people were
treated for throat and lung irritations caused by the smoke, which
blanketed the rural area 80 miles northwest of Nashville, Tenn.
   Randy Looney and his wife, Tricia, were roused by firefighters,
scooped up their infant son and headed for a shelter set up at the
Crofton Elementary School.
   Their house trailer less than two miles from the derailment was
filled with acrid smoke, Looney said.
   ``It smelled like sulfur and burned your lungs,'' he said.
``When we went outside, you could hardly see anything.''
   The chemical burst into flames when the 34 cars derailed in a
steep ravine about two miles north of Crofton, a town of about 900
people.
   The Federal Aviation Administration restricted air traffic over
the site until about dawn Thursday and safety workers temporarily
sealed off roads in the vicinity.

<HEAD>Court Finds in Favor of Homosexual Groups at Arkansas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Arkansas violated the
constitutional rights of a homosexual group by denying it funds, a
federal appeals court has ruled.
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned a lower court ruling Wednesday and ordered appropriate
relief to the school's Gay and Lesbian Students Association (GSLA).
   The GSLA filed suit after the university's Student Senate, which
decides on funding for student organizations, denied the group's
request for funds because of the content of its message, a
violation of the First Amendment.
   ``In brief,'' the appeals court said, ``we hold that a public
body that chooses to fund speech or expression must do so
even-handedly, without discriminating among recipients on the basis
of their ideology.
   ``The university need not supply funds to student organizations,
but once having decided to do so, it is bound by the First
Amendment to act without regard to the content of the ideas being
expressed.
   ``This will mean ... that the taxpayers will occasionally be
obligated to support not only the thought of which they approve,
but also the thought that they hate. This is one of the fundamental
premises of American law.''
   The appeals court rejected the school's claims that the case was
moot and that it does not have the final say over the Student
Senate's funding decisions.
   In elaborating on it's decision, the appeals court said: ``True,
sodomy is illegal in Arkansas. However, the GLSA does not advocate
sodomy, and, even if it did, its speech about an illegal activity
would still be protected by the First Amendment. People may extol
the virtues of arson or even cannibalism. They simply may not
commit the acts.''

<HEAD>40th Anniversary Of Berlin Airlift, `Raisin Bomber' Remembers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 44-year-old airplane carrying Allied ambassadors
flew from Frankfurt to Berlin to highlight celebrations marking the
airlift that fed 2 million city residents during a Soviet blockade
40 years ago.
   Among the passengers Thursday was one of the Berlin Airlift's
original pilots, dubbed ``Raisin Bombers,'' who said that out of
fairness he droppped candy and raisins to children in both the
Communist and Western halves of the city.
   ``The Berlin Airlift changed this city, and it changed the
world,'' U.S. Ambassador Richard Burt said of the June
1948-September 1949 operation which delivered more than 1.8 million
tons of food and vital supplies to Berlin's Allied-controlled
western sectors.
   Accompanying Burt on Thursday on the DC-3, a civilian version of
the military C-47 transports used during the airlift, were British
Ambassador Sir Christopher Mallaby, French Ambassador Serge
Boidevaix and West German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz.
   Long-time Berlin resident Helga Galler, 60, was among the 400
people waiting for the landing at Berlin's Templehof airport. She
said she recalled well the shortages and feelings of hopelessness
created by the Soviet blockade.
   ``Everything was in short supply _ food, clothing, everything,''
Mrs. Galler said. ``So when we saw these planes coming, we knew we
didn't have to worry any longer.''
   ``I don't what we would have done without them,'' Mrs. Galler
said.
   At the end of World War II, Berlin was divided into Soviet,
U.S., British and French sectors. The city was surrounded by
Soviet-controlled territory that later became East Germany.
   Bitter disputes between the Kremlin and the United States,
Britain and France led to the Soviet move to cut all Berlin off
from the West.
   Specifically, Soviet leader Josef Stalin was staunchly against
the creation of a unified German state in the three Western
occupation zones, and when the Western allies backed a currency
reform to speed up Germany's economic recovery, Moscow imposed the
blockade.
   Retired Air Force Col. Gail Halvorsen, who accompanied the
ambassadors on the plane, was the first to begin dropping raisins
and candy to Berlin's children to sweeten the supplies they were
already receiving.
   Halvorsen, 67, said that once during the airlift days he
received a letter asking why no candy was dropped over Berlin's
eastern sector.
   ``So I flew over East Berlin after that and started dropping
candy there too,'' he said.
   But after one such run, Halvorsen said, ``an officer came up to
me and asked what I was doing. He told me the Russians had
complained that we were trying to influence the thinking of the
kids over there, so I had to stop it.'' Halvorsen, who was a
27-year-old U.S. Army Air Force lieutenant when he started flying
Berlin Airlift missions in July 1948, said he flew a total of 126
roundtrip missons from July 1948 to February 1949, taking off from
the U.S. Rhine Main base near Frankfurt.
   He later became commander of the U.S. Air Force at Tempelhof Air
Base from 1970 to 1974. He has since retired from the military and
makes his home in Provo, Utah.
   Halvorsen said he first had his crew throw out candy to children
waiting at Templehof Airport.
   ``There were only about 30 kids gathered at the airport'' on
that run, he said. But the idea spread like wildfire, and soon
there were thousands of children throughout the city waiting for
sweets to be tossed out of airlift planes, which were quickly
dubbed ``Raisin Bombers.''
   When the Soviets blocked off Allied access to the western
sectors of Berlin in 1948, they also cut delivery of electricity
and food from Berlin's communist-controlled eastern sector.
   In response, the Allies officially announced the Berlin Airlift
on June 26, 1948. By the time the airlift ended on Sept. 30, 1949,
more than 277,000 planeloads of food and supplies had been brought
to the former German capital.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan put in a plug for Vice
President George Bush during this week's economic summit, but
getting Bush elected as his successor apparently isn't the
president's top priority.
   In fact, it was 15th on a list of items on Reagan's agenda that
was put together by a Reagan aide.
   Reagan obviously hopes to witness the inauguration of the
Republican vice president as his successor next Jan. 20. But just
how much he will do in the Bush campaign remains a question mark.
   Reagan went out of his way during the Toronto summit to bring
Bush into the picture, lauding the vice president's role in the
fight against drugs during his concluding speech to members of the
Empire and Canadian clubs.
   ``Drugs have only once before been on our agenda'' at an
economic summit, he said. ``A North American dialogue between Prime
Minister (Brian) Mulroney and Vice President Bush put them there
this time.''
   ``Over breakfast in Washington in April, the prime minister and
the vice president exchanged thoughts on how our countries could
work together to fight the drug kingpins,'' Reagan said. ``One area
they discussed was appropriate for the talks at this summit _ how
to prevent the laundering of money across international borders.''
   ``Canada's strong support for the Bush initiative is reflected
in the historic commitment endorsed by the summit leaders in the
Toronto communique,'' he said. Canada agreed to stepped-up
cooperative efforts to stop drug money laundering.
   Later, as the president flew back to Washington on Air Force
One, reporters sent a note forward asking to speak with Kenneth
Duberstein, the deputy chief of staff who is taking over from
retiring chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. They said they wanted
to talk about the president's post-summit agenda.
   What they got in return was a note from White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater listing, in this order:
   _Strategic arms reduction talks.
   _A United Nations resolution enforcing a cease-fire in the
Persian Gulf.
   _Peace in Nicaragua.
   _Efforts to get a trade bill acceptable to the administration.
   _Welfare reform.
   _Signing of a bill providing catastrophic illness insurance.
   _A fair housing bill that the president supports.
   _Help for farmers hard-pressed by the drought.
   _Approval of the U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement.
   _Peace in the Middle East.
   _The work of the president's drug task force.
   _The budget and appropriations bills.
   _The investigation of Department of Defense procurement.
   _The Republican convention.
   Finally, in 15th place, came support for the Bush campaign. It
was followed on the list by official visits by leaders of Turkey
and Australia, a forthcoming trip to Miami and several other items.
   The impression was that the president would campaign for Bush
when he got the time, but that he's still president and has other
things to do.
   It's an impression that's been around for some time. After Bush
wrapped up the Republican nomination, Reagan delayed endorsing him
for several weeks and then gave an endorsement that was viewed as
so lackluster that the White House followed up with a formal
presidential statement to make clear that he was really for Bush.
   Behind the scenes, negotiations continue over what role the
president will play. An administration official familiar with the
discussions said decisions are expected to be made before the GOP
convention opens in New Orleans in mid-August.

<HEAD>House Ethics Committee Launches Investigation Of Swindall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee has launched a
preliminary investigation to determine if Georgia Rep. Pat Swindall
violated the law or House rules in pursuing a loan after being told
it likely would be financed by drug money he would be helping to
launder.
   After a closed-door meeting Thursday, the committee issued a
statement saying it had received evidence ``reasonably indicating''
that Swindall, a second-term Republican, may have violated laws or
acceptable standards in his negotiations for an $850,000 loan.
   Swindall, who represents a suburban Atlanta district, asked the
committee last week to review his actions in the negotiations last
fall for the loan he was seeking to finance construction of his
$1.2 million home in Stone Mountain, Ga.
   Swindall left Washington for Georgia on Thursday. Arriving at
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, he said he had asked for
and welcomed the investigation.
   ``Basically, I've turned it over to them,'' he said. ``If
anything unethical's been done, I want to know.''
   A preliminary inquiry is the first step in an ethics committee
investigation. If the panel finds reason to believe that the
alleged violation in fact occurred, it makes a formal statement of
the violation and can ultimately recommend disciplinary action
ranging from reprimand to expulsion.
   Swindall asked for the investigation one day after The Atlanta
Journal and The Atlanta Constitution reported details of the loan
negotiations that came from conversations secretly recorded during
a federal money laundering investigation.
   The taped conversations involved discussions between Swindall
and two other men _ Charles LeChansey, who later was indicted on
money laundering charges, and Michael Mullaney, an undercover
Internal Revenue Service agent posing as a money broker for
underworld figures.
   The newspaper said the tapes show that Swindall continued to
pursue the loan for several weeks after Mullaney had advised him
that it might be financed with illegal drug or gambling profits.
   Swindall at one point accepted a $150,000 check from LeChansey
but returned it uncashed several days later. The tapes show that he
broke off the negotiations after Mullaney told him he would have to
accept the loan proceeds in cash and sign a receipt for them.
   ``The only reason I can't do that is I would then be essentially
laundering y'all's money,'' Swindall told Mullaney, according to
the newspapers' account of the tapes. ``In other words, if Charles
(LeChasney) wants to launder y'all's money, fine, but I can't do
that, and to sign a receipt of cash would be to do that.''
   At a news conference last week, Swindall apologized for his role
in the negotiations, saying he was wrong and ashamed but would
continue to seek re-election.
   ``I was wrong to have ever considered such a proposal, to have
discussed it,'' he said. ``I was wrong not to have gone to
authorities before I did.''
   Swindall said, however, that he eventually ``made the right
decision'' in walking away from the deal and insisted that he ``did
not break the law nor do anything unethical.''
   Swindall is the only candidate in the Aug. 9 Republican primary
for his 4th District seat. Since qualifying for the primary has
ended, his name is the only one that can appear on the Republican
primary ballot under state law.
   Three Democrats are competing in their party's primary for the
right to challenge Swindall in the November general election.

<HEAD>Duplicate Records Could Reopen Thousands of Veterans' Disability
Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration is launching a
massive review of rejected disability claims following the
discovery of 10 million military medical records that duplicate
some lost in a 1973 fire.
   Veterans groups say thousands of veterans from World War II and
the Korean War could be affected by the discovery. They say the
newfound records would provide verification for claims denied
because there were no records to substantiate them.
   Thomas K. Turnage, the VA administrator, announced the discovery
on Thursday and called it a ``very important'' development.
   ``It opens up new vistas for us. It means that these people who
before had difficulty establishing a basis for their disability
compensation, or the degree of it ... it means we can have another
chance to look at it and, in effect, may come up with a different
result,'' Turnage said.
   The VA said that it would immediately begin going through the
new data and reviewing claims rejected because of lost records. The
agency urged veterans seeking information about their claims to
contact their VA regional offices.
   Turnage said the VA had become aware of the information last
week, and it was too early to say how many people would be
affected. He also did not have figures on how many claims were
denied because of lost records.
   Officials cautioned against overestimating the impact of the
discovery. R.J. Vogel, the VA's benefits director, said that most
veterans who made disability claims did so during their initial
years after service and would likely have filed claims before 1973.
   But John Sommer, director of the American Legion Veterans
Affairs and Rehabilitation Commission, whose office helps veterans
with their disability claims, said there was no doubt the
development could affect thousands.
   ``You'd be amazed at the number of people, World War II veterans
in particular, who waited until they retired to file a claim with
the VA, and then found the records had been destroyed,'' he said.
``Many of them felt they just didn't want to take anything from the
government. ... Then, as they aged, they decided to file a claim
and discovered their records had been burned.''
   Others likely to be affected include people with an injury or
disease suffered during active duty that became more pronounced
over the years, such as a back or heart ailments, officials said.
   Eighteen million military personnel records were destroyed or
seriously damaged in the July 12, 1973, fire at the National
Personnel Record Center in St. Louis. The lost records were from
the years 1912 through 1959 for Army personnel, and 1947 through
1963 for Air Force personnel with the surnames of Hubbard and
through the letter Z.
   The duplicate records cover the years 1942 to 1945 and 1950 to
1954, and so will primarily affect veterans of World War II and the
Korean War.
   The records were collected by the National Research Council, a
private research organization, during the 1950s as part of its
analysis of Army hospital records. A researcher at the council came
across the records and notified the National Archives, said Jill
Brett, an archives spokeswoman.
   Ms. Brett said that the records are on computer magnetic tapes
created by the council from hospital admissions punch cards
prepared by the office of the surgeon general. She said the
archives paid the council $8,662 for the tapes and will reformat
them for cross-referencing against other files.
   She said they were not listed by the military officer's name,
but included the officer's serial number, grade and rank, age, date
and place of admission as well as disease and diagnosis.
   Of the 10 million files, there were 3.5 million files for the
year 1944 alone, Turnage said, covering about 2.4 million people.
For 1945, 2 million files were discovered, covering about 1.4
million people. He said the agency still was trying to compile the
breakdown for the other years.

<HEAD>Parents of Teen-ager Shot by Rowan Upset by Decision Against
Assault Charge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a teen-ager who was shot by
syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan after taking an unauthorized dip
in the journalist's pool say their son may have shown immaturity,
but Rowan displayed even worse judgment by responding with a deadly
weapon.
   The U.S. attorney's office said Thursday that Rowan would not
face assault charges stemming from the June 14 incident, but it
deferred a decision on whether to bring weapons charges against the
columnist to District of Columbia authorities.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said in a prepared statement that
there was a ``substantial basis'' for charging Rowan, an avowed
gun-control advocate, with possession of an unregistered handgun.
   The court developments angered the parents of 18-year-old
Benjamin N. Smith of suburban Chevy Chase, Md., who has been
charged with unlawfully entering Rowan's northwest Washington
property.
   Neil Smith acknowledged that his son had committed an ``unlawful
act'' by entering Rowan's yard. But, he added: ``Was that act cause
for Mr. Rowan to shoot Ben and possibly kill him?''
   Dinah Smith said her son ``certainly showed immaturity, but Mr.
Rowan's judgment is appalling.''
   The younger Smith, who was wounded in the right wrist by a
bullet from Rowan's unregistered .22-caliber revolver, may not
recover full use of his hand, his father said.
   The columnist has made no attempt to contact her family or
apologize for the incident, Mrs. Smith added.
   R. Stan Mortenson, a lawyer for 19-year-old Laura Bachman of
Bethesda, Md., arrested along with Smith at Rowan's residence, said
Ms. Bachman ``deeply regrets that the events of June 14th ever
occurred.''
   Mortenson, whose client also faces a charge of unlawful entry,
called the government's case ``unjustified and highly unusual.''
   Smith and Ms. Bachman pleaded innocent to the misdemeanor charge
Thursday before a District of Columbia Superior Court hearing
commissioner. Trial was scheduled for Aug. 18.
   Rowan, who has been ridiculed by pro-gun groups as hypocritical
for advocating handgun bans while keeping one himself, refused to
discuss the latest developments.
   ``I am not saying one word about that decision,'' he said when
called at his home. ``I think I've been very generous in talking to
the media, and I've said all I'm going to say.''
   Rowan has told authorities that his son, Carl Jr., a former FBI
agent, gave him the gun after he received several threats. He said
his son had been told by city officials he did not need to register
the weapon after leaving the FBI.
   The district's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance says that all
weapons must be registered. Possession of an unregistered handgun
or ammunition carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a
$1,000 fine.
   Rowan has defended his use of the weapon, saying he thought his
life was in danger. He said he called police after hearing noises
in his backyard, investigating and finding four people in his pool.
   The columnist said he fired at Smith after the young man lunged
at him. Smith disputes that, saying he did nothing to threaten
Rowan and was trying to flee when he was shot.
   Smith and Ms. Bachman face a maximum penalty of six months in
jail and a $400 fine if convicted. The two had been charged with
illegal entry shortly after the incident, but those charges were
withdrawn within hours pending an investigation. The charges were
reinstated Thursday.
   Stephens said his office found insufficient evidence to warrant
an assault charge against the 62-year-old Rowan but believed he
should be charged with possession of an unregistered firearm.
   The city government traditionally handles weapons charges, and
Claude Bailey, a spokesman for the District of Columbia Corporation
Counsel, said officials would decide within a few days whether to
prosecute Rowan.

<HEAD>House Vote on Fair Housing Bill Could Come Next Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is close to approval of legislation
to strengthen enforcement of the nation's fair housing law after
defeating a proposal to eliminate the ban on discrimination against
families with children.
   Final approval in the House should come sometime next week,
although no specific time has been set because leaders want to
complete action on remaining appropriation bills before the end of
the month.
   ``Fair housing is a top priority item,'' said House Majority
Whip Tony Coehlo, D-Calif., on Thursday before the House recessed
so members could attend the funeral of Rep. John J. Duncan,
R-Tenn., in Knoxville.
   The Senate is expected to act quickly after the House vote, thus
sending the measure to the White House before the end of the summer.
   Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, said, ``This legislation to finally make fair
housing a reality for so many Americans is another significant step
forward for our nation in eliminating discrimination and providing
equal opportunity for all in one of our most basic human needs _
housing.''
   The bill would give the Department of Housing and Urban
Development the power to bring actions on behalf of individual
victims of discrimination, would ban discrimination against the
disabled and forbid limitations on renting to families with
children, except in clearly defined retirement communities.
   The House eliminated the last controversial amendment on
Thursday, when members voted 289-116 to defeat a proposal by Rep.
E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., that would have eliminated the provisions
protecting families with children under age 18 from housing
discrimination.
   Shaw said that the bill's language was confusing, unenforceable
and would ``wipe out every senior citizen community in this
country.'' Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chief sponsor, argued that
the provision had been drafted in consultation with groups
representing senior citizens and had received their full support.
   Since enactment of the first federal law to ban discrimination
in the sale and rental of housing in 1968, the homebuilding and
sales industries have staved off repeated efforts to toughen
enforcement rules. The recurring battles have embittered civil
rights advocates and denied millions of families equal access to
decent housing.
   However, a crucial compromise was reached late last week and
announced on Tuesday that set the stage for quick passage of the
bill.
   Originally, the bill would have created a system of
administrative law judges who would hear cases against alleged
housing violators when conciliation failed. The judges could award
actual damages to a plaintiff and impose fines. Any ruling could be
appealed to the federal court.
   The Reagan administration and the National Association of
Realtors opposed the bill because they believed that administrative
law judges would create constitutional problems. They argued that
an accused party could be forced to pay fines and damages without a
jury trial, in violation of the Constitution's Seventh Amendment.
   Under the compromise, however, either the plaintiff or the
defendant can elect to go to federal court first, thus satisfying
the objections of the administration and the Realtors.

<HEAD>Reagan Sticks with Generalities in Assuring Australia on Farm
Trade</HEAD>

   President Reagan says the United States will
try to keep Australia from being caught in a crossfire over farm
subsidies, but he is not offering any new steps to deal with
Australian concerns.
   Reagan met with Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke on Thursday
and said afterward, ``We're in full agreement on the need to open
up international trade in agricultural products, a keystone of both
our economies.''
   ``We also agree on the need to redouble our efforts toward the
elimination of trade-distorting government subsidies of
agricultural products,'' the president said in a departure ceremony
in the White House East Room.
   ``Until we achieve that goal,'' he added, ``we will assure that
any measures the United States may take to counter unfair
subsidization of agriculture will take fully into account the
interests of countries like Australia.''
   Gaston Sigur, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, when asked how this pledge would be carried out,
said, ``Well, he didn't make any very specific commitments as such.
This is the same commitment that he made to the prime minister in
1986. It's a continuation of this.''
   At issue is a U.S. policy of entering markets that have been
invaded by subsidized countries. Australia contends that this
damages its farmers because Australia also exports to the same
countries.
   Hawke, in a speech to a joint meeting of Congress earlier in the
day, said Australia's farmers are finding themselves ``squeezed out
of markets by practices which distort prices and levels of
production.''
   ``In agriculture we find ourselves caught in the crossfire of a
destructive and counterproductive trans-Atlantic subsidies war,''
the Australian leader said.
   Reagan advocates an end to agricultural subsidies by the year
2000, but gained little support for his proposal from European
powers in the seven-nation economic summit that ended Tuesday in
Toronto.

   Jesse Jackson stepped back from credentials
fights at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but he is
pressing forward with demands for new party rules for 1992, demands
that could trigger a floor fight in Atlanta.
   The atmosphere at Thursday's credentials committee meeting was
peaceful and united _ with aides to Jackson and Dukakis exchanging
compliments as the temporary roll of delegates to the July
convention was agreed to without dissent.
   But the rules committee meetings this weekend may be quite
different.
   ``There is still some disagreement with party rules, state and
national,'' former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya said Thursday.
``Rev. Jackson has determined the proper place to take those
disagreements is the rules committee.''
   ``He wants the convention to make the changes for next time,''
said Ann Lewis, a top Jackson adviser. ``He doesn't want it just
referred to another commission.''
   The two campaigns have been working late into the night this
week to settle as many of the issues as possible, and Dukakis aide
Tad Devine said the negotiations are continuing on the
delegate-selection rules.
   Jackson has the strength to force a floor fight at the
convention in Atlanta July 18-21, but he does not have enough votes
on the rules committee to win without the agreement or at least the
acquiescence of Dukakis.
   But Devine said no agreements had been written in stone by
Thursday on the rules, in contrast to the quiet resolution of
dispute after dispute about credentials.
   The credentials committee approved resolutions settling all of
the delegate challenges and putting the stamp of approval on
delegates who had not been challenged.
   The only outstanding delegate disputes between the campaigns are
in Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico. Private talks to settle those
arguments _ which were never filed as challenges _ are progressing,
both campaigns said.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk was pleased
with the results, saying it is the first time in history that the
party will convene without delegate challenges.
   Looking to the future, Jackson is seeking specific changes in
the rules that govern primaries and caucuses.
   Lewis said Jackson's focus is on changes that will make a
state's delegation to the convention more closely reflect the
popular vote among the state's Democrats, as evidenced in a primary
or caucus.
   For most of the proposed changes, there are powerful forces in
the party who object to such revisions _ such as DNC members who
could lose their automatic seats at the convention.
   In specific, Jackson is seeking to ban direct-election primaries
and bonus-delegate systems and wants some changes in the super
delegates.
   In direct-election primaries, delegates are elected
individually, not in proportion to the overall popular vote in a
district or state. This tends to favor the leading candidate or the
candidate with the most support from well-recognized political
figures who run for delegate slots.
   In bonus-delegate states, the winning candidate in each
congressional district wins one more delegate that he would under a
strictly proportional system.
   Jackson is also unhappy with having more than 600 unpledged
super delegates at the convention whose votes do not have to follow
the primary returns. These include governors, state chairmen,
members of Congress and DNC members.
   He also wants the 1988 convention to make these rules decisions
for 1992 and not leave it to a party commission meeting between
conventions. Jackson has said the party commission that wrote the
1988 rules ignored its instructions from the 1984 convention _
instructions written at his urging.

   The Pentagon's chief spokesman says it has
never tried to disguise the amount of money it spends on
consultants, particularly since a lot of the work they perform is
demanded by Congress.
   Dan Howard, in a lengthy rebuttal Thursday to complaints by Sen.
David H. Pryor, D-Ark., said the Pentagon will spend $3.87 billion
on all types of consulting services during the current fiscal year.
   Pryor, the chairman of a Senate Governmental Affairs
subcommittee that has been investigating the government's use of
private consultants, accused the Pentagon on Tuesday of keeping a
``shadow government under wraps.''
   Citing a General Accounting Office review, the senator said the
Pentagon claimed it spent only $155 million on outside consultants
in fiscal 1987 when in reality it had spent $2.8 billion.
   Howard used his regular Pentagon briefing on Thursday to counter
the assertions, saying Pryor's figures were wrong. He said the $155
million figure came not from the Defense Department, but from a GAO
information-gathering system that Howard said demonstrates the
maxim ``garbage in, garbage out.''
   Of the total the Pentagon will spend this year, the spokesman
continued, $254 million will go for ``studies, analyses and
evaluation.''
   ``One of the things it includes is a number of studies mandated
by the Congress. Since 1970, the number of annual studies required
of the Department of Defense by the Congress has increased 1,900
percent. It has gone from 36 reports in 1970 to 719 reports this
year,'' Howard said.
   ``Were it not for the contracting of these reports (to
consultants), we estimate that it would have required ... an
additional 29,000 DoD employees to do the reports.''
   Howard said the Pentagon this fiscal year will spend $11.4
million on individual experts and consultants; $970 million on
``management support'' studies such as developing a computer model
to predict future aircraft costs; $379.7 million on engineering and
technical support to teach military personnel how to operate and
repair new weapon systems, and $583.8 million on ``information
technology,'' meaning the maintenance and acquisition of computer
data bases.
   ``All told, that is $2.199 billion in the fiscal 1988 budget,''
the spokesman said.
   In addition to those programs, the Pentagon will spend $943
million on outside systems engineering contracts, he continued.
   ``Systems engineering people are those who, for example, when
you install a new complex system in an aircraft, an existing
aircraft, ensure that the systems all fit together; that they all
work together,'' he said.
   A final category totals $725 million and involves federal
funding for certain key research and development centers that
perform dozens of military studies every year, such as the Rand
Corp. and the Institute for Defense Analysis, Howard said.
   ``So if you combine the two categories _ the contracted advisory
and assistance services at $2.199 billion, and these other contract
services, you get a grand total of $3.87 billion.''

   House tax-writers trying to avoid an
election-year hassle with farmers are ready to repeal a new law
requiring off-the-road business users of diesel fuel to pay the
federal tax and then apply for a refund.
   The House Ways and Means Committee agreed Thursday to add the
repeal amendment to a package of miscellaneous tax provisions and
to authorize refunds with interest for any tax-exempt diesel users
who have paid the tax since April 1.
   The Senate Finance Committee has agreed to repeal the diesel
provisions retroactive to April 1, when they went into effect.
   The House panel also approved tax relief for up to 20 million
owners of shares in mutual funds and agreed to extend expiring tax
credits for research and development and for employers who hire the
poor, and a tax exemption for mortgage bonds that benefit
low-income first-time home buyers.
   Aides said the committee, meeting behind closed doors, had no
problem approving tax relief for farmers, contractors, barge
operators and others who use diesel for off-the-road business
purposes. Farmers especially have complained loudly that the new
law, enacted last December, drains their cash flow and increases
their paperwork burden.
   The new law, aimed at tax cheats, requires that such diesel
users, even though they are exempt from the tax of 15.1 cents a
gallon, py it and then apply for a refund the following year when
they file their tax returns. The vote Thursday would repeal that
requirement so long as a user can show evidence of tax-exempt use.
   The House committee added the repeal provision to a bill whose
main purpose is to correct errors in the 1986 tax overhaul. Aides
said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the committee chairman, hopes
to complete work on the bill next week.
   Before the bill is finished, the panel will have to find ways to
pay for the special tax reductions. Rostenkowski has proposed a
package that would place most of the burden on defense contractors,
owners of single-premium life insurance and corporations that hold
sizable shares in other corporations.
   Aides said it is likely that members of the committee will
propose relief for other beneficiaries. Because of budget
restrictions, any such tax cut that is adopted will have to be paid
for by a tax increase on some other group.
   The committee spent much of Thursday's session arguing about
Rostenkowski's proposal to tighten slightly and extend the
mortgage-bond tax exemption, which is due to expire Dec. 31. The
Reagan administration opposes any extension.
   In addition, the General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress,
contends the bonds open the door to home ownership to very few
people who could not afford to buy otherwise. Also, GAO said in a
report last March, ``home buyers, on average, receive only about 36
to 39 cents in benefits for every dollar in tax revenue forgone.''
   Extending the mortgage-bond exemption would cost about $165
million through 1991.
   The panel also voted to:
   _Extend through 1990 the credit for increased spending for
research and development. Lawmakers view the credit as a big plus
in the effort to make U.S. businesses more competitive abroad. To
offset part of the cost, the business deduction now allowed for
research expenses would be reduced by the amount of the credit. The
two provisions would mean a revenue loss of $1.05 billion through
1991.
   _Permanently permit owners of mutual-fund shares to fully deduct
certain investment expenses of the funds, thus granting them tax
relief of about $1 billion through 1991. Without the change, many
shareholders would be unable to write off those expenses because of
the new restriction that allows deduction only of miscellaneous
expenses that exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income.
   _Extend through 1990 the targeted-jobs tax credits, under which
the government in effect pays up to $2,400 of the first-year wages
of workers considered economically disadvantaged. The credit, due
to expire Dec. 31, would cost about $315 million through 1991.

<HEAD>Phone Problems Put Congress on Hold; Was AT&T `The Right Choice?'</HEAD>

   Frustrated House members are calling a new $16
million telephone system ``a failure'' after its third outage in as
many days, and some are beginning to wonder whether selecting AT&T
was ``the right choice.''
   The House of Representatives system was out of order for more
than two hours on Thursday, bringing howls from members unable to
communicate with constituents or with their home district offices.
   The outage also forced House leaders to resort to hand signals
to communicate with their floor organizers.
   ``It's like returning to the 19th century,'' said one leadership
aide.
   One lawmaker, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., went to the floor and
held up two styrofoam coffee cups linked by a piece of wire.
   ``If I get the contract for $10 million or so to install this in
the House of Representatives, I promise that it will work just as
well as the phone system we have here now,'' he said.
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. flew in top management and
technical executives from around the country in an attempt to
ferret out the mystery bug in the balky computer switching system.
   The system, called System 85, controls some 17,000 telephones in
three House office buildings, two annexes and the House side of the
Capitol. It was installed last August after AT&T won in a
competitive bidding process held by the House Administration
Committee.
   The problems began last week, when the system shut down for
nearly an hour. Substantial outages have occurred at least three
times since then, and Thursday's was the longest yet.
   AT&T officials met with the chairman of the panel's office
systems subcommittee, Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C., late Thursday.
Rose later went to the House floor to implore members ``to be as
indulgent and patient as they can'' and promised that if the system
isn't working by the July Fourth weekend, ``the whole blooming
thing will be replaced.''
   Ray Colley, the deputy House clerk, said the system is one of
the largest in the country and the problems are atypical. ``It's a
flukey sort of thing,'' he said. ``We're losing a lot of calls,
obviously. ... Believe me, we have total attention from AT&T.''
   Technicians suspected a computer software problem, perhaps
exacerbated by an unusually high volume of calls coming through the
system. But they were examining everything, including the
possibility of computer hackers tampering with the system from
outside, Colley said.
   Congressional offices reported everything from totally dead
telephones to intermittent service on some lines. In some offices,
all the phones suddenly rang at once.
   Kolbe said the communications glitch reminded him of the AT&T
television commercials showing distraught employees bemoaning their
choice of a competing phone system and discussing how their
businesses had been ruined. The commercials end by proclaiming AT&T
``the right choice.''
   ``Well, in the interest of ... truth in advertising, I think we
ought to admit that the same source of that advertising is the one
that has the telephone system here in the House,'' Kolbe said.
   ``I don't know what motivated this installation of the new
system, but it's certainly proven to be a failure,'' complained
Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C. If Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of
the telephone, had been around the House the past two weeks, he
``would have been most depressed and despondent, to say nothing of
being embarrassed,'' Jones said.
   Herb Linnen, an AT&T spokesman, said the company was trying to
replicate the House calling patterns in its Denver laboratories to
help isolate the problem, but had been unable so far to do so.
   ``We are totally empathetic'' with the frustration of lawmakers,
Linnen said. ``We are frustrated. We have a commitment to get the
... problem fixed as quickly as possible,'' he said.

<HEAD>Studies Show Lost Hearing Is Regained Among Birds, May Help Humans

   Scientists studying the inner ears of birds
have found a clue that could lead to the possible development of a
therapy to restore hearing to people who have a deafness caused by
exposure to loud noises.
   In articles published today in Science, two groups of
researchers report that both adult quails and young chickens are
able to regrow cells in the inner ear after their hearing has been
damaged by acoustic trauma.
   The studies suggest that there may be a hormone or protein
secreted by damaged sensory cells in the ear could cause the growth
of new, replacement cells.
   Edward W. Rubel of the University of Washington, co-author of a
study using adult quails, said the finding is ``truly new'' and
could eventually be important to some of the 22 million Americans,
among them President Reagan, who suffer from hearing loss.
   ``We have not found a cure for deafness, but we have found
something in the ear of birds that we haven't thought possible,''
Rubel said.
   Douglas A. Cotanche, an assistant professor at the Boston
University School of Medicine and co-author of a study using young
chickens, said researchers are not yet able to show that the
regrowth of the cells critical to hearing also occurs in mammals or
humans.
   But Cotanche said the findings do offer a theoretical
possibility of one day correcting a type of deafness in humans.
   Both of the bird studies centered on an inner ear organ called
the cochlea, a key part of the hearing process. The researchers
discovered that when sensory cells within the bird cochlea are
destroyed by loud noise, some chemical process causes the growth of
new sensory cells, apparently restoring a key link in the hearing
process.
   In the hearing process, sound waves cause the ear drum to
vibrate. This vibration is transmitted through bony parts of the
middle ear to the inner ear where it creates a pressure wave in the
fluid-filled cochlea. Microscopic hairs lining the cochlea act as
sensors to detect this pressure wave and cause nerve signals to be
sent to the brain, which interprets the signals as sound.
   Intense levels of noise can cause the cochlea hair cells to be
killed, thus lowering the hearing acuity. If enough hair cells are
lost, deafness can result.
   Some people, such as Reagan, can compensate for the hearing loss
by wearing an electronic aid that amplifies sound.
   Reagan's hearing problems began early in his movie career. When
he was co-starring in a crime story film, a pistol was fired just
inches from his ear. He later said that the acoustic trauma was so
great that he almost collapsed. The injury severely damaged the
hearing in one ear, but Reagan's doctor said he wears two aids, as
do many people, to achieve a hearing balance.
   Even hearing aids, however, are ineffective if enough of the
hair cells have been killed.
   ``These are the most important cells for hearing and cells that
we can't replace surgically,'' Rubel said.
   But the findings in the studies on quails and chickens raise the
possibility of finding a way to cause the body to stimulate
regrowth of these hearing cells.
   ``If we can find the protein or the genes that get turned on to
do this (cause hair cell regrowth in birds) then we may be able to
artificially stimulate them in a mammal, but that's still far down
the road,'' Cotanche said.
   For their independent studies, both Rubel and Cotanche injected
two groups of laboratory birds with a tracer chemical that marks
genetic and cellular activity. One group of birds in each study was
then subjected to traumatic levels of sound. Control groups of
birds were not exposed to the noise.
   Later the birds were killed and their hearing organs analyzed.
The scientists, by checking for the presence of the tracer
chemical, were able to show that the traumatic sound caused the
spontaneous growth of replacement hairs cells in the cochleae of
the birds subjected to the noise. Birds in the control groups
showed no such new cell growth.
   Cotanche was co-author on the chicken study with Jeffrey T.
Corwin of the University of Hawaii. Rubel's co-author in his study
was Brenda M. Ryals of the Veterans Administration Medical Center
in Richmond, Va.

<HEAD>Greenhouse Effect Will Bring More Droughts, Hot Weather,
Scientists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midwesterners and Southerners can expect heat
waves and droughts more often because the long-dreaded ``greenhouse
effect'' warming of the Earth has begun, but the current dry, hot
weather can't be specifically tied to the global warming,
scientists told Congress.
   Instead, the weather troubles now affecting much of the United
States could be the result of normal climate fluctuations, several
scientists told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
on Thursday.
   ``It is not possible to blame a specific heat wave-drought on
the greenhouse effect,'' said James Hansen, climatalogist at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute
for Space Studies in New York City.
   However, Hansen and other scientists said the current hot, dry
weather is an example of things to come.
   The four globally warmest years on record have all fallen in the
current decade, and 1988 is practically certain to break all
records at close to nine-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit warmer than
normal, defined as the 1951-1980 average.
   Many scientists have said that they believe the long-predicted
greenhouse effect has begun. In the most definite statement yet,
Hansen said it has.
   ``Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe
with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship
between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming,'' he said.
   He said there is only a 1 percent chance that he is wrong in
blaming rising temperatures around the world on the buildup of
man-made gases in the atmosphere.
   Syukuro Manabe, soil specialist at the Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, said the current drought ``is an example of the
kind of drought that will occur more frequently as the global
warming becomes larger.''
   Computer models predict more frequent droughts in the American
Midwest and Southeast, and the latest models predict a best-guess
estimate of an increase in global average temperature of about 0.54
degrees Fahrenheit each decade into the middle of the next century.
   Temperature increases in high latitudes could be more than
double that. This could mean growing cotton in Siberia and oranges
in British Columbia. Tropical temperatures would hardly change,
although precipitation would increase at high and low latitudes.
   The warmer weather would also mean a rise in sea level of about
a foot, which has been about the increase on the U.S. Atlantic
Coast over the past century, a period in which the average
temperature worldwide rose about nine-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit.
   Hansen earlier had published predictions of what this would mean
for several cities in terms of the typical number of days each year
with temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit: Washington, 12
instead of one; Dallas, 78 instead of 19; Memphis, Tenn., 42
instead of four; Chicago, six instead of none.
   It reached 101 degrees in Washington on Wednesday.
   The greenhouse effect is the result of gases emitted by modern
civilization reducing the heat normally radiated by the globe into
space, just as the glass in a greenhouse raises the temperature
inside.
   Several gases contribute, and last year's treaty calling for a
halving of chlorofluorocarbon emissions should reduce future
warmings by 10 percent. But half the effect is the result of carbon
dioxide formed in the burning of fossil fuels, like coal.
   The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by
10 percent since 1958 and 25 percent since about 1790, roughly when
coal-fired steam engines set off the industrial revolution in
England. Currently, 3 billion tons of carbon are added to the
atmosphere every year.
   Reducing emissions by 3 billion tons or 50 percent to 60 percent
of current levels ``could stabilize the content of the
atmosphere,'' said George M. Woodwell, director of the Woods Hole
Research Center in Massachusetts. ``It is well within reach, no
question about that.''
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., concerned about his state's coal
industry, asked physical chemist William R. Moomaw of the World
Resources Institute, a Washington-based policy research
organization, if technology could reduce the harmful emissions.
   Moomaw replied, ``I would argue the resource we have in most
abundance is the potential for using fossil fuels more efficiently
at much lower cost than building any form of power generation.''

<HEAD>Koop Calls For More Emphasis on Preventing All Diseases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, stepping
beyond his role as a chieftain in the fight against AIDS and
smoking, says the nation should lend additional emphasis to
prevention of all diseases.
   ``It is a strange paradox in our health system,'' Koop told a
congressional panel Thursday. ``We recognize that the promotion of
good health and the prevention of disease is the way to go. We
recognize that it is every effective and we recognize that it is
very cheap.
   ``But we tend not to pay for it.''
   Appearing before the health subcommittee of the Joint Economic
Committee, Koop said there are three ``overarching issues'' dealing
with the long-range future of health care in America:
   _The evolving relationship between technology and health care.
   _The emerging changes in the way the public relates to organized
medicine.
   _The potential changes in how society's values may hamper the
historic financial support for a broad-based health care system.
   He said that Americans are ``preoccupied with health'' and drawn
to glamorous high-tech solutions.
   ``The things such as prevention of disease, promotion of health,
good counseling ... are very effective, very cheap, but have no
glamour whatsoever. I think we have to face the fact that you can
have glamour as long as it is cheap, but when glamour gets as
expensive as it is, you have to sort of trim your sails.''
   On the second point, he said the new mobility of American
society makes it much less likely ``the average patient will be
known and served by the same physician and same hospital staff for
a lifetime.''
   He said that an estimated 15 million Americans have turned to
self-help because they have lost a sense of personal contact with
doctors and other health professionals.
   ``My only concern _ and it's a major concern _ is that some
people who need the help of experts with medical training aren't
getting it or are avoiding it and their health and possibly their
lives may be in peril as a consequence,'' he said.
   A third major concern, he said, is that the public might seek
retribution in the future against people with certain illnesses
that may be associated with lifestyle.
   He said the American people are generous in supporting, through
taxes and personal donations, the goal of good health for everyone
in society.
   ``But they can also become impatient,'' he said. ``For example,
most Americans disapprove of smoking and would like to see all
smokers stop. ... Hence, the non-smoking public is asking for new
and stronger state and local laws to curb cigarette smoking in the
work place and in all public governmental and commercial
buildings.''
   Calling this an example of ``public retribution directed against
smokers,'' Koop cautioned that such movements should be kept in
perspective.
   He expressed concern that such trends toward retribution could
result in a backlash against health care spending on people with
illnesses that probably could have been prevented with healthier
lifestyles.

   A diverse group of business, political and
religious leaders will gather in Williamsburg, Va., this weekend to
celebrate freedom of religion _ a right guaranteed by the
Constitution that they feel has come on rough times.
   The leaders, representing Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, Mormons,
Christian Scientists as well as secular institutions, will meet in
the Colonial Capitol at Williamsburg. That is where Thomas
Jefferson, James Madison and others first agreed in 1776 that all
citizens should have the right to freely exercise their religious
beliefs.
   Then, in ceremonies on Saturday morning, the leaders will sign a
charter that reasserts religious freedom and offers some guidelines
for what the leaders hope will be more constructive debate on
religious issues. Organizers from the Williamsburg Charter
Foundation are expecting about 100 people to put their names on the
charter.
   The Rev. Billy Graham will deliver the main address following
the charter signing. Others scheduled to make remarks over the
weekend are Camelia Sadat, daughter of the late Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat; Makaziew Mandela, daughter of South African black
leader Nelson Mandela; Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; and
George Gallup Jr. of the polling firm.
   ``There is no pretense that these people believe the same thing,
whether in politics or religion,'' said Robert Kramer, a spokesman
for the foundation. ``They are coming together merely to say that
we all should take a moment to step back from our antagonisms.
   ``We're not saying that we have to find some common religion,
that we have to paper over our differences,'' Kramer continued.
``We are saying that there has to be some common notion of
responsibility and respect for others. You may think the other
person's beliefs are foolish, but you still have to respect that
person's right to hold them.''
   That, in essence, is the message of the charter, which has been
undergoing repeated changes in the past two years.
   The version of the charter that will be signed this weekend
acknowledges ``continuing differences'' but warns that ``religious
liberty can never be taken for granted.'' It also says, ``If
religious liberty is neglected, all civil liberties will suffer.''
   ``We're not so much looking for a middle ground as for some
basis for co-existence, so that one group does not fear that the
expansion of rights to others means fewer rights for themselves,''
Kramer said.
   Os Guinness, executive director of the foundation, said it has
taken two years to overcome the suspicions of many of the religious
and other leaders who will sign the charter. They either feared the
foundation was promoting some religion or working against religion,
Guinness said.
   The foundation, which goes out of business at the end of the
year, is doing neither, he said.
   ``This charter is clear from the beginning that it's an
agreement on how to disagree. We are not offering specifics,''
Guinness said. ``We are trying to offer a way of answering the
question: How do we live with each other's differences?''
   During the weekend, Colonial Williamsburg will offer its usual
tours of historic buildings, but the guides will focus their
discussions on religious liberty. Folk singers Peter, Paul and Mary
will perform on Saturday and a top U.S. Postal official is expected
to present the first issue of a commemorative stamp honoring the
bicentennial of Virginia's ratification of the Constitution. The
events will be topped off Saturday night with a musical program and
fireworks.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' move to help
balance his state budget with $115 million in new taxes immediately
spilled over into the presidential campaign, with the campaign of
Republican George Bush pouncing on the plan.
   In addition to announcing his support of tax measures, Dukakis
faced a barrage of questions Thursday about an FBI investigation of
the siting of a Massachusetts prison and the indictment of his
former top education adviser for alleged corruption.
   Dukakis was heading to the island of Nantucket today for a
four-day vacation.
   Before traveling to Washington for a unity dinner Thursday
night, Dukakis signed a $40 million state cigarette tax and said he
supported raising another $75 million by bringing the Massachusetts
tax code in line with federal tax changes.
   He downplayed the political ramifications, saying his immediate
concern was to ``make sure that the state's fiscal base is solid
and strong.''
   But the Bush camp immediately labeled Dukakis a tax-raiser.
   ``It's obvious that his reaction is to tax,'' said Bush
spokeswoman Sheila Tate. ``Instead of cutting (spending), he raised
taxes. It seems to speak for itself.''
   Dukakis disagreed.
   ``I think the people of this state and the people of this
country can recognize when someone is talking about fiscal
responsibility and someone who is doing it,'' Dukakis told a
Statehouse news conference.
   ``Gov. Dukakis has balanced nine budgets and is about to balance
a 10th, which stands in stark contrast to eight years of a
Reagan-Bush administration that has left us with more red ink than
all the previous administrations combined,'' the Dukakis campaign
said in response to Tate's remarks.
   The Massachusetts Constitution requires the governor to balance
the budget although Dukakis has twice inherited deficits.
   Dukakis had to decide by today whether to sign the legislation
authorizing the 5 percent sales tax on cigarettes and other tobacco
products. The tax is effective in 90 days.
   House-passed legislation to raise about $75 million by
conforming state tax codes with federal tax laws, which is awaiting
approval in the Senate, would affect about 15 percent of the
state's 4 million taxpayers. The ``coupling'' tightens exemptions
for tax shelters and business expenses and would affect mainly the
wealthy.
   Dukakis also wants to raise about $16 million by closing a
corporate tax loophole. Because revenues have not met projections,
he now favors an $11.8 billion spending plan, some $200 million
less than his original proposal.
   Dukakis has said he would raise federal taxes only as a last
resort, seeking first to reduce the deficit by trimming spending,
cutting inflation rates through economic growth and collecting
unpaid taxes.
   The long-awaited word on Dukakis's position on the tax proposals
came the same day the FBI said it was conducting a preliminary
inquiry into plans to build a medium-security prison in rural New
Braintree.
   The agency said it was reviewing whether there were possible
violations of the Hobbs Act, a federal anti-racketeering statute.
Dukakis is not currently a subject of the investigation, the FBI
said.
   Opponents of the proposed prison contend the owner of the land
purchased it after receiving inside information that it was being
eyed by the state.
   ``The process was as open as it could possibly be,'' Dukakis
said. ``We have very tough procedures for the acquisition of
property.''
   Also Thursday, former Dukakis education adviser Gerard T.
Indelicato was accused of larceny and forgery related to his state
duties. Indelicato previously pleaded guilty to separate federal
charges of fraud and conspiracy.
   ``The criminal charges against Gerard Indelicato are very
serious, more so because they allege a violation of the public
trust,'' Dukakis said. ``I expect every public official who works
for the commonwealth to meet the highest standards of integrity.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Reverses Policy On `Meese is a Pig' T-shirts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a sudden reversal of policy, the Justice
Department says people who wear T-shirts proclaiming ``Meese is a
Pig'' will now be allowed into the building.
   A bicycle messenger wearing one of the shirts was not permitted
to make a delivery on the premises earlier this month because he
was ``inappropriately attired,'' department spokesman Patrick S.
Korten said. As of the start of business Thursday, that policy
stood.
   But Korten said later in the day that the policy had been
reversed.
   ``The matter was raised with the attorney general this morning.
And he said from here on out our policy will be that if they want
to enter the building wearing that sort of T-shirt, they may,''
Korten told The Washington Post.
   Christopher Stalvey, who said he was turned away from department
offices June 10, visited the American Civil Liberties Union this
week to tell legal director Arthur B. Spitzer about the encounter.
   Spitzer said the ACLU was prepared to bring suit if the policy
remained in effect. ``It seems like a perfectly clear case of
discrimination based on the content of the T-shirt,'' Spitzer told
The Associated Press.
   The Justice Department ``obviously doesn't understand what the
First Amendment is all about,'' Spitzer said before the policy
change. ``If they had a rule that said no T-shirts, that might be
an acceptable rule. But apparently they have a rule that says no
T-shirts that insult Ed Meese. Presumably, this guy would have been
allowed in if he was wearing a T-shirt that said `Reagan-Bush
'84'.''
   Told later about the change of policy, Spitzer said, ``That's
great.''

<HEAD>Tracing Sexual Contacts Of AIDS-Infected People Worthwhile, Study
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tracing the sexual contacts of people infected
with the AIDS virus can be a tricky but cost-effective way to slow
the spread of the disease as long as health workers don't disclose
names, say authors of a new study.
   ``We tried very hard to develop a positive, empathetic and
compassionate relationship with the people we worked with,'' said
Dr. Randolph E. Wykoff, co-author of a study that found
contact-tracing to be worthwhile, contrary to the predictions of
many health officials.
   ``I could see very clearly where this would have been a
miserable failure if they hadn't trusted us,'' Wykoff said of the
study published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   The study conducted in a rural South Carolina county in 1986
turned up 82 men and one woman who possibly had been exposed to the
virus, researchers said.
   The cost of the tracing worked out to about $105 per person
tested for AIDS or $810 for each infected person located. That's a
small price compared with the cost of treating a single case of
AIDS, which is estimated at between $40,000 and $100,000, Wykoff
said Wednesday.
   ``If we prevented one case at $40,000, that's 400 people we can
educate,'' said Wykoff, a district director for the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control.
   Educating and counseling both infected and uninfected people led
them to greatly reduce the number of their sexual partners, as
shown by a check six months later, the researchers said.
   After counseling, most of the individuals started using condoms
at least some of the time, although none had used them before, the
researchers said.
   The virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome is
believed to be passed mainly through sexual intercourse, shared
hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants
before or during birth.
   ``The study suggests that at least in rural areas, there is a
sizable population that has not been reached by other education
efforts,'' Wykoff said. ``Our study gives a preliminary suggestion
that we can produce a positive behavior change in this population.
   ``I don't think the study says contact-tracing will work
everywhere or that it will always be effective. But it does suggest
it will work in some communities,'' he said.
   But an editorial accompanying the study said contact-tracing
should not become the main weapon against AIDS, although the
strategy would be appropriate in areas where the disease is less
common.
   If ``one were to attempt contact tracing for all sexual and
needle-sharing contacts of all persons with HIV (AIDS) infection in
cities like New York or San Francisco, the costs would be
enormous,'' Drs. George W. Rutherford and Jean M. Woo of the San
Francisco Department of Public Health wrote.
   Contact-tracing has been effective with other sexually
transmitted diseases, but the doctors say AIDS differs in three
ways:
   _The vast majority of AIDS infections are still undiagnosed, so
contact tracing would reach only a fraction of people affected.
   _The infection usually causes no symptoms for years, making it
difficult to go back and find sex partners.
   _No cure exists, making it questionable whether any intervention
is really helpful.

<TEXT>
   The Birds Landing post office,
named one of the smallest in the nation, looks more like a
spruced-up tool shed than the local outpost of the U.S. Postal
Service.
   Postmaster Shirley Paolini admits that handling mail for the 24
folks in town and about 100 families in the surrounding countryside
doesn't sound like a high-pressure job by city standards.
Nevertheless, Paolini says she never has a dull moment.
   ``For me, it's never boring. It can be anything else, but it's
never boring. You never know what the day is going to bring,'' she
said.
   The post office serves an important function for the farm
families who have lived in the area for generations and for the
homesick Basque, Peruvian and Mexican sheepherders under contract
with local ranches.
   Paolini, who lives with her husband in a frame house just behind
the post office, has been postmaster for 20 years. In the summer,
she and her husband are joined by their grandson, who catches
turtles in the nearby creek and plays softball in the road.
   An American flag and red geraniums grace the front of the post
office, while two friendly old dogs watch the locals trade gossip
at nearby picnic tables. Inside, a table and two chairs provide
more opportunity to catch up on town news. Next door sits a 19th
century general store.
   Founded by settler John Bird in the 1870s, Birds Landing is
located south of Fairfield in Solano County, about 20 miles
northeast of San Francisco.
   The U.S. Postal Service announced Wednesday that the Birds
Landing post office tied with two others in a contest to name the
nation's smallest post office. The two others were Salvo, N.C., and
Ocholpee, Fla., beating out such places as Cut and Shoot, Texas;
Smile, Ky.; and Remote, Alaska.
   Candidates for the contest were nominated by the public. Using a
point system, nominees were compared in such categories as square
footage, local population, number of post office boxes and number
of delivery route stops.
   The contest was the brainchild of officials at the Postal
Service's Oakland division, which includes Bird's Landing.
Contenders had to be free-standing post offices with appointed
postmasters and their own zip codes.
   ``Each town has a cute little story to tell,'' said Dan
DeMiglio, spokesman for the Oakland postal division. ``The majority
of (nominating) calls came from people who grew up in some
wonderful small town and remember the way life used to be.''

<HEAD>Air Force Reviews Proposed Fine for Radioactive Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is reviewing a proposed $102,500
fine by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for alleged violations
associated with a 1986 spill of radioactive powder at an Ohio
military base.
   NRC spokesman Jan Strasma said Thursday that it is the first
time the NRC has ever proposed a fine against the military.
   Strasma said the proposed fine involving Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base near Dayton is for willful failure to report the spill
within 24 hours and for the internal exposure of an individual to
the powder.
   The failure to report violation is responsible for $100,000 of
the total proposed fine, he said.
   ``There was an effort to avoid reporting it to anyone, including
other groups within the Air Force,'' Strasma said.
   Patti Turner, spokeswoman for the Air Force surgeon general's
office, said that the NRC action is being reviewed and a response
will be filed within 30 days. She declined further comment.
   No one was injured in the spill of americium-241, but a
radiological safety officer at the base said tests showed he
inhaled a small quantity of the powder.
   Wright-Patterson spokesman Lt. Col. Michael Turner said that the
violation notice was received at the base Wednesday afternoon and
that no decision has been made on whether to pay the fine or
protest it.
   A protest would be evaluated by NRC staff, which could then
modify the proposed fine. If a fine is imposed, the Air Force could
appeal it to an administrative law judge or the Atomic Licensing
Safety Board.
   The radioactive powder leaked out of an unlabeled barrel at the
base in September 1986 while four workers were taking inventory in
a storage building. The powder is not considered dangerous on the
skin, but can cause cancer if swallowed or inhaled, experts say.
   The workers later washed themselves under a spigot at a Boy
Scout camp on the base. Air Force officials say tests show there
was no contamination there, but as a precaution offered to test
hundreds of Boy Scouts who had camped there.
   Wright-Patterson spokeswoman Kathy Higgins said that none of the
140 Boy Scouts and leaders tested so far has tested positive for
exposure.
   The powder allegedly was accepted for storage at the base from a
jeweler who had used it to change the color of diamonds. Cleanup of
the spill cost nearly $1 million.
   Prosecutors in Ohio have been investigating an alleged attempt
to cover up the spill, and a former radiation safety officer at the
base was indicted by a federal grand jury last May for his role in
the incident.

   America's prairie waterfowl, their
numbers already depleted by decades of agricultural development and
lost habitat, are seriously threatened this summer by the worst
drought since the Great Depression.
   North Dakota, cited by the Agriculture Department as suffering
more from the searing heat than any other state, is at the heart of
the prairie pothole region, a 300,000-square-mile patch of glacial
gouges that is a critical stop on the Central Flyway for migrating
and nesting birds.
   In a landscape resembling a vast piece of Swiss cheese, the
potholes trap precious fresh water that creates the food and
shelter for birds trying to reproduce.
   About 50 percent of all ducks in North America come from the
prairie potholes.
   But this year, because of record-breaking heat, a drastic drop
in annual rainfall and a barren, dry winter, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service estimates the duck population in North Dakota is
down 18 percent from last year and has decreased 22 percent in
South Dakota since 1987.
   Federal counters estimate North Dakota has 2.4 million ducks,
South Dakota about 2 million.
   Further, say Fish and Wildlife aerial surveyors, there's been a
sharp decline in the number of waterholes available to those birds
attempting to hatch young.
   In North Dakota, the pond count is down 49 percent from last
year; in South Dakota the number of available waterholes has shrunk
42 percent.
   `We've put transmitters on about 175 female mallards in North
Dakota and Minnesota this season, and so far only five have hatched
broods,'' said Gary Krapu, a federal research biologist at the
Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center in Jamestown.
   ``It's likely fewer than 20 of those hens will produce broods
this season.''
   A brood averages eight to 10 ducklings; because of predators and
a chancey food supply, only about half live through their first two
months.
   ``If the drought lingers and populations continue to decline,
Americans can expect to see far fewer waterfowl than they have
traditionally known,'' Krapu said.
   Birds that flock to prairie pothole country, which spans parts
of North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana and three Canadian
provinces, include everything from tiny teals to majestic swans and
endangered whooping cranes.
   Among the 119 bird species found in North Dakota are seagulls
from California, white pelicans from Texas, the threatened piping
plover that has almost vanished from its original Great Lakes
range, and even swallows from Bolivia and upland sandpipers that
fly all the way from the Argentina pampas to nest in the potholes.
   But when the birds arrived this year, things were different, and
Krapu believes they knew it immediately.
   ``I think the birds sensed drought from the beginning,'' Krapu
said. ``In April we had the worst dust storms since the 1930s.
Maybe half the birds didn't nest at all, and the other half made
one attempt and gave up.''
   Krapu, a native North Dakotan, is pained by the disappearing
flocks, especially the masses of ducks he remembers from childhood.
   ``To one person, seeing two ducks is all they need to see, to
another person, seeing 1,000 isn't enough,'' said the biologist who
says he's devoting his life to studying birds.
   Krapu's grandfather was a homesteader in the virgin prairies of
North Dakota shortly after it gained statehood in 1889.
   ``There used to be waterfowl in such numbers that they blackened
the sky as they flew by,'' said Krapu, 44. ``My dad, who's 80 this
year, remembers an April sunrise when the whole sky was moving
north.''
   That was before the plow, before agricultural erosion, and
before 3 million of North Dakota's 5 million acres of pothole
wetlands were drained by farmers.
   Today, only a century after settlement, 28 million of the
state's 44 million acres are cropland and ``there has been a
drastic decline in just about every bird species that's been coming
or living here for millions of years before man came,'' Krapu said.
``I've watched many species of birds pass into oblivion, and today
the duck population is down to a very small part of what it once
was.''
   Krapu said this year's drought, the culmination of several
abnormally dry years, is a crushing blow to bird populations
already severely stressed because of water and food shortages.
   ``We are not facing seeing waterfowl driven to extinction. But
from man's standpoint, these birds are an important tradition to
millions of Americans, an important symbol of our natural
resources, and a barometer of our overall wildlife situation.
   ``We must wonder whether the birds will be a viable, important
part of our national heritage if the drought continues.''

<TEXT>
   In a second round of expulsions for alleged
spying, Canada has kicked out a senior Soviet diplomat, bringing to
19 the number of Soviet officials banned from Canada this week.
   The Soviet Union promised to retaliate in a move indicating
little hope for an end to the tit-for-tat expulsions.
   Foreign Minister Joe Clark on Thursday ordered Col. Grigori
Stepanovich Roublev, the senior military attache in the Soviet
Embassy, out of the country by Monday.
   Clark also said Sergei Mikhailovich Kashtanov, a former second
secretary at the embassy who served in Canada from 1981-1985, was
no longer welcome in Canada because of ``espionage activities.''
   In addition, the total Soviet diplomatic contingent in Canada
was cut from 63 to 60.
   The move brought to 19 the number of Soviet diplomats and
officials expelled or declared ``persona non grata'' since Tuesday.
Nine have been thrown out and 10 formerly assigned here have been
told not to come back since Canadian authorites announced the
break-up of a spy ring that was seeking military secrets.
   The Kremlin retaliated Wednesday by expelling two Canadian
diplomats in Moscow, and banning re-entry for three other Canadians
not presently in the country.
   Soviet Embassy spokesman Viatcheslav Bogdanov termed Thursday's
action ``indecent revenge'' and said: ``There is no doubt
whatsoever that there will be retaliation. It is going to happen.''
   Canadian officials accused the Soviets of trying to obtain
highly classified military and civilian technology.
   But Defense Minister Perrin Beatty denied reports the targets
included U.S. naval communications and weapons systems made by
Paramax Electronics of Montreal. The company is a subsidiary of
Unisys Corp. of Detroit and a major contractor for new Canadian
frigates under construction.
   ``We have no indication at all of any connection between these
expulsions and the (frigate) program,'' Beatty said.
   Disclosure of such naval espionage could be highly embarrassing
to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government which has asked the
United States to approve the transfer of nuclear submarine
propulsion technology to Canada.
   Canada is currently negotiating the $6.6 billion purchase of its
first fleet of eight to 10 nuclear-powered submarines, and the
options include a British-designed boat using the U.S. technology.
   Clark also accused the Soviets of trying to infiltrate the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police security service and its successor, the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
   ``We are confident that Canadian security was not compromised,''
he told Parliament on Wednesday. He said a Soviet translator at the
International Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal, Yuri Smurov,
had defected to Canada after providing intelligence on the Soviet
operations.
   Intelligence Service spokesman Jerry Cummings said the
expulsions stem from Soviet spying operations going back five years.
   Asked if they were connected with the arrest earlier this month
of Stephen Ratkai, a Canadian of Hungarian descent charged with
trying to pass U.S. military secrets to the Soviets, Cummings said
he could not comment because the case is before the courts.
   Cummings said the government did not intend to make the first
round of expulsions public, but the story leaked out during the
seven-nation Economic Summit in Toronto this week.
   Canada is ``willing to put the matter behind us'' if Moscow ends
the retaliation now, officials said.
   The mass expulsions are the first since 1978 when 13 Soviet
diplomats were sent home for trying to recruit a Royal Canadian
Mounted Police intelligence officer as a double agent.
   ``But that doesn't mean others haven't been (declared persona
non grata) or expelled since 1978,'' Cummings said.

   A 44-year-old airplane carrying Allied ambassadors
flew from Frankfurt to Berlin to highlight celebrations marking the
airlift that fed 2 million city residents during a Soviet blockade
40 years ago.
   Among the passengers Thursday was one of the Berlin Airlift's
original pilots, dubbed ``Raisin Bombers,'' who said that out of
fairness he droppped candy and raisins to children in both the
Communist and Western halves of the city.
   ``The Berlin Airlift changed this city, and it changed the
world,'' U.S. Ambassador Richard Burt said of the June
1948-September 1949 operation which delivered more than 1.8 million
tons of food and vital supplies to Berlin's Allied-controlled
western sectors.
   Accompanying Burt on Thursday on the DC-3, a civilian version of
the military C-47 transports used during the airlift, were British
Ambassador Sir Christopher Mallaby, French Ambassador Serge
Boidevaix and West German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz.
   Long-time Berlin resident Helga Galler, 60, was among the 400
people waiting for the landing at Berlin's Templehof airport. She
said she recalled well the shortages and feelings of hopelessness
created by the Soviet blockade.
   ``Everything was in short supply _ food, clothing, everything,''
Mrs. Galler said. ``So when we saw these planes coming, we knew we
didn't have to worry any longer.''
   ``I don't what we would have done without them,'' Mrs. Galler
said.
   At the end of World War II, Berlin was divided into Soviet,
U.S., British and French sectors. The city was surrounded by
Soviet-controlled territory that later became East Germany.
   Bitter disputes between the Kremlin and the United States,
Britain and France led to the Soviet move to cut all Berlin off
from the West.
   Specifically, Soviet leader Josef Stalin was staunchly against
the creation of a unified German state in the three Western
occupation zones, and when the Western allies backed a currency
reform to speed up Germany's economic recovery, Moscow imposed the
blockade.
   Retired Air Force Col. Gail Halvorsen, who accompanied the
ambassadors on the plane, was the first to begin dropping raisins
and candy to Berlin's children to sweeten the supplies they were
already receiving.
   Halvorsen, 67, said that once during the airlift days he
received a letter asking why no candy was dropped over Berlin's
eastern sector.
   ``So I flew over East Berlin after that and started dropping
candy there too,'' he said.
   But after one such run, Halvorsen said, ``an officer came up to
me and asked what I was doing. He told me the Russians had
complained that we were trying to influence the thinking of the
kids over there, so I had to stop it.'' Halvorsen, who was a
27-year-old U.S. Army Air Force lieutenant when he started flying
Berlin Airlift missions in July 1948, said he flew a total of 126
roundtrip missons from July 1948 to February 1949, taking off from
the U.S. Rhine Main base near Frankfurt.
   He later became commander of the U.S. Air Force at Tempelhof Air
Base from 1970 to 1974. He has since retired from the military and
makes his home in Provo, Utah.
   Halvorsen said he first had his crew throw out candy to children
waiting at Templehof Airport.
   ``There were only about 30 kids gathered at the airport'' on
that run, he said. But the idea spread like wildfire, and soon
there were thousands of children throughout the city waiting for
sweets to be tossed out of airlift planes, which were quickly
dubbed ``Raisin Bombers.''
   When the Soviets blocked off Allied access to the western
sectors of Berlin in 1948, they also cut delivery of electricity
and food from Berlin's communist-controlled eastern sector.
   In response, the Allies officially announced the Berlin Airlift
on June 26, 1948. By the time the airlift ended on Sept. 30, 1949,
more than 277,000 planeloads of food and supplies had been brought
to the former German capital.

   A man charged with previous rapes and
released from prison last month was arrested Thursday in the
slaying of a Honeywell Inc. manager on a parking ramp, police said.
   David Anthony Thomas, 26, was arrested without resistance at the
Epilepsy Foundation in St. Paul where he worked, police Capt. Carl
Johnson said. He said fingerprints at the murder scene led to the
arrest.
   Police have until noon Saturday to charge Thomas in the June 12
death of Mary Catherine Foley, 34, of St. Paul, Johnson said.
   Johnson said police have found ``absolutely no connection''
between Thomas and Foley.
   Foley's death came 16 days after 19-year-old Carrie Coonrod of
Eau Claire, Wis., was stabbed to death on a downtown Minneapolis
parking ramp. A suspect in the Coonrod killing was arrested shortly
afterward and has been indicted.
   Three other attacks on women in Minneapolis since May 22 had
heightened concerns about the safety of women where they work.
Among the victims was an attorney abducted from her downtown office
and repeatedly raped during a 13-hour ordeal.
   Johnson said Thomas was identified in 1980 in several
burglary-rapes in south Minneapolis, less than a mile from the
murder scene. Johnson said he was not certain of the disposition of
the cases, but said Thomas was placed on probation and didn't serve
time in prison until he violated terms of the probation.

<HEAD>Lap Belts Increase Chance of Serious Injury, Private Study
Concludes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A rear-seat passenger restrained only by a lap
belt is exposed to greater risk of disabling or perhaps fatal
injury during a car crash than a passenger wearing a
lap-and-shoulder belt, a privately commissioned study says.
   ``Rear-seat occupants wearing only lap belts are exposed to
substantially greater impact forces in the abdominal and lower
spinal column area than occupants wearing lap-shoulder belts,'' the
study said. ``This greatly increases their risk of sustaining
severe injuries, including disabling or fatal injuries to the
spinal cord and abdominal organs, in such crashes.''
   The study was released by the Institute for Injury Reduction at
a hearing on Thursday of the House government activities and
transportation subcommittee. The institute, based in Dunkirk, Md.,
was founded this year by attorneys involved in product-injury
litigation.
   The study was prepared for the institute by Automotive Safety
Testing Inc. of East Liberty, Ohio, which used instrumented dummies
belted into the rear-seat assembly of a 1987 Honda Accord LX and
subjected to simulated crashes.
   A simulated crash at 27 mph showed an adult-size dummy pressing
against the outside part of a lap belt at 2,350 pounds per square
inch, 338 percent higher than the pressure recorded when a
lap-and-shoulder restraint was used.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the
study showed a lack of reponsibility toward public safety.
   ``In our opinion, it is irresponsible for anybody to discourage
the wearing of any kind of safety belt,'' said Ron De Fore, NHTSA's
director of public and consumer affairs. ``The Department of
Transportation has for years studied hundreds of thousands of fatal
crashes, and our data shows that you have a nine times greater
chance of being killed in the rear seat without a belt as opposed
to wearing the belt, even if it is a lap-only belt.''
   De Fore accused the institute of special pleading. ``The people
who presented the testimony ... have an underlying motive by their
own admission _ they represent plaintiff attorneys who have clients
that are among the few that have been injured by the lap belt,'' De
Fore said.
   The use of lap belts alone in rear seat became a subject of
contention among auto regulators with the 1986 release of a
National Transportation Safety Board study that concluded the belts
might cause serious injury rather than protecting the passenger.
   The Highway Traffic Safety Administration has said the 1986
study was based on insufficient data.
   The traffic safety administration and auto manufacturers have
said a properly adjusted lap belt will provide protection because
the force of the crash will be absorbed by the large pelvic bones.
   A misadjusted belt will result in the belt's cutting through the
soft abdomen to the spinal column, studies have shown.
   The institute's study did not consider the position of the lap
belt on the passenger.
   Virtually all 1990-model U.S. cars will have lap-shoulder belts
in the two rear-window positions, said Thomas Hanna, president of
the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, which represents the
automakers.
   Hanna said that members of the association have designed kits
for nearly all models made in the last 10 years that allow owners
to install lap-shoulder belt combinations in the back seat of
vehicles.
   The kits, however, may be difficult to obtain, the Institute for
Injury Reduction said. The organization on May 25-26 conducted a
random telephone poll of 30 dealers for five automakers in six
cities and found none had lap-shoulder belt kits in stock, 21 said
no kits were available and only eight said kits could be ordered.
   ``The conclusion is inescapable ... that manufacturers have
failed to undertake vigorous production, marketing, pricing and
installation programs aimed at substantially increasing the
availablility of retrofit rear-seat lap-shoulder belts to American
car owners,'' said A. Benjamin Kelley, the institute's president.

<HEAD>Bush Camp Takes Aim At Dukakis On Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush's campaign immediately branded Democrat
Michael Dukakis a tax-raiser after the Massachusetts governor
backed $115 million in new state taxes. Dukakis was coping with
other home-state headaches as well, including an FBI probe of his
administration's selection of a prison site.
   Bush was flying to Cincinnati today for a GOP unity conference,
and the Republicans were expected to have a field day with Dukakis'
tax move. Several of Bush's former rivals for the nomination _
Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, former Secretary of State Alexander Haig and
Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson were to be on hand for the
Republican event.
   Dukakis on Thursday signed a $40 million state cigarette tax and
said he supported raising another $75 million by bringing the
Massachusetts tax code in line with federal tax provisions.
   The state faces a $400 million deficit in the current fiscal
year, but Dukakis defended his ability to manage a budget, saying
it stood in ``sharp contrast'' to the record of the Reagan
administration.
   The Bush camp's reaction to Dukakis' action was swift _ and a
bit gleeful.
   ``It's obvious that his reaction is to tax,'' said Bush
spokeswoman Sheila Tate. ``Instead of cutting (spending), he raised
taxes. It seems to speak for itself.''
   Bush has already been getting a lot of campaign-trail mileage
out of tax issues, making frequent reference to ``tax-and-spend''
Democrats. Dukakis has said he would raise federal income taxes
only as a last resort.
   The paths of the presidential rivals nearly crossed Thursday
night in Washington _ Bush and Dukakis posed separately, a few
hours apart, for pictures with visiting Australian Prime Minister
Bob Hawke.
   Dukakis was in Washington for a Democratic fund-raiser before
heading off today for a four-day vacation on the island of
Nantucket in Massachusetts.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, was in Puerto Rico today. The
island's residents do not vote in the general election, but Jackson
was angling for a share of Puerto Rico's 57 delegates to the
Democratic National Convention.
   Jackson was greeted on his arrival Thursday night by the
territory's governor, Rafael Hernandez Colon, who said earlier in
the day that he was considering Jackson's request that he be given
some of the delegates. Jackson won Puerto Rico's non-binding
primary in March but most of the delegates have said they would
vote for Dukakis at the convention.
   The Jackson forces are taking a conciliatory approach to
delegate questions, though. On Thursday, Democrats agreed to a list
of delegates to next month's national convention.
   But Jackson has put the Dukakis campaign on notice that he
intends to keep pressing platform demands unacceptable to Dukakis _
including a call for new taxes on the wealthy and support for a
Palestinian homeland. A Democratic committee was convening today in
Denver to continue work on the platform draft.
   Jackson was also keeping alive the issue of whether he should be
Dukakis' running mate. He's said he ought to be asked _ but won't
say if he actually wants the job.
   Jackson told reporters in Washington on Thursday that he has
made up his mind about whether he wants a spot on the ticket, but
said he's not telling anyone what his private verdict was _ not
even Dukakis.
   ``That would be public,'' he said.
   Dukakis has repeatedly said that many people are being
considered for the No. 2 spot, and said Thursday he wasn't close to
a decision on a running mate.
   ``You're going to have to wait on that for a while,'' he said.
   Dukakis, spending one last day tending to business before
beginning his vacation, was beset by a series of woes on Thursday.
   After signing the cigarette tax, he brushed aside questions
about the political repercussions of raising taxes in the midst of
his presidential campaign, saying that his main concern was to
``make sure that the state's fiscal base is solid and strong.''
   The tax action followed a day of questions about a federal
investigation of the Dukakis administration's plan to build a
prison in the small town of New Braintree.
   Local officials have accused the Dukakis administration of
tailoring a deal on the site because the co-owners of the property
are longtime acquaintances of the governor and one co-owner has
contributed to Dukakis' presidential campaign.
   The FBI, which does not usually confirm when a probe is under
way, said it revealed the investigation because of Dukakis' status
as a presidential contender. The FBI said Dukakis was not a target
of the probe, but said the investigation had not reached a stage in
which subjects would be singled out.
   Dukakis denied any wrongdoing, saying the suggestion that his
administration had acted improperly was ``unfortunate and
regrettable.''
   Also Thursday, former Dukakis education adviser Gerard T.
Indelicato was accused of larceny and forgery related to his state
duties. He had previously pleaded guilty to separate federal
charges of fraud and conspiracy.
   Dukakis called the charges ``very serious, more so because they
allege a violation of the public trust.''

   A seasick seaman accused of threatening to
kill the captain of a commercial fishing boat unless he was
returned to shore said he was so sick he ``couldn't take it
anymore.''
   Patrick James D'Alessandro, 27, of Cape May, N.J., who allegedly
brandished a rifle and a knife in his attempt to get back on land,
was charged Thursday with assault and mutiny. He faces up to 20
years in prison if convicted on the federal charges.
   ``I didn't want to hurt anyone. I couldn't take it anymore,''
said D'Alessandro in a telephone interview from the Newport News
City Jail.
   ``I just wanted to go home,'' he said.
   D'Alessandro, who had never been to sea before, acknowledged
that he was armed with a .22-caliber rifle and a knife when he
demanded Wednesday afternoon that Capt. Edward Lominec of the
70-foot Miss Marie take him ashore because he was seasick.
   D'Alessandro was taken into custody by the Coast Guard Wednesday
evening and no one was injured in the incident, which occurred
about 90 miles east of Cape Hatteras, N.C.
   Lominec and three other crewmen aboard the boat said
D'Alessandro threatened to kill the captain if the vessel didn't go
to shore, said Lt. Allan Black, commanding officer of the Coast
Guard patrol boat that responded to the vessel's call for help.

<HEAD>Another Landslide Forces Suspension Of Rescue Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ZEYNEP ALEMDAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tons of rocks and earth tumbling down on a
mountain village have forced the suspension of rescue work at the
site of a major landslide that buried at least 100 people alive,
officials said.
   Radio reports late Thursday said villagers heard people crying
for help from underneath the debris.
   The victims, including 30 travelers stranded in a coffeehouse by
an earlier landslide early Thursday, were buried by the major
landslide which swept down on Catak village Thursday afternoon,
according to reports from the northeastern area.
   Catak is located in Trabzon province about 500 miles northeast
of Ankara and not far from the Black Sea. The earth was loosened by
heavy rains in the region, where frequent landslides are sometimes
blamed on extensive cutting of forests.
   Provincial Deputy Gov. Haydar Ozgun said it was feared the death
toll would be high, since so many people were missing. Rescuers,
hobbled all day by rain, had recovered only one body by late
Thursday, provincial Governor Enver Hizlan announced.
   An announcement over loud speakers by the Turkish Red Crescent,
a relief organization, caused panic when it said 300 people had
been killed, the independent Hurriyet News Agency said. Officials
denied that the toll was so high.
   State radio reported that at least 31 people were injured in the
disaster in Catak. One victim said the landslide came without
warning Thursday.
   ``It happened all at once after a noise that sounded like
thunder,'' Turan Alemdar, a truck driver who witnessed the
disaster, was quoted as saying by Hurriyet. ``The rocks swept away
everything in a second.''
   ``I saw the mountain coming over me and started running away,''
Zeki Ilhan was quoted as saying by the semi-official Anatolia news
agency.
   State radio said villagers reportedly heard people crying for
help as they lay underneath a mass of earth and stones.
   Rescue teams put off work until early today after a third
landslide hit area Thursday evening. No one was reported buried in
the new slide which dumped tons of mud and rocks near the village.
   Ozgun told The Associated Press by telephone that land slide
experts had ordered the rescue operations halted for the day.
   Hizlan said that a German rescue team today will fly in to help
Turkish rescue efforts. He said the German team would bring trained
dogs to help dig out victims.
   The mud and rock roared down a mountainside onto at least three
houses, four stores, a restaurant, a high school and the crowded
coffeehouse, according to news agency reports.
   Several buses and cars were lined up on the road when the
landslides hit, state radio said.
   Televised reports said the landslides had also caused a river to
flood the village. Footage showed houses under water.
   Landslides blocked a riverbed and sent the waters coursing
through the village, according to news reports.
   The televised reports also showed trees and lampposts lying on
ground. Some vehicles were buried in soil.
   A survivor wrapped in blankets said on television that he was
trapped in the coffeehouse but swam out.
   Rescue workers recovered two minibuses under the wreckage, but
no one was found inside, according to news services.
   Television also showed footage of the village smothered between
mountains with the roofs of its houses barely protruding from the
rubble.
   The reports said it took about four hours for rescue teams to
reach the site. They said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers tried
unsuccessfully to push away the mud and stone which covered the
area. They moved slowly for fear of causing new landslides.
   Buses and vehicles were waiting on road at the time of the slide
because the highway was closed by the earlier landslide Thursday
shortly after midnight, the reports said.
   Deputy Gov. Erkan Isilgan told The Associated Press that
authorities were trying to find out whether the buses were carrying
any foreign tourists.
   Isilgan said 17 houses in the village were evacuated.
   The Red Crescent sent 150 tents to the area and dispatched a
mobile hospital, according to the news reports.
   Meanwhile, the closure of the highway disrupted traffic in the
area. Bus services from eastern provinces to Tarbzon province were
canceled, Hurriyet said. Vehicles formed long lines on both sides
of the highway waiting for bulldozers to clear the road.

   Television stations have been put on notice:
Scenes of a bare-breasted woman seducing a 15-year-old boy are off
limits on prime-time TV.
   Beyond that, though, TV stations say they have little to guide
their programming decisions and protect themselves from government
sanctions for violating decency standards.
   ``This is a baby step of further information, but it's not
enough to provide any cohesive or comprehensive guidelines for
stations,'' said Walt Wurfel, a spokesman for the National
Association of Broadcasters.
   The FCC issued the guidance on Thursday, when it slapped a
$2,000 fine on Kansas City, Mo., station KZKC-TV for airing the
movie ``Private Lessons'' at 8 p.m. on May 26, 1987 _ a time, the
agency said, when children were likely to be watching.
   The movie is about a 15-year-old boy seduced by his housekeeper,
who undresses while the boy watches in one scene. She appears
bare-breasted in several other instances. These scenes, the FCC
said, ``were neither isolated nor fleeting.''
   The commission said nudity and sexual themes are not necessarily
``indecent,'' but their context and treatment in ``Private
Lessons'' were.
   ``The movie included nudity and scenes depicting sexual matters,
which were dealt with in a pandering and titillating manner,'' the
FCC said.
   ``The story line of the seduction of a 15-year-old boy by an
older woman, together with the inclusion of explicit nudity, would
have commanded the attention of children and the sexual references
would have been readily understood by children who tuned into the
program,'' the commission said.
   The station's owners, Media Central Inc. of Chattanooga, Tenn.,
said the movie had been cut by an inexperienced editor and violated
the station's own standards of good taste.
   But the Kansas City Times reported in today's editions that
Media Central says it will not pay the $2,000 fine.
   ``It's a matter of principle,'' Morton Kent, Media Central's
chairman of the board told the newspaper. ``We have the money to
pay the $2,000 fine, but we will not.''
   Kent said the FCC ignored the fact that KZKC changed its editing
policy after the R-rated movie was broadcast.
   The FCC's decency guidelines have been under fire since they
were adopted in April 1987. Broadcasters and others say the
guidelines are unconstitutionally vague. A coalition of these
groups is challenging the guidelines in court.
   The FCC judges material to be indecent if it ``depicts or
describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory
organs or actitivies.''
   Obscene material _ defined as appealing to prurient interest and
lacking literary, artistic, political or scientific value _ by law
cannot be aired at any time, but the Supreme Court has said
indecent material cannot be totally banned. The FCC says indecent
material can be aired after midnight, when there is little risk
children would be watching.
   Critics have demanded that the FCC give more specific guidance
about what will be considered indecent, but commission lawyers have
said that providing a list of dos and don'ts would run afoul of the
Constitution. Instead, the FCC has told broadcasters they should be
guided by the decisions the agency makes in the cases that come
before it.
   Since the FCC revised its decency standards, it has acted on
nine complaints against broadcasters, including the one against
KZKC-TV. At the same time that the FCC revised the standards, it
issued warnings to three radio stations, and later dismissed
complaints against two TV and three radio stations.
   The commission has said several times that context is a crucial
factor in determining whether material is indecent.
   In one case, the commission dismissed a complaint against a TV
program on sex education that included a simulated demonstration of
birth control devices. The FCC said that though the program
contained references to sexual and excretory organs and activities,
the references ``in context, were not vulgar, lewd or shocking. Nor
were they made in a pandering or titillating manner.''
   In another case, the FCC put a radio station's reading from the
James Joyce classic ``Ulysses'' in the ``decent'' category, along
with the song ``I Want to Kiss Her, But ...,'' which the commission
said was ``capable of two meanings _ one innocent, one sexual.''
   When the FCC adopted its tougher decency standards in April
1987, it ruled in a case involving New York disc jockey Howard
Stern that use of double-entendre was indecent when it was mingled
with explicit references that made the material capable of only a
sexual meaning.

   Stars and bars may again grace the uniforms of
Chinese soldiers as the government announced today it had set up a
committee to study restoring ranks to the People's Liberation Army.
   The late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung abolished ranks more than
20 years ago, calling them a vestige of hierarchical, bourgeois
society.
   Zhang Husheng, director of the Information Bureau of the General
Office of the Standing Committee of China's parliament, said today
the committee will also take up proposals to confer medals on
retired soldiers and confirm ranks held in 1955-65, before Mao did
away with the system.
   Zhang was speaking at the first news briefing ever held by the
Standing Committee. He said it was part of efforts to ``increase
openness'' of government proceedings.
   The 155-member Standing Committee handles day-to-day affairs of
the 3,000-member National People's Congress, China's parliament,
which hold only one session annually. The committee is meeting for
the second time since the seventh plenary session was convened in
March.
   Zhang said the agenda will be led by a series of proposals
submitted by the Central Military Commission, headed by senior
leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Among the proposals is one that defines the roles of officers in
the People's Liberation Army.
   Zhang said military ranks were ``conducive to commanding and
control of our army and required by modernization and
standardization of our army.''
   Deng has repudiated Mao's concept of an egalitarian, proletariat
army and has sought to bring back ranks as part of efforts to
create a more modern and efficient fighting force. Since 1985,
China's military has been reduced in size from 4 million to 3
million troops.
   The military has also abandoned its old force doctrine of
``People's War,'' which relied on guerrilla warfare to protect the
country, and embraced military theories closer to those of the West.
   It is widely believed that the PLA will formally reinstate ranks
on either Aug. 1, Army Day, or Oct. 1, National Day.
   Even though Chinese soldiers have been formally without ranks
for the past two decades, they have not been equal. Generals still
command and foot soldiers still obey.
   In addition, even though all military uniforms appear to be the
same, irrespective of a soldier's position, subtle differences in
clothing indicate great differences in power. High-ranking
officers, for example, wear wool Mao suits in the winter and the
jackets usually come with four pockets. Foot soldiers wear cotton
suits and only get two pockets.
   Zhang said the Standing Committee will also discuss such issues
as the nation's financially pinched education system and how to
improve the work of the National People's Congress and the
committee.
   Although China's policies are still set by the ruling Communist
Party, the People's Congress in recent years has shed its
rubberstamp image and become a forum for debate and discussion of
those policies.
   Zhang said the Standing Committee will establish a practice of
holding news briefings once every two months and will make the
contents of its meetings as open to the public as possible.
   He said the committee also plans to set up a reception room
where ordinary Congress members can come to express opinions.

   The mighty Mississippi, drained to an
all-time low, looks like an emptying bathtub. Receding waters have
exposed cracked river banks and beach-like expanses where barges
sit mired, their crews restlessly hoping for an unlikely rain.
   ``We're stuck on this thing,'' said Johnny Bryson, 35, pilot of
one of 56 towboats parked Thursday along a 40-mile stretch of idle
river around Memphis. ``That's all everybody talks about _ the
river, the low water, no rain.''
   The crews, stalled by the worst drought in half a century, are
swabbing decks, changing engine oil and finding other ways to kill
time until the river is navigable again.
   A few miles north of here, a dredge worked around the clock to
deepen a channel that was 6 inches shallower than the 9-foot depth
guaranteed by the Army Corps of Engineers. A 35-foot scoop that
looks like a dustpan scrapes a sand shoal at a rate that could
deepen a football field by 9 feet a day.
   The Coast Guard hoped to have the channel open this afternoon,
freeing the 22 southbound tows and 34 northbound boats that had
lined up by 7 p.m. Thursday. The river was shut to commercial
traffic Tuesday night.
   Normally, 30 to 50 towboats moving barges of wheat, corn, coal,
petroleum, steel, bauxite, chemicals, auto parts, cement and other
bulk goods churn past Memphis each day.
   The cargo floats on a natural interstate highway that is a
lifeline to the nation. It would take 27,000 trucks to haul the
tonnage pushed past Memphis in a day.
   These days, however, the Mississippi is at its lowest level
since records were first kept in 1872. Receding waters have left
beach-like expanses of sand bars and stone dykes used to control
channel flow, and river banks baked by the relentless sun show
deep, dry cracks.
   The only things moving on the brown waters Thursday were
pleasure craft and fishing boats.
   The Charlotte and its five metal barges, which shimmered with
griddle-like heat waves in broiling 100-degree heat, was bound for
St. Louis from Beaumont, Texas. The river traffic jam could extend
add a week to the 14-day trip.
   ``It's OK to break for a day or so,'' said engineer Darrell
Eriest, 32, of Harned, Ky. ``Then everybody gets anxious.
   ``There's an old saying out here that a towboat never stops, but
it's always stopping. We're used to hurrying up and then waiting.
It's part of the game,'' Eriest said.
   Eriest spent the day changing oil on the main engines, greasing
the rudders and cleaning engine filters.
   ``When the boat shuts down, that's when my work starts,'' he
said.
   One problem for boats arriving at the bottleneck was finding a
spot to tie off. The water has dropped so low that sturdy trees are
more than 1,000 feet from the water.
   Hard-muscled rivermen, most with tanned and leathery skin, are
used to seeing the Big Muddy blocked from time to time by
accidents, barges running aground or ice packs. But the worst
drought in 50 years has brought record low water, and the dry
months of July and August are still to come.
   ``What's got everybody shook up is it's happening early in the
year before the dry months. There's no end in sight,'' said D.L.
Carroll, 58, captain of the Arnold Sobel, which is carrying
fertlizer.
   Carroll used the dead time to have an abcessed tooth pulled in
Memphis. He also radioed his home office in St. Louis, jokingly
asking them to send rain gear.
   ``We'd all rather be under way. Time passes better when the
engines are running,'' Carroll said. ``But there are still things
to be done.''
   Depending on which company they work for, river crews work 30
days, then get 15 or 30 days off. If the boat shuts down, they
still get paid from $57 to $200 a day, depending on whether they
are a deckhand or a captain.
   ``In a way, it's easy money. There really isn't that much to
do,'' said Stuart Mill, 27, an assistant engineer from Daytona
Beach, Fla.
   Modern towboats bear little resemblance to the steam-driven
paddlewheelers of Mark Twain's time, when Memphis was built on a
bluff to accommodate the cotton and riverboat trade.
   The Arnold Sobel is like a floating motel, complete with air
conditioners, private rooms and a laundry. On board for a crew of
nine are five television sets and one videocasette recorder, the
better to pass the time on idle days. The carpeted guest room has a
private lounge and brass beds.
   The boat is pushing 23 barges from New Orleans to Hartford,
Ill., a trip that usually takes 10 days. Thursday was the ninth day
of the journey and only its halfway point.
   ``Ain't no use being in a hurry,'' said Robert Patterson, 48, a
mate from Arlington, Ky. ``If it don't rain, there ain't going to
be no grain to ship anyhow.''

   Three huge gasoline tanks exploded
Thursday at a depot in this northeastern industrial city, killing
at least two people and starting a blaze too hot for firefighters
to approach, officials said.
   Twenty people were hospitalized with burns, including six in
very serious condition, officials said.
   Several vehicles parked near the tanks turned to molten metal
and the temperature near the fire at times reached 5,400 degrees,
said Nuevo Leon state judiciary police director, Hernan Guajardo
Garza, who visited the site.
   Two workers died from burns at the San Rafael tank farm owned by
the government petroleum monopoly, Pemex, said Raul de la Garza,
Nuevo Leon press secretary. De la Garza earlier had said four
workers died but later corrected the figure, citing his latest
information.
   Pemex spokesman Guillermo Guevara, at a press conference with de
la Garza, said firefighters managed to extinguish the flames in two
of the tanks around 11:30 p.m. EDT, and said they expected the
blaze in the third tank to be put out early Monday.
   De la Garza said 10,000 people were evacuated from their homes
around the tank farm in case the flames spread.
   About 200 amy infantry troops cordoned off the area to prevent
looting and the government news agency Notimex quoted police as
saying 40 people found loitering around evacuated houses were
detained for questioning.
   Federal and state police blocked access roads to Guadalupe,
creating traffic jams around the greater Monterrey metropolitan
area.
   The three tanks exploded one after another starting at about 3
p.m. (5 p.m. EDT). At 9:30 p.m. (11:30 p.m. EDT), the fire was
still out of control and a reddish glow could be seen 10 miles away.
   Flames shot up more than 100 feet in the air, and palls of smoke
about 1,000 feet high rising from the three burning tanks.
   Guadalupe is just outside Monterrey, Mexico's industrial center
and its third largest city, with a population of about 2 million.
Both cities are about 440 miles northeast of Mexico City.
   Firefighters at the tank farm said intense heat prevented them
from approaching the three tanks to pour in chemicals to control
the blaze. Authorities said they used 50-foot pipes that can eject
chemical foam at a great distance to put out fires at two of the
tanks.
   The special equipment was flown in from the Gulf of Mexico port
of Ciudad Madero, 280 miles southeast of Guadalupe.
   The San Rafael complex has 23 tanks of about 55,000 barrels
capacity each, where Pemex stores gasoline and diesel oil for
retail distribution in Monterrey and other parts of northeastern
Mexico.
   Guillermo Guevara, a Pemex spokesman, said in a telephone
interview the three tanks were full of low-grade, 81-octane
gasoline. He said the other tanks contained higher-grade, 90-octane
gasoline and diesel oil, mostly used by trucks.
   ``We're trying to control the fire and allow the gasoline to be
consumed naturally. Gasoline ... is very flammable, it burns
easily. We don't know why the explosions occurred. We can't get
close enough to investigate because it's too hot,'' Guevara added.
   Fire brigades were also rushed to the scene from dozens of
industrial plants in Monterrey, including private companies, the
Monterrey airport, other Pemex facilities in the area and the
nearby Pemex refinery at Cadereyta.
   Guevara said a total of 2.26 million gallons of liquid fuel was
stored at the tank farm.
   He said 250 Pemex workers are employed at the tank farm, but
added he did not immediately know how many were at the site when
the explosions occurred.
   Four Pemex workers were hospitalized with second- and
third-degree burns on more than 50 percent of their bodies, and two
others were hospitalized with lesser injuries, Guevara said.
   Natalia Palacios, who lives about four blocks southeast of the
tank farm, said se took her family of eight, including an uncle and
aunt, out of their home, and rushed them to a friend's home farther
away, where they planned to spend the night.
   Mrs. Palacios said her husband works at another Pemex plant.
   An explosion and fire May 24 at Pemex's gas and kerosene supply
depot in the northern city of Chihuahua caused the evacuation of
more than 100,000 residents, according to the Chihuahua state
government.
   Pemex's preliminary report on that disaster found that a spark
during the installation of firefighting equipment touched off the
blaze.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Christic Suit Against `Guns-For-Drugs' Contra
Ring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge's dismissal of a damage suit
accusing 29 people of running a guns-for-drugs smuggling scheme to
aid the Contra rebels was angrily denounced by stunned plaintiffs
as a political move.
   But one of the defendants, who included former CIA officials,
Contra leaders and cocaine traffickers, said the $24 million
lawsuit was itself a political attack on the Reagan administration
and probable Republican presidential nominee George Bush.
   ``I'm very pleased,'' retired Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, a key
figure in the Iran-Contra scandal, said following Thursday's
ruling. ``I think the case is 100 percent political.''
   Chief U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King's ruling also
cleared Iran-Contra figures Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, former
CIA deputy director of operations Theodore Shackley, Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and leaders of Colombia's violent Medellin Cartel.
   In granting summary judgments to the defendants, King found that
the plaintiffs, two journalists, had failed to prove their case.
   Christic Institute attorney Daniel Sheehan, whose liberal,
Washington-based organization represented the plaintiffs, accused
King of political motivations in his ruling and said he would
appeal to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
   ``The judge's action is a conscious action to stop this case
from going to trial before the election,'' said Sheehan. ``The
court has defied the law, not just mistaken the law.''
   Sheehan and the plaintiffs said they were stunned the judge's
ruling came only a few days before the trial was to start Monday.
   Tony Avirgan, who filed the suit with his wife Martha Honey
after being wounded in a 1984 bombing blamed on the defendants,
reacted angrily to the decision.
   ``I think it's absolutely absurd that the judge has said we
don't have enough evidence,'' Avirgan said in a telephone interview
from his Costa Rican home. ``All the key defendants have refused to
take depositions, walked out on depositions, refused to turn over
documents, and he's refused to take sanctions against them.''
   King ruled the plaintiffs failed to prove their basic contention
that a wide-ranging conspiracy was behind the news conference
bombing in Nicaragua that injured Avirgan. Eight people were killed
but the apparent target, Contra leader Eden Pastora, was only
wounded.
   The judge also ruled the plaintiffs failed to prove the
defendants were responsible for threats to news sources and the
journalists aimed at covering up the defendants' involvement.
   Singlaub, who said he spent $250,000 on his defense, and
Shackley promised retaliatory legal action against the Christic
Institute.
   Singlaub and Calero said the motive for the suit was to attack
the administration and Vice President George Bush before the
November election and to punish those who helped the Contras.
   The suit was filed in May 1986, six months before the
Iran-Contra affair became public. Many of the people it brought to
light have been indicted or appeared before congressional
committees investigating that case.
   It alleged the defendants belonged to a right-wing terror
network dating back to 1959 that illegally participated in
assassination plots, gun running and drug trafficking.
   The suit accused the defendants of funding illegal Contra
activities with drug runs in cooperation with the Medellin Cartel
and threatening, imprisoning and even killing anyone who threatened
to uncover the ring.
   Other well-known defendants included cartel leaders Pablo
Escobar Gaviria and Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, Iran-Contra figure Robert
Owen, Costa Rican rancher John Hull and former mercenary Sam Hall.
Hall had been ordered jailed during the trial after refusing to
answer questions in a deposition but apparently will not have to
serve the sentence.

<HEAD>Court Urged to Leave Civil Rights Decision Intact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorneys general of 47 states, 59 U.S.
senators and 112 House members are asking the Supreme Court to
leave intact a 1976 civil rights ruling that they say is the
``armor in the battle against prejudice.''
   The officials, joined by a coalition of civil rights groups and
other organizations, said on Thursday that reversal of the
12-year-old ruling ``would send the signal that discrimination is
tolerable in American society.''
   Justice Department officials, meanwhile, said that the Reagan
administration will sit out the controversy and will not offer its
views by filing a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief.
   At issue is the court's announcement last April that it will
consider overturning a decision that allows people to sue private
citizens accused of racial discrimination.
   A decision is expected sometime in 1989.
   The extraordinary move _ no one had asked the court to overturn
the ruling _ was taken by a 5-4 vote, and the four dissenters
accused the court of undermining the trust of minorities.
   Critics said mere consideration of such a move could have a
major psychological impact on minorities, raising fears that an
increasingly solidified conservative majority on the court is
willing to consider dismantling other civil rights victories.
   The court in April said it will use a North Carolina case
involving charges of on-the-job racial harassment to reconsider a
decision called Runyon vs. McCrary.
   In the 1976 ruling, the court said racially segregated private
schools that refuse to admit black students violate the Civil
Rights Act of 1866, a law enacted to ensure recently freed slaves
all the rights of citizenship.
   The 1976 decision let civil rights groups use the law as a
weapon in attacking private discrimination.
   If Runyon vs. McCrary is overturned, no federal law would ban
racially segregated private schools.
   Also, civil rights activists say a major deterrent to racial
bias in employment would be lost because the 1866 law is the only
one that allows victims of illegal discrimination to collect hefty
punitive-damages awards.
   More than 100 civil rights and public interest groups joined in
urging the justices on Thursday to leave the 1976 ruling intact.
   Among the groups signing the brief were the American Civil
Liberties Union, the AFL-CIO, the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, the National Organization for Women and the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith
   ``The unprecedented number of groups signing onto this brief is
indicative of the concern that the court's action has caused,''
said Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights.
   ``For the millions of Americans for whom civil rights is not
just an abstract legal principle but rather armor in the battle
against prejudice, the court's decision to overturn Runyon would be
a direct assault,'' Neas said.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said
lawyers in the North Carolina case were informed by letter
Wednesday ``that the Justice Department won't be filing in the
case.''
   She said the brief letter did not give specific reasons for
Solicitor General Charles Fried's decision not to file a brief.

<TEXT>
   A local florist who paid $2,000 to bring a
Sioux Indian medicine man to dance and pray for rain in the
drought-stricken Midwest says the showers were brief, but the money
was well spent.
   Cliff Doebel said Thursday he was pleased with the attention
Leonard Crow Dog's ceremony drew to the drought and its effect on
the state's agriculture economy.
   ``People around the world need to know that this year we may not
be able to supply the grain we usually supply,'' he said.
   Crow Dog used an eagle bone whistle and a peace pipe at the
30-minute ceremony Sunday, when he guaranteed that the
drought-stricken northwest Ohio town would receive rain by Thursday.
   The medicine man, who said the ritual always brings rain, blew
the whistle toward the north, south, east and west, and then toward
the sky and ground.
   The showers arrived ahead of schedule Wednesday night as a cold
front moved through the state. The National Weather Service does
not have an official rainfall monitor in Clyde, but precipitation
in nearby communities ranged from .22 inches in Fremont to .08
inches in Milan, forecaster Matthew Peroutka said.
   ``It's not enough, and the situation is still here and still
severe, but I think it was enough to help some of the corn out,''
Doebel said.
   Doebel said he wasn't sure whether to credit Crow Dog or just
luck.
   ``I'm not one to know those answers,'' he said. ``All I know is
you flip a coin and sometimes it comes up heads.''

   The dollar closed sharply higher in trading against
the Japanese yen on Friday, and stock prices rallied slightly.
   The dollar closed the week at 129.70 yen, the day's high, up
1.15 yen from Thursday's finish. It opened trading at 128.63 yen
and ranged between 128.50-129.70 yen during the day.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 127.85-point loser Thursday, gained back a
modest 17.46 points, or 0.06 percent, to finish the week at
27,750.39.
   The dollar was higher in response to Japanese news reports that
the United States would tolerate its rise through the 130 yen
level, traders said.
   The report quoted an anonymous U.S. Treasury source as saying
the dollar's strength against the yen since the beginning of this
week was within the range the United States could accept.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said the
market was ``becoming nervous'' following wild fluctuations in
trading Thursday, when the dollar ranged between 129.80 yen _ a
nearly four-month high _ and 128.25 yen.
   The Bank of Tokyo dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the dollar's further moves would depend on activity by
Japanese institutional investors.
   ``The firmness of Japanese government bond prices and stabilized
foreign exchange dealings helped the stock market,'' said Masahiro
Umemori of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   He also said market participants were confident that inflation
in Japan was not heating up.
   Traders also said losses over four consecutive trading days made
share prices attractive to investors.

<TEXT>
   Opponents of President Kurt Waldheim of
Austria are using Pope John Paul II's second visit to this country
to demonstrate against the controversial president.
   Five hours before the pope arrived at Vienna's Schwechat airport
on Thursday, a group of six Jews from the United States, led by
Rabbi Avi Weiss of Riverdale N.Y., demonstrated outside Waldheim's
office.
   They told reporters the Pope's meeting with Waldheim on Thursday
evening constituted a ``desecration of the memory of those Jews and
Christians who were murdered'' at the former Nazi concentration
camp at Mauthausen.
   Jewish leaders have harshly criticized the pope for meeting
Waldheim.
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress
in New York, said late Thursday that the pope's meeting with
Waldheim has thrown into doubt the long-planned meeting between the
Vatican and Jewish groups on the Holocaust.
   Waldheim has been the focus of international controversy
concerning his service in the Balkans during World War II as a
soldier in the German army.
   He has denied any wrongdoing.
   ``Do not embrace Waldheim, no!'' said Rabbi Weiss as he stood
outside the presidential offices in downtown Vienna.
   Standing with Rabbi Weiss were five Jewish students dressed in
black and white striped garb like those worn by Nazi concentration
camp inmates. They held up posters, including a blown up photograph
of Waldheim in a Germam army uniform.
   Later Rabbi Weiss and his associates were joined by Paris-based
Nazi hunter Beate Klarsfeld and a group of ten Jews from France at
a hotel overlooking St. Stephen's Cathedral.
   As the pontiff entered the cathedral, they unfurled banners from
windows overlooking the church. One said, ``Pope John Paul, Don't
Meet Waldheim.''
   Austrian police stormed the rooms, and one demonstrator was hit
when he refused to turn over his poster, Ayall Schanzer, chairman
of the New York-based North American Jewish Students' Network,
said. No arrests were made.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Klarsfeld said. ``I think it's a lack of
sensitivity toward the Holocaust.''
   Weiss, who heads a group called the Coalition of Concern, said
his organization also objects to the planned papal visit to the
former Mauthausen concentration camp today, a day after the pope
met with Waldheim.
   About 110,000 prisoners died in the camp, and Weiss said after
the pope leaves the site of the former camp his group plans to
``re-sanctify'' the camp and recite prayers.
   About 100 young Austrians belonging to the ``New Austria'' group
of intellectuals who oppose Waldheim staged an anti-Waldheim
demonstration near the Hofburg Palace at 6:00 p.m. Thursday, one
hour before the pope met Waldheim there.
   The demonstrators tried to approach the palace but were
prevented by police who posted dozens of guards in the area.

   Here are some comments Thursday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, responding to news that the FBI is conducting a
preliminary investigation into site selection for a prison in New
Braintree, Mass.: ``The process was as open as it could possibly
be. ... We have very tough procedures for the acquisition of
property.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, after saying he has privately made a decision on
whether he will accept second place on the Democratic ticket but
saying he will not tell anyone, including Dukakis, what that
decision is: `` No. That would be public.''
   
   SHEILA TATE, Bush campaign spokeswoman, calling Dukakis a
tax-raiser after the Massachusetts governor announced his support
for $115 million of new state taxes: ``It's obvious that his
reaction is to tax. Instead of cutting (spending), he raised taxes.
It seems to speak for himself.''
   
   ANN LEWIS, former Democratic party political director and an
adviser to Jesse Jackson, on possible dissention at the party's
national covention over delegate-selection rules: ``He wants the
convention to make the changes for next time. ... He doesn't want

<HEAD>Scriptwriters Reject Latest Offer, Producers Maintain Rigid Stance</HEAD>

   Scriptwriters voted overwhelmingly
to continue their 4-month-old strike, threatening the fall TV
schedule and prompting layoffs and angry promises from both sides
not to compromise.
   Members of the Writers Guild of America voted 2,789-to-933, or
75 percent to 25 percent, to reject the latest contract offer by
the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the union
announced Thursday.
   With the exception of the few shows whose producers signed
contracts independent of the alliance, virtually all fall TV
entertainment programming is threatened by the strike. The
exceptions include ``The Cosby Show'' and ``The Tonight Show With
Johnny Carson.''
   The alliance reacted to the results of Wednesday night's vote by
saying it had nothing further to negotiate with the guild. Leaders
promised to push forward with television programming where
possible, and to begin layoffs where necessary.
   ``It's disastrous for the entire business,'' said Paul Junger
Witt, a guild member and co-executive producer of ``The Golden
Girls'' and ``Beauty and the Beast.''
   Layoff notices were issued almost simultaneously with the
announcement of the voting results. At Universal Studios, a memo
went out to employees Thursday announcing that the commissary would
close today. And more layoffs are planned.
   ``It's devastating,'' said Dan Slusser, senior vice president
and general manager of Universal City Studios Inc. ``We've already
made a number of cutbacks in the TV and studio operations group.''
   Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg said the guild vote was
emotional, rather than a serious appraisal of the offer.
   But union officials said producers' stubbornness caused the
strong rejection.
   ``The message to the companies is loud and clear,'' said Mona
Mangan, executive director of the Writers Guild, East. ``Our
members want a contract that resolves the key issues of the strike.
   ``If the companies end their inflexibility, which forced the
strike and prolonged it, we can end this strike quickly and put
everyone in our industry back to work,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, ``Late Night With David Letterman'' head writer Steve
O'Donnell said Thursday the talk show, which has been in reruns
because of the strike, will return to live telecast Tuesday night.
O'Donnell said the show is seeking a waiver contract with the
guild, but will resume without its writers if approval isn't
granted by then. He said the writers were supporting Letterman.
   Members of the 9,500-member guild went on strike March 7 over
the issues of residual payments for one-hour shows and programs
broadcast in foreign markets.
   Producers say their four-year contract offer would be worth an
extra $71 million to writers and includes an across-the-board
increase in residuals of 14.7 percent. Payments to writers now
total about $360 million a year, Steinberg said.
   The guild contends its negotiators accepted a flexible formula
for payment on one-hour televison shows sold for reruns but was not
rewarded with a more generous offer for shows sold overseas. The
union has linked the two items in an economic package.
   The guild said 104 independent waiver contracts have been
signed, but alliance officials contend most of those are small
producers with little impact on the industry.

<HEAD>CDC Updates Precautions For Health Care Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials say they believe health care
workers are heeding a set of recommended precautions designed to
protect them from potentially dangerous viruses, including the one
that causes AIDS.
   The recommendations dealing with patients' body fluids were
published last August and, in response to numerous questions from
health care workers across the country, clarified and updated in a
report issued Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control.
   Officials at the Atlanta-based CDC said the questions and other
signs indicate that people are paying attention to the
recommendations.
   ``We have not done any formal study. However, from what we hear,
health care workers are being more careful,'' said Julia S. Garner,
the CDC's chief of prevention activity.
   Use of protective gloves by health care workers, the main
emphasis of the CDC report, has increased to the point where there
is a shortage of the gloves, officials said.
   Ms. Garner said it was not clear how much can be attributed to
the government's recommendations and how much is simply the result
of generally heightened awareness of the AIDS epidemic.
   In addition, more care apparently is being taken in the disposal
of needles and other sharp objects, which Ms. Garner said is a
serious threat to transmit human immunodeficiency virus _ the virus
that causes AIDS _ and hepatitis B virus.
   The CDC recommends that needles, scalpels and other sharper
objects that come in contact with blood and other potentially
dangerous body fluids be disposed of in puncture-resistant
containers.
   ``Four years ago it was not unusual to see used needles in
cardboard boxes used to store supplies,'' Ms. Garner said.
   The 1987 report was updated to be more specific about what types
of fluids health care workers must protect themselves from and to
apply the precautions to hepatitis B as well as HIV, Ms. Garner
said. Officials also wanted to quell rumors that a certain type of
medical glove was inadequate.
   Gloves should be used whenever an individual might come in
contact with a patient's blood, the updated report said. Other
``universal precautions,'' such as gowns, masks and protective
eyewear, also are advised.
   Blood is ``the single most important'' source of HIV, hepatitis
B and other disease-causing micro-organisms and viruses, the CDC
said.
   Universal precautions also apply to tissues, semen, vaginal
secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid,
peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid and amniotic fluid, the CDC
said.
   Feces, nasal secretions, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and
vomitus do not require universal precautions, the CDC said, unless
they contain visible blood.
   Breast milk, though it has been implicated in the prenatal
transmission of HIV and hepatitis B virus, does not require the
high degree of precaution for health care workers, the CDC said.
However, those who have frequent exposure to breast milk should
consider wearing gloves.
   Gloves are not needed when feeding patients or wiping saliva
from skin, the CDC said, though gloves and handwashing are
recommended for such practices as digital examination of mucous
membranes.

<HEAD>Cuomo Expects No Quick Decision on Dukakis VP Choice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo says he doesn't
think likely Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis is
going to make a quick decision on his vice presidential running
mate.
   Cuomo Thursday said he came to that conclusion after a long
discussion with Paul Brountas, who's leading the effort to find a
suitable running mate for Dukakis, about the vice presidential
selection process and came away with the impression that it would
take awhile.
   ``They do not seem to me the kind of people who would make
precipitous judgments or very early judgments,'' said Cuomo. ``I
don't expect a quick decision.''
   Meanwhile, a political adviser to both Cuomo and Dukakis said
the New York governor had agreed to stump the nation in support of
the Massachusetts governor's Democratic presidential campaign.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis has the
early lead over Republican Vice President George Bush in the
presidential race in Missouri, according to the results of a recent
Missouri poll.
   According to the Missourinet poll, released Thursday, 47 percent
of the Missourians surveyed favored Dukakis and 37 percent
supported Bush.
   When asked how they would vote if Dukakis selected Jesse Jackson
as a running mate, 43 percent said they would back Bush and
whomever he selected for a running mate while 36 percent said they
would back the Democratic ticket.
   The survey consisted of 413 random telephone interviews
conducted between June 13-16 with Missourians over the age of 18
who are also registered to vote. The poll has a sampling error of
plus or minus 4 percent.

   Indiana Democrats have revised a compromise
in a dispute between two Lake County politicians who each claim the
right to represent Jesse Jackson at the national Democratic
convention next month in Atlanta.
   State Democratic Chairman John Livengood said Thursday both
former Gary Mayor Richard G. Hatcher, who is vice chairman of
Jackson's national campaign, and current Gary Mayor Thomas V.
Barnes will attend the convention as Jackson delegates.
   Under the new settlement Carlos Toliver, who had been teamed
with Hatcher and Barnes' partner, Rudolph Clay, a Lake County
commissioner would also go to Atlanta.
   Under the latest plan, all four will attend the convention and
the votes of four other Indiana delegates backing Jackson will be
cut in half to make room.

   Sen. Tom Harkin is defending Iowa's
precinct caucuses as a showcase for candidates with small
bankrolls, such as Jesse Jackson, and predicts Jackson's challenge
to Iowa's prominence in presidential politics would fail.
   ``I don't know what Jesse Jackson's so sore about. He did pretty
well in Iowa; without money he did pretty well,'' Harkin said
Thursday in a telephone news conference. ``If Jesse Jackson wants
to replace Iowa with the regional-type primaries he's been talking
about then when another Jesse Jackson comes along he wouldn't have
a prayer.''
   Jackson has proposed reducing the emphasis of Iowa on the
presidential selection process and giving more heavily populated
states an earlier say.

<TEXT>
   The dollar surged today to close the week at its
highest level in about four months against the Japanese yen, while
stock prices inched up after declining for five consecutive trading
days.
   After opening the day at 128.63, the dollar continued to climb
and closed at 129.70 yen, the day's high, up a sharp 1.15 yen from
Thursday's finish. It was the currency's highest level since late
February.
   ``Institutional investors and interbanks bought substantial
amounts of dollars in the late afternoon,'' said a foreign exchange
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said there was no obvious reason behind their moves.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
127.85 points Thursday, won back 17.46 points, or 0.06 percent, on
Friday. It closed at 27,750.39.
   ``The market was led mainly by large-capital issues on their
favorable prospects,'' said a stock analyst with a major commercial
securities house, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Traders said the market continued to reflect concerns about
interest rates and inflation. Issues such as blue chip electricals
that should benefit from the stronger dollar have not been able to
sustain gains over the past few sessions.
   The Nikkei index lost a total of 609.53 points during the week.
   Volume of the first section trade was estimated at 1.6 billion
shares, up from 1 billion shares Thursday.
   Among the gainers were steels and non-ferrous metals. Losers
include marine transportations, shipbuildings, and machineries.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Will Negotiate With Vietnam, But Doubts Troop Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk said today he will take part in peace talks with
Vietnamese officials next month but expressed doubt about Hanoi's
planned withdrawal of troops from Cambodia.
   ``I'm in favor of dialogue. I am not Mr. Nyet. I am Mr. Da. I'm
not going to say no to anybody,'' Sihanouk said at Beijing's
airport.
   He left today for Bangkok to attend a meeting of the foreign
ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a
principal backer of the three-party anti-Vietnam coalition that
Sihanouk heads. He is also likely to meet Secretary of State George
Shultz, who will be in Bangkok for the conference.
   Sihanouk said he will ``say always `yes' to all proposals'' that
would lead to a settlement of the Cambodian conflict and called
plans for informal peace talks to be held next month in Jakarta a
``good thing.''
   Vietnam has said it will also attend the ``cocktail party''
talks in Jakarta.
   ``I am interested in solving the problem of Kampuchea so with or
without the Vietnamese in Jakarta I'm going to attend,'' he said.
``The composition of the participants has no importance.''
   The ``cocktail party'' would bring together for the first time
the rival factions of the three-party resistance, representatives
from Vietnam and from the Hanoi-installed Cambodian government.
   Sihanouk also said he was willing to meet with Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen. He broke off talks with Hun Sen in Paris earlier
this year, accusing him of being a puppet of the Vietnamese.
   ``I will talk to the Vietnamese, to Hun Sen, to everybody,''
Sihanouk said. ``The most important thing is to start the process
of examining the problem and trying to exchange views and having
discussion.''
   The resistance coalition, made up of Sihanouk, the Communist
Khmer Rouge and the non-Communist forces of Son Sann, is calling
for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops that have occupied Cambodia
since late 1978. The group also wants the formation of a four-party
government that would include Hun Sen.
   Vietnam has said that it will pull out 50,000 troops this year
and the remainder of its estimated force of 120,000 by 1990, but
Sihanouk said he feared the troops would only be rotated.
   ``I don't believe it is true,'' he said. ``That must be rather a
rotation of troops rather than a genuine withdrawal. The Vietnamese
cannot afford to withdraw ... because the Hun Sen regime would
collapse.''
   Vietnam's pullout, which is to begin this month, has renewed
concern about the return of the Communist Khmer Rouge, which killed
a million or more people before being ousted by Hanoi.
   Sihanouk denied Western news reports that China had offered to
give asylum to Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot in an attempt to help
solve the Cambodian conflict.
   China on Thursday called the reports ``highly irresponsible''
and ``absolutely groundless.''

   After 26 years of Buddhist passivity
and private grumbling, opponents of Burma's authoritarian regime
are taking to the streets in violent protest.
   Since October, students have mobilized demonstrations three
times, causing deaths, mass arrests and long university closures.
Nine people were killed this week in the latest, ongoing street
confrontations in Rangoon, the Burmese capital, officials said.
   The students are demanding release of detainees and legalization
of their unions.
   However, Western diplomats in Rangoon and knowledgeable Burmese
observers say the outbursts reflect deep-rooted disillusionment
with a regime that has monopolized power for a quarter century.
During that time, it has led the resource-rich Southeast Asian
nation to economic ruin and isolation.
   In an unprecedented admission of failure, strongman U Ne Win
last year called on the state to ``pinpoint the disease'' and
lifted controls on the vital rice trade. There was also talk of
constitutional change but little to indicate Ne Win's party would
throw out the basic tenants of his rule: rigid socialist economics,
isolationism and single-party control backed by the powerful
military.
   ``No real reform has yet been made, although there has been some
small-scale tinkering with the economy,'' wrote a leading American
Burma scholar, Josef Silverstein, recently. ``The economy's
downward spiral remains unchecked.
   Despite the unprecedented surge of opposition, there have been
no predictions so far that anything but old age or ill health will
topple the 78-year-old leader.
   While ordinary citizens have joined students in some
demonstrations, there has been no sign of a meaningful and
organized opposition to Ne Win among the military, bureaucracy or
influential Buddhist monkhood.
   The activist students themselves have shown little evidence of
planning and coordination, although the Rangoon-centered protests
have been touching off minor disturbances elsewhere in the country.
   Ne Win, who came to power in a 1962 military coup, has in the
past systematically rooted out opponents and dealt harshly with the
few open protests he faced. Rarely seen in public and never
interviewed by the press, Ne Win is said to be a superb and highly
intelligent political infighter and a strong nationalist.
   But beyond a neutralist foreign policy that has paid dividends,
his overall record as national leader is badly marred.
   ``He has lost whatever lingering support he may have had. People
now realize the government has never had their interests in mind,''
said one Western diplomat in Rangoon last year. He made the comment
after the government took about 60 percent of the kyat currency out
of circulation without explanation or compensation.
   Burmese in the streets talked of ``official robbery.'' Angry
students spilled out of their campuses in the first rioting since
1974.
   Analysts regarded the reaction to the demonetization as a
watershed event.
   It coincided with a nosedive of the already weak economy that
continues even now.
   Once the world's largest rice exporter and an oil producer,
Burma has suffered spot food shortages and has had to import
petroleum products. Regarded as potentially the richest nations in
Southeast Asia because of its vast natural resources, Burma _ with
a per capita annual income of less than $200 _ ranks among the
world's ten poorest nations.
   Although the state officially controls much of the economy, a
black market actually accounts for two-thirds or more of the
transactions. The government must spend a third of its budget on
fighting a welter of ethnic minorities seeking autonomy and another
big chunk on servicing a foreign debt of about $3.5 billion dollars.
   Observers have long said that one lid on protest in Burma was
its fertile soil and a low population _ currently about 38 million.
   Another widely accepted theory was that Burma's deeply rooted
Buddhism fostered an acceptance of suffering as one's ''karma,'' or
fate, and deference to authority figures.
   A final factor may be Burma's state-imposed isolation from much
of the world. With few real friends and no real enemies, outside
pressures for change have been minimal.

<HEAD>Chief Minister Resigns After By-Election Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief minister of India's most
populous state resigned today, eight days after Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi's ruling Congress Party lost a critical election to a
rising Gandhi opponent.
   Chief Minister Bir Bahadur Singh, the highest-ranking elected
official in Uttar Pradesh, tendered his resignation after a meeting
Thursday night with Gandhi, the United News of India reported.
   A second resignation was expected today from the chief minister
of western Maharashtra state, UNI said.
   The minister there, S.B. Chavan, has been accused by party
members of failing to deal with rising opposition groups, including
Shiv Sena, which was set up to protect Hindu rights. Shiv Sena has
won control of the government in the state capital at Bombay.
   Congress Party committees were scheduled to meet in both states
late today to select successors.
   Both moves were intended to strength the Congress Party hold on
the populous states in advance of national elections, which must be
held before January 1990.
   Uttar Pradesh has more than 120 million people. Maharashtra has
nearly 70 million. India's total population is about 800 million.
   The Congress Party suffered a major setback in Uttar Pradesh in
elections June 16.
   Former Defense Minister V.P. Singh, an independent running with
the backing of major opposition parties, defeated the Congress
Party candidate by a 2-to-1 margin.
   V.P. Singh resigned from Gandhi's Cabinet last year after
revealing that he was launching investigations into possible
kickbacks on Indian defense contracts.
   Indian newspapers and opposition parties have alleged that some
of the funds may have gone to Gandhi supporters. Gandhi and his
party leaders have denied any wrongdoing.
   Gandhi's Congress Party won a landslide victory in national
elections in 1984, largely on a sympathy vote after the prime
minister's mother and predecessor, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated.
   Since then, his party has lost 10 of 14 state elections.
   In the latest by-election, Congress won only two seats of the
seven being contested, while the opposition won three. Results have
not yet been announced in two districts because of allegations of
vote rigging.
   The Congress Party had held all seven seats going into the
election.

<TEXT>
   The defense has subpoenaed U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese III as a witness in the Wedtech Corp. corruption trial
of Rep. Mario Biaggi and six others.
   Although Meese was served with the subpoena Thursday, it is up
to the judge presiding over Biaggi's racketeering trial whether the
attorney general will be required to testify.
   A Justice Department spokesman in Washington, Patrick Korten,
confirmed that Meese had been subpoenaed and that the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan would argue today or Monday against
requiring Meese to appear.
   ``There is no testimony that the attorney general can provide
that is relevant,'' said Korten.
   Biaggi, his eldest son and five others are accused of turning
Wedtech, a now-bankrupt defense contractor, into a racketeering
enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to secure
no-bid government contracts.
   Wedtech grew from a small machine shop in the impoverished South
Bronx into a $100-million-a-year business through a series of
no-bid contracts set aside for companies controlled by minority
group members.
   Prosecutors charge Biaggi and the other defendants helped
Wedtech obtain those contracts through bribery and fraud and then
allegedly extorted 5 percent of Wedtech's stock as payment.
   The defense has maintained that corrupt Wedtech officials had
numerous connections with Reagan administration insiders like
Meese, Meese's former personal lawyer, E. Robert Wallach and former
White House aide Lyn Nofziger.
   With friends like that in a Republican administration, the
defense claims, ``there was simply no logical reason to bribe Mario
Biaggi,'' a Bronx Democrat, for help in obtaining government
contracts.
   Dominic Amorosa, attorney for Biaggi's son Richard, claimed the
testimony of Meese and a former Meese aide ``will establish that it
was they and others, and not Richard Biaggi and his father, who
corruptly acted on behalf of Wedtech.''
   In a letter to U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley on
Monday, Amorosa sought her approval for testimony by Meese and
James Jenkins, a former Meese aide when he was presidential
counsel. Jenkins was subpoenaed Wednesday night at his Carmichael,
Calif. home.
   Jenkins chaired a crucial 1982 White House meeting on Wedtech's
problems in securing a $32 million no-bid Army engine contract.
Wedtech got the contract several months later. Jenkins left the
White House in 1984 and became a consultant for Wedtech in 1985.
   Korten said Meese ``had but one thing that he did and that is
that he asked that they (Wedtech officials) be given a fair
hearing'' by the Army.
   Meese, who has been under fire from members of Congress for his
legal difficulties and beset by the resignations of several key
aides, has not been charged with any wrongdoing concerning Wedtech.

   A raging fire with temperatures up to
5,400 degrees burned out of control today after three gas tanks
exploded, killing two people in this northeastern industrial city,
officials said.
   Officials said the heat of the blaze melted several cars and the
fire's glow could be seen up to 10 miles away.
   The blasts and the fire also injured 20 people. Authorities said
six of them were in very serious condition early today.
   The blaze started after three tanks exploded one after another
at the San Rafael tank farm belonging to Pemex, the state petroleum
monopoly.
   The flames, shooting more than 100 feet in the air, forced the
evacuation of more than 10,000 people from nearby homes.
   Nuevo Leon state judiciary police director Hernan Guajardo
Garza, who visited the site, said at times the fire reached 5,400
degrees Fahrenheit, or 3,000 degrees Celsius, and turned several
nearby vehicles into molten metal.
   Firemen, rushed in from all around the area, were finally able
to douse the flames in two tanks late Thursday using special
equipment with 50-foot pipes that can shoot chemical foam at a
great distance. A third tanks continued to burn.
   The equipment was flown in from Ciudad Madero, 280 miles away on
the Gulf of Mexico coast, Pemex spokesman Guillermo Guevara said.
He said firemen expected to control the flames in the third tank
early today.
   Guevara and Nuevo Leon state press secretary Raul de la Garza,
who spoke at a joint news conference Thursday night in Monterrey,
said there were no immediate clues as to what started the fire on
the 23-tank farm but that an investigation was under way.
   The private television network Televisa quoted Pemex officials
as saying the explosions and fire were caused by stray sparks from
welding equipment being used nearby.
   An explosion and fire May 24 at Pemex's gas and kerosene supply
depot in the northern city of Chihuahua was blamed on a spark set
off during the installation of firefighting equipment. No one was
hurt then, but more than 100,000 people were forced to evacuate
their homes for a day.
   Guevara said the 23 tanks were loaded with a total of 2.26
million gallons of gasoline and diesel oil when Thursday's disaster
occurred.
   The tank-farm, employing 250 workers, is used as a retail
distribution center for Monterrey and the northeastern region.
Monterrey is the country's third largest city with a metropolitan
population of 2.8 million people and one of its main industrial
centers.
   The explosion and fire set off panic among residents of
Guadalupe, a small city on Monterrey's outskirts about 440 miles
north of Mexico City.
   People fled their homes even before the state government ordered
the area evacuated at mid-afternoon Thursday. About 10 government
and private shelters were packed with an estimated 8,000 people who
spent the night there, some looking for lost relatives.
   Raquel Garcia Monrial, 35, begged for help finding her
7-year-old daughter.
   ``We heard the explosion and ran from the house,'' she said,
with tears streaming down her checks, searching through one shelter.
   ``The street was full of people, and my daughter got away from
me,'' Ms. Garcia said. ``It was terrible. People were screaming and
crying. The flames were so big.''
   Antonio Bernal, 36, searched frantically through an auditorium
packed with about 300 people at the Guadalupe Exposition grounds.
``I can't find my son. He's 10 years old,'' he said. ``All the
children were in the house, and I guess he ran out. It was pure
panic.''
   ``People left their houses wide open and just ran,'' he added.
   The state Integral Family Development agency brought in
emergency shipments of food and blankets at several locations, but
one director said the organization's main job was to help family
members locate each other.
   ``The people are very disoriented,'' said Yolanda Elizondo de
Lopez, Guadalupe, the agency president. ``At one place, we have 200
names of missing people.''
   People rested on the floor on blankets or lined up for plates of
sandwiches, rice and beans at the Guadalupe shelter.
   ``Tomorrow, I'm going to go stay with some friends, but right
now I just don't feel like going anywhere. We're pretty nervous,''
said Celia Mendoza, who sat on the floor holding her two small boys.
   Ms. Mendoza said she was on a bus near the plant when the
explosion occurred. ``People were climbing all over each other to
get out. It was a mess,'' she said.
   About 200 army infantry soldiers cordoned off a five-mile area
around the tank farm. Police patrolling inside detained 40 people
for questioning after they were found loitering near the evacuated
homes, the government news agency Notimex said.

   Treasure hunters killed a 4-year-old boy
in central India because they believed that by sacrificing the
child they would find hidden loot, the United News of India
reported today.
   The news agency said the boy disappeared from his home last
Saturday in the village of Panchampur Sarseni.
   The village is near the town of Gwalior, 210 miles north of the
Madhya Pradesh state capital at Bhopal.
   UNI quoted police as saying the boy was lured by a neighbor to a
hidden site where a treasure was believed buried. He was killed at
the site, but no treasure was found.
   The boy's body was later found on the outskirts of the village,
the news agency said.
   Three villagers have been arrested in connection with the case,
UNI said.
   Human sacrifice is outlawed in India, but it sometimes occurs in
remote villages where superstitions run high.

<DATELINE>MAYAGUEZ, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cuban resident of Miami has been
charged with first degree murder in connection with a bomb blast
that killed another Miami resident on the west coast of Puerto Rico.
   Antonio Alfredo Gonzalez Olmeda, 25, faces one count of murder
stemming from the death of Jeff Parker, 33, who was killed when an
explosive device blew up while he was apparently assembling it
inside a car.
   Gonzalez Olmeda was charged Thursday.
   Gonzalez Olmeda, who was standing beside the car and received
face and upper body injuries, will be charged with murder under the
felony murder rule, according to assistant district attorney Eric
Velazquez. The rule applies when someone died in the commission of
a felony.
   He was also charged with damages and explosives law violations.
   Bail for Gonzalez Olmeda, who was still hospitalized, was set in
absentia at $790,000.
   Investigators did not disclose the target of the attack.
   The explosion took place about 1:40 a.m. Monday in the town of
Mayaguez, 100 miles from the capital San Juan.
   A briefcase found in the trunk of the car, which was rented,
contained a digital remote control detonator, officials said. It
also held airline tickets for a Monday afternoon flight to Miami,
and an Immigration and Naturalization Service card and driver's
licence, both in Gonzalez Olmeda's name.

<TEXT>
   A jailhouse lawyer tried to prove that he
``died'' on the operating table during open-heart surgery and
therefore completed his life sentence for murder, but a
disbelieving judge ordered him back to prison.
   ``Law is interesting,'' Cayuga County Judge Peter Corning said,
trying to suppress a smile after hearing convict Jerry Rosenberg's
argument Thursday.
   Corning ruled that Rosenberg, 49, did not meet the Court of
Appeals' 1984 definition of death: a lack of brain activity or an
irreversible halt in heart and lung activity.
   ``As his presence in this courtroom indicates ... he did not
die,'' Corning said.
   Rosenberg, who has earned several law degrees from
correspondence schools during his 25 years in prison, said before
the ruling that he planned to appeal if he lost. After the
decision, guards from Auburn Correctional Facility escorted him
from the courtroom.
   Rosenberg contended that he died when his heart stopped during
the 1986 bypass operation. Doctors restarted his heart.
   He tried to convince Corning that the definition of death was
ambiguous and that there were two kinds of death, reversible and
irreversible.
   ``The higher courts, the Supreme Court has never defined death.
They've defined life,'' Rosenberg said before a crowded courtroom.
``Reversible death, which is a medical term, means they bring you
back from death to life, not life to life.''
   However, Assistant Attorney General Ken Goldman presented
affidavits countering Rosenberg's claim from three doctors,
including Dr. Leslie Kohman, who operated on the convict.
   Having a patient's heart stop during a bypass operation does not
``represent an untoward occurence,'' Kohman wrote.
   Corning asked Rosenberg if he believed that everyone whose heart
stopped during heart surgery should be considered legally dead.
Rosenberg said yes.
   The judge said that under Rosenberg's theory, everyone who has
heart surgery could collect on his or her life insurance policy, be
declared divorced and have estates probated.
   ``Yes, yes,'' said Rosenberg. ``I know this is far-reaching and
I'm opening up a can of ... not worms, but boa constrictors.''
   Rosenberg was convicted in 1963 of murder in the killing of two
police officers in New York City, and was sentenced to death, but
managed to find a legal loophole and have his sentence commuted to
life.
   While in prison, he has filed lawsuits ranging from a successful
appeal for a Mafia kingpin to a child custody request for a fellow
convict.
   Rosenberg has another lawsuit pending in federal court in
Syracuse in which he claims he's being denied proper medical
treatment and access to the media.

   A new National Weather Service forecast for
the Colorado Rockies eastward through the Central Plains, the lower
Midwest and the Middle Atlantic states is for more of the same hot,
dry weather for the rest of June.
   In its first ``drought advisory'' of the year, the service on
Thursday forecast below-normal rainfall from the Central Plains to
Illinois and Indiana, although surrounding areas may have closer to
normal precipitation.
   The Climate Analysis Center issues drought advisories when lack
of rain has continued over a large area for several weeks and the
forecast fails to indicate any upcoming rain.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, meanwhile, told President
Reagan on Thursday that it is too early for emergency relief
measures to deal with effects of the drought.
   ``Despite the serious potential effects of the drought, the
secretary said rainfall in the next two weeks would alleviate much
of the potential damage,'' Deputy White House Press Secretary B.
Jay Cooper said.
   Vice President George Bush, however, said in a separate
statement, ``If conditions continue to deteriorate, money that has
been saved in this year's farm programs will be redirected to farm
families as disaster relief for the rural economy.''
   The weather service noted in its advisory that the period from
April 1 to June 1 was among the driest since 1920 in the North
Central states, although not yet as dry as in 1934.
   The center also expressed concern about conditions in the
Southeast, where a dry spell has prevailed for nearly four years,
and in the Mississippi-Missouri watershed.
   Since April 1, less than 50 percent of normal precipitation has
occurred in an area stretching from the states on the Gulf of
Mexico to the northern border.
   Drought conditions have been gradually worsening over the
northern Great Plains and Rockies, the Tennessee and Ohio valleys,
the southern Appalachians, California, the interior Pacific
Northwest and northern Maine, the statement noted.
   The Climate Analysis Center regularly issues 30- and 90-day
national forecasts but rarely issues special statements such as the
drought advisory.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty liberal lawmakers from the governing
Nationalist Party proposed today that Taiwan improve its almost
non-existent relations with Communist China.
   The legislators, who were elected delegates to upcoming party
congress in July, issued a statement urging the Nationalist Party
to map out a ``positive and forward-looking'' policy toward China.
   It said the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, should ``adopt an
open and realistic attitude to promote more exchanges and
contacts'' with China.
   The Nationalists have refused all official contact with the
rival Communist government in Beijing since 1949, when they fled to
Taiwan after losing a civil war on the Chinese mainland. Both
governments claim to be the rightful ruler of both Taiwan and the
Chinese mainland.
   Last year, the Nationalists lifted a ban on travel to China to
allow family reunions. The party's policy-making Central Standing
Committee proposed last week to allow mainland Chinese studying
overseas to visit Taiwan but ruled out cultural and athletic
exchanges with China.
   The legislators demanded that the party allow the 1,200 party
delegates to decide on a new policy toward China rather than
``rubber-stamping'' a resolution made by the Central Standing
Committee.
   The statement urged the government to also allow sightseeing,
cultural and athletic exchanges.
   ``We should open up gradually,'' the statement said. ``The next
phase of development should depend on how the Chinese Communists
respond'' to Taiwan's relaxation of its policy.
   The Nationalist government wants China to promise that it won't
use force to unite the two and stop isolating the island
diplomatically.
   Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with 22 countries and has
withdrawn from most international organizations because of China's
objection.
   In a related development, Taiwan announced today that it had
rejected a request by a state-run research group to attend an
international science meeting in Beijing.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Yu-chu told a press conference
that the Cabinet would not allow Academia Sinica of Taiwan to send
a delegation to the 22nd annual meeting of the International
Council of Scientific Unions in September.

<TEXT>
   Zapping freshly laundered underpants in
the microwave may prevent the recurring yeast infections that
plague millions of women, researchers say.
   A five-minute microwave treatment at high power kills the fungus
that causes vaginal infections in 20 million women yearly, said
Byron J. Masterson, chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the
University of Florida.
   The underwear must be cotton and still damp, he warned. ``Not
your Frederick's of Hollywood _ no-no,'' Masterson said. ``The
bunny suits would probably go ka-boom in your microwave.''
   Yeast infections can cause irritation and discharge.
   The study was published recently in the Journal of Reproductive
Medicine.
   Previous studies have found that yeast, or candida albicans,
survives laundering in detergent, even in hot water. That's because
candida is killed at 154 to 163 degrees, while household water
heaters are set at about 120 degrees.
   ``Undergarments are contaminated, and regular washing doesn't
seem to kill it,'' Raymond Kaufman, an obstetrician-gynecologist at
Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said Thursday. He did not
take part in the University of Florida study.
   ``Most people carry candida; it's a very common organism. Most
women who develop vaginal infections (can be treated) very
effectively with drugs 80 percent of the time,'' Kaufman said.
   ``But you've got a percentage who keep getting reinfected over
and over. We see this commonly in diabetic women'' or those whose
immune systems are below par.
   Other studies have shown that boiling underpants kills the
yeast. ``But how many women do you know are going to boil their
underwear?'' Masterson asked.

   Gov. Michael Dukakis says any suggestion that his
administration acted improperly in selecting a prison site in a
small Massachusetts town is ``unfortunate and regrettable.''
   And Dukakis administration officials are questioning whether
political motivations lay behind the revelation that the FBI is
looking into the selection process. In publicly acknowledging the
probe, the FBI broke its usual policy of neither confirming nor
denying the existence of investigations.
   A bureau spokesman in Washington, Bill Carter, said Thursday the
reason for the exception was that this case could appear to
implicate a presidential candidate. Dukakis is all but assured the
Democratic presidential nomination.
   The bureau released a statement saying Dukakis was not the
subject of the probe. But spokeswoman Sue Schnitzer added that the
inquiry has yet to reach the stage where any individual would be
identified as a subject of investigation.
   Bureau spokesmen declined to say whether any information
implicating Dukakis had been discovered. Dukakis said no
administration official has been contacted or subpoenaed by the FBI.
   Some residents of the town of New Braintree have accused Dukakis
of cronyism in his support for purchasing land there for the
prison. The governor told reporters Thursday that his
administration had been ``as open as it could possibly be'' about
the prison controversy.
   ``Any suggestions that the secretary of human services and his
staff proceeded other than in accordance with the law and strict
standards of integrity are unfortunate and regrettable,'' Dukakis
told reporters.
   Dukakis administration officials on Thursday questioned whether
the Reagan administration might have engineered publicity over the
probe, the first report of which appeared Thursday in The
Washington Times.
   ``I think it's very curious,'' said John DeVillars, a top
Dukakis aide, adding: ``I would certainly be interested in what
U.S. Attorney (Frank) McNamara has to say.''
   McNamara, a former Republican candidate for Congress, is a
Reagan appointee. He declined comment on the probe on Thursday.
   Those who accuse the Dukakis administration of tailoring a deal
on the prison site point to the fact that the co-owners of the
782-acre property are longtime acquaintances of the governor and
one co-owner has contributed to Dukakis' presidential campaign.
   A Norwood, Mass., development firm owned by Daniel Striar and
Gary Jacobson purchased the land from the Seventh-day Adventist
Church in December 1985 for $3 million. Jacobson was a boyhood
neighbor of Dukakis.
   Dukakis said he was unaware who owned the land at the time he
approved it as a prison site.
   But The Boston Globe reported in today's editions that
Selectwoman Dorothea Thomas-Vitrac, a member the governing board of
New Braintree, said Dukakis was told the names of the people who
owned the land at a meeting with town residents in the governor's
office May 6, 1986.
   Jacobson and Striar purchased the land a month after the state
listed the land as a possible prison site. A later state-funded
appraisal of the property in 1986 valued the land at $8.7 million.
   That appraisal led critics of the plan to complain that the site
owners were going to make millions. Dukakis said Thursday that the
state would release its final appraisal of the land in the next 10
days, and hinted it would be considerably less than $8.7 million.
   In February 1987, Jacobson and Striar offered to sell the land
to the state for $9.5 million, more than three times the purchase
price.
   Jacobson has been a contributor to Dukakis' political campaigns.
He and his wife each contributed $1,000 to Dukakis' presidential
campaign this year, the maximum allowed by law.
   A secretary said Jacobson, a physician, was seeing patients and
was unable to return a reporter's phone call. Striar is on vacation
and could not be reached.
   New Braintree has a population of 800. The $22 million prison
would hold 500 inmates.
   Dukakis has been dogged by opponents of the prison plan while
campaigning for the Democratic nomination. Residents have held
protests and lobbied lawmakers against the prison proposal.
   Thomas-Vitrac, one the strongest opponents to the prison, said
she has been questioned at least twice by FBI agents beginning last
March. The selectmen have been independently seeking a probe, first
with the state attorney general and, last March, with the U.S.
attorney.
   Thomas-Vitrac said she has turned over to the FBI a box of
documents relating to the case. She has received through requests
under the Freedom of Information Act documents relating to the
prison site.
   But the Dukakis administration has refused to release two
documents she wants. One is an October 1986 memo to Dukakis' chief
legal counsel Stephen Rosenfeld from an aide the day before the
Adventists announced that Striar and Jacobson were potential buyers
of the property. Another, dated Dec. 2, 1985, were sent from
Rosenfeld to Dukakis the day before the actual sale of the property.
   An index of documents released by the administration indicated
the author, recipient and subject of the memos.
   ``There are some documents in this administration we don't
release publicly on grounds of executive privilege,'' Dukakis said.

   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the drought
and weather picture:
   _U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng met with 10 Midwestern
governors Thursday in Chicago to discuss the drought. The
farm-state governors warned that the drought is seriously affecting
food production.
   _The National Weather Service's six-to-10-day weather outlook
for the Plains and Midwest extended an earlier forecast for hot,
dry weather.
   _Crews dredged the drought-shrunken Mississippi River around the
clock to free hundreds of backed-up barges.
   _The extremely low levels of the Mississippi are allowing a
wedge of saltwater to push upriver from the Gulf of Mexico. It
could affect marshland wildlife, the seafood industry and cities
that draw drinking water from the river.
   _In St. Louis, the medical examiner's office said that a
99-year-old woman whose body was found in a sweltering bedroom
Wednesday had died from heat.
   _South Dakota fire crews near the Montana line contained a
forest fire that burned about 5,300 acres.
   _Eighteen firefighters were injured in Montana when a blaze that
consumed at least 11,000 acres of woodland flared up again Thursday
night.
   _Crews contained a 10,000-acre blaze in Utah that was believed
to have been sparked by weapons tests by the military.
   _Congressional advocates of income guarantees for America's
drought-plagued farmers predicted it would take weeks to fashion a
bill.
   _The worsening drought outlook has prompted an ``alarming''
number of calls from troubled farm families, say congressmen and
mental health officials.
   _In Alabama, state officials warned that unless water use
declines, shortages will force people to rely on water hauled by
the National Guard.

   Student protesters abandoned Burma's
holiest Buddhist shrine, its trustees said, but authorities kept
guard around the reopened complex and other major temples in the
capital today.
   The heightened security culminated a week of tension and
student-led rioting. Officials said nine people died in street
violence, and the government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew,
closed institutions of higher learning and prohibited all public
meetings.
   Buddhist pilgrims reported Thursday that students had moved into
the sprawling hilltop Shwedagon Pagoda, a centuries-old marvel of
golden spires and stupas, to set up a ``strike center'' that would
coordinate anti-government protests.
   However, pilgrims who entered the pagoda after it was reopened
today said they found no trace of student demonstrators.
   Pagoda trustees who spoke on condition of anonymity said
university students arrived in groups at the shrine on Wednesday
afternoon and probably mingled with worshippers before the 6:00
p.m. government curfew.
   The students were also said to have left later that day, though
it was not clear whether they too were observing the curfew or
departed for some other reason.
   The trustees said security officials searched the temple grounds
Wednesday night and barred public access Thursday.
   The week's protests have also caused classes to be suspended at
schools in Mandalay, the country's second largest city.
Anti-government protests have also been reported in Pegu, north of
Rangoon, and in Moulmein, on the southeastern seacoast.
   Since October, the 26-year-old regime of strongman U Ne Win has
been rocked by three violent protests in Rangoon and smaller ones
in other parts of the country.
   Diplomatic and other sources says lack of personal freedoms and
a downward spiraling economy are fueling unrest.
   Buddhist pagodas in Burma have traditionally been centers of
political protest. In 1920, Rangoon students moved into the
Shwedagon grounds to launch agitation against the British, who were
then the colonial rulers in Burma.
   The posting of guards at Sule, Botataung and other shrines today
was viewed as a measure to prevent activists from entering the
Buddhist holy places, where violence of any kind is forbidden.
   Traffic increased in Rangoon today and all markets were open,
although fewer shoppers were seen.
   Last week, students at several institutions had peacefully
demonstrated for release of detained students and legalization of
student unions. Violence broke out after the government responded
by closing the schools.
   On Tuesday, about 5,000 students and other protesters fought
police with stones.
   Last March, police and military units brutally suppressed a
similar demonstration, arresting hundreds and killing what Western
diplomats put at possibly up to 100 protesters.

<HEAD>Britain Says No Hostage Deals With Iran, Newspaper Predicts
Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Secetary Sir Geoffrey Howe denounced any
bargain for release of British hostages in Lebanon, while a Middle
Eastern newspaper said it had obtained reports that those captives
would soon be freed.
   Howe spoke Thursday amid rising hopes that a recent series of
contacts between Britain and Iran could lead to the early return of
a British diplomat to Tehran and negotiations for the British
hostages.
   But he told the Association of American Correspondents that this
week's private visit of four British lawmakers to Tehran had not
changed Britain's policicies toward Iran or the hostages.
   The Parliamentary delegation, the first to visit Iran since the
1979 revolution, said Wednesday that Iran had agreed to use its
influence to try to obtain the release of the British hostages. The
delegation urged Britain to post a diplomat to Tehran.
   Meanwhile, the Al-Khaleej newspaper in Sharjah, United Arab
Emirates, reported Thursday that Church of England envoy Terry
Waite and some other hostages held in Lebanon have been taken to
Iran, where they will be freed soon.
   The publication, which is usually reliable, quoted ``informed
Lebanese sources'' in its front-page report, which said the other
hostages involved ``are believed to be British too.''
   The daily said Waite and the other hostages were moved from
their kidnappers' hideouts in the Shiite Moslem-dominated slums of
south Beirut by Iranian Revolutionary Guards last month.
   The Guards had been fighting alongside guerrillas of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, against the Syrian-backed
Shiite Amal militia.
   They left south Beirut under the cease-fire brokered by Syria
and Iran that ended three weeks of fierce fighting, al-Khaleej
reported.
   It said the Guards took Waite and the other captives first to
the Syrian capital of Damascus and then to Tehran.
   It was not clear whether the Syrians were aware the hostages
were being moved.
   The daily said the captives ``are expected to be released within
the coming few days.''
   However, other reports have said the hostages are held in a
Hezbollah barracks ringed by Syrian troops in south Beirut.
   Mohammad Akhoond Zadeh Basti, Iran's charge d'affaires in
London, said Wednesday night he was ``very optimistic'' that the
improvement in diplomatic relations could lead to the release of
Waite, journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan.
   But Howe said Britain's relations with Iran remained ``at a very
low ebb'' because of ``the shameful way'' in which British diplomat
Edward Chaplin was abducted and beaten by Iranian agents in Tehran
May 28, 1987. Britain reduced its ties with Iran to a caretaker
status following the incident and ordered its diplomats home.
   The foreign secretary stressed that the Parliamentary mission
was organized by Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie of the
Church of England _ not the government.
   Waite, McCarthy and Keenan are among 18 foreign hostages held in
Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16,
1985.
   France and Iran named ambassadors to each other's countries
Thursday, one week after restoring diplomatic relations. The
appointments were linked to the return of the last three French
hostages from Lebanon.

<HEAD>Cool Air Brings Relief to Northeast; Heat Continues Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cool Canadian air settled over the Northeast early today, but a
heat wave that gripped much of the nation showed no sign of easing.
   On Thursday, 26 cities recorded record high temperatures for the
date, while another nine tied record highs. Tucson, Ariz., had the
nation's high with 113 degrees.
   Early today, temperatures were mostly in the 40s and 50s from
Pennsylvania and New York through New England. Readings in the 50s
also were common over northeast Minnesota, Michigan and eastern
Ohio.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over eastern Montana,
the southern San Joaquin Valley in California, northeast Arizona,
New Mexico and southeast Colorado, where nearly an inch of rain
fell Thursday night and flooded some streets in Colorado Springs.
   A few showers and thunderstorms lingered over southeast
Minnesota, eastern Iowa, southern Wisconsin, southeast Virginia and
northern North Carolina, where winds gusted to 47 mph Thursday
night at Durham.
   Heavier rainfall during the six-hour period ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included a half-inch at Knob Noster, Mo.; nearly a half-inch at
Mason City, Iowa; and about a quarter-inch at Norfolk Naval Air
Station, Va., and Evansville, Ind.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 43
degrees at Massena and Watertown, N.Y., Bradford, Pa., and
Limestone, Maine, to 99 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
over the upper Mississippi Valley and upper Michigan; scattered
thunderstorms from southern Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast;
and scattered thunderstorms over the southern and central Plateau
region and the southern Rockies in the afternoon.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the upper 80s or 90s
across much of the nation. Highs were forecast for the 60s and 70s
along the Pacific Coast and in New England; the 70s from the Great
Lakes to the middle Atlantic Coast; 100 to 105 degrees over the
central Plains and Arkansas, as well as parts of California,
southern Oregon, southwest Idaho and western Colorado; and 100 to
115 degrees across the desert Southwest.

   With knuckles down and backs to the wind,
two 12-year-olds became the king and queen of marbles in the 65th
annual National Marbles Tournament.
   Shannon Capasso of Pittsburgh and Dan Strohecker of Reading,
Pa., were crowned Thurday after winning the best of 15 matches in
the final round of competition on the beach in this vacation
community.
   Both credited their ability to maintain a ``spin'' on their
``shooter,'' the main marble used to send seven of 13 marbles
hurling out of a 10-foot ring. Squatting _ with knee pads _ on
concrete platforms in the steamy air, the final competitors in the
girls and boys categories nervously wiped their sweaty hands on
towels and blew on their shooter marble to cool it.
   They reached their spots after competing since Monday against 42
other contestants from 10 states, including Michigan, Iowa and
Georgia.
   Shannon and Dan each won a giant trophy, a plaque, a $2,000
college scholarship and a medal. Seated on wooden ``thrones'' set
on a beach platform, they rejected the tradition of kissing each
other, and instead smirked and shook hands.
   Last year, the future of the marbles tournament appeared
uncertain because a sponsor could not be found. This year, an Iowa
company that manufactures a marbles game, Creative Athletic
Products Inc., not only boosted the scholarships but helped pay
each contestant's room and board, said Eugene Mason, the
tournament's director.
   ``There's been a resurgence in marbles interest,'' Mason said.
``Kids have needed a new activity.''

   The movie ``Bull Durham'' apparently has
created new fans for the the Class A baseball team the film
depicts, and team officials say they hope it leads to increased
attendance as well.
   ``We were all over the papers, both locally and nationally,''
said Durham Bulls sales manager Kevin Maloney. ``Souvenir sales
have picked up and phone-in orders have picked up nationwide.
   ``I think we do foresee an upturn in that, a lot more people
purchasing pennants and T-shirts,'' he said.
   Maloney said the Bulls' office has taken souvenir orders from as
far away as Edmonton, Alberta; Yardley, Mass.; and New York City
since the movie opened last week. Bill Miller, the team's assistant
general manager, has done pregame radio shows for stations in
Chicago and San Francisco.
   The movie's effect on local theater audiences should be known
tonight when the Bulls return from a road trip for their first home
game since the film's release.
   ``We already lead the nation in A-ball attendance. Certainly,
our name is out in the open,'' Maloney said this week. ``They hear
Durham Bulls, they know who the Durham Bulls are. This could be the
opening of the floodgates.''
   The comedy-romance movie stars Kevin Costner, who plays a new
Bulls catcher, and Susan Sarandon.

<HEAD>Dollar Climb Continues, Gold Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar extended its recent gains in early
European trading today before running into a bout of profit-taking
and reported central-bank intervention. Gold bullion eased.
   Buoyed by a reversal in market sentiment, the dollar hit an
eight-month high of 1.7978 West German marks in Frankfurt early
today. Traders said the currency was likely to test the
psychologically important 1.8-mark during the day.
   The dollar also was trading at levels last seen in February
against the Japanese yen and the British pound and at its highest
levels since last year against some other European currencies.
   However, the dollar eased later in the morning as profit-takers
stepped in amid reports that Bundesbank, West Germany's central
bank, had bought dollars on the open market to keep the currency
from rising too fast.
   Here are some mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with
late Thursday:
   _1.7905 West German marks, up from 1.7855
   _1.4905 Swiss francs, up from 1.4800
   _6.0520 French francs, up from 6.0245
   _2.0258 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0145
   _1,331.50 Italian lire, up from 1,326.50
   _1.2030 Canadian dollars, unchanged
   The dollar rose against the British pound, which was quoted at
$1.7460, compared with Thursday's $1.7565.
   The dollar surged to a closing rate of 129.70 Japanese yen in
Tokyo, up from 128.55 yen. In London trading later today, it was
quoted at 129.68 yen.
   London's major bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price of
$447 a troy ounce at mid-morning, down from $448.75 late Thursday.
A dealer said the dollar's strength was putting pressure on
bullion, but trading volume was light.
   In Zurich, gold traded at a bid of $446.70, down from $448.50.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $448.55, down
from $449.78.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid of $6.92 a troy ounce,
down from $7.02.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A convoy of 36 trucks and buses came to
Washington from Laredo, Texas and in an Old West style immediately
circled the object of its focus, the White House.
   The Veterans Peace Convoy came to Washington Thursday to protest
recent actions by the Reagan administration to block the group's
delivery of food, medicine and clothing to Nicaragua.
   ``We have come to take care of the children of Nicaragua,'' said
convoy organizer Gerry Condon of San Francisco. ``We intend to
lobby and gain support for this convoy to pass. We want to feed the
children, not the war.''
   But custom agents in Texas recently seized four vehicles and
barred the group from crossing into Mexico when they would not post
bond and sign an agreement that the aging school buses and pickup
trucks would be returned to the United States because the
administration contends that to let the vehicles remain in
Nicaragua would violate a trade embargo.

   A New York congressman says the Education
Department is allowing high-level officials to get away with abuses
for which it punishes low-level employees and program beneficiaries.
   Democratic congressman Ted Weiss, who chairs the House
subcommittee on Government Operations said Thursday ``High-ranking
officials have gotten off with slaps on the wrist, while low-level
employees and program participants have been disciplined or
prosec;uted to the full extent of the law.''
   ``Our preliminary review of these cases indicates that justice
is not blind when it comes to corruption at the Department of
Education,'' said Weiss at a committee hearing.
   Much of the discussion at the hearing focused on an incident
involving Madeleine Will, assitant secretary for special education
and estranged wife of nationally syndicated columnist George Will.
   Mrs. Will was allowed to make restitution when it was discovered
she had used a department car and driver for personal business,
claimed travel expenses that she never incurred and had authorized
payments to a special assistant after the assistant had been

<HEAD>Lawmakers Debate Counting Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers are debating whether following the
letter of the Constitution as it concerns the 1990 census may
result in a system that is unfair to citizens.
   ``This is a fairness issue,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa.,
at a Census subcommittee hearing on Thursday.
   Ridge and others argued that illegal aliens should not be
included in the 1990 count because states will large numbers of
illegal aliens would benefit unfairly when their large population
totals give them extra seats in the House.
   ``Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted
all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal
aliens,''said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.
   House and other political districts are redrawn every ten years
on the basis of the census and because there is a 435-seat limit in
the House, when one state gains a member another must lose one.

<HEAD>18 Killed As Soldiers Clash With Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops clashed with
communist guerrillas across the Philippines, killing at least 18
people, military reports said today.
   Most of the casualties in Thursday's fighting occurred in the
southern province of Davao del Norte, where New People's Army
rebels attacked a paramilitary outpost and killed seven militiamen,
the military's Southern Command said.
   Also today, human rights groups staged a mock trial and
pronounced the Aquino government ``guilty'' of increasing human
rights abuses in the capital.
   Army soldiers who arrived to reinforce the detachment later
fought with the guerrillas in San Vicente town, leaving six rebels
dead. An army soldier also was killed and four civilians caught in
the crossfire were wounded in the incident, the military said.
   Government soldiers killed three other rebels in a separate
clash Thursday in Misamis Occidental province, also on the southern
island of Mindanao, military reports said.
   In Manila, government troops killed an alleged communist rebel
in a shoot-out in the suburban district of Paranaque late Thursday,
the military said today.
   Reynaldo Floriano, allegedly a New People's Army member in Albay
province south of here, drew his gun and fired on troops belonging
to the Capital Regional Command when they accosted him as he walked
in a residential area, a military report said.
   The troops fired back, killing Floriano, the report said. It
added Floriano had taken part in a raid on the town of Santo
Domingo in Albay and was facing murder charges for killing three
soldiers in the Albay town of Tiwi.
   Meanwhile, the Philippine Constabulary was planning to file new
charges of rebellion and subversion against Jose Maria Sison,
founder and former chairman of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, the government-run Philippine News Agency reported
today.
   It quoted Maj. Gen Ramon Montano as saying Sison had rejoined
the party, taken up his former post and was in Europe soliciting
funds for the 19-year-old communist insurgency here.
   Sison, who founded the Communist Party in December 1968, was
arrested and jailed in 1977 under deposed President Ferdinand
Marcos. He was among more than 500 political prisoners President
Corazon Aquino released following Marcos's ouster and her rise to
power in February 1986.
   About 400 human rights advocates attended the so-called
``people's tribunal.'' Survivors of assassination attempts and
victims of mass arrests, torture and labor harassment related their
experiences.
   A five-member panel that included Rep. Anna Dominique Coseteng,
chairperson of the House committee on human rights, issued a
statement at the end saying ``the government and the police ... are
guilty of systematic human rights violations in Manila.''
   Later, they joined about 1,500 leftist protesters in a downtown
square and marched towards the presidential palace, where hundreds
of anti-riot police armed with sticks stood guard.
   A statement from the Alex Boncayao Brigade, a communist
liquidation squad operating in the capital, was distributed during
the march. It called on the people to ``join the armed struggle''
and give the rebels information on activities of government forces.
   Speakers denounced the government and urged people to defend
human rights in a brief rally near Mendiola, the main road leading
to the presidential palace. Four layers of barbed wire barricades
sealed off the road.
   The protesters chanted ``Down With Fascism'' and dispersed
peacefully after the demonstration.

<HEAD>Tom Wolfe: Courts Should Get More Coverage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom Wolfe, whose best-selling novel ``The
Bonfire of the Vanities'' focuses on the criminal-justice system,
says reporters are missing out on billions of stories by failing to
cover the courts.
   ``Despite the highly publicized cases that you're all aware of,
I submit that the courts in this country are grossly undercovered
by the press,'' Wolfe said Thursday in a speech to 800 members of
the Philadelphia Bar Association.
   Wolfe, a former reporter for The Washington Post and the New
York Herald Tribune, said that while researching the novel in New
York City he was alarmed to find reporters unwilling to sit in on
court cases.
   He said reporters would gather in a press room and wait for a
district attorney or a spokesperson to come to ``deliver or get
their story for them.''
   ``I would find that day after day, I was the only reporter in
any courtroom in Manhattan or in Bronx County,'' said Wolfe. ``I
think that is a terrible mistake on the part of the press.''

   Actor Paul Newman and delicatessen
owner Julius Gold both say they believe jurors were leaning in
their favor before Gold's lawsuit against Newman came to an abrupt
end with a mistrial.
   But several jurors said they weren't even close to a decision
and predicted that if the case hadn't ended in a mistrial Thursday
there would have been a hung jury.
   Gold, who owns a deli in nearby Westport, is seeking stock in
Newman's food company, Newman's Own Inc., claiming he helped
develop Newman's products and is partly responsible for their
success.
   ``We were nowhere near close to a verdict,'' said juror Janice
Mayeran.
   Mayeran and another juror, Timothy Morris, said there was a
possibility of a hung jury if the trial hadn't ended.
   Bridgeport Superior Court Judge Howard Zoarski declared the
mistrial after jurors sent a note saying they couldn't ignore
depositions that weren't admitted as evidence but were
inadvertently turned over to them Wednesday, the second day of
deliberations.
   Zoarski's ruling reversed one he made minutes earlier
instructing jurors to disregard copies of the depositions from Gold
and others involved in the case.
   The note delivered to the judge said, ``Some members do not feel
an unbiased opinion can be rendered in light of their reading of an
amount of the depositions.''
   Zoarski said he had no choice but to order a mistrial.
   Afterward, Newman, standing in the courthouse lobby, thanked
jurors for their efforts. The Westport resident called the mistrial
``a terrible, unfortunate circumstance,'' adding that ``I always
thought this case had no merit, and Mr. Gold did not have a case.''
   Newman said he was ready for another trial, and Gold vowed to
continue pursuing the lawsuit he filed five years ago.
   Attorneys for Newman indicated they would file a motion asking
the judge to decide the case in their favor. There was no immediate
indication from Zoarski as to how the case eventually would be
resolved.
   Several jurors disregarded the judge's instructions not to speak
to reporters.
   Jury foreman Joseph Grassi said a number of the jurors were
``extremely disappointed'' by the mistrial after spending more than
three weeks on the case.
   The panel, which had deliberated for eight hours over two days,
was sent home Wednesday after Grassi told the court that it had
received depositions from Gold and some of the defendants, and
wanted to see Newman's.
   Newman's attorney, W. Patrick Ryan, said Wednesday it appeared
the clerk who took the exhibits into the jury room also
inadvertently took the depositions.
   Gold alleged that an attorney for Newman promised him 8 percent
of the stock from Newman's Own Inc. Gold said he contributed 30
months of effort to the company.
   Newman's Own, whose products include spaghetti sauce, lemonade
and popcorn, has donated $15 million in profits to charity since
1982.

   Yasser Arafat's guerrillas and
Syrian-backed rivals dueled today with mortars and rockets over two
devastated refugee camps in Beirut. Police said 10 people were
killed and 34 wounded.
   With today's casualties, 63 people have been killed and 249
wounded in 15 days of clashes at the camps of Chatilla and Bourj
el-Barajneh on Beirut's southern edge.
   By police count, 112 people have been killed and 502 wounded
since the clashes erupted May 1.
   A police spokesman said the intensity of the fighting escalated
sharply at about 5 a.m., when fighters from Col. Saeed Mousa's
Fatah-Uprising hammered the two camps with mortars and rockets at a
pace of five shells per minute.
   Defenders from Arafat's Fatah group, the main component of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, responded in kind, the spokesman
said.
   Residents of Beirut woke up to the booms of shell blasts that
resounded across the city. Smoke billowed from the two shantytowns
as ambulances, their sirens wailing, raced to evacuate casualties.
   Arafat's loyalists dislodged Mousa's followers from the two
camps in previous rounds of fighting. The Fatah-Uprising fighters
have regrouped along the Syrian-controlled edges of the shantytowns
and launched a series of abortive attacks to regain lost territory.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations, said the tiny camp of Chatilla took the brunt of the
Fatah-Uprising shelling from positions in Syrian-policed West
Beirut.
   ``It appears they (Mousa's forces) are trying to demolish what
is left of Chatilla,'' the spokesman said.
   The two camps suffered extensive damage in repeated attacks by
Israel and Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem militias beginning in 1982.
   The fighting raged despite a Libyan-brokered truce announced in
Tripoli Thursday.
   The truce, reached in a meeting between Libyan officers and
representatives of neutral Palestinian guerrilla factions, called
on the warring factions to return to positions they held before the
fighting started May 1.
   A Fatah spokesman charged that Mousa's forces ``started shelling
the camps indiscriminately early today to sabotage the Libyan
mediation.
   ``They are massacring our people,'' he added, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Fatah-Uprising, in a statement, accused Arafat of provoking the
clashes at the two camps to ``sabotage Syria's role ... in order to
be acceptable to America.''
   Fatah and the mutineers have been fighting in Beirut despite a
reconciliation meeting between Arafat and Syrian President Hafez
Assad in Damascus last April.
   Mousa, also known by his code-name Abu Mousa, broke away from
Fatah in 1983 and established his headquarters Damascus, the Syrian
capital.

   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq knelt
with other worshipers today to open what Pakistan claims to be the
world's largest mosque.
   The building accommodates 10,000 people in its prayer hall and
an additional 200,000 on its surrounding lawns.
   It is named after the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, who
supplied the financing. The mosque bears a white vaulted dome
surrounded by four 285-foot minarets.
   Gen. Zia dissolved the National Assembly and fired his civilian
government on May 29, accusing them of foot-dragging in making
Islam the supreme law of the land. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia had
been expected to open the mosque, but political observers
speculated that the ceremony may have been moved up as part of
Zia's Islamisation program.

<HEAD>Police Dispatcher Suspended Over 911 Delay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran 911 emergency dispatcher has been
suspended for a delay in reporting to patrol officers a frantic
call from a woman facing an assailant who then shot and killed her.
   Police said Thursday that it took officers 38 minutes to respond
to an emergency call from the woman. She was shot while phoning a
second time for help.
   The average time for a dispatcher to send an emergency call to a
radio car is 3.5 minutes, but in this case the dispatcher took
almost 20 minutes to alert a patrol car after a police operator
told the dispatcher of the call, said police spokeswoman Alice
McGillion.
   Carol Kudelycz, 24, of Queens was shot to death shortly after 11
p.m. Tuesday, 23 minutes after she first called the police
emergency number. A police operator heard Ms. Kudelycz scream and
then heard a gunshot.
   Officers arrived 15 minutes after the shooting, according to
police records.
   Investigators today said they were looking for her former
boyfriend for questioning. He had been free on $5,000 bail while
awaiting trial on charges of having tried to set Ms. Kudelycz on
fire in March.
   During her first call to police, Ms. Kudelycz reported that a
man who was trying to kill her, and who had already tried once
before, was ringing her doorbell, Ms. McGillion said.
   The dispatcher, Cloria Washington, 32, who worked for the police
emergency phone system for seven years, was suspended without pay
and will face a departmental hearing, Ms. McGillion said.
   The department also will discipline the operator who took Ms.
Kudelycz' first call because he failed to include information about
the past attempt on the woman's life when forwarding the call to
Ms. Washington, the spokeswoman said.
   That operator, whose name was not released, will face
departmental charges, and will be reassigned and retrained,
according to Ms. McGillion.

   Heat-sensitive phosphorus inside a derailed
CSX tanker reignited as workers righted it, spewing more toxic
smoke a day after 15,000 people were evacuated from eight western
Kentucky counties, authorities said.
   Thursday night's cloud, however, was not as severe as the one
the previous night, which forced one of the largest evacuations in
the state's history, officials said. There were no reported
injuries from the second fire.
   Only about 60 families living within three miles of the
derailment were evacuated after the chemical reignited, said Don
Armstrong, a spokesman for the state Division of Disaster and
Emergency Services.
   ``By midnight it was determined that the problem was getting
less and not greater,'' said Armstrong. ``They're letting it burn
out this morning.''
   ``There's just a small fire this morning and very little of the
chemical left in the tank,'' said Shirley Arnold, a state police
dispatcher. Police units remained at the scene throughout the night
to keep sightseers away.
   The tanker was part of a CSX Transportation Corp. train that
officials say was going too fast through rural Christian County
when 34 of its cars derailed in a ravine.
   The new cloud, 100 yards wide and 400 feet high, was moving
southeast, Armstrong said.
   Greg Powell, of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
Atlanta office, said the danger appeared minimal. Nobody was hurt
when the train caught fire again, Armstrong said.
   Officials said they believe that once the second fire is out all
of the phosphorus will have been consumed.
   Earlier Thursday, officials said the crew of the freight train
that derailed Wednesday might have avoided the accident had it seen
a 10 mph speed limit sign.
   The speed limit was posted because of a problem with the track
at the point where the train derailed. The train was traveling 35
mph, said Tim Hensley, a spokesman for CSX Transportation Corp.
   ``This probably is a factor, but we are not saying that this is
a cause,'' Hensley said. ``And it has not been developed whether it
was human error on the part of the crew, or whether they were not
provided with the information with regards to that slow order.''
   Hensley said the track was found to be in good condition when it
was inspected last month. He said the safety order was issued
because of a one-block-long stretch of rough track, possibly caused
by heat extension of the rails.
   ``Where there's a curve it will cause them to move to the
outside and form a kink,'' he said.
   The phosphorus, which can ignite spontaneously in high
temperatures, spilled from the ruptured 33,000-gallon tanker and
burned in 99-degree heat for more than 12 hours after the Wednesday
night crash.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan praised Mississippi Democrat
John C. Stennis for leading ``crucial battles'' to build up U.S.
military might during his 41-year Senate career and announced that
the Navy's next nuclear-powered aircraft carrier will be named for
the retiring senator.
   Stennis, the president pro tem of the Senate and chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, was honored at a benefit dinner on
Thursday night for the John C. Stennis Institute of Government and
the John C. Stennis chair of political science at Mississippi State
University.
   The president, in his speech, said that ``this humble man who
came to Washington from a small town in Mississippi has made an
impression on American government that is difficult to measure and
hard to fully describe.''
   As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee in the 1970s,
Reagan said, Stennis ``led some of the most crucial legislative
battles in history on behalf of our nation's defense.''
   The president told of going to see Stennis at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center after Stennis' left leg was removed in a cancer
operation in 1984.
   ``I went to Walter Reed to encourage Senator Stennis, but when I
left it was I who had been strengthened,'' he said. ``For even from
his hospital bed, John Stennis talked of the future of this
nation.''
   Turning to Stennis, he said, ``In troubled places, you have
brought calm resolve, like one of the many great fighting ships
which you did so much to obtain for the Navy.''
   Then, to applause from the crowd of more than 1,000, the
president announced that the U.S.S. John C. Stennis will be the
next addition to the nation's nuclear-powered carrier fleet.
   Stennis, who is not seeking re-election this year, responded
with a wide smile and a wave to the crowd.
   Stennis was first elected to the Senate in a special election in
1947. He has served longer than any other senator in history except
the late Democratic Sen. Carl Hayden of Arizona.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who succeeded Stennis as chairman of the
Armed Services Committee, said in introducing the president, ``It
is hard for me to imagine the Senate of the United States next
January without John Stennis at its helm.''
   Stennis, speaking from his seat, said the speakers who had
praised him were truly ``expressing their interest in and respect
for the free government that we have.''
   ``I am not entitled to as much credit as my friends have given
me tonight,'' he said. ``I was just trying to do what looked to be
my duty, and kept up the best I could.''

   Government agents today arrested a
West German woman allegedly involved in a ring that bought babies
from impoverished Filipinos and sold them to Europeans, officials
said.
   Margaret Kresser, 48, was arrested in the tourist district of
Ermita, said the Commission on Immigration and Deportation. Birth
certificates, affidavits from Filipino parents giving up custody of
their children, and infant clothes were taken from her residence, a
commission statement said.
   Immigration and Deportation Commissioner Miriam
Defensor-Santiago said Kresser was part of a syndicate that offers
money to poor Filipinos in exchange for their children, who later
are sold in Europe.
   ``In Europe, it's extremely difficult to adopt children, apart
from the rarity of children put up for adoption. That is why this
racket flourishes,'' Santiago said.
   In a separate case, immigration agents arrested an American,
Roger Leonard Landry, on charges he was involved in swindling
activities, illegal employment, and drug abuse. There were no other
details on that case.

<HEAD>Two French Advisers Reportedly Killed in Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two French advisers to an Afghan guerrilla group
were killed when government forces attacked the insurgents' command
center in southeastern Afghanistan, the Tass news agency said today.
   In a separate report, Tass said guerrillas today fired rockets
in the Afghan capital, Kabul, and at a nearby hydroelectric
station. It also said Afghan government soldiers killed 265
insurgents in battles in southeastern Zabul province.
   Tass said the French advisers infiltrated Afghanistan in early
May along with a group of American, Chinese, Pakistani, Iranian and
Arab advisers. It did not give any names.
   It said the group was organizing command posts, coordinating
attacks by anti-government forces, teaching guerrillas how to use
ground-to-ground missiles, and paying bonuses for successful
attacks.
   Tass did not say when the French advisers were killed. According
to the report, the Afghan air force raided the command post of a
guerrilla group in Zabul province and killed 40 rebels.
   ``Two French advisers also were killed,'' the report said.
   The report also accused the Pakistani military of deploying
long-range artillery and anti-aircraft guns capable of helping
anti-Marxist guerrillas, who have been fighting the Afghan
government for 10 years.
   Soviet troops intervened in December 1979 to help the Marxist
government. They began withdrawing May 15 under an accord signed in
Geneva.
   In a second report today, Tass said rebels fired four rockets
into Kabul, injuring one woman and destroying a house. One of the
rockets caused a fire at the Kabul airport that was put out by
airport workers, it said.
   It said a man was killed Thursday when a bomb he was trying to
smuggle into the Kabul bazaar exploded prematurely. Two people were
injured, the report said.
   Rebels fired 50 rockets at the Naglu hydroelectric station near
Kabul, killing three people, wounding two others and damaging two
power lines, Tass said.

   Writer Rose Franken, a prolific novelist
who also penned Hollywood screenplays and Broadway dramas, has died
at the age of 92.
   A native of Gainesville, Texas, she spent much of her life in
New York, moving to Tucson four years ago, said her youngest son,
Peter A. Franken, a University of Arizona physics professor. She
died Wednesday.
   Mrs. Franken's first book, ``Pattern,'' was published in 1925.
Her series of ``Claudia'' books, begun in 1939, were the basis for
the movie ``Claudia and David,'' which she wrote in 1946.
   Her play ``Claudia,'' was written in 1941. She also wrote the
plays ``Another Language'' in 1932 and ``Outrageous Fortune'' in
1944.
   As a screenwriter, Mrs. Franken wrote the movie ``Beloved
Enemy'' in 1936.
   Her books also included an autobiography, ``When All is Said and
Done,'' published in 1963. Her last book, ``You're Well Out of the
Hospital,'' was published in 1966.
   In addition to her son Peter, Mrs. Franken is survived by two
other sons, John and Paul of New York, four grandchildren and one
great-grandchild.
   Her first husband, Sigmund Franken, and her second, William B.
Meloney, both predeceased her.

   The Postal Service announced today that it
will begin a drug-screening program for job applicants.
   The program is expected to begin in about 90 days, the agency
said, and will be phased in over a nine-month period.
   ``We have no plans to initiate random drug tests of current
employees,'' said Assistant Postmaster General Joel S. Trosch.
``Testing for drug use by a current employee is done only if a
physician decides it should be administered as part of a medical
examination.''
   The Postal Service said it has signed a contract with Pharmchem
Laboratories of Menlo Park, Calif., to conduct the tests.
   The Office of Personnel Management said last month that plans
were being developed to administer drug tests to new federal
workers. The Postal Service, while constituted as an independent
agency, follows federal personnel policies.

<HEAD>Locust Invasion Threatening Food Supply in Sahel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Swarms of locusts migrating from northwest Africa
will threaten the food supply in the sub-Sahara region and could
reach the Red Sea, United Nations officials said today.
   ``There is actually little hope of being able to contain the
plague in the near future,'' the director-general of the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization, Edouard Saouma, said in a statement.
   He added that the invasion ``is of unprecedented dimensions and
will affect the food security of 15 African countries, from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea.''
   Dr. Lukas Brader, head of the Emergency Center for Locust
Operations at FAO, said the locusts moved south in April and May,
earlier than expected, because plentiful rains there resulted in
favorable breeding and living conditions.
   He said the situation will worsen during the next few weeks as
new swarms arrive, coinciding with the harvest in the Sahel, the
area that extends from Senegal to the Sudan and separates the arid
Sahara from tropical West Africa.
   Brader said countries in this region face a potential loss of 1
million tons of grains. About $300 million worth of food aid would
be required to make up for the destroyed crops, he said.
   United Nations experts have said a swarm covering just half a
square mile can contain 50 million insects, weigh 100 tons and eat
its weight in vegetation each day.
   Brader said that Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, which were first
infested with the locusts, had succeeded in keeping the locusts
south of the Atlas mountains in relatively uncultivated areas.
   He added that since the beginning of 1988, 12.3 million acres in
those countries and Mauritania have been treated with pesticides.
   In the Sahel, locust control is more difficult because the
insects are more dispersed.
   Saouma said in his statement that locust swarms were sighted in
Sudan this week and that ``it must now be feared the plague will
extend to the Red Sea, where it may invade the Arabian peninsula
and the horn of Africa.''
   If unchecked, the swarms eventually could reach Israel and
Turkey as well as the Indian subcontinent.
   Authorities try to control locusts mainly by spraying pesticides.
   The fight has cost $45 million since the beginning of 1988, and
FAO estimates a total of $150 million may be needed for the year.
   The last major invasion of locusts in Africa began in 1950 and
lasted for 13 years. Brader said the current invasion is ``the
biggest plague history recalls.''

<HEAD>Humpback Whale Cruising Waters of Puget Sound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young humpback whale, possibly trying to
find its way out of Puget Sound's maze of inlets, has been spotted
cruising the waters of the south sound, marine biologists say.
   The whale is only the fourth humpback sighted in Puget Sound
since 1976. The last sighting was in June 1986.
   ``He's covering a lot of ground,'' said John Calambokidis, a
marine mammal researcher with the Olympia-based Cascadia Research
Collective. Calambokidis observed the whale from a boat for about
two hours Wednesday evening.
   He described it as 25 to 30 feet long, perhaps 1 year old and of
unknown gender. Adult humpbacks reach 50 feet in length.
   By photographing the whale's flukes (tail), ``we `fingerprinted'
it,'' he said.
   ``If we run into him a month from now, we'd recognize the
markings on the underside of the flukes,'' he said. ``They're
distinctive enough markings that we can see them their whole
lives.''
   Humpbacks normally spend summers feeding in the ocean off the
west coast of Canada and the United States, but individual
humpbacks occasionally stray into Puget Sound. During the winter
breeding season, they frequent waters around Hawaii and Mexico.
   Calambokidis said the whale did not appear to be distressed or
in any danger. He said there were no plans to intervene or attempt
to guide the whale out of the sound.

<HEAD>Senate Condemns Use of Nerve Gas in Iran-Iraq War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate today condemned the use of nerve
gas in the Iran-Iraq war and urged President Reagan to pursue
aggressively an international agreement to ban production and
stockpiling of all chemical weapons.
   On a 91-0 vote, the Senate adopted a resolution noting a United
Nations finding that Iraq has used chemical weapons several times
during the war and citing reports that Iran retaliated in kind.
   The resolution specifically cited a March 16 attack in which an
estimated 2,000 Kurds were gassed to death on Iraqi soil by Iraq in
an effort to regain control of an Iranian-ocuppied villate.
   ``This is a grave violation of international law,'' said Sen.
George Mitchell, D-Maine, chief sponsor of the resolution. ``Unless
both sides forgo use of chemical weapons, there could be an even
more alarming esclation of the nearly 8-year-old Gulf war.''
   Mitchell noted that a 1925 Geneva agreement outlaws use of
chemical weapons but does not bar their production or stockpiling.
``The United Nations has never invoked sanctions of any sort
against a violator of the Geneva protocol,'' he said.
   The resolution calls on the president to ``seek allied
cooperation to further tighten controls on the export of chemical
compounds to countries seeking to develop a chemical-weapons
capability.''
   It ``urges the president to pursue American efforts at the
Geneva Conference on Disarmament to reach an arms-control agreement
banning the use, production, development, stockpiling, transfer and
acquisition of chemical weapons.''
   ``Either we can sit around and wait for the inevitable,'' said
Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., ``or we can actively and aggressively
pursue an agreement today that seeks to prevent that next attack
tomorrow.''

<HEAD>Thailand Proposes Renting Islands for Boat People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government official said today that
he will recommend that the United Nations lease desert islands so
that Vietnamese boat people have a place to live.
   ``Thirteen thousand of these islands abound in Indonesia, and it
is possible they can be converted into profitable farming areas,''
said Somporn Klinpongsa, deputy permanent secretary of the Interior
Ministry.
   Somporn said the island rentals could solve the problem of what
to do with the increasing number of Vietnamese seeking asylum.
   ``When (the) leases expire, say in 10 years, the people must
return to their homeland,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Somporn said he would seek endorsement of the proposal from the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Jean-Pierre Hocke, at an
annual refugee conference in Geneva beginning June 29.
   Somporn said the ``islands-for-rent'' idea gained widespread
acceptance during a recent tour he took of Southeast Asian nations.
   ``Many of the boat people are farmers, and they should be
encouraged to grow sugarcane and rubber on the islands,'' he said.
   Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries regard a large
majority of the recent Vietnamese fleeing their homeland as
economic migrants rather than genuine refugees.
   The United Nations said that as of March 31, it was handling
about 40,000 Vietnamese refugees in Asia, up from 32,000 two years
ago. The largest numbers are found in Thailand, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia.

<TEXT>
   A judge who ordered a political
consultant to make classroom appearances and a public service ad on
voting said he wanted the sentence to serve as a warning to others
who contemplate tampering with the system.
   A jury ordered $7,600 in fines and a year on probation for Rocky
Mountain, who was convicted of 38 misdemeanor forgery charges for
instructing workers to put phony signatures on petitions that got
former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont on the state's Republican
presidential primary ballot in March.
   Southern Political Consulting Inc., of which Mountain is vice
president, was ordered to pay $38,000 in fines.
   Harris County Judge Sherman Ross added to the sentence, ordering
Mountain to talk to two civics classes a week for a year on the
topic, ``The Political Process and How to Make it Work Right'' and
prepare a public service announcement ``about the value of the
right to vote.''
   Ross also ordered Mountain to finish college. He must take six
hours of Spanish to do that.
   ``I hope this message rolls like thunder across the country that
at the grass-roots level, the most important level of politics, we
have to maintain the integrity of the system,'' Ross told the
political consultant Thursday.
   Mountain faced a maximum punishment of one year in jail and
$76,000 in fines. The company faced a maximum fine of $380,000.
Defense lawyers said the convictions might be appealed.
   After the trial, Kevin Burnette, the company's president,
reiterated his claim that his Houston-based firm was the victim of
selective prosecution because it is disliked by state GOP officials.
   ``We reacted very stupidly to a very stupid rule,'' he said of
the petition rule in effect for the presidential primary.
   GOP candidates had to submit 5,000 signatures to get on the
ballot. That rule has since been changed to allow a $5,000 filing
fee instead.
   Mountain, 27, testified Tuesday that he ordered the forgeries
because he had been pressured by a du Pont campaign official. He
said he never intended for the du Pont campaign to submit them.
   But after the punishment was announced, Mountain said, ``I don't
believe I was guilty of a crime, but I accept the verdict of the
jury.''
   Of the probation conditions set by Ross, Mountain said, ``If
this thing isn't overruled and if I have to, as a condition of
probation, go out and talk to civics classes, I'll look forward to
doing that. In the long run, that will probably help business more
than anything else.''

   A Jewish settler in the occupied West Bank
fired a submachine gun at a crowd of rock-throwing Moslem
worshippers today and wounded seven Palestinians, an Arab witness
and hospital officials said.
   Also on the West Bank, a Palestinian stabbed a U.S.-born settler
who then chased the Arab and shot him in the elbow, army radio
said. Both the Palestinian and the Israeli were hospitalized.
   And, the army began freeing 89 Palestinians jailed for taking
part in anti-Israel disturbances. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
said the move was part of a new policy to reward Arabs for good
behavior.
   In Nablus, Palestinians leaving the central Mazuz Masri Mosque
after Sabbath prayers stoned a settler's car, said the Arab witness
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The settler got out of the car and fired his Uzi submachine gun,
and the Palestinians hurled back stones, watermelons and shoes, the
witness said.
   Officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital said seven Arabs were
hit in the arms or legs in the shooting. Two were 8-year-old boys.
   The witness said the area was quickly surrounded by troops who
fired rubber bullets and injured four Palestinians. Arab reports
said the army later clamped a curfew on Nablus, the West Bank's
largest city where some 100,000 Arabs live.
   Al Ittihad officials also reported that a protest broke out in
refugee Camp No. 1 near Nablus and that one Palestinian was
seriously injured in the left eye by a rubber bullet.
   The military command said it was checking the reports.
   The army also placed a curfew on Hebron's central casbah, or
Arab marketplace, where the stabbing incident occurred.
   The settler, Yonah Chaiken, was shopping when an attacker
stabbed him in the shoulder and lower back, the radio and a
Jerusalem hospital spokeswoman said.
   Chaiken pulled a gun, chased the Palestinian about 50 yards and
shot him, and then ran another 300 yards to a building housing
Jewish families, where he collapsed and received first aid, said
the radio and Zev Hever, a leader of the 200-member Jewish
community in Hebron.
   The wounded Palestinian, who was captured, was identified by
officials at Hebron's Alia Hospital as Abdel Majid Sharawneh, 22.
The radio and a hospital official said Sharawneh was shot in the
elbow.
   Chaiken was later taken by helicopter to a Jerusalem's Hadassah
Hospital, where he was in stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman
said.
   He told reporters his injury ``is a direct result of American
pressure on Israel not to take stronger steps against the Arab
rioters.''
   Chaiken, originally from Boston, was the second Israeli victim
of an apparent nationalistic attack this week. On Sunday, an
Israeli farmer was bludgeoned and stabbed to death while spraying
insecticide on his vineyard south of Jerusalem.
   That death was the fourth Israeli fatality since an uprising
began Dec. 8 against the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. In all, 211 Arabs have been killed.
   In its latest leaflet, the Palestine Liberation Organization
designated today as a day of attacks on Arab tax officials who
cooperate with Israeli military authorities in the occupied lands.
   The PLO has released leaflets encouraging anti-Israeli action
since the unrest began.
   The move to free the Arab prisoners drew fire from Benny
Katzover, a senior official in Gush Emunim, the Jewish settlement
movement. Katover said the Arabs would interpret the goodwill
gesture as a sign of weakness.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, commander of Israeli forces in the
occupied West Bank, said the army would pardon 17 Palestinians
currently in jail, halt judicial proceedings against 27 suspects
and cut short the administrative detentions of 45 others.
   The army command said the move was meant ``to help calm the
situation.''
   Rabin said the army releases 50 to 80 Arab detainees a day,
``some before their trial and some before they have served their
sentences.''
   ``If a village or a family have shown good behavior, we are
going to release some detainees from the area,'' Rabin said. ``We
want to use the carrot as well, not only the stick.''

   The Fish and Wildlife Service said today it
plans to cancel or restrict the special early hunting season for
the blue-winged teal in 18 states and two other jurisdictions
because of the drought.
   The action could be only the first of new hunting restrictions
this fall, the service has warned.
   This species of duck, whose migration south begins well before
others, has been hunted for a few days in September for the past 18
years. Last year the season was nine days in September in most
states that had one.
   Populations of the blue-winged teal total about 3.6 million this
year compared with a normal 4.8 million. The service has called the
prospects for breeding this year ``grim'' because of the loss of
marshy areas in the great plains of the United States and Canada.
   Frank Dunkle, director of the service, has accepted a staff
recommendation made earlier in the week to propose cancelling the
season in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas and
New Mexico.
   A similar season in Iowa, legally not limited to the blue-winged
teal but in practice dominated by it, also should not be held,
according to the proposal.
   Bag limit reductions, shorter seasons or both will be proposed
for blue-winged teal and some other species, in some cases all
ducks, for Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alaska, Puerto Rico and
the Virgin Islands.
   Loss of habitat from drought and other causes led the service to
adopt hunting restrictions in 1985 aimed at reducing the annual
harvest by hunters by 25 percent. Dunkle has warned there will be a
``hard look'' at the regulations this summer.
   Today's action will be proposed for public comment and should be
adopted by July 18, said spokeswoman Meagan Durham.
   Regular-season regulations, generally taking effect in October,
are not adopted until August.

   Part of a ceiling collapsed onto a sleeping
guest at Manhattan's Helmsley Windsor Hotel today, killing the man,
police said. The top three floors of the hotel were evacuated
briefly because of the accident.
   The victim, who was described as 35 to 40 years old but was not
immediately identified, was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where he
was declared dead on arrival, said Emergency Medical Services Capt.
William Olsen.
   The time of the collapse was not clear, said Police Inspector
James McCabe. The body was found after a light on the hotel's
switchboard indicated at 6:40 a.m. that the phone in room 1628 was
off the hook.
   Hotel security guards went to the room on the top floor of the
16-story building and found the man on the bed. The ceiling and
part of the roof's underpinnings had collapsed; the room was full
of cinderblocks and dirt, and a 4-foot-by-4-foot-by-10-inch chunk
of ceiling material was on the bed.
   ``It looked like he was killed instantly, but he might have been
lying there injured'' and knocked the phone off the hook, McCabe
said.
   The victim and his wife checked into the hotel Wednesday; his
wife left Thursday.
   The hotel, on West 58th Street, has about 20 rooms on each floor
and was nearly full Thursday night, according to police.
   Police evacuated the 14th, 15th, and 16th floors as a
precaution, said Sgt. John Venetucci, a department spokesman. But
by late morning, only the man's room and the one beneath it
remained off limits.

<HEAD>Nation's Catholic Bishops To Discuss AIDS Statement At Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLLEGEVILLE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Catholic bishops gathered today for a
national conference on such issues as women's concerns in the
church and society and disagreements about a statement on the use
of condoms to stop the spread of AIDS.
   More than 250 bishops from across the country were expected at
St. John's University for the fourth meeting in six years of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   The Rev. George Speltz, former bishop for the St. Cloud area and
a spokesman for the diocese, said he thinks the pastoral on women
will generate the most discussion, followed by a proposed statement
on the morality of nuclear deterrence and the AIDS issue, which
will be debated behind closed doors Monday.
   ``I think they will be rather heavy discussions because they're
all sensitive (issues),'' Speltz said.
   The report on the morality of U.S. nuclear policy is the result
of two years of work by a bishops' committee commissioned as a
follow-up to their 1983 peace pastoral. The committee is
recommending that its ``conditional acceptance'' of nuclear
deterrence be retained, according to a pre-conference news release.
   Speltz said he doesn't think the position of the original
document will be altered after talks on the new report.
   He said ``conditional acceptance'' could be viewed as a
psychological deterrence to nuclear war. ``I have always felt it's
like bluffing in poker,'' he said.
   Some people, Speltz said, will find the first draft of the
women's pastoral inadequate because it doesn't discuss ordaining
women to the priesthood. But that issue won't come up.
   ``The Holy Father said there is no possibility of it and the
U.S. church does not want to contradict that,'' he said.
   The draft calls sexism a sin, asks that key church positions
excluding ordination be open to women, urges an end to the economic
inequities women suffer and says men need to be more responsible in
marriage and family relationships.
   The closed-door discussion on AIDS is a follow-up to December's
dispute about a statement in a paper that discussed church policy
on AIDS. The paper mentioned the use of condoms in public education
programs as a way of stemming the spread of the deadly disease.
   Some bishops feared the statement would be misinterpreted as
condoning sex outside of marriage and the use of artificial birth
control, which the Catholic church opposes.
   In other business, the bishops will:
   _Consider proposals to join a new interfaith cable TV venture or
work more closely with the Eternal Word Television Network.
   _Vote on a proposal outlining conditions for the use of general
absolution, or forgiveness of a group of penitents without
individual confessions.
   _Adopt a formula for distributing money raised in a new national
collection beginning this December to meet the retirement needs of
religious communities.
   _Update bylaws for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
and the U.S. Catholic Conference.

<HEAD>Court Says Miranda Ruling Sufficient to protect Criminal
Defendants' Rights in Illinois Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said today its famous
Miranda ruling is sufficient to protect the rights of criminal
defendants questioned by police after they are indicted or
otherwise formally charged.
   The justices, voting 5-4 to uphold an Illinois man's murder
conviction, said the warnings police have given suspects since the
court's landmark 1966 decision adequately protect an
already-indicted suspect's right to legal help.
   The court ruled 22 years ago in a decision called Miranda vs.
Arizona that police must tell suspects before interrogating them
that they have a right to remain silent, to confer with a lawyer
before answering any questions and to have a lawyer provided if
they cannot afford to hire one.
   The court said then that such warnings are needed to protect
suspects' privilege against self-incrimination, assured by the
Constitution's Fifth Amendment.
   Today, the court said the so-called Miranda warnings also
adequately protect an indicted defendant's Sixth Amendment right to
legal assistance.
   ``Whatever warnings suffice for Miranda's purposes will also be
sufficient in the context of post-indictment questioning,'' Justice
Byron R. White wrote for the court.
   ``The state's decision to take an additional step and commence
formal adversarial proceedings against the accused does not
substantially increase the value of counsel to the accused at
questioning, or expand the limited purpose that an attorney serves
when the accused is questioned by authorities,'' White said.
   The issue arose after Tyrone Patterson was indicted in a 1983
murder in Evanston, Ill.
   Patterson, a member of the Vice Lords street gang, eventually
was convicted of the Aug. 21, 1983, beating death of James Kevin
Jackson, a member of the rival Black Mobsters street gang.
   Patterson's convcition and the 24-year prison sentence it drew
were upheld by the Illinois Supreme Court last year.
   While in custody at the Evanston police station, Patterson was
informed he had been indicted by a grand jury for his role in
Jackson's death. Patterson said he understood his Miranda rights
when read to him by a police officer but agreed to answer questions
without first seeking a lawyer's help.
   During two interrogation sessions, Patterson incriminated
himself in connection with the crime.
   Patterson's lawyer later tried to have the incriminating
comments excluded from the trial, contending that using them as
evidence would violate Patterson's Sixth Amendment right even if
his Fifth Amendment right had not been violated.
   State courts rejected the argument but the justices last October
agreed to study Patterson's appeal.
   Today, they agreed with the state courts.
   ``Because we believe that (Patterson's) waiver of his Sixth
Amendment right was knowing and intelligent, we find no error,''
White said.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, William J.
Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented.
   The case is Patterson vs. Illinois, 86-7059.

   In an arrest described as a ``relief to the
community,'' a 26-year-old ex-convict is being held without bail in
the strangling of a Honeywell Inc. manager in the company parking
ramp.
   David Anthony Thomas, 26, was arrested Thursday at a charitable
foundation in St. Paul where he worked, police Capt. Carl Johnson
said. Thomas, he said, was linked to the murder by fingerprints
found at the murder scene, although police still had not formally
charged him Friday morning.
   Johnson said police can hold Thomas until noon Saturday before
charging him in the June 12 death of Mary Catherine Foley, 34, of
St. Paul, who was assaulted while returning to her car after work
at Honeywell headquarters. It is possible police could get an
extension until Monday, he said.
   Police have found ``absolutely no connection'' between Thomas
and Foley, the captain said. He said the Minneapolis man previously
had been charged with rape and had been released from prison last
month.
   City Council President Alice Rainville said the arrest is ``a
relief'' to the community.
   ``We are so pleased with the professional police work that led
to (the arrest),'' she said. ``This community has been awash in
grief.''
   Elizabeth Olson, who works at the Honeywell office where Foley
worked, said she felt very relieved after hearing of Thomas' arrest.
   Olson said she has been taking extra precautions since the
murder.
   ``I already had a can of Mace, so I took that. I started
checking under my car and in my car and making sure people were
with me when I went to the ramp,'' she said.
   The arrest coincided with a memorial service for Foley in St.
Paul attended by about 500 people.

<HEAD>Clash Over Islamic Law Injures 25</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a fundamentalist Moslem
party clashed with opponents of a new law making Islam the state
religion, and at least 25 people were injured, police said today.
   The clash with homemade bombs and guns lasted about two hours
Thursday in Rajshahi, about 120 miles northwest of Dhaka, police
said by telephone.
   Trouble began after two major opposition groups began a march to
protest the new law.
   Jamaat-e-Islami, a fundamentalist Moslem Party, tried to block
the march, and fighting broke out, police said.
   Jamaat-e-Islami has been involved with the opposition groups
since last November in an unsuccessful campaign of strikes and
rallies to oust President Hussain Muhammad Ershad.
   But the Moslem party broke with its allies over the Islam bill,
contending that to oppose it would encourage anti-Islamic forces.
   The Bangladesh Parliament passed a constitutional amendment on
June 7 making Islam the state religion. More than 85 percent of
Bangladesh's 105 million people are Moslem.
   The law has drawn considerable protest, not only from minority
Hindus and Christians but also from opposition parties who contend
it violates the country's secular tradition.
   Bangladesh, formerly the eastern province of Pakistan, won
independence after a civil war in 1971.

   Mental health workers and congressmen say they've been besieged
by calls from farm families anguished because ``now God's against
us,'' as 10 governors prepared recommendations for federal action
to save drought-stricken farms.
   A persistent heat wave, meanwhile, continued to exacerbate the
worst drought since the 1930s, though parts of the Northeast and
Midwest enjoyed cooler weather on Thursday than the record-high
temperatures of recent days. Temperatures hit record lows overnight
in the Northeast and Northwest, including 40 at Burlington, Vt.,
and 39 at Olympia, Wash.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across much of the
Southeast, the Gulf Coast and central Texas. The storms brought
brief relief to some parched areas, including a half-inch of rain
in sections of Missouri and a quarter-inch at Mobile, Ala. Parts of
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa also got rain, with 1.8 inches at
Waterloo, Iowa.
   In St. Louis, the medical examiner's office said a 99-year-old
woman whose body was found in a sweltering bedroom Wednesday died
from heat. In Georgia, Thomas County Coroner Sam Brown said a woman
died of a heart attack brought on by heat stroke while working in a
tobacco field.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms were predicted today in
parts of the Midwest, the Southeast and elsewhere. But the National
Weather Service said the Plains and Midwest should have continued
hot and dry weather for the rest of June.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad today again pushed the Reagan
administration for more aid to drought-stricken farmers, arguing
``the situation is getting more critical day by day.''
   ``It's not fair for the farmer who has a crop disaster to bear
the financial burden of this,'' Branstad said on NBC's ``Today''
show. ``We can't afford to see more family farmers be pushed off
the land.''
   On Thursday, Branstad and fellow governors from North Dakota,
South Dakota, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Montana, Ohio
and Wisconsin warned that the drought is seriously affecting food
production.
   The situation is ``much more critical than we even realized,''
said Gov. George Sinner of North Dakota, chairman of the National
Governors' Association's agriculture committee.
   ``I'm afraid we're going to lose some farmers, and we've lost
enough already in my state,'' Sinner said after a Chicago meeting
of 10 governors, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, farm
representatives and agricultural experts.
   The governors agreed to 36 recommendations aimed at protecting
farm income, encouraging conservation and efficient use of water
supplies, and preventing early sales of livestock due to feed
shortages.
   Gov. George Mickelson of South Dakota said the meeting would
only be successful ``if we go to Washington and see that these
things are actually implemented.''
   Lyng promised that the federal government ``will do what is
necessary to minimize the severity of the damage.'' He noted that
1,200 counties in 30 states have been granted permission to cut hay
or graze cattle on government-rented land set aside for
conservation or crop reduction.
   But, he said, the extent of the damage is undetermined.
   Sinner said Lyng's speech ``confused us a bit'' since experts
already predict a 25 percent to 30 percent drop in wheat yields
this year. He said livestock feed also has been harmed.
   The worsening outlook has set loose an ``alarming'' number of
calls from families troubled by the drought, say mental health
officials.
   Many of the calls are from ``adolescents with families who are
feeling tremendous pressure ... because the parents are under such
great stress,'' said Myrt Armstrong, a spokeswoman for the North
Dakota Mental Health Association hotline.
   Many farm families already suffered from a tough agricultural
economy, said Milan Christianson, a family therapist at North
Dakota State University.
   ``And now some of them are even saying, and they're shaking
their fist and saying it, `Nature. Now God's against us,'''
Christianson said.
   U.S. Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said he's received many calls
from desperate farmers. Dorgan said one woman even blamed him for
the drought.
   ``During the course of the conversation she was saying, `You
know, you guys gotta do something. You can't let this happen,'''
Dorgan said. ``I said, `Well, listen, unfortunately we don't
control the drought.'''
   A Mississippi River traffic jam grew to 1,000 barges Thursday
near Memphis, Tenn., as the Coast Guard imposed new limits on the
size of towboat loads.
   The lack of rain has dropped the Mississippi to 20 feet lower at
Memphis than it was last June. Dredging of low areas of the river
continued Thursday.
   The river's reduced flow has allowed dense saltwater to begin
moving upstream in the Delta, threatening wildlife habitat and New
Orleans' drinking water. The Army Corps of Engineers says it will
build a dike 45 feet beneath the surface across the bottom of the
river to block the sea water, which is heavier than fresh water. On
Thursday, the leading edge of the saltwater was slightly more than
halfway to New Orleans, officials said.
   Dust-dry timber has been blamed for forest fires in several
states. In Montana, 18 firefighters were injured when a blaze that
consumed at least 11,000 acres flared up again Thursday night.
   In Kentucky, the heat was blamed for exacerbating a train
derailment that drove about 15,000 residents from their homes when
white phosphorus that burns in high temperatures spewed from a
derailed tank car and ignited.

<HEAD>Court Limits Government's Immunity from Lawsuits in Maryland Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today limited the
government's broad immunity from lawsuits, reinstating a suit by a
couple fired on by a drunk, off-duty Navy medic in Maryland.
   The 6-3 ruling expands the government's liability for negligence
in personal injury claims.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said
negligence by government employees that allows a foreseeable
assault to occur by someone else can be a basis for a lawsuit
against the government.
   The government assumed responsibility in this case when Navy
corpsmen found the drunk medic but failed to report his condition
or that he was armed in violation of Navy rules, Stevens said.
   ``The theory of liability in this case is analogous to cases in
which a person assumes control of a vicious animal, or perhaps an
explosive device,'' he said.
   Similarly, he said, the government ``has a duty to prevent a
foreseeably dangerous individual from wandering about unattended.''
   The case stems from an incident on the evening of Feb. 6, 1982,
outside the Bethesda Medical Center in Maryland, a few miles from
the nation's capital.
   Michael and Mary Sheridan were driving past the hospital when
shots rang out. Mrs. Sheridan was struck by the bullets and pieces
of the shattered windshield. Her husband said he suffered from
shock.
   The shots were fired by Robert W. Carr, a Navy enlisted man who
worked as a medical aide at the hospital.
   According to court records, Carr was inebriated when he was
found unconscious shortly before the shooting by three other Navy
corpsmen.
   They attempted to take him to an emergency room, at one time
permitting him to slip from their grasp and fall down a flight of
concrete steps.
   Before reaching the emergency room, Carr regained consciousness
and flashed he barrel of a .22 caliber rifle he was carrying. The
three corpsmen fled and took no further action to alert authorities.
   Carr began shooting at passing vehicles, hitting the Sheridans'
car.
   The Sheridans sued the government, claiming the three corpsmen
were negligent for violating a Navy regulation that requires
personnel to report violations of any Navy rule.
   The rule in question was Carr's possession of firearms on the
base, something that generally is forbidden by the Navy.
   The Sheridans argued that had a civilian possessed a firearm on
the Navy base, rather than an off-duty corpsman, the government
would be liable for any injury.
   The Sheridans also said the government violated its duty to
protect the public by failing to supervise Carr properly.
   They sued the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act which
authorizes claims against the government for negligence.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year the
government is shielded from the suit.
   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to uphold the
appeals court ruling on grounds that permitting the suit could
expose the government to a vast array of such claims.
   Stevens said today the government would not be liable for
negligence if nothing more was involved than Carr's conduct at the
time he shot at the Sheridans.
   But Stevens said the actions of the other corpsmen opens the way
for the the government to be sued for negligence.
   The government is in a legal position in this case similar to
that of a private hospital that was allegedly negligent, he said.
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
   The case is Sheridan vs. U.S., 87-626.

   The completed upgrading of the nation's
air traffic control centers will allow controllers to keep pace
with air traffic through the next decade, the head of the Federal
Aviation Administration said.
   The Salt Lake City Air Route Traffic Control Center was the last
of 20 centers to receive the new, $40 million system, linking it
with facilities nationwide.
   FAA Administrator T. Allan McArtor said during a ceremony
Thursday that the new system operates 10 times faster and has four
times the capacity of the old system.
   ``The old system was difficult to maintain and had a back-up
system that was switched to quite often. The new one will allow for
much faster response times and easier maintenance'' and no need for
a backup system, he said.
   He said the new system will allow introduction of new functions
to enhance safety and increase controller productivity.
   McArtor said upgrading Salt Lake's computer was as significant
as the driving of the golden spike that joined rails linking the
nation's first transcontinental railroad about 50 miles north of
here at Promontory in 1869.
   ``Today we're passing another transportation milestone with
another golden spike. ... It's appropriate for us to take our bows,
this is a culmination of a lot of work,'' he said.
   The Salt Lake computer cost $9 million, with the remainder of
the $40 million going for support technology.
   The Salt Lake center controls air traffic over Utah, Idaho,
Montana and Wyoming and parts of Oregon, Nevada and North and South
Dakota.

<TEXT>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service will not
consider further applications to exhibit pandas in U.S. zoos while
it tries to decide what its policy will be, the service announced
today.
   At least 30 institutions, most in the United States but some
overseas, have been reported negotiating with China for panda
exhibits, ``posing new, cumulative threats to the wild and captive
populations of the species,'' said a Federal Register notice.
   The service promised decisions as quickly as possible.
   The world's pandas, of which only a few hundred live in the wild
in China, are an endangered species protected by treaty and may not
be imported without a permit from the service.
   On Monday, the service denied import permits to the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources for exhibition of two pandas at the
state fair on the grounds the trip might harm their breeding
potential.
   Last week, a court decision barred the collection of fees by the
Toledo, Ohio Zoo for its panda exhibit, for which the service had
granted import permits.
   Conservation organizations have protested the growing practice
of showing pandas imported from China. Pandas attract large crowds
and sharing the fees reportedly can yield China $300,000 to
$500,000.
   The zoos contend the fees help Chinese panda breeding and
conservation programs, but conservationists contend the panda loans
threaten more harm than good.

<TEXT>
   Democrats today released a preliminary draft of a
platform that promises to restore ``competence and hope'' to the
presidency, while avoiding any mention of higher taxes, a freeze on
Pentagon spending or a Palestinian homeland.
   The 3,500-word draft was being debated, revised and voted on
later today by a 16-member platform drafting committee meeting on
the eve of the first gathering of the full 186-member platform
committee.
   The draft incorporates language on a dozen issues that
representatives of likely nominee Michael Dukakis and his only
remaining challenger, Jesse Jackson, agreed to two weeks ago in
drafting sessions on Mackinac Island, Mich.
   But in every significant area of dispute, it is Dukakis'
preferences and not Jackson's, that are embodied in the preliminary
draft. Jackson has said he may fight to the convention floor in
Atlanta next month for planks endorsing higher taxes on the rich
and a freeze on the Pentagon budget.
   Ted Sorensen, the onetime John F. Kennedy speechwriter who
penned an earlier platform ``discussion paper'' for Democratic
Party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr., said in an interview today, ``It's
fairly clear now this will be the shortest platform in over a
hundred years.''
   ``It will be a thematic, readable platform. It will not have the
traditional, negative cast. Reagan, Republican, Bush _ those words
aren't even mentioned,'' said Sorensen, who also helped write this
draft.
   The draft is headed ``The Restoration of Competence and Hope.''
It pledges party leaders and elected officials ``to restore
competence, caring and incorruptibility to the federal executive
branch and get it working again fairly for all Americans.''
   It calls for ``more stable defense budgets,'' appointment of a
drug czar and ``maintaining the special relationship with Israel''
while pursuing peace in the Middle East along the lines laid out in
the Camp David Accords.
   Dukakis, who has ruled out any talk in the platform of raising
taxes, gave a terse reply Thursday in Fall River, Mass., when asked
if he supported Jackson's call for a Palestinian homeland.
   ``No, of course not,'' said the Massachusetts governor and
certain nominee.
   Several state Democratic parties have called for
self-determination for Palestinians, saying the issue should be
part of the platform.
   The 16-member platform drafting committee headed by Rep. William
H. Gray of Philadelphia was planning to vote late today on a
preliminary draft culled from position papers agreed to in the
first round of drafting sessions two weeks ago on Mackinac Island,
Mich.
   Dukakis's representatives there refused to endorse higher taxes
on the rich and insisted the platform call for a stable Pentagon
budget, not the freeze Jesse Jackson wants.
   Gray's panel is essentially a subcommittee of the full
186-member platform committee, which will hold its first meetings
here Saturday and Sunday.
   The full panel, chaired by Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard,
will try to craft the document that the entire convention will be
asked to approve on July 19. Jackson has more than a quarter of the
delegates, enough to force a floor fight on any issues he chooses.
   Jackson huddled in Washington on Thursday with his convention
and platform strategists.
   Ron Brown, director of Jackson's convention operation, said
discssion on the Palestinian issue is still going on between the
Jackson and Dukakis camps.
   Asked if Jackson would insist on acceptance of a platform plank
calling for a Palestinian homeland, Brown said, ``We want language
we can accept.''
   Pressed on the Palestinian state question, he added: ``We
haven't drawn any line in the sand.''
   Dukakis told reporters, ``I support direct negotiations between
Israel and its neighbors and responsible Palestinians who ...
recognize Israel's right to exist within its borders.''
   Jackson reportedly told his lieutenants in the private
Washington meeting that he expects to see all the disputes settled
and the party unified coming out of Atlanta.
   Jackson, asked why he had not endorsed Dukakis as have the
governor's other former rivals, said, ``Kennedy did not stop before
New York in 1980. Hart did not stop before San Francisco in 1984.''
   He said the others may have ``thrown in the towel in the face of
adversity,'' but ``I'm tough ... I will never surrender.''

<TEXT>
   Inadequate trauma care is killing 20,000
Americans each year and causing billions of dollars in losses,
researchers say.
   Most states lack regional systems to treat people injured in
motor vehicle or industrial accidents, falls, shootings, stabbings
or drowning, a study shows.
   It has been 22 years since the National Research Council labeled
trauma ``the neglected disease of modern society,'' the study in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association said.
   Only two states, Maryland and Virginia, have all the elements
needed for adequate emergency medical services to handle trauma
under standards defined by the American College of Surgeons, the
study found.
   It said 19 states and the District of Columbia either had
``incomplete statewide coverage or lacked essential components,''
while 29 states ``had yet to initiate the process of trauma center
designation.''
   Studies dating to 1979 show one-third of trauma deaths in
hospitals not able to handle such cases are preventable, said the
study, which was led by Dr. John G. West of St. Joseph Hospital in
Orange, Calif.
   Up to 20,000 Americans die needlessly each year because they are
treated inadequately for trauma, West said Thursday.
   Trauma costs the nation an estimated $113 billion annually,
including lost wages. Twenty-five percent could be saved with
adequate trauma care, he said.
   Trauma centers differ from regular hospitals. They have a
surgical team ready at all times to operate on critically injured
patients. They also have advanced communications and transportation
systems to get patients to the site as quickly as possible.
   West said many hospitals resist cooperating with trauma care
networks for various economic reasons.
   In urban areas, hospitals tend to avoid being designated as a
trauma center because many trauma patients are poor and can't pay,
he said.
   In non-urban areas, hospitals want to be designated as trauma
centers so as not to lose business to rivals.
   Both problems can be addressed with adequate regional
cooperation and planning, according to the study.

<HEAD>Veteran Songwriter Sues Motown Founder for $170 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A songwriter who helped write dozens of hit songs
during Motown Record Corp.'s heyday in the 1960s is suing company
founder Berry Gordy Jr. for more than $170 million.
   Eddie Holland Jr. charged in the suit, filed Thursday in Wayne
County Circuit Court, that Gordy failed to pay him royalties in
1987, maliciously sued him over those payments, refused to let
Holland examine Motown financial records, and made unfavorable
licensing deals.
   Holland, 48, also asked that the court order Gordy to return to
him compositions, master recordings and copyrights related to his
work for Motown. The songs alone are worth $35.2 million, Holland
said in the suit.
   Neither Gordy nor Holland was available for comment, The Detroit
News said. Motown officials in Los Angeles, where Gordy moved most
company operations in the early 1970s, declined comment.
   Holland, his brother, Brian Holland, and Lamont Dozier wrote Top
10 hits for most Motown recording artists during the mid-1960s.
Those songs included ``You Can't Hurry Love'' and ``Stop! In the
Name of Love'' by the Supremes; ``You're A Wonderful One'' by
Marvin Gaye; ``Baby, I Need Your Loving'' and ``I Can't Help
Myself'' by the Four Tops; ``Heat Wave'' by Martha and the
Vandellas, and ``Please, Mr. Postman'' by the Marvelettes.
   Members of the Vandellas and Marvelettes also have filed suits
recently suits against Gordy and Motown in county court over unpaid
royalties.

<HEAD>Court Says States Not Required to Provide Bus Transportation for
Poor Children in North Dakota Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 14-24, In other action, with other cases.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a case of particular importance to rural
areas, the Supreme Court ruled today that states are not required
to provide free bus transportion for poor school children.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said North Dakota officials did not
violate the rights of families that have trouble affording the
busing charges.
   ``A state's decision to allow local school boards the option of
charging patrons a user fee for bus service is constitutionally
permissible,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said for the court.
``The Constitution does not require that such service be provided
at all and it is difficult to imagine why choosing to offer the
service should entail a constitutional obligation to offer it for
free.''
   The ruling is in line with earlier court decisions upholding
laws that treat the wealthy and poor differently. The court has
said such laws are permissible if they serve a rational purpose.
   North Dakota law provides free bus transporation to those living
in districts that have reorganized to broaden their tax base and
improve education. Only those districts that have not reorganized
are allowed to charge parents for busing costs.
   The law was intended to spur reorganization while assuring
people in those districts they would not have to pay for
transporation.
   The court said the law is a rational approach to encouraging
local school officials to reorganize.
   The law was challenged by Paula Kadrmas from rural Dickinson,
N.D. She said the statute denied equal rights to her daughter,
Sarita, because the family could not afford a $97 annual bus fee.
   Ms. Kadrmas has driven Sarita the 16 miles to school rather than
pay the fee.
   Bus service in Dickinson is offered for a fee to elementary
school students who live more than three miles from school and to
high school students who live more than four miles away.
   The North Dakota Supreme Court had upheld the law.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting opinion, said,
``Today, the court continues the retreat from the promise of equal
educational opportunity by holding that a school district's refusal
to allow an indigent child who lives 16 miles from the nearest
school to use a schoolbus service without paying fees does not
violate'' the Constitution.
   He was joined by Justice William J. Brennan. Justices John Paul
Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun dissented in a separate opinion.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Limited severely states' authority to lower the electric rates
public utilities charge as a result of agreements with federal
regulators.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, said Mississippi authorities are
required to pass through to retail electricity customers a
utility's federally determined share of the costs of constructing
the Grand Gulf 1 nuclear plant.
   _ Limited the government's broad immunity from lawsuits,
reinstating a suit by a couple fired on by a drunk, off-duty Navy
medic in Maryland.
   The 6-3 ruling expands the government's liability for negilgence
in personal injury claims.
   _ Ruled that state and federal officials may not be sued for
monetary damages by people whose Social Security disability
benefits were cut off unlawfully.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said the fact that Congress has
provided an assortment of remedies for people whose benefits
wrongly are terminated means federal courts may not allow such
lawsuits.
   _ Said its famous Miranda ruling is sufficient to protect the
rights of criminal defendants questioned by police after they are
indicted or otherwise formally charged.
   The justices, voting 5-4 to uphold an Illinois man's murder
conviction, said the warnings police have given suspects since the
court's landmark 1966 decision adquately protect an
already-indicted suspect's right to legal help.
   _ Limited the power of federal judges to dismiss criminal
charges when prosecutors violate a law requiring speedy trial of
defendants.
   In a 6-3 ruling, the court reinstated the indictment in Seattle
of Larry Lee Taylor, who is accused of cocaine trafficking.
   The school-bus case is Kadrmas vs. Dickinson Public Schools,
86-7113.

<HEAD>Court Says Officials May Not Be Sued for Monetary Damages in
Arizona DisabilityCase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

   State and federal officials may not be sued
for monetary damages by people whose Social Security disability
benefits were cut off unlawfully, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said the fact Congress has provided an
assortment of remedies for people whose benefits wrongly are
terminated means federal courts may not allow such lawsuits.
   Millions of people file Social Security disability claims each
year.
   ``Such a remedy, not having been included in the elaborate
remedial scheme devised by Congress, is unavailable,'' Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court in reversing a legal
victory previously won by several Arizona residents.
   Their lawsuit, sparked by the cutting-off of benefits in 1981,
had been filed against one state and two federal officials who made
policy under the Social Security Act's disability-benefits program.
   The suit said the recipients' constitutionally protected
due-process rights had been violated by then-Secretary of Health
and Human Services Richard Schweiker; John Svahn, head of the
Social Security Administration at the time; and William R. Sims,
director of the Arizona Disability Determination Service.
   A series of Supreme Court decisions since 1971 has allowed
people alleging certain constitutional violations by public
officials to sue for monetary damages in federal court.
   The court has done so when it found ``no special factors
counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by
Congress'' and ``no explicit congressional declaration'' that
monetary damages may not be awarded in such cases.
   In today's decision, O'Connor said Congress has indicated that
such lawsuits should not be available when Social Security
disability benefits are ended unlawfully.
   ``We agree that suffering months of delay in receiving the
income on which one has depended for the very necessities of life
cannot be fully remedied by the belated restoration of back
benefits,'' O'Connor said.
   She noted that one of the Arizonans who sued, James Chilicky,
was in the hospital recovering from open-heart surgery when he was
informed that his heart condition was no longer classified as
disabling.
   ``Congress, however, has addressed the problems created by state
agencies' wrongful termination of disability benefits,'' O'Connor
said. ``Whether or not we believe that its response was the best
response, Congress is the body charged with making the inevitable
compromises required in the design of a massive and complex welfare
benefits program.''
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A.
Blackmun dissented.
   ``In appropriate circumstances we should defer to a
congressional decision to substitute alternate relief for a
judicially created remedy,'' Brennan wrote for the three. But he
said nothing in the Social Security Act or its amendments contains
``any suggestion that Congress meant to preclude recognition of
(federal lawsuits) for persons whose constitutional rights are
violated by those charged with administering the program.''
   The case is Schweiker vs. Chilicky, 86-1781.

<HEAD>Court Limits Power of Federal Judges to Dismiss Criminal Charges
in Seattle Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today limited the power of
federal judges to dismiss criminal charges when prosecutors violate
a law requiring speedy trial of defendants.
   In a 6-3 ruling, the court reinstated the indictment in Seattle
of Larry Lee Taylor, who is accused of cocaine trafficking.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said the
presiding judge in the case abused her authority by failing to
analyze adequately all the factors that contributed to delay in
bringing Taylor to trial.
   ``Seemingly ignored were the brevity of the delay and the
consequential lack of prejudice to (Taylor), as well as (Taylor's)
own illicit contribution to the delay,'' Blackmun said.
   He said the judge apparently threw out the case ``in order to
send a strong message to the government that unexcused delays will
not be tolerated. That factor alone ... does not suffice to justify
barring reprosecution in light of all the other circumstances
present.''
   The ruling is a victory for the Reagan administration, which
argued for reinstatement of the indictment.
   Under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974 any criminal defendant in
federal court must be brought to trial within 70 days of being
indicted. If not, the indictment can be dismissed.
   In Taylor's case, U.S. District Judge Barbara J. Rothstein
dismissed the indictment and blocked any effort to re-indict him on
the same charges.
   Taylor had been indicted July 25, 1984, on charges of conspiring
to distribute cocaine and possessing 400 grams of cocaine with
intent to distribute it.
   His trial was scheduled to begin Nov. 19, 1984, one day before
the 70-day deadline under the Speedy Trial Act.
   Taylor failed to show up for his trial, however, and was
declared a fugitive.
   He was arrested in San Mateo County, Calif., the following
February. Taylor then was placed in the custody of federal
authorities in San Francisco while he testified as a defense
witness in a federal narcotics prosecution.
   The federal grand jury that indicted Taylor issued a superseding
indictment on April 24, 1985.
   Judge Rothstein, in considering the time elapsed from Taylor's
disapperance until the issuance of the new indictment, ruled that
most of the delay was not the government's fault and therefore did
not apply to the Speedy Trial Act.
   But she said 15 days of the delay were due to the government's
actions and therefore the Speedy Trial Act deadline had been missed
by 14 days.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld her ruling throwing
out the case.
   The Supreme Court reversed that ruling today.
   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan
and Thurgood Marshall.
   The case is U.S. vs. Taylor, 87-573.

<TEXT>
   A rash of new mudslides sent boulders
hurtling down a mountainside today, disrupting efforts by rescue
workers to reach 100 people believed buried under tons of mud and
rocks that smothered this village.
   Radio reports said 31 people were injured in the mudslides
Thursday in Catak village. One body was recovered Thursday before
torrential rains triggered more slides that halted rescue efforts
for the night.
   Radio reports also said villagers heard people crying for help
from beneath the debris.
   Catak is in Trabzon province near the Black Sea, about 500 miles
east of Ankara.
   Turkish civil defense workers, helped by a 32-member West German
rescue team with search dogs, shoveled through the mud and stones
that roared down on the mountain village Thursday morning.
   ``The dogs found three separate areas where there may be people
buried, but we don't yet know if they're dead or alive,'' said
Klaus Kolter, of the Mannheim-based West German Rescue Dog
Association.
   Soon after the rescuers started work this morning, however,
rocks began tumbling down the mountainside, hitting a truck and
slightly injuring the driver, the Anatolia news agency said.
   ``The rescue operation is difficult because landslides keep
coming down,'' Gov. Enver Hizlan of Trabzon province said. ``They
stop work and raise thick clouds of dust everywhere.''
   Turkish newspapers today reported death tolls ranging between 50
and 200. They said five buses and two trucks were buried beneath
tons of mud.
   Officials denied an announcement Thursday by the Turkish Red
Crescent, a relief organization, that up to 300 people had been
killed.
   Televised reports said the landslides had caused a river to
flood the village. Footage showed some houses under water and
others buried beneath the mud, their roofs barely protruding.
   The televised reports also showed trees and lampposts lying on
ground. Some vehicles were buried in soil.
   Hizlan said 26 Turks and three West German tourists were so far
reported missing, but that he expected the numbers to rise.
   ``They were mostly people from other districts, so we haven't
heard from their relatives yet,'' Hizlan said.
   Villagers said the initial mudslides with a deep rumbling noise.
   ``It sounded like someone was exploding dynamite close by. There
were clouds of dust. I flung myself down, then ran for my life when
I saw the landslide coming,'' said construction foreman Recep
Ergain.
   Heavy rains apparently triggered the slide, which buried a
crowded coffeehouse, a restaurant, four houses and a high school
closed for the summer vacation. It blocked a fast-flowing stream
that flooded another part of the village.
   ``The villagers panicked as they rushed away from the falling
debris. I saw 25 to 30 people crammed on a small crossing that
collapsed under their weight,'' Ergain said.
   He said bulldozers had uncovered an empty van, but that a bus
was still unaccounted for.
   The three missing West Germans were identified as Markus Mutter,
Andreas Burghard and Birgit Hastenteufel, all traveling to Trabzon.
Their ages were not immediately available.
   They were reported missing by two friends.
   Catak village president Riza Yavuz was quoted as telling Turkish
newspapers he had warned the Public Works Ministry of a landslide
threat in the area, where a major highway construction project is
under way, but got no response.
   The earth had been loosened by heavy rains in the region, where
frequent landslides are sometimes blamed on extensive cutting of
forests.
   The television reports said it took about four hours for rescue
teams to reach the site. They said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers
tried unsuccessfully to push away the mud and stone which covered
the area. They moved slowly for fear of causing new landslides.
   Buses and vehicles were waiting on a road at the time of the
slide because the highway was closed by the earlier landslide
Thursday shortly after midnight, the reports said.
   Catak is strung along a two-lane highway leading to eastern
Anatolia and Iran from the Black Sea port of Trabzon. It lies in
Turkey's main hazelnut-growing region near a famous tourist
attraction, the ruined Byzantine monastery of Surmela.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations announced today it
will send $9.1 million in emergency food to help 1.5 million
drought victims in Vietnam.
   A news release from the U.N. World Food Program said its
officials had confirmed a serious deterioration in the food supply
in 12 provinces of northern Vietnam.
   The U.N. agency said it would provide 30,000 tons of cereals and
720 tons of vegetable oil. Hanoi earlier appealed for foreign food
aid.
   The food program said the current crisis was the lastest in a
series of natural disasters that have severely reduced Vietnam's
food supply. In 1987, the country was hit by typhoons, floods,
insect infestation and an erratic monsoon season.
   Since the beginning of 1988, food shortages have increased as an
unusually prolonged winter was followed by drought, the agency
said. A shortfall of about 700,000 tons of rice for the current
June harvest is expected.
   As a result of the shortages, food prices on the open market
have soared to levels beyond the purchasing power of most
Vietnamese, the news release said.
   The Vietnamese government has also admitted to mismanagement of
the agricultural sector as well as the economy as a whole. Over the
past year, Hanoi has allowed far greater freedom to farmers in
growing and marketing their crops.

<TEXT>
   A high court today adjourned preliminary
hearings on petitions filed by Union Carbide Corp. in the Bhopal
gas disaster case, the Press Trust of India reported.
   Justice S.K. Seth of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Jabalpur
set July 22 for the next hearing, the agency said.
   The Indian government has filed a $3 billion suit against Union
Carbide for the 1984 gas leak that killed nearly 3,000 people and
injured more than 20,000 in the southern city of Bhopal.
   The gas leak at a pesticide plant operated by a Union Carbide
subsidiary was the world's worst industrial disaster.
   Two petitions filed by Union Carbide lawyers concern an order by
the Bhopal District Court instructing the U.S.-based multinational
to pay interim relief to the gas victims.
   Seth on April 4 upheld the order and fixed the amount at $192
million. Union Carbide lawyers on May 2 petitioned the court to
review Seth's decision.
   The other application filed by Union Carbide concerned a June 16
order by Bhopal District Judge M.W. Deo.
   Union Carbide, headquartered in Danbury, Conn., argued that Deo
had pre-judged the case by ordering interim relief. The company had
asked that the case be tranferred to another judge.
   Deo declined to remove himself from the case.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson picked up six of
Puerto Rico's 57 delegates today and said their switch represented
``a victory for the people'' who gave him a primary win here.
   As Jackson opened a three-day visit to this Caribbean island,
the Boston Globe reported that the Democratic candidate has
indicated to aides that he would not accept the vice presidential
nomination if it is offered by Michael Dukakis.
   ``What he implied was that he was not going to tie his tail to
anyone else's kite,'' one aide, speaking on condition on anonymity,
told the Globe.
   Jackson breakfasted this morning in the Condado Beach Hotel with
his local campaign committee and said picking up the delegates
represented ``a victory for the people...a victory for democracy.''
   He said Thursday night he also wants to meet with Puerto Rican
delegates in hopes of persuading more of them to support him.
   Jackson won the island's non-binding primary on March 20, but
received none of the island's 57 delegates. They were chosen as
uncommitted, then pledged to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis by
Puerto Rico Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon.
   ``We've made steps in the right direction,'' Jackson said after
an hour-long session at the stately 16th-century Spanish governor's
mansion.
   Hernandez Colon said he and other party leaders decided there
were six delegates who weren't firmly committed to Dukakis and
preferred Jackson.
   ``We expect we will be able to obtain that support from them ...
in the interests of party unity and in the interests of the
fairness question,'' Hernandez Colon said.
   He said Jackson wants other delegates approached as well.
   ``We are willing to undertake such a search to see if additional
support can be gotten,'' the governor said.
   Jackson said he will push at next month's convention for a
change in delegate-selection rules. Hernandez Colon agreed that
Puerto Rico's system should be changed.
   Hernandez Colon explained that the vote for uncommitted delegate
slates, who didn't campaign for presidential candidates, was a
battle of local politics.
   His Popular Democratic Party, which supports the Commonwealth
status, won 55 of 57 delegates over the rival New Progressive
Party, which wants statehood.
   Hernandez Colon said he had conferred earlier with Dukakis
national campaign officials.
   ``They told me to do what we thought was best for party unity,''
Hernandez Colon said.
   Jackson reiterated his support for Puerto Rican
self-determination, which he described as giving the islanders the
right to choose their own status without fear of losing U.S.
support. He said he thought the issue of Puerto Rican status should
be addressed at the convention.
   Asked whether he sought support from the Puerto Rican governor
for himself as the party's vice presidential candidate, Jackson
replied: ``We did not discuss that, but between now and Saturday,
he could get that inspired.''
   Jackson said earlier in Washington he has made a decision on how
he would reply if offered the vice presidential nomination, but is
keeping it private for now. Hernandez Colon said Jackson ``deserves
serious consideration.''
   Hernandez Colon angered many Puerto Rican politicians in New
York by campaigning for Dukakis. Jackson was accompanied here by
state Sen. Olga Mendez of New York.
   The governor, who will head Puerto Rico's delegation to Atlanta,
met in New York two weeks ago with Puerto Rican political leaders
to explain why he supported Dukakis.
   The governor, who for years has had close ties with
Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, said he supported Dukakis
because he considered him a socially progressive governor who had
the best chance to win. Dukakis also is willing to support
increased autonomy for the commonwealth, Hernandez Colon said.
   The 3.2 million Puerto Ricans have U.S. citizenship and are
largely self-governing but subject to federal laws. They do not
vote in national elections and their delegate to Congress has no
vote.

   The White House said today it wants legal
proceedings to go forward in the case of fired National Security
Council aide Oliver L. North and is doing everything possible to
release the necessary classified documents.
   Spokesman Roman Popadiuk responded to a statement by Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell, who said at a hearing in U.S. District Court
Thursday, ``The highest levels of the government have to make a
decision as to whether this case is going to go or if it's not
going to go.''
   Gesell suggested that Attorney General Edwin Meese III name a
Justice Department official to help the administration decide
whether it is willing to make the disclosures of national security
documents that are necessary to move the case to trial.
   Popadiuk said a team of senior officials has been spending ``an
inordinate amount of hours'' to meet the demand for relase of
classified documents.
   ``We want the legal proceedings to go forward, but the question
of a trial is up to the judge and the prosecutor,'' Popadiuk said.
``We are doing everything we possibly can.''
   Popadiuk added that he could not say whether the administration
would consider any further steps to speed up the declassification
process.
   The judge said that he wondered whether ``we don't need a clear
decision from the administration itself that they want to try this
case or they don't want to.''
   Gesell made the comments after he heard independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh's request for a month's delay in the production
of 150,000 pages of classified CIA and Justice Department documents
still to be reviewed by an interagency task force.
   The group, composed of officials from the agencies that produced
the documents, must identify the passages the government doesn't
want disclosed in court, Walsh said. It cannot complete the work by
July 1.
   While the members of the interagency task force are ``not trying
to torpedo the case or help the case,'' they ``are not in the
position to judge the larger implications of the case,'' the judge
said.
   ``But the obstacles keep arising.''
   Voicing frustration at the additional delay, the judge indicated
that he had planned on Friday to issue an order setting the date
for North's trial. ``I'm not going to do that. The case isn't
ready,'' he said.
   ``If you can't get a trial going soon there isn't going to be a
trial,'' Gesell told lawyers on both sides.
   The hearing was held a day after Gesell had given North until
July 11 to specify which secret documents he wants to disclose in
court when the case goes to trial.
   The fired National Security Council aide is accused of
conspiring with former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord to
illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan
rebels. Gesell ordered separate trials for each of the four.
   So far, 82,000 pages of classified documents have been turned
over to the defense for pretrial inspection.
   Walsh said that ``a much smaller number but still a large
number'' of documents were relevant to the case. He said he doubted
that many of the 150,000 pages of unreviewed material would be
admissible as evidence.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, a defendant
must notify the court before trial of his intention to disclose
specific secrets in court.
   The court has the power to delete portions of documents the
government doesn't want disclosed or to substitute statements of
facts that the material would prove if shown to the jury.
   But if there is a sufficient quantity of secret material that
cannot be edited, the judge is empowered to dismiss the charges if
the government refuses to let it be disclosed in court.
   An alternative to dismissing all the charges in the Iran-Contra
case would be to try the defendants on those counts of the
indictment that don't involve the wide use of classified documents.
   Clearly the main conspiracy count against all four defendants
would require the greatest disclosure of government secrets to show
they acted with authority of high government officials.
   North and Poindexter might not be entitled to disclose as many
secrets to rebut charges that they lied to Congress or obstructed a
presidential inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair.
   The same would hold for charges that North obstructed an FBI
inquiry into who paid for a $15,000 security fence around his home
in Great Falls, Va., or that he pocketed some of the travelers
checks given to him by a Contra leader to cover expenses.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Congress of Racial Equality
confirmed today that an investigator hired by his group has
uncovered evidence of drug use in the case of a black teen-ager who
claims she was kidnapped and raped by white men.
   Meanwhile, a man who says he is a surveillance expert either has
or soon will appear before a federal grand jury investigating
possible fraud in the Tawana Brawley case, according to reports
published today.
   The New York Times, citing unidentified sources, said
authorities had granted Samuel McClease immunity from prosecution
for illegal break-ins and other possible offenses in exchange for
his cooperation.
   The New York Post, also quoting unnamed sources, said that the
deal may include McClease's pleading guilty to some minor charges.
   McClease has said he was hired by the Rev. Al Sharpton, a
Brawley family adviser, to plant listening devices in the home and
office of one of the Brawley family lawyers, C. Vernon Mason, and
in Sharpton's own home.
   The private investigator hired by CORE said in a WKNY radio
interview Thursday in Kingston that he had evidence suggesting Miss
Brawley was involved in drugs and prostitution during her four-day
disappearance last November.
   ``Our best belief is that Tawana got involved in something
initially voluntarily,'' said Galen Kelley, a forensic psychologist
hired by CORE executive director Roy Innis last December. ``It had
to do with drugs ... you'd have to define it as prostitution.''
   Kelly said he would report his findings to the grand jury in New
York City. ``That's the report he has presented to me,'' Innis said
of Kelley's comments today from his Brooklyn office. ``That drug
thing comes up all the time.''
   McClease has said his tapes show that the advisers did not
believe Miss Brawley's story that she was kidnapped and raped by
six white men, but were using the case for personal and political
gain.
   None of the papers' sources could verify that the tapes included
the information McClease said they did. However, WCBS-TV reported
today that both U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who heads the
federal investigation, and state Attorney General Robert Abrams,
who has been appointed special prosecutor in the Brawley case, have
heard the tapes.
   Miss Brawley, 16, and her family have refused to cooperate with
a state grand jury, which has been trying to learn what happened to
the Wappingers Falls girl during four days last November.
   The Post said that McClease turned over tapes of conversations
to the federal grand jury Thursday. The sources also said McClease
testified Thursday and was expected to resume testifying today.
   But the Times said it was unclear when McClease would be called
to testify.
   McClease said Sharpton feared as early as February that the
story was falling apart and wanted something he could use to
protect himself.
   Sharpton denies knowing, meeting or hiring McClease. The team of
Brawley advisers have called him a liar.

   The Navy will drop manslaughter charges
against at least two of the six sailors charged in a recruit's
death, and has offered non-judicial punishment rather than a court
martial to three of them, defense attorneys say.
   Attorneys for Petty Officers 1st Class Richard E. Blevins and
David J. Smith, instructors at the Naval Rescue Swimmer School,
said they were informed Thursday of the decision by Rear Adm. David
R. Morris, chief of naval air training, in Corpus Christi, Texas.
   A spokesman for Morris, Lt. Lee Saunders, said today he couldn't
comment on the lawyers' statements because the admiral is still
investigating the case.
   Blevins, Smith and three other instructors were charged with
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery in the
March 2 death of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis.
   Mirecki was literally scared to death when he was forced into a
swimming pool after trying to quit a rescue course at the Pensacola
Naval Air Station, according to testimony at an investigative
hearing two weeks ago.
   Morris also gave Blevins and Smith the option of non-judicial
punishment, which could mean a pay cut, restriction to the base or
extra duty on the conspiracy charge and an added charge of battery,
the lawyers said.
   Thomas A. Torchia, the officer in charge of the school, was
charged only with dereliction of duty and also is being offered
non-judicial punishment instead of a court-martial, said his
lawyer, Lt. Thomas C. Leighton.
   None of the three have decided whether to accept the unspecified
non-judicial punishment or opt for court-martial, which could clear
them of the charges, their attorneys said.
   Smith's civilian attorney, Barry Beroset, said he was told of
the admiral's decision in a telephone call from the prosecutor in
the case, Lt. Cmdr. Larry Wynne.
   Blevins' attorney, Lt. Steven H. Cohen, said today that Blevins
was given until Monday to make his decision. If he should opt for
the non-judicial punishment he would go before Morris on Wednesday
in Pensacola.
   Petty Officers 2nd Class Frankie D. Deaton, John W. Zelenock and
Michael W. Combe had faced the same charges as Smith and Blevins,
but lawyers for those three refused to comment on the disposition
of their cases.
   If court-martialed and found guilty, the defendants could have
been sentenced to prison and expelled from the service.
   Non-judicial punishment could include a 50 percent cut in pay
for two months, reduction of one pay grade, restriction to base for
60 days, extra duty for 45 days or any combination of those
penalties, Cohen told WEAR.
   Lynne Johansen, Mirecki's sister, said the family expected that
court-martials might not be recommended for all the defendants
following the investigative hearing.
   Mrs. Johansen said criminal proceedings were secondary to
finding out how her brother died, which the hearing accomplished,
and said changes in the training program were made to avoid a
recurrence.
   ``We still feel very satisfied in knowing many changes have been
made in the situation,'' she said in a telephone interview from
Appleton.
   The rescue swimmer school was closed March 29 and reopened
Monday after changes in procedures, including a ban against
instructors touching recruits.

<HEAD>USDA Also Keeping Eye on Weather in Other Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought may be holding the attention of
crop watchers around the world, but professionals in the
Agriculture Department also are keeping a weather eye on other
countries that compete with American grain farmers in the global
market.
   A deep fear of farmers, real or partly imagined, is that the
U.S. government, other countries, war in the Mideast or the weather
might deprive them of the valuable export markets that have meant
so much.
   With rising grain prices and declining prospects for 1988
harvests, some foreign buyers might be tempted to shop around to
see if better deals can be made. It's one of the possibilities the
USDA is considering.
   ``Foreign grain production, excluding rice, is forecast up 3
percent in 1988-89, led by increases in Europe and the Soviet
Union,'' says the department's Economic Research Service.
``However, among the major exporters competing with the United
States, smaller gains in grain area and production are expected.''
   If Europe and the Soviet Union are discounted, total area and
production of wheat and coarse grains _ mostly corn, oats, barley
and sorghum _ are expected to climb by less than 2 percent,
remaining well below the levels of the early 1980s.
   As with U.S. harvest prospects this year, the world situation
also is uncertain, and early crop projections are likely to undergo
substantial revisions, especially for crops in the Southern
Hemisphere.
   Two agency economists, Pete Riley and Sara Schwartz, examined
the competitive grain export situation in a report scheduled for
the July issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   ``Concerns about hot and dry weather in the United States and
Canada, and the recent run up in prices may have influenced
Southern Hemisphere farmers' planting decisions, which are made in
May and June,'' the report said.
   But the report added that only a few large adjustments in
planted area or production are expected _ some larger, some smaller
_ and ``the changes tend to offset each other.''
   The global wheat supply has tightened more than for coarse
grains, the report said. Wheat trade has been brisk, but world
traffic in coarse grains has been flat since 1985-86, and compared
with wheat, supplies of corn and the other grains are abundant.
   Wheat plantings in the major competiting countries are forecast
to rise by less than 1 percent in 1988-89. Higher prices may
trigger some expansion in Australia and Argentina, but wet weather
last fall in the European Economic Community held down plantings.
   Total EEC wheat plantings for 1988 may have dropped 2 percent,
but yields are expected to be greater this year, so production
could be up.
   In the coarse grains, major competitors are projected to boost
production by only 2 percent this year, with corn output rising the
most significantly. Not counting the EEC, where no change is
indicated, corn production could rise by 14 percent over 1987-88.
Smaller increases are expected for barley and sorghum.
   ``The most dramatic change among the coarse grain competitors is
likely in Thailand, where a monsoon hurt the 1987-88 corn crop, and
the area planted was already down because of low prices,'' the
report said.
   In 1988-89, Thailand's corn production is forecast to jump more
than 75 percent to 4.8 million metric tons and ``will enable
Thailand to recapture some of its traditional export markets.''
   South Africa, another competitor, is also boosting corn
production, despite the government's policy of diversifying its
agricultural exports away from corn. Production could increase to 8
million tons from 7.5 million last year.
   In Argentina, coarse grain output was forecast at about the same
as in 1987-88, although the planted area may increase about 4
percent.
   ``An average Argentine growing season could mean more
abandonment (of planted acreage) in 1988-89, offsetting some of the
likely increase in plantings, while yields are not expected to
match 1987-88,'' the report said. ``Last season, with excellent
conditions and high yields, there was below-average abandonment.''
   Eastern Europe, although not usually considered a major
exporter, is expected to rebound sharply in corn production this
year, thus allowing for larger exports and reduced imports.
   China's corn production may be down slightly to around 76
million tons in 1988-89, with the planted area declining 3 percent,
the report said.

   Two Americans and a West German each will receive
the Kyoto Prize for pioneering research in a ceremony scheduled for
November, Japan's Kyodo News Service said Friday.
   Kyocera Corp. Chairman Kazuo Inamori set up the Kyoto Prize,
administered under his Inamori Foundation, four years ago to honor
research in the fields of basic science, frontier science and
philosophy.
   Stanford University professor John McCarthy was selected in the
field of frontier science for his work on artificial intelligence.
   Noam Avram Chomsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
took the basic science award for his work in linquistics.
   West German scholar Paul Thieme was chosen for his research on
Indian philosophy, the report said.
   Each of the prize recipients will receive $350,000 in the Nov.
10 ceremony in Kyoto, 230 miles southwest of Tokyo, Kyodo said.

   A new manual influenced by the ``Kama Sutra,'' the
Indian manual on the art of love, will be offered to Estonian high
school students in a new drive to improve sex and family education,
the official news agency Tass said Friday.
   Tass said Estonian psychologist Andres Kherkel had prepared what
it billed as the first manual on family psychology for Soviet high
school students.
   The book was prepared as part of an effort to reduce divorce and
improve young people's understanding of family life in Estonia, one
of the Soviet Union's most westward looking regions.
   ``Eastern philosophy, in particular the tract `Kama Sutra' and
the studies of Mahatma Gandhi, exercised a big influence on the
composition of the second part,'' Tass quoted Kherkel as saying.
   It did not say when the book would start being used in Estonian
schools.

   France conducted its second
underground nuclear test in a week at the Mururoa atoll testing
ground in the South Pacific early Friday, officials said.
   The force of the blast was equivalent to about 20,000 tons of
dynamite, said a statement by the Australian Seismological Center
at the Bureau of Mineral Resources.
   An explosion at the atoll June 17 was equivalent to about 6,000
tons, the center said.
   Friday's blast was the fourth on the atoll this year and the
99th in a series started in 1976 when France abandoned atmospheric
testing.
   France maintains a policy of not commenting on reports of its
nuclear tests, which are vigorously opposed by nations in the

<TEXT>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service said Friday it
plans to cancel or restrict special September hunting seasons in 18
states for the blue-winged teal, a variety of duck hard hit by the
current drought.
   Director Frank Dunkle has accepted a staff recommendation made
earlier in the week to propose dropping the early season, generally
nine days, this year in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Illinois,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma,
Kansas and New Mexico, the service said.
   A similar season for all ducks in Iowa would be canceled.
   Additional shortening of the season or lower bag limits would be
proposed for blue-winged teal and in some cases other ducks in
Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands.
   The blue-winged teal has been one of the species most damaged by
the drought and loss of marshy breeding habitat in the northern
Great Plains and in Canada. The service earlier called the breeding
outlook this year ``grim.''
   The normal population of 4.8 million has declined to about 3.6
million, according to preliminary estimates.
   Dunkle's decision will be published for public comment and final
regulations should be adopted July 18, spokeswoman Meagan Durham
said.
   Regulations for the regular hunting season later in the fall
usually are adopted in August, and the service has warned hunters
it is taking a ``hard look'' at the restrictions it adopted in 1985
to see if they should be tightened further.

<HEAD>A Revival of Eugene O'Neill's `Ah, Wilderness!' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 3 grafs with what other critics said.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Ah, Wilderness!,'' Eugene O'Neill's only
comedy, is tinged with a poignancy that rarely surfaces in revivals
of this sweet-tempered play.
   That sadness comes through in the production starring Jason
Robards and Colleen Dewhurst which opened Thursday at Broadway's
Neil Simon Theater. It is a wistful, gentle remounting of a work
that celebrates the loss of innocence as well as the gaining of
self-knowledge.
   What makes the poignancy even more apparent is the pairing of
the play with ``Long Day's Journey into Night.'' They are running
in repertory at the Neil Simon as part of the First New York
International Festival of the Arts. ``Long Day's Journey,'' with
its miserly father, drug-addled mother and alcoholic sons, was the
reality of O'Neill's life. `Ah, Wilderness!'' is the fantasy.
   O'Neill once called the comedy ``a nostalgia for a youth I never
had,'' and a rosy-hued remembrance infuses the entire play. It's
set in 1906 _ six years before ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' _
and takes place in a small Connecticut town during that most
American of holidays, the Fourth of July. Parades, picnics,
fireworks, family dinners with most of the clan gathered around the
table, all are part of the play's long, leisurely story.
   ``Ah, Wilderness!'' centers on the Miller family, particularly
the 17-year-old son Richard, a stand-in for the playwright. Richard
is a rebel and a romantic, fond of quoting Swinburne, Shaw and all
those other ``radical'' writers dismissed by his mother and
secretly admired by his father.
   The parents in ``Ah, Wilderness!'' are everything O'Neill wanted
in his own father and mother. Nate and Essie Miller are
good-humored people who may be stern but are also always forgiving.
Most of the other adults are equally understanding. There's quiet
Aunt Lily and the hard-drinking but genial Uncle Sid who is not
made unbearable or destroyed by liquor like some of the characters
in ``Long Day's Journey.''
   Robards excels as crusty but kind-hearted father and Dewhurst
manages to turn the role of the mother _ usually considered a minor
character _ into a protective hen who will battle for her baby even
if she disapproves of what he does. They are adept at getting
laughs out of the most inconsequential situation.
   The pivotal role of Richard is played by a ruddy-cheeked young
actor named Raphael Sbarge. He brings an open-mouthed innocence to
a character who could be insufferable but here is genuine and
appealing.
   There are effective cameos from Elizabeth Wilson as Lily; George
Hearn as a golden-voiced Uncle Sid, a happy drunk who knows how to
sing; Campbell Scott as Richard's pompous older brother, and Annie
Golden as a baby-faced lady of the evening who tries to seduce
Richard.
   The setting by Michael H. Yeargan also links the play to ``Long
Day's Journey into Night.'' That living room, designed by Ben
Edwards, was dark and dank and featured a view of Long Island
Sound. The same water view is in Yeargan's set but the living room
is filled with bright furnishings and framed by flowered wallpaper.
   Arvin Brown has directed the show at a slow pace. There are
three long acts, and he has filled each with a lot of stage
business. It is a deliberately old-fashioned approach to the play,
allowing the audience to savor each member of the large cast.
   ``Ah, Wilderness!'' ends on a hopeful, expectant note as Brown
and company conjure up a stunning tableau. Richard gazes dreamily
at a full summer moon while his father remarks to his mother,
``Spring isn't everything ... There's a lot to be said for autumn
... And winter, if you're together.''
   It's a togetherness O'Neill's family never achieved, but at
least he managed to unite his imaginery family in ``Ah,
Wilderness.'' Robards, Dewhurst and the rest of the cast bring them
vibrantly to life.
   Frank Rich, in The New York Times, said: ``... It's hard to
imagine contemporary theatergoers being held by `Ah, Wilderness!'
unless they see `Long Day's Journey' in close proximity. I would
visit the plays in reverse order of composition, for O'Neill's most
cheerful work is best enjoyed now not for its comedy but as a
chaser to the mature brew of his art.''
   Howard Kissel in the New York Daily News wrote: ``Arvin Brown's
production captures beautifully the sunlit quality of the play. At
times it moves slowly, but after all, this is a period when
motoring is still regarded as a sport.''
   Clive Barnes in the New York Post wrote that the play provided
``total enchantment. ... On the surface `Ah, Wilderness!' is no
better a play than `Life with Father' or `You Can't Take It With
You,' but listen deeper and the echoing resonance of O`Neill _ the
youth of commonplace language with the certainty of natural speech,
the depth of characterization and aptness of anecdote _ soars above
the conventional.''

<HEAD>Tiny Insect Called Pear Thrip Threatens Vermont Maple Syrup, Fall
Foliage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BENNINGTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lush, green mountainsides in southern
Vermont have been scarred with patches of brown, the work of tiny
insects that are threatening the state's maple sugar industry and
tourism.
   A bug known as the pear thrip is blamed for damaging nearly
500,000 acres of forest in Vermont this year. By comparison, 21,000
acres were damaged last year, said H. Brenton Teillon, chief of
forest protection for the state Department of Forests and Parks.
   Officials say the bugs that attacked millions of maple trees
this spring are the state's worst insect problem in more than 25
years. The current drought is putting still further stress on trees.
   The maples are a source of income for hundreds of Vermonters who
tap them to produce syrup and sugar candy. The state produced
370,000 gallons of maple syrup this year, leading the nation, and
that generated $12.5 million in income.
   The loss of a significant portion _ some foresters fear up to a
fifth _ of the maples could also mean far fewer dollars this fall
from tourists who come to view the foliage.
   From a window in a four-seat plane, state forester Pete
Norkeveck assessed the damage over Bennington on Thursday
afternoon. Some forestland had retained its brilliant green, but
there were wide swaths of shriveled brown foliage with tints of
gray and orange.
   ``Those trees are in real trouble,'' says Norkeveck. ``If we
don't get some rain in the next couple of weeks, we're looking at a
very high mortality rate. Even with some rain, a lot of them might
not survive.''
   Pear thrips have been in the United States since the early part
of the century, but historically they have been a problem mainly in
orchards.
   Norkeveck said the pear thrips attack a tree's flowers in early
spring. The bugs then enter a period of dormance.
   Experts are unsure why the problem flared up this year. They
cite a variety of possible factors, including the drought, a
heavier-than-normal blooming of the maples this spring, and a cold
snap at a key time this spring that may have been a boon to the
insects.
   Bob Twitchell of Landgrove said he was one of the first maple
growers to be affected. He first saw the defoliation in the early
summer of 1985. To reduce stress on the maples on his 60-acres, he
decided not to tap his trees the following spring, losing his main
source of income for a year.
   ``If you don't tap for one year, you don't have the resources to
continue,'' he said. ``A lot of people just do it as a part-time
thing and they don't depend on it as much. But if I let up for one
year, I'm done for.''
   The problem has grown only worse.
   ``It looks like winter. There's nothing there,'' he said. ``I
just don't know as there's anything I can do.''
   He's given up sugaring completely for lumbering, and talks of
selling off some of his property to make ends meet.
   A similar sense of worry and uncertainty was evident Thursday
among 50 maple sugar producers, landowners, state and Canadian
officials who met in Bennington to discuss the problem.
   To a lesser degree, the infestation has also affected parts of
other New England states, New York and Pennsylvania, foresters said.

<HEAD>Painter Sues Police, Aldermen Over Seized Portrait</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a
lawsuit on behalf of an artist whose portrait of the late Mayor
Harold Washington in women's undergarments was seized by police
from an exhibition.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court, seeks $100,000 in
damages from Police Superintendent LeRoy Martin, unidentified
officers and three City Council members: Allan Streeter, Dorothy
Tillman and Bobby Rush.
   Several black aldermen marched from City Hall to the School of
the Art Institute on May 11 to demand that the portrait by David
Nelson be removed from an exhibiton of students' work.
   Police seized the painting, saying the display could provoke a
riot.
   ``We all must follow the rule of law, not the rule of
aldermen,'' said ACLU attorney Harvey Grossman. ``The law is quite
clear. The police must control the audience, not the speaker ...
not the painting.''
   ``I am deeply offended and angry at the vigilante behavior of
the aldermen and the irresponsible conduct of police,'' Nelson said
in a statement. ``I am suing to vindicate my rights and to ensure
that Chicago aldermen and police do not become the censors of other
artists in the future.''
   Rush called the lawsuit ``frivolous.''
   ``I'm not sure what the absolute motivation is, whether it's an
attempt to enhance (ACLU) fund-raising activities or if it's
political, because there were only three aldermen targeted for the
suit,'' he added.
   Defendants are accused of depriving Nelson of his right to
freedom of expression under the First Amendment; his right to be
free from unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment; and his
right not to be deprived of property without due process under the
14th Amendment.
   Washington died of a heart attack last November.

<HEAD>Agency Imposes Temporary Halt On Panda Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service warned zoos
Friday it will not consider applications to import pandas for
exhibit while it tries to decide whether and how to restrict the
practice.
   A Federal Register notice said reported plans by 30 instititions
in the United States and abroad to show pandas on loan from China
are ``posing new, cumulative threats to the wild and captive
populations of the species.''
   Michigan's Department of Natural Resources was denied import
permits on Monday to show pandas at a state fair. Last week, a
court order barred the Toledo, Ohio Zoo from collecting fees to see
pandas there on loan from China.
   The Toledo pandas were imported under a permit granted by the
service.
   Pandas are an endangered species protected by treaty and may not
be imported without a permit from the service. Only a few hundred
live in the wild in China, and zoologists fear the populations,
devastated by the loss of bamboo forests, are not large enough to
be self-sustaining.
   Conservation organizations claim the enthusiasm for showing
pandas imported from China, which attract large fee-paying crowds,
could hurt the species. China's share of the fees from a panda loan
has been reported at $300,000 to $500,000.
   The zoos contend that the fees help Chinese panda breeding and
conservation programs.
   The service promised decisions as quickly as possible.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II visited a former
Nazi death camp and condemned the ideology that made it possible,
but the pontiff angered Austria's chief rabbi by not making any
specific reference to the Jews.
   An estimated 110,000 people died in Mauthausen, the most
infamous Austrian concentration camp during the Third Reich.
   ``Here in Mauthausen were people who, in the name of a lunatic
ideology, set into motion a whole machinery of contempt and hatred
of others,'' John Paul said during a speech at the site.
   He also emphasized the pain and death ``of all people,
especially those who when World War II was raging in Europe,
suffered the torture of such camps.''
   However, while the pontiff mentioned Marcel Callo, a Catholic
activist who died in Mauthausen, and other Catholics persecuted in
Nazi camps, he made no reference to Jews by name.
   That infuriated Chaim Eisenberg, Austria's chief rabbi, who told
reporters in Vienna: ``A visit to Mauthausen without mentioning the
word Jews once is not satisfactory.''
   ``The only Jew he mentions who suffered is Jesus Christ, and he
didn't die in Mauthausen,'' Eisenberg added. An estimated 6 million
Jews died in the Holocaust.
   The 68-year-old pontiff told Austria's Jewish leaders earlier
today that Palestinians have a right to a homeland, but did not
respond to their call for the Vatican to give full diplomatic
recognition to the state of Israel.
   ``The Jewish people has the right to a homeland, as any other
nation has according to international law,'' John Paul said. ``The
same goes for the Palestinian people, many of whom have become
homeless and refugees.''
   John Paul reminded Austrian Jewish community President Paul
Grosz and five of the country's other leading Jews that he had made
a similar call last September in Miami during his tour of the
United States.
   ``By means of a common readiness for understanding and
compromise, solutions should finally be found which lead to a just,
comprehensive and lasting peace in this area,'' the pope said,
delivering his remarks in German.
   They met at the office of the papal ambassador, called the
nuncio, to Austria.
   John Paul then flew by helicopter to the town of Trausdorf near
the border with Hungary, where he celebrated an outdoor Mass for an
estimated 80,000 Roman Catholics, most of them from Hungary and
Yugoslavia.
   Speaking to the Jewish leaders, the pope said ``the
incomprehensible pain, suffering and tears'' of the Holocaust
``still are before my eyes and etched deep in my soul.''
   But he added: ``It would be clearly unjust and untrue to charge
Christianity with these unspeakable crimes.''
   The Roman Catholic leader said that instead the Holocaust arose
from a world ``without and even aimed against God'' and called for
an end to anti-Semitism.
   Some Jewish leaders have accused Christians, and the Vatican in
particular, of failing to do enough to prevent the Holocaust.
   Grosz, in his remarks, said the pontiff's decision to receive
controversial President Kurt Waldheim at the Vatican last year
shows that ``many Austrians still have not come to terms with their
past.''
   Waldheim has faced allegations of complicity in Nazi war crimes
during his service in the German army, while some Jewish leaders
have accused the church of failing to try to prevent the Holocaust.
   Waldheim has denied any wrongdoing during his World War II
military service.
   The Jewish community leader added: ``We sincerely regret that
full diplomatic relations between Israel and the Holy See have not
yet been established.'' The pontiff did not respond to that point.
   The Vatican has cited what it says is Israel's lack of settled
borders, as well as the international dispute over Jerusalem, for
the absence of diplomatic ties with Israel.
   Grosz appealed to the pontiff to work together with the Jewish
community to ``seek a way to solve the problem of the Middle East
together.''
   Grosz, the head of the nation's 12,000-member Jewish community,
later told a news conference that the good atmosphere of the
meeting was ``overwhelming.''

<HEAD>State Department Will Consult Congress on Fate of Moscow Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department says it will begin
consultations with Congress this autumn on what to do about the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow, which may have to be torn down because it
is believed to be riddled with listening devices.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said consultations
with Congress will be necessary before a presidential decision on
the embassy, because appropriations to fix the problem will be
necessary.
   A final report on the matter is still pending from a team of
consultants, the BDM Corp. and MK-Ferguson Co.
   According to a preliminary report by the private engineers, it
would be better and no more expensive to tear down the entire
eight-story chancery building and erect a new structure, than
rebuild part of the building.
   Congressional investigations led by Reps. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine, and Dan Mica, D-Fla., also have led to suggestions the
facility be razed.
   On the other hand, surveys commissioned by the Reagan
administration recommend the remodeling approach. Former Defense
Secretary James R. Schlesinger proposed that the top three stories
be rebuilt and that the most sensitive work be conducted in a newly
constructed annex.
   A study by Anne L. Armstrong, head of the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board, also said the building could be
salvaged.
   The United States began work on the new building a decade ago,
but it has not been occupied by American diplomats because of
structural flaws and evidence that the Soviet embedded listening
devices in the walls.
   In a tit-for-tat move, the Soviets have been denied access to
their new chancery building in Washington.

   Zambezia province has been the scene of extensive fighting

<HEAD>Lotto Winners to Repay Debts from Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple who filed for bankruptcy six weeks
before winning $4.6 million in the lottery say they'll pay their
debts even though they're not required to by law.
   ``We're not criminals,'' Jerome Jenks of Haines City said. ``We
want to clear up our credit.''
   The first of 20 yearly Florida Lotto checks for $229,000 was
issued to the Jenkses on Friday. Legally, their creditors can't
demand a nickel from the windfall.
   ``They can tell them to go fly a kite,'' Chief Bankruptcy Judge
Alexander Paskay said.
   The Jenkses listed debts of more than $17,000 when they filed
the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition May 3.
   Jenks, 42, a $300-a-week night shift supervisor at a soap plant,
and his 38-year-old wife Theresa, a $290-a-week housekeeper at Walt
Disney World, said bankruptcy was their last resort when their
income dropped because of cuts in overtime.
   Chapter 7 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act anticipates
inheritances, among other windfalls that can change a bankruptcy
status, but lottery winnings acquired after filing for liquidation
can't be touched.
   ``Timing is everything,'' said Terry E. Smith, the trustee in
the case. ``A bankruptcy is a snapshot of an individual at a point
in time. It doesn't matter whether they get better off or worse off
later.''
   ``I love their luck,'' said A. Karl Stevens, the Jenkses'
lawyer. ``When a person files for bankruptcy, it's a fairly
degrading process.''
   The Jenkses were able to keep their home, a few household
possessions and their two cars as long as they kept up with the
payments.
   And they got to tear up their other bills _ more than $14,000
owed on credit cards, $3,473 owed to the Florida Central Credit
Union of Lakeland and a disputed $389 car-repair bill.

   The mine-damaged U.S. missile frigate
Samuel B. Roberts has been refloated before it is loaded aboard a
special cargo vessel for the trip home for repairs, sources in the
United Arab Emirates said Friday.
   The shipping sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they expected the operation to take place over the weekend. Heavy
swells apparently thwarted plans to do it Friday.
   The 3,600-ton frigate remained moored at a dock near the Dubai
shipyard where it underwent preliminary repairs after it hit an
Iranian mine in the central Persian Gulf on April 14.
   The ship will be put aboard the Mighty Servant 2, a 25,743-ton
Dutch semi-submersible cargo vessel chartered to take the frigate
to the United States.
   U.S. military officials declined to say when the crippled
warship would actually leave. Naval ship movements are kept secret.
   The Samuel B. Roberts hit a submerged mine after stumbling into
what U.S. officers said was a newly laid minefield 50 miles
northeast of Qatar.
   Ten sailors were wounded in the blast that ripped a 25-foot gash
in the hull. Senior U.S. officials have credited the other crewmen
with saving the ship by controlling fires and flooding.
   The United States retaliated by attacking two Iranian oil
platforms April 18, starting daylong fighting in which six Iranian
naval craft were sunk or damaged.
   About 30 of the Samuel B. Roberts' sailors will accompany the
ship to home port at Newport, R.I., a trip expected to take about
six weeks.
   About 140 other crewmen returned Monday to the United States.
   The frigate will be taken from Newport to the Bath Iron Works in
Bath, Maine, for further repair work.
   The Samuel B. Roberts was escorting shipping in the gulf, which
has been a target of spillover attacks in the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq
war.

   A Turkish journalist who was jailed for
reporting the pre-trial testimony of a man accused of trying to
kill Premier Turgut Ozal was freed Friday.
   Erbil Tusalp, a reporter in Ankara for the Istanbul daily
Cumhuriyet, was released by court order after being held for three
days, a colleague said.
   Tusalp faces trial on charges of publishing information banned
by authorities. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to eight
years in prison.
   Ozal was shot in the hand June 18 at a convention of his
Motherland Party.
   Chief prosecutor Nusret Demiral and his assistants have been
interrogating Kartal Demirag, who was arrested after the shooting.
   The story, which appeared on the front page of the
moderate-leftist Cumhuriyet on Tuesday, included a text of
Demirag's testimony.
   Tusalp was detained after he refused to say who gave him the
testimony.
   The State Security Court examining the shooting ordered police
and state officials to make no comment on the investigation.

<HEAD>Court Rules in Tennessee Prisoner Rights Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today relaxed the deadlines
prison inmates face when seeking to appeal their cases in federal
appellate courts.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said inmates satisfy one
preliminary, 30-day deadline if they deliver the necessary
documents to prison authorities in time.
   Those documents do not have to reach a court within the 30-day
deadline, Justice William J. Brennan wrote for the court.
   Prentiss Houston, serving a 50-year sentence in a Tennessee
prison for murder, challenged his state court conviction in an
appeal to a federal trial judge in early 1986.
   When the judge threw out Houston's appeal, the inmate decided to
appeal to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   He prepared the necessary ``notice of appeal'' to send to the
trial judge, and gave it to prison authorities 27 days after the
judge's ruling against him.
   Federal law allows 30 days for such notices to be ``filed with
the clerk'' of the federal district court. Houston's notice was
stamped ``filed'' by the court clerk's office one day beyond the
30-day deadline, and his appeal was dismissed by the 6th Circuit
court for that reason.
   Reviving Houston's appeal before the 6th Circuit court, the
nation's highest court today said Houston's notice of appeal was
``filed'' the moment he delivered it to prison officials.
   ``Unskilled in law, unaided by counsel and unable to leave the
prison, (an inmate's) control over the processing of his notice
necessarily ceases as soon as he hands it over to the only public
officials to whom he has access _ the prison authorities,'' Brennan
said.
   He added that such a rule for judging whether a deadline has
been met will help cut down the number of disputes over such
filings.
   Brennan was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Chie Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented.
   Writing for the four, Scalia acknowledged that the rule
fashioned today ``makes a good deal of sense.'' But he said the
court was taking a shortcut to changing federal law _ and cheating
Congress out of an opportunity to veto the change before it takes
place.
   Houston and a co-defendant, Bobby Vinson, pleaded guilty to the
Aug. 10, 1982, killing in South Fulton, Tenn., of Marcel Anderson,
22, of Union City.
   Police said that the two accosted Anderson in an apartment
complex parking lot, and that Vinson shot him as he tried to get
out of a car.
   The case is Houston vs. Lack, 87-5428.

   Rebels ambushed a troop truck in

   The ambush took place on a highway near Katakwi, 220 miles

speaking on condition of anonymity. No attackers apparently were
hurt.
   The troops were on a mission to buy cattle for their garrison
stationed at nearby Moroto when the guerrillas fired on their
vehicle with automatic weapons.
   Guerrillas of the Uganda People's Army, one of several rebel
forces fighting to topple President Yoweri Museveni's government,
have staged frequent ambushes on the highway. Museveni seized power
in a coup in January 1986.

   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
has sent out thousands of notices to people whose age
discrimination complaints may have been handled improperly, EEOC
Chairman Clarence Thomas said Friday.
   Thomas said the 7,500-plus notices went out in cases where there
was reason to believe complaints had not been pursued within the
two-year time frame required by law, whether due to agency
negligence or late filing.
   The notices were required under the Age Discrimination Claims
Assistance Act, which President Reagan signed into law April 7. The
act was designed to give second chances to complainants following
revelations that EEOC workers had let hundreds of cases expire
beyond the statute of limitations.
   ``We blanketed the world with them,'' Thomas said of the notices
during a break in a hearing by the Senate Special Committee on
Aging. ``We did not want to underestimate. We know we overestimated
... We'll make absolutely sure that there are none left hanging out
there.''
   Thomas said the notices, sent out last month, tell people that
``you may still have an opportunity to pursue your case.''
   Age discrimination complaints constitute 20 percent of the EEOC
caseload. The new claims assistance law applies to cases filed
after Jan. 1, 1984, and shuts the door on second chances in
September 1989.
   Currently the agency is aware of 1,650 age discrimination cases
that may have been improperly handled. Thomas said he expected only
3 percent of the new notices to prompt reopened proceedings.
   Some of the notices are probably duplicates, he said, and many
people won't respond. He said other cases may have been settled or
closed properly, or may turn out to be without merit.
   Thomas said that in the future, age discrimination cases will be
pursued first, before race and sex discrimination complaints. He
said the age bias law is the only one that contains a statute of
limitations.

   President Reagan met with Marionite Catholic
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir of Lebanon today and the religious leader
said Reagan promised to do ``all in his power to put an end to the
tragic situation'' in the war-torn country.
   Neither the patriarch nor the White House, however, indicated in
separate statements about the private meeting what commitments, if
any, were made.
   The White House said Vice President George Bush met separately
with the patriarch. The Most Rev. Pio Laghi, the apostolic nuncio,
or diplomatic representative of the Vatican in Washington, also
attended the meetings.
   The patriarch said he asked Reagan to help bring peace to
Lebanon. Asked how the president responded, he said, ``He promised
to make all in his power to put an end to the tragic situation.''
   Asked what specific steps were mentioned, he said, ``I can't say
what, because it is up to the president of the United States to
choose the means by which they might do something.''
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk issued a statement saying
that both Reagan and Bush ``reaffirmed U.S. support for the
restoration of Lebanon's unity, sovereignty, and territorial
integrity, and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.''
   The patriarch, asked whether he thought Syrian forces performed
a useful role in Lebanon, said, ``We are asking to see all the
non-Lebanese armed go out of Lebanon, so Lebanon will be pacified.''
   On the question of hostages held in Lebanon, he said, ``We know
that we have nothing to help in this way, but we talked about peace
in Lebanon. About the hostages, it is a very difficult thing. It is
not for me to say what we can do for them.''
   He said Marionite Christian leaders were in touch with Moslem
religious leaders on the question, but ``all Lebanon is taken
hostage.''

<HEAD>Fort Worth Defense Contractor Helping Taiwan Develop Jet Fighters
^Eds: CORRECTS newspaper's name in 2nd graf; SUBS 6th graf, `Three
State ...,' with 4 grafs to add no comment from State Department
spokesman today, add background.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of General Dynamics Corp.
have for the past three years secretly helped the Taiwan government
develop a new fighter plane, it was reported today.
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said the aircraft is being designed
by a group of about 100 Taiwanese engineers and technicians, with
General Dynamics employees acting as advisers.
   The Americans are not directly involved in the aircraft design
or production, said a company official familiar with the program
who spoke on the condition he not be identified. ``We are not
building it or designing it. We are merely teaching them how to
design it,'' he said.
   The program has the approval of the State Department but has
operated quietly to avoid offending China. China and Taiwan do not
recognize each other.
   ``It's a touchy political problem. The State Department knows
about it, China knows about it, but as long as it doesn't get a lot
of publicity, they won't complain,'' the official told the
Star-Telegram.
   The nature of the U.S.-Taiwanese military relationship is a
highly sensitive issue that State Department officials are
reluctant to discuss.
   Under a 1982 agreement, the United States retains the right to
sell defense equipment and services Taiwan needs for defense. At
the same time, however, a 1972 agreement between China and the
United States imposes ``qualitative and quantitative'' restrictions
on what Taiwan is given.
   Neither agreement spells out in detail how the restrictions
apply to particular weapons systems.
   Alex Almasov, a State Department spokesman, today declined to
comment on the report about General Dynamics.
   General Dynamics spokesman Z. Joe Thornton told the newspaper
Thursday that he could not comment on the program.
   ``We can't talk about that. ... It's a sensitive issue,'' he
said.
   The unidentified General Dynamics official said that several
hundred employees have worked on the program, which is worth about
$200 million to the defense contractor and also involves other U.S.
companies.
   Work on the program is being done in a small, unmarked building
in Fort Worth, the Star-Telegram said.
   Col. Yi Chou, a weapons procurement officer in Taiwan's
representative office in Washington, D.C., said the Taiwanese
government has ``a team based at General Dynamics.''
   He declined to provide any details of the work being performed
in Fort Worth but said the team was headed by a Taiwanese military
officer.
   A press officer at the Chinese embassy said that he could not
comment on the Taiwanese aircraft program. However, Chiwei Zhang
added, ``Our government's general policy is that we oppose any
foreign country to supply arms to Taiwan.''
   General Dynamics' F-16 Fighting Falcon is one of the most
successful fighter aircraft in U.S. history, with more than 3,000
ordered by the U.S. Air Force, the Navy and 15 foreign countries.

   Ousted Haitian President Leslie Manigat's stopover
in Miami today on his way to an international forum of Christian
Democrats in Rome won't win him support from Haitians living in the
United States, a Haitian-American leader said.
   ``He thinks he'll look better in the eyes of the Haitians back
home, but he's not going to get a tribute here,'' said Roger
Biamby, head of the Haitian American Community Association of Dade.
   Biamby said Manigat hopes his visit to Miami will shore up his
credentials as a genuine opposition figure, but the strategy won't
work.
   ``We were not supporters of Manigat,'' said the Rev. Gerard
Jean-Juste, who heads the Haitian Refugee Center, a grassroots
organization in Little Haiti.
   Manigat arrived in Miami this afternoon aboard a private 10-seat
jet. As he walked with his wife to a U.S. Customs office, he
flashed a V sign to about 25 Haitians gathered at Miami
International Airport. They responded with applause.
   He had been in exile in the Dominican Republic since he was
overthrown Sunday by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Namphy ran the country as head of an interim junta for two years
after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile. He turned over
power in February to Manigat, who was elected the previous month in
military-run elections that were rife with fraud.
   ``I do understand that he is passing through Miami Friday on his
way to Rome ... where there is a meeting of the Christian Democrat
International Conference,'' said State Department spokesman Charles
Redman. ``He's going to be participating in that.''
   The United States is not involved in Manigat's travel plans and
no administration officials planned to meet with him, Redman said.
   Manigat, 57, will probably escape any protest demonstrations
because exiles in Miami don't want to be seen as backing Sunday's
coup. Instead, Haitian groups here plan to ignore Manigat.
   ``He should not be allowed to come to the United States. He's a
traitor to the Haitian people, he's a traitor to democracy,''
Biamby said, referring to allegations that Manigat was connected to
the violence that disrupted Haitian elections.

   A new manual influenced by the ``Kama Sutra,'' the
Indian manual on the art of love, will be offered to Estonian high
school students in a new drive to improve sex and family education,
the official news agency Tass said Friday.
   Tass said Estonian psychologist Andres Kherkel had prepared what
it billed as the first manual on family psychology for Soviet high
school students.
   The book was prepared as part of an effort to reduce divorce and
improve young people's understanding of family life in Estonia, one
of the Soviet Union's most westward looking regions.
   ``Eastern philosophy, in particular the tract `Kama Sutra' and
the studies of Mahatma Gandhi, exercised a big influence on the
composition of the second part,'' Tass quoted Kherkel as saying.
   It did not say when the book would start being used in Estonian
schools.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers on Friday removed a
barbed wire fence surrounding a squatter camp to mark the end of
factional fighting that broke out earlier this year.
   The fence was erected after eight people were killed and several
thousand burned out of their homes in violence at KTC, a section of
the Crossroads squatter complex near Cape Town.
   At a government ceremony for the event, Roland Njoli, mayor of a
group of black townships in the area, said residents had requested
the removal of the fence because the feud appeared to have ended.
   Graham Lawrence, a provincial government official, said the area
razed during the fighting in January and February would be upgraded
starting next year. The first project would be to install
infrastructure and services, and eventually 2,200 houses would be
built, he said.

   A blast ripped through the refrigerated storage
section of a meat processing plant in central Russia, killing two
workers and injuring five others, it was reported Friday.
   The explosion in Yaroslavl occurred when a high-pressure pipe
burst during maintenance work, the news agency Tass said. Ammonia
from the pipe leaked into an adjacent building and ignited.
   Tass quoted rescue official Vladimir Vatin as saying the plant
and four nearby kindergartens considered to be in what he called a
``danger zone'' were evacuated, and residents of nearby houses were
warned of the danger of further blasts.
   ``The consequences of the accident could have been greater'' if
rescue services had not worked efficiently and promptly, Vatin said.
   Tass said without explanation that ``the accident was localized
by 1:30 p.m. and the all-clear signal was given in the area at 6
p.m.''
   It did not specify whether this meant people had returned to the
evacuated areas.
   Last month, a massive blast caused by an industrial explosive on
railway cars killed 88 people and injured more than 200 in an
accident near the industrial city of Gorky northeast of Moscow.

   About 3,500 candidates from 16 political
parties have registered to run in nationwide parliamentary
elections, government officials said Friday.
   Friday marked the deadline for registration and the final
candidate count would be known Saturday, said Yuvarat Gamolvej,

   The candidates will vie for 357 seats in the lower house in
elections July 24.
   There are 26 million eligible voters in Thailand.
   Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda dissolved Parliament in April
because ministers of the Democrat Party, the main party of his
coalition government, voted against government-backed legislation
to protect U.S. copyrights.
   Critics maintain the prime minister dissolved Parliament to
avoid a probable no-confidence motion by the opposition in May.
   Prem, a former army chief, has been prime minister since 1980.
He is widely expected to return to power.

<HEAD>Seoul Marks War Anniversary With Warning Against Radicals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea on Friday marked the
anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War with a warning
against radicals allegedly supporting Communist North Korea's
political cause.
   In the border town of Panmunjom, meanwhile, the U.N. Command
renewed its demand Thursday that North Korea return the remains of
two U.S. soldiers who died in captivity in the North during the
1950-53 war.
   But Senior Col. Kim Ryon Ki of North Korea told the 494th
Military Commission that the matter should be discussed between his
country and the United States, not the commission.
   The commission consists of delegates from the U.N. Command,
North Korea and China. The command, made up of the United States
and 15 other countries, fought in the war to help the South repel
the North Korean invasion, launched June 25, 1950. Chinese troops
joined the North Korean side.
   In Seoul, Culture-Information Minister Chung Han-mo marked the
1950 invasion by criticizing domestic political dissent. Past
government criticism on the anniversary has been directed mainly at
North Korea.
   ``We will deal harshly with ideological radicals sympathetic
with the principles and cause of the North Korean Communists,''
Chung said.
   The radicals are demanding that North Korea serve as a co-host
of the Olympic Games in Seoul and the United States withdraw its
42,000 troops stationed in South Korea.
   The minister criticized radicals consideration of the three-year
Korean War as ``a proper effort to unify'' the peninsula, which was
divided in 1945.
   North Korean troops, supported by Soviet-built tanks, invaded
South Korea and captured Seoul in three days.
   The war ended in 1953 after leaving about 760,000 military
personnel killed and 1.8 million wounded. Civilian casualties were
estimated at 1.4 million.
   In Panmunjon, U.S. Army Col. Charles O. Coffman, speaking for
the U.N. Command, criticized North Korea for refusing to return the
remains of two Americans when it had admitted having them and
implied its willingness to return them.
   Coffman said the North and the command held serious talks but
the North broke them off Jan. 26 out of ``discontent'' with the
U.S. sanctions imposed after the North's alleged bombing of a South
Korean jetliner in November.
   All 115 people aboard were killed in what South Korea called an
attempt to scare people away from the Olympics in Seoul this fall.
   In a message to the U.N. Command Feb. 2, North Korea identified
the two Americans as 1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders of Cedar City, Utah,
and Cpl. Arthur I. Seaton of Philadelphia.

   An exhausted British adventurer gave up
his third attempt to row solo around the world and was rescued by a
French trawler off the coast of Brittany, the coast guard said.
   Geoff Cooper, 36, rowed away from the southwestern English port
of Gweek in his 16-foot boat on June 17, expressing confidence
despite previous failures.
   But he was exhausted Thursday when he was picked up 46 miles
south of the Cornwall region of England, said a Falmouth coast
guard spokesman. Cooper had said he planned to complete the
36,000-mile trip in three years.
   Cooper's 1986 attempt ended after 36 hours, when he injured a
wrist 37 miles offshore and was rescued by a helicopter.
   Last year, three British navy helicopters had to rescue him
during a practice trip.

   About 200 American firefighters are helping
Canadian crews battle hundreds of forest fires raging across the
drought-parched prairie provinces and northern Ontario.
   Light rain on Friday helped subdue flames in one of the worst
blazes, near the mining center of Sudbury, Ontario, but the Natural
Resources Ministry said the fire was still out of control. About 18
squares miles of forest land have been destroyed there.
   Ontario is spending $622,500 a day to fight 230 fires, and 27
are burning out of control, the ministry said. About $166 million
worth of timber has been destroyed.
   The American firefighters, who call themselves the ``Hot
Shots,'' come from the National Interagency Wildlife Center in
Boise, Idaho.
   In Saskatchewan, officials evacuated 400 people Thursday near
Saskatoon after a fire broke out in Pike Lake Provincial Park. A
huge blaze in northeast Saskatchewan was dampened overnight by
light rain, but Norm Hook of the provincial Forest Fire Management
Center said: ``It's like a sleeping giant, just sitting there and
waiting for wind.''
   The federal government's Interagency Forest Fire Center in
Winnipeg said 5,500 forest fires have been reported across the
country so far this year, compared with 4,700 by this date in 1987.
   Although June thunderstorms have alleviated what threatened to
be the worst drought on the Canadian prairies since 1937, many
areas remain parched.

<HEAD>Optimistic Liberals Drawing Up Dukakis Administration Blueprint</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberal Democrats, using the conservative
Heritage Foundation as their model, are drawing up a progressive
blueprint they hope a President Dukakis would use to set the
direction for his administration and to avoid ``victory without
vision.''
   Encouraged by opinion polls showing Dukakis has stronger support
around the country than Republican George Bush, project leader Mark
Green said Friday it was put together ``because we think
conservatism is faltering, because we think there is a new
progressive majority.''
   Green, an unsuccessful candidate for the Senate in New York in
1986, is president of the Democracy Project, sponsor of the attempt
to formulate a progressive agenda.
   Transition '89 is dedicated to avoiding victory without
vision,'' he said. Looking back at the election of Democrat Jimmy
Carter 12 years ago, Green said, ``In 1976, it was a political
victory without a program.'' Carter lasted one term and then was
trounced in 1980 by Ronald Reagan.
   As Reagan prepared to take power from the Democratic president,
an obscure conservative think tank called the Heritage Foundation
suddenly attained prominence as a source of ideas for the incoming
administration.
   Heritage was ready with ``Agenda for Progress,'' a 378-page
study that recommended cutting $58.6 billion from the 1982 federal
budget, while at the same time increasing defense spending by $33.7
billion.
   Heritage became a source of ideas and personnel for the Reagan
administration and its days in obscurity ended.
   Green and his fellow liberals are hoping for a similar
resurgence in the event of a Dukakis victory in November.
   ``We hope to be a conduit between 20 years of progressive,
public interest policy experience and a new government open to
fresh approaches,'' said Green, in a statement announcing release
of a 140-page book called, ``Ideas That Work: 60 Solutions for
America's 3rd Century.''
   The book includes proposals in areas ranging from the economy,
education, and the environment to foreign and defense policy.
   But while the book offers a preview of the approaches the
progressives would take, Green said the main project of his group
is an agency-by-agency study of the government by 48 experts who
would issue their recommendations after the November election.
   ``While a lot of folks are understandably concentrating on the
politics of '88, Transition '89 wants to concentrate on the
policies of '89,'' he said.
   One of the people on Green's list was Stephen F. Cohen, an
expert of U.S.-Soviet relations at Princeton University, who said,
``Suddenly, it seems, there's a chance to end the Cold War.''
   Cohen said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``at great risk to
himself is revising, in the confines of his own national security
elite, almost 70 years of Soviet Cold War dogma. ... The key Soviet
Cold War dogma has been that the nature of the United States made
the Cold War inevitable. It had nothing to do with Soviet behavior.
   ``And Gorbachev is now saying that isn't so.''
   Cohen said the next president ought to ``send a message to
Gorbachev, publicly or privately, that this president is prepared
to negotiate every dispute, issue, anew.''
   He expressed dismay at Dukakis' commitment to a buildup in
conventional forces and said he has seen no sign from the
Democratic candidate that he or his advisers ``are willing to seize
the opportunity'' for dramatic change in U.S.-Soviet relations.

   Space shuttle Discovery was linked
Friday to the two solid fuel booster rockets that are to hurl it
into space this summer on the first post-Challenger shuttle mission.
   A giant overhead crane hoisted the 85-ton spaceship on a metal
sling and gingerly guided it into position for mating with the
126-foot-tall boosters and a 154-foot fuel tank that will feed the
craft's three liquid fuel engines.
   NASA workers then made electrical, fuel line and other
connections. On Sunday, they will begin testing the connections.
   Barring problems, Discovery will be transported to the launch
pad in the glare of powerful floodlights Friday, starting at 12:01
a.m. The ship's five-man astronaut crew and NASA officials will
participate in the rollout ceremony from a flag-bedecked grandstand
outside the shuttle assembly building.
   Forrest McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space Center, will
present the astronauts with an autograph book which they will carry
into space on their four-day mission. The book contains the
signatures of the 15,000 center workers here who have labored to
return the shuttle fleet to space.
   McCartney has invited center workers and their families to drive
their personal cars onto the spaceport that day for a drive around
the launch pad to view Discovery there.
   Discovery's linkup with the boosters was delayed more than a day
while engineers overcame a problem with a mechanism controlling the
landing wheel doors in Discovery's nose.
   The shuttle was moved into the assembly building Tuesday after
undergoing an extensive overhaul of several of its systems, many of
the changes the result of the Challenger explosion that killed
seven astronauts shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The disaster was blamed on a faulty joint in one of Challenger's
solid fuel boosters. The joint has been redesigned and has passed
four test-firings, with one more set for July 26 before Discovery
is cleared for flight.
   The three main engines also must undergo a pre-flight test. That
20-second firing, with Discovery bolted on the pad, is set for July
22.
   The current launch target date is Sept. 3 but officials say
there is a chance liftoff could occur in late August.
   During the flight, commander Rick Hauck and his crew will deploy
a communications satelite, conduct science and technology
experimets and test modifications made to the shuttle. The other
crew members are Dick Covey, Mike Lounge, George Nelson and David
Hilmers.

<HEAD>U.S. Engineer Goes on Trial For Murder of Prostitute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American engineer went on trial Friday
for the murder of a Spanish prostitute last year, and he said he
remembered only punching her in the nose during an argument over
money.
   The prosecution said David Baxter of St. Louis, an engineer with
McDonnell Douglas Corp., smothered Rufina Sanz, a 35-year-old
Madrid prostitute, in his hotel room and mutilated her body on
March 3, 1987.
   Baxter, 30, came to Spain two days before the murder to work on
a joint McDonnell Douglas-Spanish government project set up in
1983, after Spain agreed to buy 72 F-18 fighter bombers from the
St. Louis-based company.
   A forensic report said Sanz died of asphyxiation from having a
foot pressed across her throat.
   The report also said she was beaten and disfigured with a knife
before being thrown from a window onto a cement patio.
   The prosecution cited psychiatric reports indicating Baxter
suffered from ``a psychosexual illness of a sadistic nature'' that
led him to commit the murder.
   The prosecution said it considered Baxter's illness an
``extenuating circumstance'' that kept it from seeking the maximum
penalty of a 30-year prison term. It asked for a 20-year prison
term in the event of conviction.
   Baxter's defense attorney, Julian Perez Templado, cited the same
psychosexual illness outlined in the reports as evidence his client
``could not be held responsible for his acts.''
   Baxter, dressed in a blue suit and handcuffed, testified he met
Sanz and returned with her to his hotel room after drinking at
several bars late on March 2, 1987.
   He said he hit her in the nose in his room after they argued
over the price he was to pay for sexual favors.
   Baxter said he could not remember what happened after that. He
said he only remembered waking up 1{ hours later, just before
police entered his room and arrested him.
   Police found a suitcase full of sadomasochistic sexual equipment
in Baxter's room, which the defendant identified as his property.
   As permitted by Spanish law, attorneys for the victim's family
asked for the three-judge tribunal to find Baxter guilty and
sentence him to 30 years in prison. They also asked he be ordered
to pay an indemnity of $127,000.

   Carol Matthau never told her husband, Walter,
when she finally decided to make her dream come true.
   ``I never said a word about it to him. (I) just started
writing,'' Mrs. Matthau says in the July-August issue of Lear's
magazine.
   Mrs. Matthau, an actress who was twice married to playwright
William Saroyan before her 28-year union with the actor, says her
dream-in-progress is a book about Hollywood called ``The Wrong
Color Green.''
   ``All the cliches about this never-never land are true, yet
nobody has written successfully about it,'' she said. ``There is no
`they' who destroy you here. ... You are your own villain.''
   Mrs. Matthau said she has always been sure that she eventually
would become a writer.
   ``I have 18 hat boxes, beautifully covered in glazed, flowered
chintzes and tied with ribbons, so pretty in my closet, and Walter
thinks I bought 18 hats,'' she said. ``But they are full of little
crumpled papers ... each with a sentence or a phrase that is very
close to me.''

<HEAD>Court Rules Children Don't Have Right To Free School Bus Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled Friday
that children from poor families do not have a constitutional right
to free bus transportation to and from school.
   The 5-4 decision in a case from North Dakota has particular
importance for people in rural areas. The ruling was denounced by
the dissenters for denying hope and equal opportunity to the
disadvantaged.
   The court's majority, however, said North Dakota officials acted
rationally and lawfully in permitting local school districts to
charge busing fees.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Limited severely states' authority to lower the electric rates
public utilities charge as a result of agreements with federal
regulators. The 6-3 ruling will cost Mississippi consumers $326.5
million.
   _Voted 5-4 to uphold an Illinois man's murder conviction, ruling
that its famous Miranda decision is sufficient to protect the
rights of defendants questioned by police after they are indicted
or otherwise formally charged.
   _Ruled, 6-3, that state and federal officials may not be sued
for monetary damages by people whose Social Security disability
benefits were cut off unlawfully.
   _By a 6-3 vote, limited the government's broad immunity from
negligence lawsuits. The court reinstated a suit by a couple shot
at by a drunken, off-duty Navy medic in Maryland.
   _Restricted the power of federal judges to dismiss criminal
charges when prosecutors violate a law requiring speedy trial of
defendants. The 6-3 ruling reinstated the indictment in Seattle of
a man accused of cocaine trafficking.
   _Relaxed the deadlines prison inmates face when seeking to
appeal their cases in federal appellate court. The 5-4 decision
revived the appeal of a convicted murderer serving a 50-year
sentence in Tennessee.
   _Ruled, 8-1, against a worker in California who was dropped from
a race-discrimination suit against his company and labor union
because of a clerical error.
   In the busing case, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the
court that states generally have a free hand in deciding whether
families must pay to get their children to school
   ``A state's decision to allow local school boards the option of
charging patrons a user fee for bus service is constitutionally
permissible,'' she said. ``The Constitution does not require that
such service be provided at all and it is difficult to imagine why
choosing to offer the service should entail a constitutional
obligation to offer it for free.''
   The ruling is in line with earlier court decisions upholding
laws that treat the wealthy and poor differently. For example, the
court has upheld the use of property taxes to support public
schools even though children from less affluent communities may
suffer. The court has said such laws are permissible if they serve
a rational purpose.
   But in a dissenting opinion Friday, Justice Thurgood Marshall
said, ``For the poor, education is often the only route by which to
become full participants in our society. In allowing a state to
burden the access of poor persons to an education, the court denies
equal opportunity and discourages hope.''
   Justices William J. Brennan, John Paul Stevens and Harry A.
Blackmun also dissented.
   North Dakota law provides free bus transportation to those
living in districts that have reorganized to broaden their tax base
and improve education. Only those districts that have not
reorganized are allowed to charge parents for busing their children.
   The law was intended to spur consolidation and assure people in
reorganized districts they would not have to pay for transportation.
   The court said the law is a rational approach to encouraging
local school officials to reorganize.
   The law was challenged by Paula Kadrmas from rural Dickinson,
N.D. She said the it denied equal rights to her daughter, Sarita,
because the family could not afford a $97 annual bus fee.
   Mrs. Kadrmas has driven Sarita the 16 miles to school rather
than pay the fee. Ironically, O'Connor noted, that meant the family
spent more than $1,000 in 1985-86 to get Sarita to and from school.
   Bus service in Dickinson is offered for a fee to elementary
school students who live more than three miles from school and to
high school students who live more than four miles away.

   Federal officials have returned for a
third time to evaluate damage caused by the May explosions at the
Pacific Engineering & Production Co. plant.
   Three structural engineers and five federal officials are
touring the areas hardest hit, checking with homeowners about
damage and insurance coverage.
   Federal Energy Management Agency officials were in Henderson
immediately after the explosion and again three weeks later.
Following the second inspection, FEMA recommended denial of federal
aid for losses suffered in the explosions.
   Gov. Richard Bryan appealed the decision, saying the FEMA teams
had missed certain uninsured structural damage. Henderson officials
estimate uninsured losses in the city at $20 million, up from $17
million previously reported.
   While federal officials were reassessing the damage Thursday,
Kerr-McGee Corp. was conducting a media tour of their plant two
miles from the site of the blast.
   Kerr-McGee resumed production of the rocket fuel oxidizer
ammonium perchlorate last week. Kerr-McGee and Pacific Engineering
were the only plants in the country producing the rocket fuel
component.
   Meanwhile, a House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee
arrived in Henderson on Thursday night and viewed the Pacific
Engineering site, then toured Kerr-McGee. Officials are concerned
about the loss of the ammonium perchlorate production since it is a
critical element in the space shuttle and military rocket fuels.
   The May 4 blast killed two people, injured 326 and caused $73
million in property damage.

<TEXT>
   Lush, green mountainsides in southern
Vermont have been scarred with patches of brown, the work of tiny
insects that are threatening the state's maple sugar industry and
tourism.
   A bug known as the pear thrips is blamed for damaging nearly
500,000 acres of forest in Vermont this year. By comparison, 21,000
acres were damaged last year, said H. Brenton Teillon, chief of
forest protection for the state Department of Forests and Parks.
   Officials say the bugs that attacked millions of maple trees
this spring are the state's worst insect problem in more than 25
years. The current drought is putting still further stress on trees.
   The maples are a source of income for hundreds of Vermonters who
tap them to produce syrup and sugar candy. The state produced
370,000 gallons of maple syrup this year, leading the nation, and
that generated $12.5 million in income.
   The loss of a significant portion _ some foresters fear up to a
fifth _ of the maples could also mean far fewer dollars this fall
from tourists who come to view the foliage.
   From a window in a four-seat plane, state forester Pete
Norkeveck assessed the damage over Bennington on Thursday
afternoon. Some forestland had retained its brilliant green, but
there were wide swaths of shriveled brown foliage with tints of
gray and orange.
   ``Those trees are in real trouble,'' says Norkeveck. ``If we
don't get some rain in the next couple of weeks, we're looking at a
very high mortality rate. Even with some rain, a lot of them might
not survive.''
   Pear thrips have been in the United States since the early part
of the century, but historically they have been a problem mainly in
orchards.
   Norkeveck said the pear thrips attack a tree's flowers in early
spring. The bugs then enter a period of dormance.
   Experts are unsure why the problem flared up this year. They
cite a variety of possible factors, including the drought, a
heavier-than-normal blooming of the maples this spring, and a cold
snap at a key time this spring that may have been a boon to the
insects.
   Bob Twitchell of Landgrove said he was one of the first maple
growers to be affected. He first saw the defoliation in the early
summer of 1985. To reduce stress on the maples on his 60-acres, he
decided not to tap his trees the following spring, losing his main
source of income for a year.
   ``If you don't tap for one year, you don't have the resources to
continue,'' he said. ``A lot of people just do it as a part-time
thing and they don't depend on it as much. But if I let up for one
year, I'm done for.''
   The problem has grown only worse.
   ``It looks like winter. There's nothing there,'' he said. ``I
just don't know as there's anything I can do.''
   He's given up sugaring completely for lumbering, and talks of
selling off some of his property to make ends meet.
   A similar sense of worry and uncertainty was evident Thursday
among 50 maple sugar producers, landowners, state and Canadian
officials who met in Bennington to discuss the problem.
   To a lesser degree, the infestation has also affected parts of
other New England states, New York and Pennsylvania, foresters said.

<HEAD>EPA To Relocate Residents On Waste Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has
recommended permanently relocating people living near a
``Superfund'' hazardous waste site for only the fourth time in the
nation and the first time in New England.
   There is no immediate health threat to the residents of a mobile
home park built on the site of the former dump, but the site is ``a
chemical time bomb that needs to be cleaned up,'' EPA deputy
regional administrator Paul Keough said Thursday.
   ``There are other sites that certainly rank high from a
potential pollution standpoint,'' said Mike Deland, an EPA regional
administrator. ``There is no other site in Vermont or New England
that has people living on top of it.''
   EPA remedial project site manager Paula Fitzsimmons said the two
main classes of hazardous chemicals in the dump are polychlorinated
byphenyls, or PCBs, which are suspected of causing cancer, and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs, basically oil and
petroleum-based products.
   Keough said there was a significant long-term potential for air,
soil and leachate contamination if residents remained and the site
were not cleaned up.
   In addition, he said, the area posed a threat to residents who
might inadvertently dig up contaminated soil while planting a
garden, for example.
   Officials said they will hold public hearings on the cleanup
proposal, with relocation to begin after a final agreement is
signed, possibly in September.
   About 60 people live at the Springfield Mobile Estates park.
   ``Some really don't want to move _ they're most elderly,'' said
resident Christine Chapman. ``There are those who tried to sell and
couldn't a couple of years ago because nobody would buy it on top
of toxic waste site. They're relieved.''
   The EPA estimated the cost of the cleanup and relocation to be
at least $12.5 million and to take 2{ years.
   The site would be dug up, covered with a protective cap and
fenced off as soon as all residents are moved. Leachate or
contaminated groundwater would also be collected and treated.
   Officials said the site would be checked every five years for 30
years to determine if the cleanup technology is working.
   Although the PCBs were not dumped in bulk, the PAHs were dumped
by huge tankers. These and other wastes were left at site from 1946
to 1968.

   Twin brothers have been getting
offers of money, jobs and college tuition, but they fear publicity
about their plight could pose problems for the father who abandoned
them five years ago.
   When Tony and John Gomez were 9, their parents divorced and
their mother left. When they were 13, their father returned to
Guadalajara, Mexico, leaving the twins to fend for themselves.
   They worked odd jobs and managed to pay the rent on a trailer
while attending school. They told few people about the arrangement.
   This month, the twins, now 18, were graduated from high school.
   Since their story was publicized, ``it's been phenomenal,'' said
Karen G. Marshall, principal of Sierra High School where Tony was a
C-plus student.
   ``People want to give money. Other people are offering jobs.
They have offers to go to college, both to community colleges and
to Cal State,'' she said Thursday.
   But, she added: ``It's starting to concern them. They are
concerned it will get their father in trouble as more people get
interested. We've tried to reassure both of them that what happened
is in the past. No one will go back and no one will get in trouble
over anything.''
   John was at work Thursday, but Tony was visiting with Ms.
Marshall.
   ``I didn't know it was going to be this big,'' he said. ``I'm
surprised people do care and want to interview us and see if our
story is real.''
   Tony plans to join the Navy late this year or early next year.
After boot camp, he plans to marry his fiance, Tara Lyn Ramirez,
17, he said.
   As for John, ``Someone is paying for his tuition for four years
of college and I'm proud of that. He's on his way. He starts school
Monday at Valley (Community College), then he'll transfer to Cal
State after two years,'' Tony said.
   The twins have a 17-year-old sister living in San Bernardino who
has lived with foster parents since she was 13.
   Over the years, the hardest thing to do without, he said, was
``a parent being there to congratulate you for graduating or
getting an award or at Christmas or other holidays.''
   But, he added, ``My brother was always there. We were always
there for each other.''

<HEAD>Rescue Workers Using Sniffer Dogs Search for Survivors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CATAK, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue workers dug in a 20-foot layer of
mud and rocks Friday for about 100 people buried by a landslide,
using sniffer dogs and dodging boulders that skittered down the
mountain.
   A truck driver and a resident were injured by the new rockslides
that pelted down on what remains of this village in the rain-soaked
mountains above the Black Sea port of Trabzon.
   ``It's too soon to give up hope of finding people alive, but I
think we will soon be discovering bodies,'' said Klaus Kolter, a
member of the West German Rescue Dog Association helping in the
search for victims of Thursday's disaster. ``We'll keep on trying.''
   Rescue workers abandoned plans for an all-night search because
of fears of a new, major landslide. The operation was to resume at
dawn Saturday.
   ``here's a risk that an entire hilltop could come crashing down
in the same area. Cracks already have been observed but it's not
possible to predict when it might happen,'' said Erkan Omarbeyoglu,
Turkey's general director of highways.
   He said that if a new landslide occurred during daylight hours,
the rescue teams would have time to evacuate.
   Three West German tourists were among those missing in the
landslide, which residents of Catak blamed in inadequate
buttressing of the walls of the highway that runs through the
village.
   Members of the West German team, wearing red coveralls, took 21
sniffer dogs over mounds of earth covering a coffeehouse, a
restaurant, 20 homes and a high school that had been closed for
summer vacation.
   Earthmovers cleared loose debris and a team of 50 civil defense
workers dug in spots where the reactions of the dogs indicated
survivors might be trapped in air pockets beneath boulders.
   More than 30 hours after hundreds of tons of mud and rock roared
down on Catak, only one body had been recovered.
   Villagers said at least 30 bus passengers were in the
coffeehouse when the landslide occurred, having breakfast and while
bulldozers cleared a rockfall that had blocked the highway the
night before. Dozens more waited at the roadside, they said.
   ``My friends were in the coffeehouse, I'd gone back outside to
see if the bus was ready to leave and I saw a telegraph pole slowly
bending over,'' said Gaby Engeler, 28, a nurse from West Germany.
``I heard a noise like an explosion and the whole hillside came
away in front of me.''
   She identified her friends as Birgit Hastenteufel, a 25-year-old
social worker, and Andreas Burghard, 28, a pharmacist. The third
missing West German was identified only as Markus Mutter.
   Enver Hizlan, the provincial governor, told reporters 26 Turks
were listed as missing, but the number was likely to rise ``because
the people involved were in transit'' and it would take time for
relatives to contact authorities.
   Catak is a straggling village of about 1,000 people bisected by
the main highway from Trabzon to eastern Anatolia and Iran. It is
in a region of hazelnut and cherry orchards about 20 miles from the
Black Sea near the ruins of the Byzantine monastery of Surmela, a
major tourist attraction.
   The two-lane highwy was widened three years ago because of
increasing truck and tourist traffic, but villagers said it was not
buttressed properly.
   ``The retaining walls weren't big enough and we started having
landslides, not big ones but enough to block the road,'' said Riza
Yavuz, the village headman.
   He said construction teams tried to shore up the overhang, but
``three weeks ago the coffeehouse owner complained again to the
public works people but he was told the highway was safe.''
   Villagers were camping out in tents Friday and eating meals
provided by the Turkish Red Crescent, the Moslem equivalent of the
Red Cross. Many spent the day on an opposite slope watching the
rescue efforts, some weeping as they waited for news of missing
relatives.
   ``I keep telling myself he's still alive, but when I look at the
earth and the stones it's hard to be convinced,'' said Hussein
Aksoy, whose son Hassan is a driver and had stopped in the coffee
house on his way back to Trabzon.

<HEAD>US Terms `Fruitless' Soviet Proposal On Conventional Forces In
Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Friday rebuffed a Soviet
proposal for an exchange of data on conventional forces in Europe,
calling it a ``fruitless'' exercise that would perpetuate a 13-year
stalemate on the issue.
   Instead, both sides should clear away diplomatic hurdles barring
the start of actual force reduction talks, State Department
spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   The spokesman was reacting to recent statements by Soviet
leaders on reducing the massive armies that have confronted each
other across Europe's East-West dividing line since World War II.
   The latest Soviet comments on the subject came at the United
Nations on Thursday, when Lt. Gen. Konstantin F. Mikhailov, deputy
chief of the foreign ministry's disarmament directorate, repeated
Moscow's willingness to make greater reductions than the West in
some conventional forces.
   The United States, which for years has complained of massive
Soviet superiority in tanks, artillery and other weapons, has said
the elimination of these ``asymmetries'' in the balance is a
necessary ingredient of conventional disarmament.
   Mikhailov said that as a first step toward identifying the
imbalances, the two sides should exchange ``official'' data on the
size of their forces.
   Redman noted, however, that the main sticking point in the
Vienna-based Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks that have
been deadlocked since the mid-1970s is the inability of the two
sides to agree on force-size data already exchanged.
   ``The Soviet call for an initial data exchange in advance of and
unrelated to specific proposals is a recipe for the kind of
fruitless data dispute which has plagued the MBFR talks for many
years,'' Redman said.
   The problem in those talks has been ``stalemate over the
inability to agree on figures,'' the U.S. spokesman said.
   Warsaw Pact and North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations have
agreed in principle to shift the conventional arms talks away from
MBFR, which deals only with central Europe, to a new set of
discussions involving more nations and covering forces throughout
the continent.
   The two blocs have failed so far to establish a ``mandate'' for
the new talks because the United States and its allies want the
discussions to include human rights issues and some Warsaw Pact
countries want to restrict the agenda to military matters.
   Earlier this year, the Reagan administration was saying it hoped
to establish the framework for the talks by the end of the summer,
but optimism has dimmed because of continuing disagreement.
   ``We encourage the Soviets to complete the task at hand,''
Redman said.

   A Palestinian stabbed an American-born Jewish
settler in the back Friday in the occupied West Bank, and the
bleeding man chased his assailant and shot him before collapsing.
   Both men were hospitalized in fair condition. Some Jewish
settlers demanded revenge and the settler blamed American inaction
against Arab unrest for the attack.
   An Israeli couple opened fire on young Palestinians who threw
stones at their car in the West Bank city of Nablus. Israel
television showed scenes of the bearded settler crouching behind
his white Ford Transit auto, dashing out to fire at the Arabs and
ducking back.
   Hospital officials said seven Arabs were wounded, including two
8-year-old boys. The two Israelis were slightly injured. Another
six Arabs suffered tear gas and rubber bullet injuries when
soldiers arrived to disperse the crowd, an army spokeswoman said.
   In Gaza City, protests broke out after weekly Moslem prayers.
About 150 Palestinian youths burned fires and shouted ``Allah
akbar!'' before troops dispersed them with rubber bullets and tear
gas, witnesses said.
   The stabbing victim, Yohan Chaiken, was attacked while shopping
before the Jewish Sabbath in Hebron, about 20 miles south of
Jerusalem. The 33-year-old computer programmer from Boston suffered
stab wounds in the shoulder and lower back.
   He pulled out a gun, chased his assailant about 50 yards and
shot him in the elbow, said Zev Hever, a Jewish leader in Hebron.
About 200 Israelis live among 80,000 Arabs in the city.
   Chaiken ran another 300 yards to a building housing Jewish
families, where he collapsed and received first aid before being
flown by helicopter to Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital, Hever said.
   It was the second serious attack on an Israeli in less than a
week. On Sunday night, a farmer was stabbed and bludgeoned to
death, bringing to four the number of Israelis killed in 6{ months
of Arab unrest. In addition, 211 Palestinians have died.
   American-born legislator Rabbi Meir Kahane and about a dozen
Jewish settlers gathered outside Hadassah's emergency room. Some
carried machine guns. One wore a skullcap with the words ``Jews,
Revenge!'' stitched on it.
   ``My injury is the direct result of American pressure on Israel
not to take stronger steps against the Arab rioters,'' Chaiken told
reporters as he was moved from Hadassah's emergency room. He came
to Israel four years ago and lives in Hebron.
   A right-wing Israeli group, Victims of Terror, said in a
statement: ``The government has shown it is weak and we will now
take action of our own in the field.'' Meir Indor, a spokesman for
the group, refused to elaborate.
   The wounded Palestinian was identified by officials at Hebron's
Alia Hospital as 22-year-old Abdel Majid Sharawneh from the village
of Dura.
   ``This isn't a hospital anymore, it's a military base,'' said
one doctor. He said three Israeli army jeeps were parked at the
hospital's main gain and four soldiers and two Israeli security
agents were standing outside the room where Sharawneh was being
operated on.
   In Nablus, 40 miles north of Jerusalem, the car of a Jewish
settler was stoned as he drove past the central Mazuz Masri Mosque
shortly after noon prayers, the army and an Arab witness said.
   The army said the settler got out of his car and fired an Uzi
submachine gun and that a female passenger also opened fire. Arab
witnesses said Palestinians threw more stones as well as
watermelons and shoes.
   Soldiers who arrived on the scene put the city of 100,000 Arabs
under curfew and dispersed the crowd by firing rubber bullets and
tear gas, which injured six Arabs, the army said.
   Seven Arabs were hit by bullets when the Israeli civilians
opened fire, according to officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital
said. They said all the Arab victims were struck in the arms or
legs.
   Later, a protest broke out at the nearby refugee Camp No. 1, and
a Palestinian man was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, hospital
officials said.
   Also Friday, the army freed 89 Palestinians jailed for taking
part in anti-Israel disturbances in a move intended to reward Arabs
for good behavior. The army decision drew criticism from some
Jewish leaders.
   Benny Katzover, a senior official in Gush Emunim, the Jewish
settlement movement, said the Arabs would interpret the gesture as
a sign of weakness.
   ``As long as the uprising continues ... (our) policy must be
much, much more aggressive,'' Katzover said on Israel radio. ``The
Arabs understand by these gestures that Israeli accepts the current
situation or is unable to cope with it.''

<HEAD>Police Tow Away Tanker That Protesters Used to Block Harbor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tugboats carrying police and soldiers
towed a U.S.-registered oil tanker back to dockside Friday after
protesters had tried to use it to block visiting British warships.
   On Thursday, shipyard workers sympathetic to the opposition
Socialist Party towed the 80,000-ton Copper Mountain to the mouth
of Valletta's Grand Harbor and left it there.
   No crewmen were aboard the Copper Mountain at the time. The
vessel, identified as owned by the Point Vale company of Delaware,
had been in drydock for months while the shipyard awaited payment
for repairs.
   The Socialists oppose the warships' port call, scheduled for
Saturday, saying that three of the ships carry nuclear arms and
that the visit would violate the tiny Mediterranean island's policy
of neutrality and non-alignment.
   The General Workers Union of Malta, which backs the Socialists,
on Friday called a strike to protest the port call. The union
covers 7,000 employees in Malta's drydocks and shipbuilding areas
and some 2,000 in other sectors.
   The police who brought the tanker back to berth hired two
private tugs since pilots of the state-run tugboats refused to work
in protest of the British visit.
   The Maltese Parliament on Thursday approved a motion reaffirming
that nuclear arms should not be allowed on Maltese territory and
declaring that other nations should respect this policy.
   Earlier Thursday, in an effort to block the arrival of any
protesters' ships, the pro-West Nationalist government gave notice
that a specific port permit would be needed to enter the harbor
during the weekend.
   The ships, led by the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, were to stop
in Malta on their way to Australia for bicentennial celebrations in
the Commonwealth nation.

<HEAD>Trade Negotiators Make Some Progress, But Not on Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRAINERD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and its major trading
partners remained far apart Friday on the contentious issue of farm
subsidies, but negotiators reported progress in other areas aimed
at reducing protectionist pressures.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said differences had
been narrowed in a number of areas, including the procedures to
expand the compact that governs world trade to include services and
investments, two areas not now covered.
   ``We haven't solved all of the problems, but we believe we have
come a long way in achieving consensus,'' Yeutter said.
   His remarks came at a news conference that closed the two days
of meetings involving trade ministers from the United States,
Japan, Canada and the 12-member European Community.
   The discussions were held as part of continuing negotiations to
expand and strengthen the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
known as GATT.
   The United States has made the elimination of all farm subsidies
by the year 2000 its major goal in the GATT talks, but President
Reagan faced stiff opposition when he discussed his proposal
earlier this week at the seven-nation economic summit in Toronto.
   The summit countries ended up directing their trade negotiators
to work harder to narrow their differences in preparation for a
critical meeting of all 96 member nations of GATT in Montreal in
December.
   The differences on farm subsidies are so great that the trade
negotiators did not even have the issue on their formal agenda for
the talks held at a resort in the lake country of Minnesota.
   But the issue did dominate discussions between the bargaining
sessions and over meals, even though no progress was made,
officials said.
   The U.S. proposal is opposed by the European Community and
Japan, which pay high subsidies to their farmers.
   Even though the major countries of the world are spending $200
billion annually in the costly subsidy battle, the Europeans and
Japanese say it is unrealistic to talk about a complete phaseout of
subsidies. They said the discussions should be focused on reducing
subsidies instead, perhaps by cutting them in half.
   Yeutter hinted that the administration might be willing to back
off its demand for total elimination of subsidies by the end of the
century in favor of a longer phaseout period, but he would not
publicly state what compromise the United States might offer.
   ``We are not moving off any options. Maybe in 1990 we will make
some adjustments, but not in 1988,'' he said. The year 1990 is when
the current GATT round of trade liberalization talks is scheduled
to be completed.
   Yeutter and the other trade ministers tried to be optimistic
that the farm battle could be resolved.
   ``If you want to make progress, you have to work hard and
consistently,'' said Willy de Clerq, trade minister for the
European Community.
   John Crosbie, Canada's trade minister, said the trade ministers
may get together again after the U.S. presidential election Nov. 8
but before the Montreal meeting in December to work on unresolved
issues such as agriculture.
   Yeutter said he was encouraged with the progres between
negotiators during the two days of talks. He said he believed a
number of contentious issues ahd been resolved which would insure
substantial progress would be made in Montreal.
   The ministers agreed in principle to a common position on
strengthening GATT's procedures for settling trade disputes between
nations by speeding up the process.
   Yeutter said progress was also made on another Reagan priority
to find methods to increase the unrestricted flow of investment
around the world as well as some progress in trying to draft rules
to cover trade in services.
   Yeutter said the services question was far from being totally
resolved because of the difficulty of deciding which of 150
different sectors, from telecommunications and banking to
construction and insurance, should be covered by the rules.
   This was the 14th bargaining session between the four sides,
which represent the biggest markets in world trade. At the talks,
which began in 1983, the participants try to reach agreement among
themselves and then sell their positions to the other 92 members of
the GATT organization.
   In a show of solidarity, all four trade ministers wore T-shirts
at the news conference emblazoned ``Think Big,'' the motto for the
conference, which was aimed at promoting a global view of trade and
combatting protectionist sentiments.

<HEAD>Parliamentary Body to Discuss Military Ranks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee of the National People's Congress
convenes Saturday to consider restoring military ranks abolished by
Mao Tse-tung more than 20 years ago.
   The weeklong session of the congress' Standing Committee also
will take up proposals to confer medals on retired soldiers, said
Zhang Husheng, director of the committee's information bureau.
   The National People's Congress is China's legislature.
   It is widely believed the army will formally reinstate ranks on
either Aug. 1, Army Day, or Oct. 1, National Day. Mao did away with
the titles in 1965 to create an egalitarian, proletarian army.
   Zhang spoke at the first news briefing ever held by the Standing
Committee. He said it was part of efforts to ``increase openness''
of government proceedings.
   The 155-member Standing Committee handles day-to-day affairs of
the 3,000-member congress, which meets once a year. The committee
is meeting for the second time since the congress held its 7th full
session in March.
   Zhang said the committee will study proposals submitted by the
Central Military Commission, headed by senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
on re-establishing the military rank system.
   The committee will also take up draft rules on defining the
roles of officers in the People's Liberation Army and will discuss
education.
   Zhang said ranks were ``conducive to commanding and control of
our army and required by modernization and standardization of our
army.''
   Deng has sought to bring back ranks to help create a more modern
and efficient fighting force. Since 1985 the army has been reduced
in size from 4 million to 3 million soldiers, and more effective
weaponry has been introduced.
   Although policies are still set by the ruling Communist Party,
the congress in recent years has become a forum for debate and
discussion of those policies.
   Zhang said the Standing Committee will hold news briefings once
every two months and will make the contents of its meetings as open
as possible.
   He said the committee also plans to set up a reception room
where ordinary congress members can express opinions. It will meet
in a larger room in the Great Hall of the People to accommodate
more non-voting members and a visitor's gallery, he said.

<TEXT>
   At least 26 people died in violence
related to communist rebels, and government troops arrested a Dutch
woman suspected of having links to the insurgents, the military
said Friday.
   Army Lt. Col. Rodolfo Lorayes said troops at a checkpoint
outside the southern town of Bayugan arrested Conny Tromp on
Thursday after she failed to produce proper identification papers.
He said Tromp, 22, showed only a photocopy of her visa, which
expired in April.
   The soldiers took the woman to army headquarters in the
provincial capital of Butuan for questioning.
   Bayugan is near a mountain boundary where communist New People's
Army rebels are known to operate. Col. Napoleon Deocariz, commander
of the army battalion in Butuan, said Tromp's presence in the area
was ``quite questionable.'' He said soldiers had reported seeing a
Caucasian at the scene of a nearby firefight recently.
   Tromp is the third foreigner arrested near a New People's Army
zone this month. On June 8, government soldiers arrested Swedish
national Stellan Hermansson and West German Protestant minister
Klaus Schmidt at a checkpoint in Quezon province for allegedly
aiding communist rebels in the area.
   In Manila late Thursday, government troops killed an alleged
communist rebel in a shootout in the suburban district of
Paranaque, the military said.
   Reynaldo Floriano, allegedly an NPA rebel facing three counts of
murder, drew his gun and fired on troops when they approached him,
a military report said. The troops fired back, killing Floriano,
the report said.
   In the southern province of Davao del Norte, rebels attacked a
paramilitary outpost and killed seven militiamen Thursday, the
military's Southern Command based on Mindanao island reported.
   Army soldiers who arrived to reinforce the detachment later
clashed with the same guerilla band in San Vicente town, leaving
six rebels dead. An army soldier was killed and four civilians
caught in cross fire were wounded in the incident, the military
said.
   Government troops killed three other rebels in a separate clash
in Misamis Occidental, also in Mindanao, the military said.
   On the central island of Bohol, guerillas were reported to have
killed eight people who refused to support the rebel movement, the
government-run Philippine News Agency said.
   The agency quoted the provincial commander of Bohol as saying
that guerrillas executed five people in Batuan town at dawn
Thursday.
   Twelve hours later, another group of rebels entered the house of
a former guerrilla supporter in Balilihan town and opened fire on
its occupants, killing three people and wounding six, the news
agency said.

   Syrian-backed guerrillas on Friday
bombarded Yasser Arafat's loyalists in a bloody struggle for
control of two Palestinian refugee camps. Police said 10 people
were killed and 34 wounded.
   At one point, police said five shells a minute were hitting the
Chatilla refugee camp as Col. Saeed Mousa's radical Fatah-Uprising
tried to crush Arafat's Fatah guerrillas. They said Chatilla's only
hospital was hit dozens of times.
   A Fatah spokesman charged that Mousa's fighters ``started
shelling the camps indiscriminately'' to sabotage mediation efforts
by Libyan officials. ``They are massacring our people,'' said the
Fatah spokesman, who refused to be named.
   A truce announced in Tripoli on Thursday called for the warring
factions to return to positions they held before fighting broke out
May 1 in Chatilla and the nearby Bourj el-Barajneh camp. It was
reached in a meeting between Libyan officers and representatives of
neutral Palestinian groups.
   Since May 1, 112 people have been killed and 502 wounded in the
fight for control of the refugee camps on Beirut's southern
outskirts.
   A Palestinian official said Mousa's gunners used 240mm mortars
to shell Chatilla, the first time they have used the heavy weapons
in the fighting.
   The official quoted a doctor in Chatilla as saying most of the
hospital's medical and surgical equipment were damaged.
   ``We're crippled. We don't have the means to carry out even
minor operations. Even oxygen bottles and gauze supplies have been
blown up,'' the official quoted the doctor as saying.
   Fatah-Uprising said in a statement that Arafat provoked the
clashes to ``sabotage Syria's role in Lebanon ... in order to be
accepted in the American-Zionist arrangements.''
   Syria has 7,500 troops deployed in west Beirut to control
unrest. Last month, Syria sent 2,400 troops into south Beirut to
end a bloodbath between the Shiite Moslem militias Amal and
Hezbollah. At least 300 people died in the battle for control of
the southern slums, where Western hostages are believed held by
factions of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah.
   Mortar rounds and rockets fired by Fatah-Uprising gunners were
raining down on the camps at a rate of five a minute around dawn, a
police spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
said Fatah defenders entrenched in the rubble of the two
shantytowns responded with heavy weapons fire.
   The fighting raged through the day as smoke from burning
buildings billowed over the camps. Ambulances evacuated the wounded
to hospitals in west Beirut.
   Fatah, the main component of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, pushed Mousa's followers out of the camps in earlier
fighting.
   The dissidents, regrouped along the Syrian-controlled edges of
the shantytowns, have launched several abortive attacks in an
attempt to regain their lost bases.
   The police spokesman said Mousa's gunners concentrated their
shelling on the tiny Chatilla camp.
   ``They hammered Chatilla all day. They're turning what's left of
the camp into a pile of rubble,'' he said.
   The camps have been badly damaged by fighting that began when
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and besieged west Beirut and the
camps in an attempt to drive out Palestinian guerrillas.
   Pro-Israeli Christian Lebanese militiamen massacred hundreds of
civilians in Chatilla and the nearby Sabra camp in September 1982.
   Syrian-backed Shiite Moslems besieged the Beirut camps in 1985,
pounding them for more than two years in an abortive effort to
prevent Arafat from rebuilding the power base he lost when the
Israelis invaded.
   What was left of Sabra was bulldozed by the Shiites, but
Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh held out until the Shiites lifted
their siege.
   Mousa broke away from the PLO in 1983 in a Syrian-backed mutiny
by radicals opposed to Arafat. The latest fighting came despite a
reconciliation between Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad in
Damascus last April to end their five-year feud over who would
control the Palestinian movement.

   Erbil Tusalp, a reporter in Ankara for the Istanbul daily

   Tusalp faces trial on charges of publishing information banned

   Chief prosecutor Nusret Demiral and his assistants have been
interrogating Kartal Demirag, who was arrested after the shooting.
   The story, which appeared on the front page of the
moderate-leftist Cumhuriyet on Tuesday, included a text of
Demirag's testimony.
   Tusalp was detained after he refused to say who gave him the
testimony.
   The State Security Court examining the shooting ordered police

<HEAD>Allies Reach Agreement On Units To Defend Norway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO agreed Friday to create a
multinational army unit to replace a 5,000-man Canadian air and sea
brigade that had been earmarked to reinforce northern Norway in
times of crisis.
   The decision caps a year of study and internal NATO controversy
about how to respond to the disbanding of the Canadian Air-Sea
Transportable brigade, which had been committed to Norway for 19
years.
   The Norwegian government had criticized the Canadian move,
saying failure to replace the brigade would weaken the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's ability to stop attacks on its
northern flank.
   Canada said in June 1987 it would offset the move by adding to
its forces in West Germany.
   The alliance's Defense Planning Committee adopted outlines of a
plan for creating an army unit of U.S., West German and Canadian
troops that would be designated as early reinforcements for Norway
in times of tension.
   A NATO announcement said Gen. John R. Galvin, the chief
commander of alliance forces in Europe, was negotiating terms of a
``composite force'' for Norway. It said details would be worked out
later.
   ``This will enhance NATO's overall deterrence in a time of
tension ... demonstrate alliance solidarity and reinforce the
defense of this vitally important region in a crisis,'' the
announcement said.
   The problem of reinforcing northern Norway stems from the Oslo
government's long-standing policy of prohibiting the stationing of
foreign troops on its soil in peacetime. It also prohibits alliance
military maneuvers in the northern Finnmark county that borders the
Soviet Union.
   In Oslo, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Bruntland told a news
conference Friday she was pleased with the alliance decision.
   ``The outlined solution represents a net strengthening of the
allied contribution to the defense of Norway,'' she said.
   Norway's concern about the withdrawal of the Canadian force has
been heightened by its fear of growing superpower military strength
in the north.
   Besides Turkey, Norway is the only NATO member to share a border
with the Soviet Union.
   A 13,000-man U.S. Marine amphibious brigade and a 5,000-man
Dutch-British landing force already are committed to reinforcing
central Norway in wartime.
   When the possibility of West German troops being included in a
replacement unit for the Canadian brigade first was raised publicly
last fall, some Norwegian press reaction was negative.
   Nazi troops occupied northern Norway for five years and
destroyed many villages and factories before withdrawing in May
1945. Resentment is still evident in some parts of the sparsely
populated north.
   The day after a foreign press report in September 1987 said
German combat troops could be returning to northern Norway for the
first time, Norway's most widely read newspaper, Verdens Gang, ran
a photograph of a column of German soldiers above the headline,
``Unwelcome in Norway.''
   Government officials have never suggested they would not accept
a German contingent in a new multinational reinforcement unit. In
March, Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst called German
participation ``welcome.''

   Two men took four people hostage
in a former soccer star's apartment but surrendered after six hours
of negotiations, police said.
   The two men took the four people hostage Thursday and demanded
nearly $1 million in ransom and a helicopter, police said.
   Authorities said the men threatened to kill their hostages, who
included Teresa Sodre, an actress and wife of Carlos Alberto
Torres, captain of Brazil's national soccer team when it won the
World Cup in 1970.
   Others held hostage were her son, a maid and a handyman, police
said.
   The two men were not identified.
   TV Globo, the nation's largest private network, said the
building's porter surprised the two men during an apparent burglary
of the apartment, and the two then grabbed the hostages and made
their demands.
   The two surrendered after authorities promised them they could
meet with a lawyer, the network said.
   Torres was in New York at the time.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal income and spending grew
modestly in May, the government reported Friday, but economists
said consumer spending likely will weaken this summer as wages lag
behind inflation.
   The Commerce Department said income rose 0.3 percent last month
following a 0.1 percent gain in April.
   Meanwhile, personal consumption expenditures, which include
virtually everything except interest on debt, rose a moderate 0.5
percent in May following a 0.4 percent increase in April.
   John Hagens, an economist with the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., consulting firm, described the spending increase as ``sort of
run of the mill,'' translating into a real annual growth rate of
about 2.5 percent after the 0.3 percent rise in consumer prices in
May is taken into consideration.
   ``I think basically our biggest concern is how weak consumer
spending is. ... The income growth is simply not there to support
much growth, particularly given higher food prices expected because
of the drought,'' he said. ``I don't think we'll get 2.5 percent
this summer.''
   Through the first five years of the six-year economic expansion,
consumer buying has fueled the growth. Now, analysts are looking
for exports and sale of equipment to businesses to drive the
economy.
   Americans' disposable income _ what they have left after paying
taxes _ shot up 1.5 percent in May, after a 1.0 percent drop in
April that was the largest decline in a year.
   That was the result of the big tax bite the government takes on
April 15. Personal tax payments fell at an annual rate of $35.2
billion in May after rising $36.9 billion in April.
   In all, personal incomes rose $13.3 billion to a seasonally
adjusted annual level of $3.95 trillion.
   The report said both the April and May increases look weaker
because March income was boosted by profit-sharing payments to Ford
Motor Co. workers and retroactive Social Security payments. Also, a
lag in federal payments to farmers held back the May advance.
   Excluding those special factors, the government said personal
income would have advanced 0.8 percent in April and 0.4 percent in
May.
   Americans saved $151.9 billion in May, compared with $119.6
billion in April, boosting the personal savings rate to 4.5 percent
from 3.6 percent.
   The April savings rate was unusually low because of income tax
payments. On average, Americans have been saving 4.4 percent of
their income so far this year, compared with a rate of 3.7 percent
last year.
   Hagens said the rate could decline this summer as consumer dip
into their savings to bolster purchasing power eroded by inflation.
But he said that likely would be only temporary and cannot support
consumer spending in the long run.
   Wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of $12.2 billion in
May after an $11.8 billion increase in April. Farm income fell $2.4
billion last month following an $11.9 billion drop in April.
   On the spending side, purchases of durable goods, ``big ticket''
items expected to last three or more years, decreased $1.5 billion
last month, following a $7.9 billion April increase. Purchases of
non-durable goods rose $7.6 billion, following a $5.1 billion
decrease.
   Purchases of services, which includes housing costs, rose $9.6
billion, following a $10.8 billion increase.

<HEAD>Police Keep Guard Around Buddhist Shrine After Protesters Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police kept guard around Burma's holiest
Buddhist shrine Friday after student protesters had abandoned the
hilltop pagoda.
   Pilgrims who entered the spawling Shwedagon Pagoda after it was
reopened Friday said they found no trace of the demonstrators.
   Traffic increased in Rangoon, and all markets were open,
although fewer shoppers were seen. Police also kept tight security
around other temples in the capital.
   Nine people were killed in the week of student-led street
violence, officials said. The government imposed a dusk-to-dawn
curfew, closed institutions of higher learning and prohibited all
public meetings.
   Buddhist pilgrims reported Thursday that students had moved into
the shrine, a centuries-old marvel of golden spires and stupas, to
set up a ``strike center'' that would coordinate anti-government
protests.
   Pagoda trustees who spoke on condition of anonymity said
university students arrived in groups at the shrine Wednesday
afternoon and probably mingled with worshippers before the 6 p.m.
government curfew.
   The students were also said to have left later that day, though
it was not clear whether they too were observing the curfew or
departed for some other reason.
   The trustees said security officials searched the temple grounds
Wednesday night and barred public access Thursday.
   The week's protests also forced the suspension of classes at
schools in Mandalay, the country's second-largest city.
Anti-government protests also have been reported in Pegu, north of
Rangoon, and in Moulmein, on the southeastern seacoast.
   Since October, the 26-year-old regime of strongman U Ne Win has
been rocked by three violent protests in Rangoon and smaller ones
in other parts of the country.
   Diplomatic and other sources says lack of personal freedoms and
a downward spiraling economy are fueling unrest.
   Buddhist pagodas in Burma have traditionally been centers of
political protest. In 1920, Rangoon students moved into the
Shwedagon grounds to launch agitation against the British, then
Burma's colonial rulers.
   The posting of guards at Sule, Botataung and other shrines was
viewed as a measure to prevent activists from entering the Buddhist
holy places, where violence of any kind is forbidden.
   Last week, students at several institutions had peacefully
demonstrated for release of detained students and legalization of
student unions. Violence broke out after the government responded
by closing the schools.
   On Tuesday, about 5,000 students and other protesters fought
police with stones.
   Last March, police and military units brutally suppressed a
similar demonstration, arresting hundreds and killing what Western
diplomats put at possibly up to 100 protesters.

   Former Miss America Bess Myerson asked
for a delay in prosecution of shoplifting charges against her until
after her federal trial this fall in New York City.
   Lycoming County Judge Thomas C. Raup scheduled a hearing July 6
on the motion, filed Thursday. Miss Myerson's trial, scheduled to
begin Monday, will be temporarily postponed at least until the
hearing.
   Her lawyer argues that publicity about the shoplifting trial
could keep her from getting an unbiased jury in the federal trial.
But District Attorney Brett O. Feese opposed the delay, saying,
``It's just another shoplifting case.''
   Miss Myerson, 63, was charged with shoplifting May 27 after she
allegedly tried to leave a department store with six bottles of
nail polish, five pairs of earrings, a pair of shoes and flashlight
batteries.
   The former New York City cultural affairs commissioner contends
she planned to go back to the store to pay for the items after
locking her car.
   Miss Myerson is scheduled to stand trial in New York in
September on charges of mail fraud, racketeering, conspiracy and
influencing a judge. The indictment, returned last October, accuses
her of trying to influence the divorce case of her reported lover,
millionaire Carl Capasso.

   Former vice-presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro will be at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta
next month as an analyst for a local television station.
   At a news conference Thursday announcing her plans to work for
the ABC affiliate WCVB-TV, Ferraro said she doesn't ``feel the same
obligation the station does to be objective'' but is confident she
will be able to discuss the issues without promoting her personal
political agenda.
   ``I'm not walking away from being a Democrat. I'm proud of it,''
she said. ``Perhaps because of it I can give an inside view. You've
seen it from the outside. I've been on the inside.''
   She said she was raising funds for Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the probable Democratic nominee. A former congresswoman,
she ran on the ticket in 1984 as Walter Mondale's running mate.

   Actress Rebecca DeMornay, reprising Judy
Holliday's Oscar-winning role in the 1946 comedy-drama ``Born
Yesterday,'' says she's amazed the story on Washington corruption
is so relevant today.
   Miss DeMornay, who starred in the films ``Risky Business'' and
``The Trip to Bountiful,'' plays a woman who learns her boyfriend
is involved in government corruption in a stage production
beginning Sunday at the Pasadena Playhouse.
   ``It's amazingly reflective of our times,'' Miss DeMornay said.
``I'm going to rehearsals and I see huge headlines in the
newspapers, `Bribery Exceeds All Limits.' That's what this play is
about!''
   She calls her character ``an innocent who is apolitical and, for
all intents and purposes, pretty dumb, who awakens intellectually
and politically.''
   ``She sees the (hypocrisy) within the system and calls everybody
on it. I thought that was very inspirational, particularly this
year,'' she said.

   Patty Hearst, who once handled automatic weapons
as a kidnapped soldier in the Symbionese Liberation Army, says she
now keeps a gun by her suburban bedside.
   ``There are guns all over the house,'' she says, including a
handgun ``a little more substantial than a Magnum'' kept by the
bed, she said in an interview in Vogue magazine.
   The 34-year-old publishing heiress recalled that during her time
with the SLA, she ``really began to notice I was no longer in
control when, without a thought, I just did what I had been trained
to do _ fire the machine gun and the other guns in sequence.''
   A few weeks after she was kidnapped by the SLA in 1974 in
Berkeley, Calif., the radical leftist band released a taped message
from her declaring that she had decided to join the group. She
subsequently took part in a bank robbery and spent more than a year
on the run before being arrested.
   At her trial, her lawyers argued that she had been mistreated
and did not freely join the SLA. Though she was convicted and spent
time in prison, her sentence was eventually commuted.
   Hearst married her former bodyguard and now lives in Westport,
Conn.

   Convicted bank robber turned
businessman Delbert Dunmire donated $300,000 worth of high-powered
assault rifles Friday to the Highway Patrol.
   Saying he thought the weapons would deter criminals, Dunmire
presented police officials with the first 100 of his planned gift
of 300 semiautomatic .223 rifles.
   Dunmire is the millionaire chairman of Growth Industries Inc.,
an airplane parts manufacturing company he founded in 1967 after
serving two years in prison for robbing a bank to pay off gambling
debts.
   ``The criminal element will hit the soft spot, not the hard,''
Dunmire said as he presented the weapons. ``I want this patrol to
be a coconut, not a banana.''
   Dunmire made headlines last August when he treated nearly 200
classmates from the Punxsutawney (Pa.) High School class of 1952 to
an expense-paid trip to the Bahamas for their 35th reunion.

   James Reinders is completing ``Carhenge,''
his replica of England's Stonehenge made of old cars welded
together in a field.
   Reinders said Thursday he has spent nearly $10,000 on the
project.
   Reinders, 60, a retired oil consultant who lives in Houston,
added 10 cars this week to the 22-car sculpture he erected last
summer on U.S. 385 north of Alliance.
   ``I'd be hard pressed to explain why all of the excitement about
Carhenge,'' Reinders said. ``Something about this is imaginative.
People see it as creative, unique, and novelty, but art _ I don't
know.''
   Reinders said that he talked to a couple who said they saw a UFO
land in the center of Carhenge.
   ``If Stonehenge has some purpose, then I think Carhenge has some
purpose,'' Reinders said. ``I was hoping UFOs would see and
recognize it as a possible landing strip. If these people saw it,
then I can only hope it was true. I wasn't here.''

   This week, Sotheby's auction house sold it for $8,250, meaning a

   ``We'd been reading up on French paperweights,'' Mrs. Goldthrite
said Thursday. ``We thought it might have been one of those.''
   It wasn't. But the 4-inch-long, cornucopia-style paperweight was
made in New England about 1860.
   The Goldthrites, who operate a booth at the Shelby Antiques
Mall, say they'll keep following a strategy that pays _ Saturday
yard sales.
   ``We start out at 6 a.m. and go straight through noon,'' Mrs.
Goldthrite said. ``We hit them all. Maybe we'll get lucky again.''

   The government has refused to give a
passport to a prominent Kenyan lawyer who was invited to the United
States to be honored by the American Bar Association, a newspaper
reported Friday.
   The Standard Newspaper wrote that Gibson Kamau Kuria hopes to be
honored in absentia.
   Kuria's passport was confiscated when he was detained Feb. 26,
1987, a day after he filed a petition challenging the detention
without charge of two lawyers and a university lecturer.
   Joseph P. Griffin, ABA chairman, invited Kuria to receive a
citation for his ``work in promoting respect for and observance of
the rule of law.'' He was to leave June 12 and return June 26.
   Kuria told Griffin in a letter made available to The Associated
Press that an immigration official had informed him the government
only returns held passports when it decides the holder can travel
outside Kenya.
   ``That policy is in conflict with the Kenyan law which governs
the return of passports held by public authorities,'' Kuria said.
   The Kenyan law requires that authorities repossess passports
only for a specific reason and for a specified period.
   Like his clients, Kuria was held under a law that allows
indefinite detention without charge.
   President Daniel arap Moi freed Kuria Dec. 12, and the attorney
rejoined his partners in a Nairobi law firm.

   A woman whose husband tried to blow up an
airliner with her and their three children aboard on has sued
``Soldier of Fortune'' magazine, alleging her husband got a bomb
through its classified ads.
   Mary Thielman of San Marcos claims in the lawsuit filed earlier
this week that her husband, Albert Lee Thielman, bought a bomb from
a Houston man who had advertised in ``Soldier of Fortune'' as a
``gun for hire.''
   Thielman, 37, is serving a 40-year prison term after he pleaded
guilty to federal charges in the bombing. The bomb exploded in the
luggage compartment moments after the plane landed in Dallas on
Oct. 30, 1985. No one was hurt.
   The lawsuit names Soldier of Fortune Magazine Inc., and its
owner, Omega Group Ltd., both of Boulder, Colo.
   Publisher Robert Brown, facing a $9.4 million judgment against
the magazine from a March trial in a Houston murder-for-hire case,
declined to comment Thursday.
   The magazine stopped accepting ``personal services''
advertisements in January 1986 after the first lawsuit, John
Coleman, a senior editor said.
   ``In fact, the classified ads we do run right now, we screen
exceptionally carefully, which is unfortunate,'' Coleman said.
``Because there are many bonafide and legitimate businesses out
there ... and without the right to advertise for work, you have a
tough time finding work.''
   Lawyers for the magazine say they will appeal the Houston case.

   A sheriff's deputy who gave a fast-talking
jail escapee a ride across the state line has been suspended, the
sheriff said.
   ``There will be disciplinary action on this matter,'' Marion
County Sheriff Dan Campbell said Thursday.
   James Ellis Wofford, 21, of Hannibal, was still at large after
getting a ride to Quincy, Ill., from Deputy Harold Lee, Campbell
said.
   Wofford was being held on charges of passing a bad check and
tampering with a vehicle when he escaped from the county jail in
Palmyra Wednesday. When his escape was discovered, his description
was broadcast to deputies and other authorities, Campbell said.
   Lee reported seeing a man walking along U.S. 24 on Thursday,
Campbell said. The man's clothing, except for the color of his
shirt, matched the description of the escaped prisoner, Lee told
Campbell.
   ``He expected the suspect to run, but the guy didn't run. He
just walked back to the officer's car,'' Campbell said. ``The
suspect said, `I've been walking half the night.' He said he missed
his ride in Hannibal and was en route to Quincy. He said his family
would be worried about him.''
   Lee believed the hitchhiker's story and gave him a ride to
Quincy, the sheriff said.
   When they arrived, Lee told Campbell, it became apparent that
the man wasn't sure what house he was looking for.
   ``At that time, Lee attempted to secure him inside the
vehicle,'' Campbell said. ``They struggled inside the vehicle and
the suspect was able to get free.''

<HEAD>Panel's Final Report Delivered To White House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The presidential AIDS commission's final
report was delivered to the White House without fanfare Friday,
officially meeting the deadline established a year ago when
President Reagan appointed the panel.
   Reagan planned to receive it formally on Monday from the panel
chairman, retired Navy Adm. James D. Watkins, and be briefed on its
recommendations, officials said.
   Contents of the report, calling for federal anti-discrimination
protection for people infected with the deadly virus, have been
public since it was agreed upon in open session shortly before
midnight last Friday at the end of the 13-member commission's final
working session.
   The final report was essentially the same as draft
recommendations unveiled on June 2 by Watkins and tentatively
approved by the panel a week later.
   Printing delays held up mass distribution of the final version
on Friday, but the first copies _ including one embossed with
Reagan's name _ came off the presses shortly after noon.
   At the White House, deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said
Reagan will formally receive the report Monday afternoon.
   The spokesman also said that Reagan will receive a briefing from
Watkins at that time.
   ``The president's fully aware of this issue,'' Popadiuk said,
side-stepping the question of whether Reagan would be reading the
commission's report over the weekend in preparation for the Monday
meeting.
   The report was received by presidential aides on Friday,
officials said.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis all but ruled
out Bill Bradley as a prospective running mate on Friday, saying
the New Jersey senator had told the campaign he wasn't interested,
and adding ``I respect that.''
   Beginning a four-day vacation at a borrowed vacation home on
Nantucket Island, Dukakis said Bradley had told Paul Brountas, the
Dukakis senior adviser who is leading his search for vice
presidential candidate, that he ``apparently'' wasn't interested.
   ``In any event, we're going to keep in touch,'' Dukakis said.
   He said rival Jesse Jackson, reported to have said privately he
would turn down the vice presidential nomination, had not sent that
word to the Dukakis campaign.
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' he said of the Jackson
report in The Boston Globe, which was attributed to unnamed sources.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor who is awaiting the
presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention next
month, said that if any of the prospective vice presidential
candidates ruled themselves out ``clearly and unequivocally, to me,
then obviously I'm not going to press the point.''
   ``I might push a little bit if somebody seemed to me to be a
good prospect,'' he said. ``But if they came back and said, `Look,
we've thought about it. We decided this isn't the time _ '''
   He was asked if that was the case with Bradley, a senator who
has campaigned with Dukakis and is clearly a personal favorite of
the governor.
   ``Well, apparently so,'' he said. ``We haven't talked personally
about it. ... He's somebody I have a lot of respect for. Apparently
he said that to Paul, and I respect that.''
   Dukakis flew to Nantucket Island off Cape Cod with his wife,
Kitty. He said he plans to read and relax over the weekend before
returning to Boston on Monday evening.
   Mrs. Dukakis is recovering from spinal surgery she underwent
three weeks ago. She wore a plum-colored scarf around a neck brace
when she and her husband appeared before reporters and
photographers on the lawn of the picturesque home where they are
staying. She took off her neck brace briefly to show the scar left
by the operation.
   ``Want to see my scar?'' she said, drawing laughs from the crowd
of reporters.
   The couple is staying at a brown, wood-frame Colonial home
overlooking an inlet off Nantucket Harbor. The home, where the
Dukakises have stayed before, is situated up a tree-lined drive and
not visible from the road.
   The home is owned by Bernard and Grace Grossman, famiily friends
for some 20 years. Bernard Grossman is a former executive of a
well-known Boston-area lumber company.
   Unlike Repulican nominee-to-be George Bush, who owns a shoreside
family estate at Kennebunkport, Maine, Dukakis owns no vacation
home.
   The governor relaxed on a lounge chair, while wearing a cotton
sweater, pants and deck shoes without socks. Rarely is he seen in
public without his usual attire: a suit and black wing-tipped shoes.
   ``It's an incredible place,'' he said, looking at the view and
recalling that he and Kitty came to Nantucket on their honeymoonn
25 years ago. ``We've been coming back ever since.''
   He said it was to Nantucket that they came in the fall of 1978
after he lost a bid for re-election ``to heal our wounds.''
   He said this time he brought two bags of reading material and
planned to spend his four days reading and walking.
   He had little to say about the series of events that buffeted
his campaign over the past several days, including the disclosure
that the FBI is conducting a preliminary inquiry into the state's
decision to locate a new prison on land owned by longtime
acquaintances of the governor. He said he planned no investigation
of the case by the governor's office.
   He again defended his decision to sign a bill imposing a 5
percent increase in the state tax on cigarettes as a move to
counter the state revenue shortfall, pointing to previous tax cuts.
   ``We've run into this rather modest shortfall and when you do
that you have to respond to it,'' he said.
   Dukakis provided little insight to his vice presidential
deliberations beyond his comments on Bradley. ``There's no list,''
he said. ``We're trying to expand the circle as broadly as
possible.''
   Aides said he planned no meetings or serious discussions on the
vice presidential choice during his vacation. Brountas did not
accompany him to the island, and campaign manager Susan Estrich
flew home to Los Angeles for the weekend.

<TEXT>
   A woman who answered a personal ad and
dated the man she met for a month has been charged seven months
later in his shooting death.
   Vivian Collie Hicks is charged with first-degree murder in the
April death of Douglas Gerald Basham. Charged along with Ms. Hicks
on Thursday was Michael Alvin Scales, 21, who police described as
her current boyfriend. They are being held in Rockingham County
Jail without bond.
   ``I would say it had something to do with the relationship
Vivian and Basham had and maybe her getting a new boyfriend,'' said
Rockingham County Sheriff C.D. Vernon.
   Ms. Hicks and Basham met through a Nov. 22, 1987, advertisment
in the Greensboro News & Record and were later featured in story in
the newspaper. They were both from Reidsville, north of Greensboro.
   The couple planned to marry, but Ms. Hicks told the newspaper in
April that she broke the engagement in December.
   In the personals ad, Basham referred to himself as: ``Me-35,
Beard, Caring, Loving, Country Boy at Heart! You-Special in Your
Own Way. Take The Chance To Write. You Might Be Surprised!''
   At the time the two met, Ms. Hicks was married to Danny Gray
Hicks of Madison. She filed for divorce in early December and later
that month took out a warrant against her husband, charging he had
threatened her over the divorce proceedings.
   The charge was found to be frivolous and malicious by a
Rockingham County judge, who ordered Ms. Hicks to pay $52 in court
fees.
   In February, Basham was arrested after Ms. Hicks took out
warrants against him charging him with beating and harassing her.
Basham was found innocent of the charges.
   Later the month, Ms. Hicks voluntarily dismissed the divorce
action, according to records at the Rockingham County Courthouse.
   At the time of Basham's slaying, Ms. Hicks apparently was dating
Scales, said sheriff's Capt. Bob Gray.
   ``What the relationship was is up for grabs,'' Gray said. ``He
(Scales) says they were dating. She denies it.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Friday announced his
intention to nominate Robert L. Pugh, a career Foreign Service
officer, to be ambassador to the Republic of Chad.
   Pugh, 56, will succeed John Blane, if confirmed by the Senate.
   Pugh entered the Foreign Service in 1961 and served as an
international economist at the State Department from 1961-63. He
served as political-military officer in Ankara, Turkey, from
1964-67 and as principal officer of the American consulate in
Isfahan from 1967-69.
   More recently, Pugh was deputy chief of mission at the U.S.
Embassy in Beirut from 1982-84. Since 1985 he has been U.S.
ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.
   Pugh graduated from the University of Washington in 1954 and
served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1954-61.

<HEAD>Army Copter Ditches in Persian Gulf, Crew Safe</HEAD>

   An Army special operations helicopter was
forced to ditch in the Persian Gulf after encountering mechanical
problems, Pentagon officials disclosed Friday.
   The Thursday night incident, the first involving one of the
secret MH-6 copters in the gulf, occurred during a routine patrol
and did not involve any hostile fire, officials said.
   Both crewmen escaped injury and were picked up later in good
condition, the Pentagon said. The helicopter sank.
   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman, said the
incident occurred shortly before midnight local time, or around 4
p.m. EDT Thursday. He identified the craft only as ``a U.S.
helicopter operating in the central Persian Gulf on a routine
surveillance mission.''
   But other officials, who asked not to be identified, said the
helicopter was an MH-6 flying from one of two large barges moored
in the northern Persian Gulf.
   The barges are used to support mine-sweeping vessels as well as
a number of special operations aircraft and commando teams, and
also as bases for surveillance missions to keep track of Iranian
gunboats. The Navy and Defense Department officially refuse to
acknowledge their existence.
   The MH-6 is a small, fast reconnaissance aircraft that has been
armed with several sophisticated weapons and night-time sensors and
modified to fly with little noise. A derivative of a bubble-canopy
copter designed by Hughes Aircraft, it is thought to be flown by
only one unit of the Army's Special Operations Forces, based at
Fort Campbell, Ky.
   Since arriving for gulf duty, the copters have at times been
referred to by the nickname ``Sea Bat'' and also as AH-6s. The Army
does not discuss the helicopter.
   The helicopters were ferried to the gulf last summer, not long
after the U.S. Navy began protecting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in
the gulf. Kuwait, a key ally of Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war,
requested the protection after Iran began singling out the vessels
for attack.
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger acknowledged the
helicopters' presence in the gulf after one of them intercepted and
attacked an Iranian navy ship, the Iran Ajr, as it sowed mines in
international waters of the gulf last Sept. 21.
   Pentagon sources said Friday they were certain an effort would
be made to raise the downed helicopter, ``depending upon the depth
of the water there.''
   ``And we would very definitely like to have it back,'' one
official said.

   Sikh extremists shot to death 12 people
in attacks across Punjab state, including a Sikh boy and two Hindu
priests, the United News of India reported Friday.
   A Hindu businessman, Prem Chand Aggarwal, was robbed and killed
by Sikh gunmen Friday in Batala town in Gurdaspur district, a major
stronghold of Sikh terrorists.
   UNI said that a 13-year-old Sikh boy, Jaswant Singh, was killed
in Amritsar by Sikh extremists. A woman also was killed in Amritsar.
   Sikh separatists shot and killed two Hindu priests in Hoshiarpur
district Thursday night, UNI said. The victims were identified as
Charan Singh and Ram Lal.
   Two policemen were killed by Sikh radicals in Asur village in
Amritsar district late Thursday, UNI said.
   Another police constable was killed after he chased a gang of
militants in Ludhiana city. Another policeman was seriously injured.
   Three other Sikhs and a Hindu also were killed in separate
attacks, UNI said.
   In addition, a person injured in a bomb explosion in Amritsar on
Tuesday died of his injuries, UNI said. That raised the death toll
from the bomb blast to 26. Police said Sikh militants planted the
bomb.
   According to police figures, the deaths raised to 1,389 the
number of people killed in Punjab this year by Sikh militants
fighting for a separate homeland in the northern state.
   Sikhs are 2 percent of India's 800 million people and claim they
are discriminated against by the majority Hindus. Sikhs are a
majority in Punjab.
   Most victims of Sikh violence are Hindus, but militants also
target moderate Sikhs who don't support their cause.

<DATELINE>HERAKLION, Crete (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek workers at a U.S. air base on this
southern island ended a monthlong strike Friday, a union
representative said.
   The 250 workers walked off the job May 23 to press for a 15
percent pay increase and special allowances from their employers,
Pacific Architects and Engineers.
   The strike at the Gournes Air Base, 10 miles outside the city of
Heraklion on the island's northern coast, affected the delivery of
food, fuel and water to the installation, the U.S. Air Force said.
   ``The Greek Labor Ministry said they would give us special
allowances that equal the 15 percent pay hike we wanted. But it
doesn't mean we are happy,'' said the union representative,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the California-based firm, which employs truck drivers
and operates power, water and sewage plants on the base, has not
agreed to sign a collective wage agreement with the workers.
   ``We might go on strike again if they don't sign,'' he added.
   No representatives of the private U.S. firm were available for
comment.
   Gournes, a communications monitoring base, is one of four
American installations that has been operating in Greece since the
early 1950s
   There is a U.S. Sixth Fleet supply base in Souda Bay, Crete, and
two more installations near Athens _ an Air Force support base
adjacent to Athens airport and a Navy communications base 22 miles
east of the city.

   A magistrate Friday ordered six soldiers
to stand trial on charges of attempting to overthrow President
Yoweri Museveni.
   Magistrate Richard Bamwiite of the Kampala District Court said
the soldiers would be tried for treason by the High Court. The
accused are Capt. Frank Kibuuka, Sgt. Yusuf Lubwama, Cpl. Mike
Muwonge and Pvts. Kennedy Bwanika, Morris Kato and Mqhamzd Kyeyune.
   The soldiers were arrested in January, allegedly during a secret
meeting in Kampala to discuss how to mount the coup.
   They are all former guerrillas of Museveni, whose National
Resistance Army seized power in January 1986. Museveni overthrew
the military junta that ousted civilian President Milton Obote in
July 1985.
   The magistrate remanded the soldiers to custody for trial on a
date to be set by the High Court.

<HEAD>Seven Walrus Hunters Rescued After Three Week Ordeal in Bering Sea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven walrus hunters including a
13-year-old boy and a teacher from New Jersey are safe after three
weeks adrift in the ice-clogged Bering Sea.
   Three were flown to Anchorage hospitals Friday while the others
awaited flights back to their St. Lawrence Island home.
   One of the hunters, a 27-year-old Eskimo, said he dreamed of hot
chocolate and strawberries before being rescued by helicopter late
Thursday. The intensive search included flights authorized by the
Soviet Union inside its 12-mile territorial limit, a first,
according to U.S. officials.
   But the missing hunters were found on a southeast shore of St.
Lawrence Island at the opposite end from their home port of Gambell
on the Island's northwestern tip and away from the Soviet
territorial waters.
   The rescue touched off a celebration in Gambell, a closely knit
Eskimo community. Six of the seven were members of the Slwooko
family. The other was Andy Haviland, a school teacher formerly of
New Jersey.
   ``Everyone is just all over the village, hugging and kissing and
praising God. ... Oh, it's amazing,'' Haviland's mother, Deborah,
told KNOM radio of Nome. She flew to Gambell from her home in
Summit, N.J., after her son was reported missing.
   Haviland, 30, was reported in stable condition at Providence
Hospital, suffering from malnutrition and dehydration. A
spokeswoman said he wolfed down a sandwich, chocolate cake and
Jello before falling asleep.
   Haviland was the only non-native in the group and he credited
the Eskimos' finely honed knowledge of nature for their survival.
   ``They had that ability ... after so many generations of
surviving, they have a very strong belief in it,'' Haviland said by
telephone from his hospital bed. ``They've done it for thousands of
years and they can do it some more.''
   Harold Slwooko, 27, was reported in stable condition at Alaska
Native Medical Center, suffering from mild dehydration, an infected
right hand and mild frostbite to his feet. Dr. Eva Carey said it
did not appear surgery would be required.
   Also in stable condition with dehydration was 30-year-old
Michael Slwooko.
   Carey said the hospital didn't have the strawberries of Harold
Slwooko's dreams, but the two men had hot chocolate, roast beef
sandwiches, orange soda and coffee, she said.
   The group of seven, in two small skiffs, were part of a larger
hunting party that left Gambell for what was supposed to be a
one-day hunt. They were heard from briefly the next day, but then
there was no trace of them.
   The search effort included the Coast Guard, Alaska State
Troopers, the Alaska National Guard and several Soviet ships. It
focused on an area less than 20 miles from the Soviet border and
included the unprecedented flights Thursday along the southeastern
shore of Siberia's Chukotsk Peninsula.
   Despite the hunters' lengthy absence, searchers remained
confident.
   ``You could tell the Soviets were deeply moved by the fact that
the walrus hunters may have been lost, and they were willing to do
anything they could to help,'' Gov. Steve Cowper said Thursday
night.
   But the hunters were found by a research vessel whose crew
spotted them paddling toward the southeast shore of St. Lawrence
Island, National Guard spokesman Mike Haller said.
   A National Guard helicopter was dispatched from Nome to pick
them up.

   Greenpeace activists tied a yellow
float to the anchor of a U.S. ship Friday to protest the alleged
presence of nuclear weapons at the American base here.
   The protest provoked a skirmish with American patrol boats, who
used hoses to douse anti-nuclear activists on the small craft.
Greenpeace said the protest was to highlight claims that
nuclear-tipped Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles have been
deployed at the base.
   The Greenpeace ship Sirius entered the base and launched two
small rubber craft toward the moored submarine tender Frank Cable.
Protesters then attached a large yellow float emblazoned with the
words ``Nuclear Free Seas'' to the ship's anchor chain, according
to Steve Morgan, a British photographer recording the event for
Greenpeace.
   Two U.S. tugboats, one Italian tugboat, and three patrol boats _
two American and one Italian _ moved in, according to a statement
issued by the group in Rome.
   The U.S. patrol boats doused two women on the yellow submarine
with fire hoses and rammed the float. Boathooks and knives were
used to puncture it and untie it from the Frank Cable, said Morgan.
   He said the women braved the hose blasts and retied the partly
deflated float to the tender. But they were finally forced to
paddle the crippled craft back to the mother ship.
   There were no arrests or injuries, the group said.
   Officials of the U.S. embassy in Rome had no comment on the
episode other than to acknowledge that it occurred. No one answered
the phone at the base commander's office at La Maddalena.
   A Greenpeace spokesman, Mike Ross, said the action was prompted
by evidence obtained by researchers in Washington allegedly proving
that the Frank Cable has been carrying nuclear-tipped Tomahawk
cruise missile since 1985.
   A U.S. Navy spokesman in Naples, Lt. David Morris, said it is
U.S. policy neither to confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear
weapons on any naval vessel.
   Former Italian Defense Minister Giovanni Spadolini has denied
these allegations since they began to surface in 1984.

   Kitty Dukakis, recovering from major
surgery on her spine, peeled off her neck brace Friday and asked
reporters, ``Want to see my scar?''
   Mrs. Dukakis, beginning a short vacation with husband Michael
Dukakis, said she was feeling well three weeks after doctors
operated to correct two disks that were pressing against her spinal
cord.
   She revealed the modest scar across the front of her neck as she
and the likely Democratic presidential nominee chatted with
reporters and photographers who accompanied them to this resort
island.
   She was wearing a scarf around the neck brace, and she was asked
how much time doctors would allow her to go without the collar.
   She started to respond, then said, ``Want to see my scar?''
   As the surprised crowd laughed, she took off the brace. As she
did, the governor asked, ``Any veterans of the Lyndon Johnson
appendectomy?''
   He was referring to the former president who lifted his shirt to
reveal his scar after gall bladder and kidney stone surgery.

   Producers vowed Friday to tape a new fall TV
season despite the 3-to-1 rejection of their latest contract offer
to scriptwriters, but the union said its walkout would keep
Hollywood paralyzed.
   As the strike continued in its 16th week, layoff notices began
almost simultaneously with the announcement of the voting results
Thursday. At Universal Studios, a memo to employees announced that
the commissary was closing Friday.
   The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers offer
was turned down 2,789 to 933. The 9,000-member Writers Guild of
America voted Wednesday night during spirited meetings in Los
Angeles and New York that injected a renewed dose of union
solidarity.
   ``If we have to strike for two years, we'll do it,'' said Scott
Frank, a writer on the television series ``Plainclothes.''
   Debut of the fall season has already been delayed to at least
mid-October, and there were harsh words from producers, who had
described the offer as their final one.
   ``We've finished talking. We won't go back,'' said alliance
spokesman Herb Steinberg, adding that production of some fall TV
shows will begin after the July 4 holiday. He would't elaborate how
the producers hoped to find non-union scriptwriters or lure guild
members into crossing picket lines.
   ``We have some things ready to go,'' Steinberg said. ``We are
very optimistic. We will have new shows for the fall season.''
   But guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden dismissed the chances of any
meaningful start-up.
   ``They were claiming they would attempt to produce with scab
writers,'' she said. ``We don't think that will be any significant
help to them. No one is crossing the lines.''
   ``We don't think they can increase production to any extent.''
   Virtually all fall programming is idled by the work stoppage.
The exceptions are some independently produced shows that have
signed guild contracts, including ``The Cosby Show'' and ``The
Tonight Show With Johnny Carson.''
   Guild President George Kirgo, leading hundreds of union members
on a picket line Friday outside the NBC-TV studios in Burbank, said
six more independent companies immediately signed contracts with
the guild after the union vote.
   Steinberg, vowing ``to do everything we can to get the town back
to work,'' said it will be next week before producers can determine
the extent of the production start-up.
   ``If we can't get it all going, there will be layoffs,'' he
said. ``We have been holding some people on the payroll, hoping the
writers would come to their senses. Now that they are dug in, we
have to reassess that.''
   Leaders of a dissident guild faction that had favored the pact
pledged not to cross picket lines, Kirgo said. But one of the
dissidents said he was unhappy the walkout was continuing.
   ``I believe the strike of 1988 will become the guild's own
Vietnam War,'' writer Rift Fournier told Daily Variety.
   ``It's disastrous for the entire business,'' said Paul Junger
Witt, a member of the guild and co-executive producer of ``The
Golden Girls'' and ``Beauty and the Beast.''
   Dan Slusser, senior vice president and general manager of
Universal City Studios Inc., called the union's vote ``devastating.
We've already made a number of cutbacks in the TV and studio
operations group.''
   The union went on strike March 7 over the issues of payments for
reruns of one-hour shows and programs broadcast in foreign markets.
   ``The problem issue is in the economic area _ residuals,
domestic and foreign,'' Ms. Rhoden said.
   Producers claim the four-year package offered would be worth an
extra $71 million to writers and contains an across-the-board
increase in residuals of 14.7 percent. Payments to writers at
present total about $360 million a year, Steinberg said.

   President Reagan presented medals to former
prisoners of three wars Friday and pledged continued efforts to
bring home any more American prisoners of war who may be held.
   ``We write no final chapters here,'' Reagan told a crowd of
approximately 1,000 at a medal ceremony on the South Lawn of the
White House.
   ``Our country has not forgotten former comrades who are still
missing, those who fought in Korea or Vietnam and have not returned
home or been accounted for,'' the president said. ``We must be
faithful to them and their families and demand a full accounting of
the fate of those Americans who are missing in action.''
   ``If Americans are being held against their will, we must bring
them home,'' he said.
   Repeating his often-expressed view of the Vietnam War, Reagan
told veterans, ``On the battlefield you knew only victory, only to
have your victory lost by a failure of political will.
Nevertheless, you did honor to America.''
   Reagan presented the medals to two prisoners from World War II,
two from the Korean War and two from the Vietnam War as
representatives of the many who are eligible.
   The Defense Department began awarding the medals in April. They
were authorized by Congress in the defense authorization act for
the 1986 fiscal year.
   Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci told the crowd, ``This is
indeed a hard medal to earn. We hope that in the future we will not
have to give out any more of these medals.''
   The recipients were:
   _Sgt. Albert J. Bland of Joppa, Md. , retired from the Air
Force, who served in the Pacific theater during World War II;
   _Lt. Charles M. Williams of Gaithersburg, Md., a retired Air
Force officer who served in the European theater in World War II;
   _Cpl. Charles A. Burton of Port Deposit, Md. , who served with
the Army in Korea;
   _Col. Jesse Booker of Beaufort, S.C., a Marine Corps officer who
Carlucci said was the first to be shot down and one of the longest
held officers in the Korean War;
   _Col. Floyd James Thompson of Key West, Fla., an Army officer
who was described as the first to be shot down, the longest held in
the Vietnam War and who was held in the South; and
   _Cmdr. Everett Alvarez of Rockville, Md., a Navy flier who
Carlucci said was shot down over North Vietnam and was the second
longest held prisoner of the war.
   The first four received their medals in veterans' organization
regalia. Thompson wore his Army uniform with green beret. Alvarez
received his medal in a business suit.
   First lady Nancy Reagan and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a former
Vietnam prisoner of war, joined the president and Carlucci on the
speakers' stand.

<TEXT>
   Greek and American negotiators ended their
seventh round of talks on an agreement for U.S. military bases
without any significant progress, officials said Friday.
   ``There still continues to be a difference of views on the
issues being discussed,'' government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos
said.
   The negotiations ended Thursday, a day earlier than scheduled
because the Greek negotiators had previous commitments, Kostopoulos
said.
   The talks, which began in November 1987, are on the renewal of a
five-year operating agreement for four U.S. bases. The accord
expires December 31, 1988.
   Greece has said a new agreement must be linked to American help
with ``national interests,'' a reference to Greece's longstanding
disputes with Turkey.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said last week that he
believed the negotiations would be ``resolved satisfactorily.''
   The next round of talks will take place at the end of July,
Kostopoulos said. He didn't specify the date.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government is expected to
give the United States a formal notice in July on closing the bases.
   Such a notice has to be issued five months before the accord
expires. It is not expected to result in closure of the bases.
   Four U.S. military bases have been operating in Greece since the
early 1950s _ two near Athens and two on the southern island of
Crete.

<TEXT>
   Ethel Meglin, a dance teacher who
helped nurture the childhood careers of Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney
and Shirley Temple, has died. She was 98.
   Mrs. Meglin died Tuesday at her home in this seaside community
55 miles southeast of Los Angeles, said her daughter, Marilyn Peitz.
   Mrs. Meglin was president of Ethel Meglin Dance Studios Inc. and
founder of the Meglin Kiddies, a group of child performers who
included Ann Miller, Gwen Verdon, Jane Withers, June Lang and
Rooney. Judy Garland joined the school in 1927 and Shirley Temple
in 1931.
   ``It gave them the talent and the incentive to continue on and
decide whether they wanted to be an actor, actress or dancer. It
gave them an interest in pursuing a career in the theatrical
world,'' said Miss Lang.
   A former dancer with the Ziegfeld Follies in New York, Mrs.
Meglin began teaching after she and her husband, Richard, moved to
California. As her reputation grew, her school became the largest
of its kind, with 52 franchises across the United States.
   The Meglin Kiddies sang on local radio stations and appeared in
several movies, including ``An American in Paris'' with Gene Kelly
and in the early 1950s, on Mrs. Meglin's local television show,
``The Meglin Review.''
   The last Meglin Studio, in Hollywood, closed in 1963 after the
death of Richard Meglin. Mrs. Meglin retired because of illness.
   She is survived by her daughter. A funeral Mass is scheduled
Saturday.

<HEAD>Renowned Guitarist Jesse Ed Davis Found Dead Of Apparent Overdose</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Ed Davis, a guitarist who performed
with such superstars as John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and
Willie Nelson, has died of an apparent drug overdose, police said.
He was 43.
   Davis rose to prominence in the 1960s playing lead guitar in Taj
Mahal's blues band, had a widely varied career as a session
guitarist and took part in George Harrison's landmark 1971
fund-raising ``Concert for Bangladesh.''
   His body was found Wedneday in the laundry room of an apartment
building in the beach community of Venice, with a fresh needle mark
on one arm and burned matches and tin foil scattered nearby, police
said.
   ``It appears to be a drug overdose. There was no trauma on his
body,'' Detective David Straky said. ``But the case is still open.
It could turn out down the road to be a homicide.''
   Davis, a Kiowa Indian from Oklahoma, played sessions for artists
representing a variety of styles, performing on everything from The
Monkees' ``Last Train to Clarksville'' to Jackson Browne's ``Doctor
My Eyes,'' said his publicist, Lani Lou Shumate.
   He recorded three albums of his own in the early 1970s, in which
his backup musicians included rock stars Clapton and Leon Russell.
   In 1985, he formed the Grafitti Man Band with Indian poet and
civil rights activist John Trudell. Davis put music to Trudell's
poetic images for ``aka Grafitti Man,'' which Dylan called the best
album of 1986.
   The musician fought alcohol and drug addiction most of his life.
   ``I've got a real reputation as a lunatic, a madman,'' he once
said. ``There was always that suspicion lurking in people's minds:
`Will he show up? Will he show up drunk, or will he not bother to
come at all?'''
   Davis is survived by his wife, Kelly Brady Davis. Ms. Shumate
said friends hope to raise money to have his body sent to Oklahoma
for an Indian burial ceremony.

   Some people are claiming the radio code name,
``Pontiac,'' that the Secret Service uses for Democrat Jesse
Jackson has racial overtones, but a Secret Service spokesman said
Friday that Jackson does not think it's racist.
   The Secret Service gave Jackson the code name when the agency
began protecting him as a presidential candidate last fall. Secret
Service agents use the code names in their radio transmissions as
they track the movements of the candidates.
   Jackson aides tried to trace why Jackson had been assigned that
name after learning that folklore expert Alan Dundes had said
``Pontiac'' is a slur _ the punch line to a series of racist jokes
collected by his students at the University of California,
Berkeley, said Jackson's national political director, Frank Watkins.
   Pontiac, usually associated with a car and a city in Michigan,
is also an acronym for ``Poor old nigger thinks it's a Cadillac,''
Dundes told The Philadelphia Inquirer, which alerted the campaign
and the Secret Service to the allegation.
   The campaign uncovered no proof of racial motivation in the
assigning of Jackson's code name, but Watkins stated:
   ``Given this administration's civil rights record and what we've
heard ... as to the mentality they have toward black people,
absolutely nothing would surprise me.''
   However, Secret Service spokesman Bob Snow that when the service
was first questioned about the matter by a reporter a few weeks
ago, the agents immediately went to Jackson and asked him if he
considered the name racist and if he wanted a new one.
   ``We asked him if he had a problem with it and he said
absolutely not,'' Snow said.
   Watkins concurred that neither he nor Jackson knew of Pontiac in
a racial context but said Jackson asked his staff to look into the
matter. Some blacks Watkins subsequently talked to recalled it as a
racial slur from their childhood.
   The name originated on a list of dozens of names provided to the
Secret Service by the White House Communications Agency, a branch
of the military assigned to serve the White House and Secret
Service, according to Snow.
   Snow said the service chooses code names from the random list
for their utilitarian attributes, though sometimes the codes appear
to fit characteristics of the candidates or government officials.
   President Reagan has a cowboy-style code, ``Rawhide'';
``Deacon'' is used for Jimmy Carter, a born-again Christian; and
Jackson's 1984 code name was ``Thunder,'' which appeared to reflect
his thunderous oratory.
   Snow said when people in the agency's communications division
were questioned about Pontiac, ``they didn't know what we were
talking about.''
   ``They said that was the name we selected because that was the
name we picked.''
   Snow said the service generally tries to give all candidates in
a given year code names beginning with the same letter, such as
Gov. Michael Dukakis' code name, ``Peso.''
   He noted some people think that name was chosen because Dukakis
is short and speaks Spanish.
   ``I'm sure nobody in our communications department knew that Mr.
Dukakis speaks Spanish,'' he said.
   However, he acknowledged that when the service narrows down the
names to fit its needs _ such as not having similar sounding names
that will get confused on radio airwaves _ there are still many to
choose from and he could not ``put myself inside somebody's mind''
who actually made the selection.
   He said the matter was brought up at a Secret Service staff
meeting and no one related Pontiac to a racial slur.
   Dundes said the meaning of Jackson's code name was obvious to
him when he discovered Jackson's code name by reading a news
magazine article.
   Dundes said there are five or six versions of the Pontiac joke,
which has been around for about 10 years. The most basic one, he
said, involves the riddle of why a black man buys a Pontiac instead
of a Cadillac.
   Dundes said his students and field researchers had collected
many examples of the Pontiac joke.

<HEAD>Food Supply in 15 African Nations Threatened By Locust Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IGOR UBOLDI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swarms of locusts migrating from northwest Africa
will threaten harvests in 15 African nations and it will require
about $300 million in aid to make up for damaged crops, U.N.
officials said Friday.
   ``There is actually little hope of being able to contain the
plague in the near future,'' the director-general of the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization, Edouard Saouma, said in a statement.
   Saouma said the invasion was ``of unprecedented dimensions'' and
will move through the sub-Sahara region to ``affect the food
security of 15 African countries, from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Red Sea.''
   Dr. Lukas Brader, head of the Emergency Center for Locust
Operations at FAO, said the insects moved south in April and May,
earlier than expected, because plentiful rains there resulted in
favorable breeding and living conditions.
   He said the situation will worsen during the next few weeks as
new swarms arrive, coinciding with the harvest in the Sahel, the
area that extends from Senegal to the Sudan and separates the arid
Sahara from tropical West Africa.
   Brader said countries in this region face a potential loss of 1
million tons of grains. About $300 million worth of food aid would
be required to make up for the destroyed crops, he said.
   U.N. experts have said a swarm covering just half a square mile
can contain 50 million insects, weigh 100 tons and eat its weight
in vegetation each day.
   Brader said that Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, which were first
infested with the locusts, had succeeded in keeping the insects
south of the Atlas mountains, in relatively uncultivated areas.
   He added that since Jan. 1, 12.3 million acres in those
countries and Mauritania have been treated with pesticides.
   In the Sahel, locust control is more difficult because the
insects are more dispersed.
   Saouma said in his statement that locust swarms were sighted in
Sudan this week and that ``it must now be feared the plague will
extend to the Red Sea, where it may invade the Arabian peninsula
and the horn of Africa.''
   If unchecked, the swarms eventually could reach Israel and
Turkey as well as the Indian subcontinent.
   Authorities try to control locusts mainly by spraying pesticides.
   The fight has cost $45 million so far this year, and the
organization estimates a total of $150 million may be needed for
the year.
   The last major invasion of locusts in Africa began in 1950 and
lasted for 13 years.

<HEAD>Veterans Protest At State Department; Request For Meeting Refused</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of veterans trying to take food and
medicine to Nicaragua protested Friday at the State Department, but
officials refused to meet with them over an order barring their
battered convoy of trucks and buses from leaving the country.
   Police blocked the circular drive in front of the State
Department after several trucks and vans plastered with slogans and
bumper stickers such as ``Children need rainbows, not Rambos,''
rolled past the diplomatic entrance.
   More than a dozen officers were called to keep the chanting
members of the Veterans Peace Convoy away from the doors of the
building.
   ``When veterans decide to wage peace, they can't handle it. If
we were carrying bombs or weapons for the Contras, the would have
let us right on in,'' said Hal Muskat of San Francisco.
   ``If we were working for (former presidential aide) Ollie North,
we would have walked right across. But if we're bringing food and
medicine to children and trucks to transport it across that
country, they don't want to hear from us.''
   State Department officials told one member of the group who was
allowed inside, Stephen Somerstein of New York, that the convoy
should take its case instead to the Justice Department.
   ``There's no justice there,'' shouted one member of the group of
veterans, most of them from the Vietnam War. ``They should change
it to the criminal department.''
   State Department spokeswoman Ellen Bork said officials refused
to talk to the group because the matter is in litigation.
   The veterans filed a federal lawsuit in Laredo, Texas,
contesting a U.S. Customs order barring them from leaving the
country at Laredo unless they posted bond and signed an agreement
to return the aging fleet of 38 school buses and pickup trucks to
the United States.
   Customs seized four of the convoy's vehicles in Laredo and
another four had mechanical problems and didn't make the long trip
from the border to Washington. The convoy arrived Thursday and its
remaining 30 vehicles circled the White House in protest for a
couple of hours while the veterans rallied across the street.
   The administration contends that to let the vehicles remain in
Nicaragua would violate a trade embargo.
   Convoy spokesmen said they wanted to meet with Elliot Abrams,
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, because
they believe he played a major role in keeping the convoy from
leaving the United States.
   Members of the convoy said they would try to meet with other
administration officials in Washington next week.
   The convoy began in four cities _ Seattle, Missoula, Mont.;
Minneapolis and Caribou, Maine, and the four groups traveled
through 100 cities in 42 states before joining up in Austin,
arriving in Laredo on June 7.
   The 30 tons of aid carried by the group includes oats and dry
milk, medicine and medical supplies such as crutches and
wheelchairs, and clothing.
   An additional 140 tons of humanitarian aid collected by the
group was shipped to Nicaragua, members of the convoy said.

<HEAD>Analysis So Far Indicates Shuttle Motor Test Successful</HEAD>

   Morton Thiokol engineers have yet to
take apart a redesigned space shuttle rocket motor test-fired last
week, but early analysis indicates it performed as expected, a
spokesman said Friday.
   The June 14 test was the fourth of five required to qualify the
redesigned booster for resumption of space shuttle flights grounded
after the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   The fifth test is scheduled late July at rocket manufacturer
Morton Thiokol's plant west of here, and the shuttle Discovery is
tentatively scheduled to fly late in the summer.
   Officials of Morton Thiokol and the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration pronounced the test successful at the time,
but said a thorough examination was necessary.
   The 126-foot-long motor's joints have been inspected inside and
out and there was no evidence of damage from superhot gases, said
company spokesman Rocky Raab.
   ``None of the joints leaked, and the inside of the motor looks
very good,'' he said.
   The Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, was blamed on a
booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to burn through
an O-ring, triggering the blast that killed the seven crew members.
   Raab said engineers had spent several days calibrating the
hundreds of channels of instrumentation involved in the test-firing
to make sure the readings were accurate.
   He said the engineers were examining computer results and likely
would begin taking the motor apart next week.

   Vice President George Bush, citing Michael Dukakis' support for
$115 million in state tax increases, said Friday the difference
between him and the Democratic governor was ``tax cuts versus tax
hikes.'' Dukakis said New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley has taken
himself out of consideration for the vice presidential nomination.
   ``I respect that,'' Dukakis told reporters as he began a brief
vacation.
   Jesse Jackson dismissed a published report he had told aides
that he would not accept the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket.
   ``Whoever was talking was not authorized, but also was not
dealing in the truth,'' said Jackson.
   The former civil rights leader said Thursday he had decided
whether or not to accept the vice presidential nomination, but he
refused to disclose his decision. The Boston Globe reported Friday
that Jackson had told aides he wasn't interested in the vice
presidency.
   Jackson denied the report during a visit to Puerto Rico where he
picked up six of the state's 57 Democratic convention delegates.
Previously, the entire delegation had been committed to support
Dukakis at the July Democratic National Convention.
   Talking to reporters at a Republican unity meeting in
Cincinnati, Bush cited Dukakis' announcement on Thursday that he
supports a $115 million tax package that included a $40 million
levy on ciagrettes as part of an effort to deal with a $200 million
state budget shortfall.
   ``I will not raise your taxes, period,'' said the vice
president. ``He just has in his home state.''
   Bush added that ``I'm just pointing out a fundamental difference
that I have on the federal level in terms of what the governor
himself has said. It makes me wonder what his commitment is.''
   Bush told reporters that their views on taxes was a ``plain as
day'' difference between himself and Dukakis. He said that
difference was ``tax cuts versus tax hikes.''
   The Massachusetts tax increases offered a welcome target to
Republicans eager to knock down the lead Dukakis has enjoyed in
recent national polls.
   GOP Senate Leader Bob Dole of Kansas was scheuled to address a
party meeting in Ohio on Saturday and his office released the
following excerpt:
   ``George Bush has made it clear that he will not raise taxes,
period. And what about Mike Dukakis? Ask the people of
Massachusetts. Yesterday, they got some more bad news from their
governor _ he's at it again. He just announced $110 million in new
taxes for the people of Tax-achusetts.''
   The revenue shortfall in Massachusetts is common to other states
as well and is a result in part of the changes in federal tax laws
enacted in 1986.
   Bush was asked why he was not equally critical of Republican
ally Gov. James Thompson of Illinois, who has also proposed a tax
increase to help balance his state budget.
   ``Dukakis is running for president of the United States. Jim
Thompson is not,'' said Bush.
   The vice president also said he was confident he would overcome
the so-called gender gap, the indication in polls that women voters
support Dukakis by a far higher percentage than do men.
   ``I am confident we can overcome this gender gap,'' said Bush.
``I want to be sure I'm as sensitive as possible to the concerns of
these activist women in our party. I think we've got a good message
for women.''
   Dukakis said Bradley had told the campaign he wasn't interested
in the vice presidency.
   ``In any event, we're going to keep in touch,'' said the
Massachusetts governor, who was vacationing on Nantucket, an island
off the coast of Massachusetts.
   At his side was his wife, Kitty, who underwent spinal surgery
three weeks ago.
   ``Want to see my scar?'' she said, removing the neck brace she
has worn since the operation.
   Meanwhile, Democratic Party platform writers worked in Colorado
on what was shaping up as the shortest party platform in half a
century, a document calling for restoration of ``competence and
hope'' and avoiding talk of higher taxes, a Pentagon spending
freeze or a Palestinian homeland.
   Those three issues could be the subject of convention fights
between supporters of Dukakis and Jackson, though Jackson partisan
Eleanor Holmes Norton said ``I'm not expecting any battles. We're
trying to work out things that could cause great difficulties.''
   In other political news:
   _The latest figures from the Federal Election Commission show a
continuing slump in Republican fund-raising, although the GOP still
leads the Democrats.
   The FEC summary of 15-month totals through March 31 showed
Republican committees had raised $97 million, compared to $127
million at the same point in 1986, $137 million in 1984 and $116
million in 1982. The Democrats have raised a total of $29 million
in this cycle, compared to $24 million in 1986, $37 million in
1984, and $13 million in 1982.
   _Sen. John Glenn of Ohio got a boost as Democratic vice
presidential nominee from Republican Party chairman Frank J.
Fahrenkopf Jr. At the Cincinnati GOP meeting, Fahrenkopf said
Glenn's presence on the Democratic ticket would make the GOP's job
more difficult in November.
   ``He is a national hero,'' the GOP chairman said of Glenn, the
former astronaut who was the first American to orbit Earth.
``People take a lot of pride in that and it can transcend party
affiliations.''

   A firm established by a central figure in the
Pentagon bribery and fraud probe paid up to $50,000 in 1986 to the
wife of the Navy's then-procurement chief, Melvyn Paisley,
according to federal and state records.
   Vicki Paisley received the money from VAMO Inc., a Virginia firm
incorporated in January 1986 by William Galvin, a consultant to
defense contractors who was a member of VAMO's board of directors.
   Paisley, who was an assistant secretary of the Navy in 1986, is
a defense consultant with a Washington office located in the same
building as Galvin's office.
   The FBI searched both offices last week as part of a two-year
investigation of whether defense contractors and consultants, many
of them former military men, bribed Pentagon officials for
contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts worth
billions of dollars.
   Vicki Paisley is now listed as VAMO's president and registered
agent. Her attorney, Robert Plotkin, said VAMO is a ``computer-type
business'' that helps companies set up management plans. He said
Mrs. Paisley would have no comment on her relationship with Galvin.
   Galvin represents a number of firms whose offices were searched
in the Pentagon probe, including United Technologies, Unisys Corp.,
Loral Corp. and Cubic Corp. He also is on the board of another firm
whose offices were searched, Armtec Inc. of Palatka, Fla.
   William Nussbaum, Galvin's lawyer, said he would have no comment
on matters pertaining to his client.
   Information on the payment Vicki Paisley _ listed as a range of
$15,000 to $50,000 in ``compensation for services'' _ is contained
on her husband's financial disclosure form filed with the Office of
Government Ethics covering the year 1986. Paisley left government
service on March 31, 1987.
   Galvin's connection with VAMO is contained in state corporation
records in Richmond, Va. The Los Angeles Times reported on the
Galvin-VAMO tie in Friday editions.
   State corporation records also reveal a close relationship
between Galvin and another consultant who is involved in the probe,
Charles F. Gardner.
   On Jan. 30, 1986, two days after VAMO was incorporated, Galvin
formed Sapphire Systems Inc. and opened its offices three floors
above those of VAMO in the same building in Vienna, Va., according
to state records.
   Among his partners in that company, according to state records
on file in Richmond, Va., is Gardner of Malverne, N.Y., another
defense consultant served with a search warrant last week in the
Pentagon bribery probe.
   Gardner is a former Unisys Corp. vice president and his files
were searched last week by the FBI.
   Paisley was the assistant secretary of the Navy for research,
engineering and systems, a key acquisition post under former Navy
Secretary John Lehman Jr., until he left the government last year
and became a consultant to defense aerospace companies, including
United Technologies and McDonnell-Douglas.
   A United Technologies unit, Pratt & Whitney, hired Paisley
within a week of his departure from government and also hired
Galvin.
   A search warrant in the Pentagon probe for United Technologies'
Washington offices alleged that Pratt & Whitney possessed sensitive
documents that rival General Electric Co. had submitted to the
Pentagon in competing for engine-building contracts worth hundreds
of millions of dollars.
   Paisley's consulting office was bugged and phone there
wiretapped in the probe, according to sources familiar with the
investigation. In addition, his office and home were searched by
FBI agents last week.

   The leadership's nominee for president
is not a Communist Party member for the first time since the party
took power in 1948, informed sources said Friday.
   A communique Friday from the party Central Committee did not say
Bruno F. Straub is not a party member but the sources confirmed it
on condition their names not be revealed.
   The Central Committee named Straub, 74, a biochemist and member
of Parliament, on Thursday to replace Karoly Nemeth, 67. Its
decision adds to the radical change under way in Hungary, whose
leaders say they want to reform political and economic life.
   Nemeth, officially on sick leave from the ceremonial post since
June 1, was dropped May 22 from the Politburo and the Central
Committee.
   Straub will leave his post as chairman of the parliamentary
committee on regional development and environmental protection,
said the committee statement, carried by the official news agency
MTI. It also announced new ministers of culture and justice, a new
Parliament speaker and other new officials.
   Parliament is to meet next week to approve the changes.
   Politburo member Janos Berecz called Straub, who specializes in
enzyme research and is a member of the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences, ``an outstanding intellectual.''
   Berecz also said the Central Committee proposed that Imre
Pozsgay, a leading reform advocate, be reassigned as a minister
without portfolio.
   Bela Koepeczi, the veteran culture minister, is to retire and be
replaced by Tibor Czere, a professor at the University of Heavy
Industry of Miskolc, an industrial town in northern Hungary.
   Justice Minister Imre Markoja, 57, will be replaced by Kalman
Kulcsar, deputy secretary-general of the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences.
   Istvan Staudinger, a Budapest city official, is to become the
speaker of Parliament, taking over from Istvan Sarlos, 67.
   Sandor Gaspar, who has been dropped from the Politburo and
ousted as trade union boss, will lose the vice presidency, his last
public post. Sarlos will get the job.
   Karoly Grosz, premier and Communist Party chief, will visit
Moscow in July, the Soviet news agency Tass reported. Grosz, 57,
replaced Janos Kadar as party leader May 22 at the end of a
three-day party conference in Budapest.

   Guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's communist
government fired rockets into Kabul on Friday, wounding people,
destroying buildings and starting a large fire at the airport, the
official news agency Tass reported.
   It did not say how many people were wounded in the Afghan
capital or whether any were killed. The dispatch said firefighters
took two hours to put out the airport blaze, but did not say
whether aircraft were damaged or destroyed.
   Afghan soldiers were on alert, taking ``special measures to
eliminate the forces that fired at Kabul,'' the agency said.
   Life in Kabul was normal despite clouds of smoke over the
airfield, Tass said, reporting that downtown streets were crowded
and trade was brisk at the public market.
   The Red Army is withdrawing its estimated 115,000 soldiers from
Afghanistan under an agreement signed April 14 in Geneva, but the
Moslem insurgents were not a party to the pact and have continued
fighting.
   Guerrilla war began after a communist coup in April 1978 and
Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979. The
Soviet withdrawal began May 15 and is to be completed in nine
months.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Approves $10.6 Billion Transportation Measure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a
bill Friday providing $10.6 billion for the government's
transportation programs, despite a veto threat from the Reagan
administration.
   The measure for fiscal 1989, sent to the full Senate on a voice
vote, would also allow spending of up to an additional $14.4
billion from the revenues the government collects each year for
aviation, highway and mass transit programs. The fiscal year begins
Oct. 1.
   Under the legislation, the government would spend $6.6 billion
for the Federal Aviation Administration, an increase of $800
million over this year. Spending for the Coast Guard would grow
$350 million to $3 billion, of which $492 million would be set
aside for drug interdiction work.
   In a continuation of a perennial dispute between the
administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress, the
committee ignored a White House request to slash spending for mass
transit and eliminate federal aid to Amtrak, the passenger railroad.
   Instead, the committee would provide $581 million for Amtrak and
$3.2 billion for mass transit.
   James C. Miller III, director of the president's Office of
Management and Budget, sent letters Thursday to committee members,
saying he would urge President Reagan to veto the legislation.
   Miller complained that the measure would allow $2.3 billion in
spending more than the president wants. He also objected to the
mass transit and Amtrak spending, and the inclusion of about $25
million for local highway projects lawmakers had tucked into the
bill.
   The legislators accepted an amendment on voice vote by Sen.
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., aimed at blocking Logan International
Airport in Boston from imposing higher landing fees on small
aircraft.
   In an effort to reduce congestion for airline passengers by
encouraging private planes to use suburban airfields, Logan
officials have scheduled the higher fees to take effect July 1.
   Rudman's provision would halt federal aid to the airport unless
officials agreed to hold off the increases until the Department of
Transportation completes an inquiry on the pricing structure, and
until lawsuits seeking to block the higher costs are settled.
   The House is scheduled to vote next week on a $10.9 billion
version of the spending bill.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Hears Case Of Williamsburg Editor</HEAD>

   A grand jury has heard the case of a
newspaper editor accused of criminally libeling two state
legislators in an editorial, but announced no decision.
   Williamsburg County Court officials said a decision about the
charges against editor Jim Fitts will be announced when the next
session of court begins Monday, which is the usual procedure.
   State Rep. B.J. Gordon and an attorney for fellow plaintiff
state Sen. Frank McGill, who is recovering from cancer treatment,
would not comment on their 30-minute appearance before the grand
jury Thursday.
   Gordon did, however, disagree with civil libertarians who have
said the state's criminal libel law is outdated: ``If it's
outdated, then the Ten Commandments are outdated.''
   The case has drawn interest because criminal libel laws _ which
can send journalists to jail _ are unusual in the United States.
Critics say they can be used to stifle free-flowing political
debate.
   The charge carries a penalty of up to $5,000 in fines or a year
in jail or both.
   Only four times in 40 years has the law has been used in South
Carolina. Similar laws exist but are rarely used in 23 other states
and the District of Columbia, said Jane Kirtley, executive director
of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in Washington,
D.C.
   ``I think that criminal libel laws are a relic of the past,''
Ms. Kirtley said. ``It seems to me that punishing people for
speaking is not an American concept.''
   Fitts was arrested and jailed May 20 on the charge of criminal
libel after he wrote a column critical of Gordon, McGill and their
re-election bids in the June 14 primaries, which both men won.
   In his column in the May 17 issue of The Voice, a black-oriented
newspaper with a circulation of about 2,300, Fitts wrote in part:
``I will say to you without fear of contradiction, if every black
in Williamsburg County would start stealing today and steal every
day for the rest of their lives, they could not steal as much as
those two have stolen during their time in power.''
   Fitts would not be specific Thursday when asked what he thought
the two men had stolen, other than to say he thought they had
stolen the pride of people in Williamsburg County.
   And he said the issue was economic, not racial. Fitts and Gordon
are black. McGill is white.
   Neither Gordon nor McGill's attorney, Kingstree lawyer Wallace
Connor, would say whether would consider settling out of court.
   Both said the law was necessary because civil suits are often
uncollectable because of the defendant's inability to pay. And as
long as the law is on the books, it should be obeyed, they said.
   Fitts said McGill and Gordon represent the haves in the county
who oppress the have-nots.
   ``It's not a racial issue,'' he said. ``I'm just challenging a
sytem that has been programmed for years to control the people.''
   Gordon's response was to note that he's been elected to office
for nine consecutive terms.
   Fitts' bond initially was set at $40,000. After two days in
jail, he was released May 22 on a personal recognizance bond.
   Gordon said Thursday his intent was not to silence the press,
but to make sure the law was obeyed.
   ``Freedom of the press is not to go around with freedom and
accuse people of commiting crimes,'' he said. ``That is not freedom
of the press.''
   Despite the pending charges, Fitts continued speaking out
Thursday, and said McGill and Gordon intended to quiet his
outspokenness.
   ``I think the intent was to silence me,'' Fitts said, but he
added that the effort is unsuccessful. ``I can't stop telling the
truth.''
   Gordon said he was secure in the decision to press charges.
   ``Have I done the right thing? It's not what I did,'' Gordon
said. ``My conscience is clear.''

<HEAD>Soviet Union Demands Property In Jerusalem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union claims an Israeli hotel built
an access road on Soviet-owned property in downtown Jerusalem and
is suing it for tresspassing, an attorney said Friday.
   It was the first property suit brought by a Soviet consular
delegation that arrived in Israel last summer after a 20 years of
minimal contact between the two countries. The Soviet Union broke
diplomatic relations during the 1967 Middle East war.
   Israeli officials say they are willing to negotiate the Soviet
claims and hope the talks will not disrupt what they see as a thaw
in Soviet-Israeli relations.
   The disputed property is a parking lot near the Tirat Bat Sheva
Hotel on King George Street, said Yacov Miron, an Israeli attorney
for the Soviet delegation.
   ``The area is registered as a Soviet government property and we
demand it back,'' Miron told The Associated Press.
   Most of the Soviet property in Israel was bought in the 19th
century by the Russian Orthodox Church or by government-affiliated
bodies of imperial Russia.
   Last July, the Soviet Union sent the eight-member consular team
to Israel to examine property holdings and renew passports for the
estimated 2,500 Soviet passport holders here.
   Israel has demanded a reciprocal visit by an Israeli delegation
to Moscow. Earlier this month, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze said the Israeli delegation would receive visas in
July.
   Two weeks ago, Soviet delegation head Georgy Martirosov informed
Israel's Foreign Ministry it had completed a survey of Soviet
property being used by Israel.
   The ministry said the Soviets were expected to present demands
for rental payments.
   Miron said the parking lot was registered in the name of the
Soviet government in 1949 after Israel was created.
   ``The area was first seized by the Jerusalem municipality, which
turned it into a municipal parking lot,'' he said. ``Then the hotel
made a access road through it.''
   According to the Israeli news agency Itim, the hotel is using
some 200 square yards of the area. Hotel officials refused comment.
   Miron said the complaint followed letters sent to the hotel and
the Jerusalem municipality which demanded evacuation of the area.
He said the municipality had not responded.
   In the complaint, which was filed Thursday, the Soviets demand
the parking lot be evacuated.
   Miron said other property claims may follow but did not
elaborate. He declined to say what the Soviets intended to do if
they got the area back.
   ``They just want it back,'' he said.

<HEAD>Democrats Making Fund-Raising Comeback, While GOP Fortunes Slump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fortunes of the Republican Party have been
in a slump while the Democrats, still lagging far behind in overall
dollars, inch their way up the fund-raising laddder, Federal
Election Commission figures showed Friday.
   The FEC summary of 15-month totals for this election cycle
through March 31 showed the three national-level Republican
committees had raised $97 million, compared with $127 million at
the same point in 1986, $137 million in 1984 and $116 million in
1982.
   The Democrats, meanwhile, have raised a total of $29 million in
this cycle, compared with $24 million in 1986, $37 million in 1984
and $13 million in 1982. The figures are based on committee reports
to the FEC and do not include so-called soft money that the parties
raise for non-federal campaign spending.
   Kathryn Murray, communications director of the Republican
National Committee, acknowledged Friday that the RNC hit a rough
stretch in 1987. But she said the committee already has turned the
corner to move back into bonanza fund-raising days _ although not
on a par with the 1984 election cycle when President Reagan ran for
re-election.
   ``We're sure (Democratic National Committee Chairman) Paul Kirk
would change checkbooks with us any day,'' she said, adding that
she expects the second quarter of this year to come it at over $10
million.
   While still not as strong as the $15 million during the same
period in 1984, that will top any other RNC second quarter, she
said.
   When broken down by committee, the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
both have shown steady growth over the years, while their
Republican counterparts have lagged.
   The reason the overall Democratic total is lower in this cycle
than in the 1984 presidential year is due to the drop in receipts
to the Democratic National Committee between 1984 and 1986.
   In 1984, the DNC had collected $26 million in the first 15
months of the cycle. In 1986 receipts dropped to less than $11
million at the same point, and this year are back up to nearly $13
million, the FEC report shows.
   The Democrats now are carrying a total debt of $3.7 million
compared with less than $1 million for the GOP.
   DNC spokesman Mike McCurry said the Democrats are pleased with
their progress this year, even the FEC numbers show the 15-month
DNC receipts are only half what they were in 1984.
   ``The party going into this general election cycle is in a
strong financial position, rather than trying to play catch up,''
as in past years, he said.
   The RNC's Murray said GOP hopes have been stirred by the fact
that the first quarter of 1988 brought in $12.6 million, almost as
good as the $13 million in 1986. The $17 million raised during the
same period of 1984 was an aberration that showed Reagan's
extraordinary popularity, she said.
   Generally, the RNC and DNC have their biggest fund-raising
successes in presidential years, while the senatorial and
congressional committees are active in the off-year congressional
races.
   In total contributions and support of congressional candidates,
the Democratic committees spent $1.2 million as of March 31,
compared with $744,186 spent by the Republicans.
   The disparity was most notable in the war for the U.S. Senate
where the Democrats have considerably fewer resources but spent
more in support of their candidates than the Republicans.
   For campaign costs paid directly by a national committee rather
than by a candidate's own campaign, the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee spent $420,173 on its candidates as of March 31,
compared with $2,814 spent by its GOP counterpart, the FEC data
showed.
   Tom Mason, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, acknowledged serious fund-raising problems over the past
several months, and said the committee's ill fortunes were not a
surprise.
   After the 1986 elections, when the Republicans gave up control
of the Senate by losing nine seats, enthusiasm among GOP
contributors waned, he said.
   He said the presidential campaign also has drained away
potential donors to Senate races.
   Mason tried to put a good face on the financial picture,
however, saying that while gross intake is down, the net money
available to help candidates has improved in recent years because
the NRSC has ``taken a sharper pencil to the cost of fund-raising.''

<HEAD>Warner Vows To Push For Plan To Offset Impact Of Shopping Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., to close
roads through the Manassas National Battlefield Park was killed by
a Senate panel Friday, but Warner vowed to revive the plan in talks
with House members.
   ``I'm going to do my best to try and go forward with planning
roads,'' Warner said after the Senate Appropriations Committee
rejected his request for $2.8 million to study ways to cut off two
heavily traveled roads that run through the historic Civil War
battlefield.
   Warner's compromise plan, which is similar to a previous
Interior Department proposal, is part of a federal effort to reduce
the impact of a proposed 1.2 million square foot shopping center on
the nearby national park.
   Warner does not oppose the commercial complex, but believes that
closing roads within the park would lessen the development's impact
on the battleground.
   Historians and preservationists argue that the complex, which
also would include 1.7 million square feet of office space and 560
homes, would forever violate the sanctity of the still-rustic
battlefield.
   Three measures now under consideration in the House would either
authorize the federal government to purchase the land or scuttle
the shopping center plan by preventing federal highway money from
being used for roads to and from the development.
   Before Warner's plan can again be considered, an amendment that
would prevent federal money from being used for highway
construction associated with the development must be dropped from a
House appropriations bill.
   Congressional rules stipulate that if that amendment, offered by
Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., Warner's amendment could then be
reconsidered in future talks between House and Senate conferees.
   Mrazek is not likely to drop his amendment, at least until the
outcome of the land-purchase bills is clear, said Tad Boggs, a
spokesman for the congressman.
   Plans to purchase the property offered by Rep. Frank Wolf,
R-Va., and a similar measure by Mrazek and Rep. Michael Andrews,
D-Texas, would also close two roads running through the park and
build new roads around it.
   Buying the 542-acre development site and adding it to the
4,600-acre battlefield park is not an option, at least in the
Senate, Warner said.
   The mall site is currently valued at $13.5 million, but the
ultimate selling price would likely be three times higher _ a
figure approaching the federal government's annual appropriation
for park purchases.

   If President Jose Napoleon
Duarte's health permits, he and four other Central American
presidents will meet here for the anniversary of the regional peace
plan, the government said Friday.
   Foreign Minister Ricardo Acevedo Peralta said President Oscar
Arias of Costa Rica, author of the peace accord, suggested the
two-day August summit be held in San Salvador in deference to
Duarte, who has terminal liver cancer.
   ``We have accepted in principle, depending on the health of
President Duarte,'' Acevedo told a news conference.
   The presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras
and Costa Rica signed the agreement Aug. 7, 1987 in Esquipulas,
Guatemala. It led to a truce in Nicaragua but has not ended civil
wars in El Salvador and Guatemala.
   Duarte has been undergoing treatment since May 31 at Walter Reed
Army Medical Center in Washington. He is to come home in next
month, but to return to the hospital in August.
   Vice President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount said: ``I thanked
President Arias for the gesture and told him we were honored, but
no one knows what the state of President Duarte's health will be.
It is so speculative that I also said an alternative site for the
meeting should be sought.''

<HEAD>Nigeria Sets Up Vigilante Groups To Monitor Toxic Waste</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout, Italy offers to remove waste, Liberia
reports dumping offer. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nigeria has posted vigilante groups
at ports and jetties to prevent foreign ships from dumping toxic
waste in that West African country, its state radio reported.
   In Rome, the Italian government said Friday it has offered to
arrange for removal of a shipload of waste dumped in Nigeria by an
Italian company.
   Liberia's health minister reported receiving three requests from
companies in industrialized nations to dump toxic waste there.
Several West African nations have reported approaches by American
and European companies offering millions of dollars to use them as
dumping grounds.
   Nigeria radio, monitored in Abidjan, said the vigilantes were
posted to protect the population from poisonous and radioactive
wastes.
   It made the report Thursday as U.S. experts tested barrels of
waste that were part of a 2,000-ton load dumped near Koko, a town
150 miles southeast of Lagos, by an Italian firm allegedly acting
for 10 European companies.
   Nigeria has recalled its ambassador to Italy, seized an Italian
ship and ordered its crew to remove the waste.
   The military government also arrested 15 people, including
several Italians, and said anyone found guilty of links to the
dumping risks death by firing squad.
   Bruno Bottai, secretary-general of the Italian Foreign Ministry,
said the offer to arrange the waste's removal was contingent upon
release of the Italian cargo ship Piave and its 24 crew members.
The ministry said it had not received a response to the offer.
   Italian officials said Franco Raffaelli, owner of the shipping
company accused of dumping the material, had agreed to provide a
vessel and crew to pick it up.
   Martha Sandolo Belleh, the Liberian health minister, said she
rejected the three requests to dump toxic waste in her country, the
independent Daily Observer of Monrovia reported.
   It quoted her as saying one company offered to build a hospital
and supply it with drugs worth $1 million. She would not identify
the companies or the countries in which they were located, the
newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson denied Friday that he
told aides he would reject the Democratic vice presidential
nomination, and said he wanted the party platform to discuss
Palestinians and Puerto Ricans.
   Jackson, who said Thursday he had made his decision on the vice
presidency but would keep it private unless Michael Dukakis offers
him the job, was asked about a report quoting unnamed aides as
saying he would turn down the post.
   ``No, absolutely not. Therefore, whoever was talking was not
authorized, but also was not dealing in the truth,'' Jackson said.
   ``The matter of the vice presidency is a serious matter. The
destiny of our nation, perhaps the rest of the world, rests on the
campaign in July and in November. To that extent, there will be no
intrigue about that decision,'' Jackson told reporters.
   He and Dukakis agreed in a California meeting Tuesday that only
the two of them and a top adviser to each _ Ron Brown for Jackson
and Paul Brountas for Dukakis _ would discuss the vice presidential
question.
   Jackson said he will make his decision known at an appropriate
time.
   Jackson breakfasted with his local campaign committee and,
dressed in a white Latin-style shirt and blue jeans, danced to
African-rooted Puerto Rican folk music at a rally for a fisherman's
association in Santurce, a sector of San Juan founded 215 years ago
by freed slaves.
   Before a scheduled speech to the Puerto Rico Chamber of
Commerce, Jackson planned to huddle again with Gov. Rafael
Hernandez Colon and Senate President Miguel Hernandez Agosto. The
governor agreed Thursday to seek support for Jackson from at least
six of the island's 57 delegates.
   Jackson had complained about receiving no delegates despite
winning Puerto Rico's March 20 primary.
   Jackson said it was too early to assess the draft platform being
worked out in Denver. Jackson said he'll continue to push for a
freeze on the defense budget and for increasing taxes on the
wealthy _ two items excluded from the preliminary platform.
   ``Clearly the defense scam ... is evidence we can freeze the
military budget without freezing our defense,'' Jackson said,
saying $60 billion could be saved by 1993 by ``freezing the
corruption and the cost overruns'' and ending single-source
contracts.
   The money for needed social programs, such as expansion of
health care and education, should come from the wealthy, he said.
   ``The people who did not benefit from the Reagan years of
prosperity must not have the burden,'' Jackson said.
   He also said he wanted a platform plank on Palestinians, a
subject that makes some Democrats nervous because they fear it
could alienate loyal Jewish voters.
   ``The language is being addressed now. The concept is very
clear,'' Jackson said. ``We stand for security for Israel with
secure borders ... security for Israel, justice or homeland for
Palestinians, and peace for both. We stand for the principle of
mutual recognition and mutual security.''
   He also said he supports Puerto Rican self-determination. He
said Puerto Ricans should ``choose their own form of government
with no interference and without intimidation.''
   He has indicated he supports a transfer of powers from the
United States prior to a Puerto Rican vote on political status. The
governing party supports commowealth status, established in 1952,
but wants greater local power.
   Some believe ending legal ties to the United States before
voting on status would virtually rule out statehood. Expected
Republican nominee George Bush supports Puerto Rico statehood.
   The 3.2 million Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens who are largely
self-governing but subject to federal laws. They do not vote in
national elections and their delegate to Congress has no vote.

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis supports
the effort of a broad coalition of members of Congress, state
officials and others urging the Supreme Court not to overturn a key
1976 civil rights decision, a spokesman for the Democratic
presidential candidate said Friday.
   The spokesman, Gene Sperling, said, ``The governor's position is
that he wants to congratulate'' those who asked the court to
sustain the ruling.
   Sperling added that the probable Democratic nominee ``is
disappointed that the Justice Department did not join in the
bipartisan effort'' supporting the 1976 decision.
   The attorneys general of 47 states, 60 U.S. senators and 112
House members joined with civil rights groups in asking the
justices to leave undisturbed the 1976 ruling that has been used to
fight racial discrimination.
   The Reagan administration Justice Department is sitting out the
controversy, declining to take sides in the case.
   The court rocked the civil rights commuity last April when it
announced it will consider overturning the 1976 decision that
allows people to sue private citizens accused of racial
discrimination.
   The justices will hear arguments on the issue in their next term
beginning in October. A decision is expected sometime in 1989.

   Five-day-old Jason Ray McClure was
buckled into a car seat and taken home Friday, five days after he
was spirited from his mother's hospital room reportedly in a brown
paper bag.
   Two women charged in his kidnapping appeared handcuffed before a
judge who appointed an attorney and returned them to jail on
$500,000 and $100,000 bonds.
   ``I hope everybody keeps saying prayers for all the missing
children in the world because they need help too,'' said Renee
McClure as she left High Point Regional Hospital with her infant
son.
   Mrs. McClure's baby was taken from her room Monday morning by a
woman dressed in white who said she had to weigh the baby.
   Police found Jason on Wednesday, hidden in a closet in a High
Point house. His hair had been cut to alter his appearance, police
said.
   ``Jason is doing fine,'' Mrs. McClure said, hugging nurses who
helped her load Jason and three carts of flowers and gifts into a
van for the ride home to Lexington.
   Brenda Joyce Nobles, 37, was charged with first-degree
kidnapping and her 19-year-old daughter, Sharon Slaydon, was
charged with aiding and abetting kidnapping. The child was found in
their home, according to police.
   Judge Lawrence C. McSwain set a July 6 court date for the women
Friday and kept bond at $500,000 for Mrs. Nobles and $100,000 for
Ms. Slaydon.
   Meanwhile, the Greensboro News & Record reported Friday that
Mrs. Nobles had shown a neighbor a baby she said she had delivered.
   ``She said the doctor had let her come straight home after
having the baby,'' neighbor Linda Drake told the newspaper. ``I
knew she couldn't have kids, 'cause she told me she had had herself
fixed.''
   Mrs. Nobles had had a hysterectomy, according to Annie Jackson,
her great aunt.
   Ms. Drake notified police about the mysterious baby Tuesday
night because ``I would want somebody to do the same thing if that
was my baby,'' she said.
   The newspaper also reported that an unidentified law enforcement
source said the kidnapper had picked out Jason during visiting
hours the night before she spirited him away in a brown paper bag.
   ``She went over Sunday during visitation hours, looked at
babies, excluded blacks, females, and picked a white male,'' the
newspaper quoted the source as saying.
   The source said the kidnapper returned the next morning, changed
into a nurse's uniform carried in a brown paper bag and then went
to Mrs. McClure's room. She told Mrs. McClure Jason needed to be
weighed, then put him in the bag and carried him from the hospital.
   Authorities said Thursday that the kidnapping was ``almost a
textbook case'' of the emotionally troubled baby-snatcher.
   ``Our theory is ... what the FBI psychologists told us from the
beginning (before the baby was found) _ she had deep-seated
emotional problems, a terribly deep desire that she needed to
fulfill by having a baby,'' police Capt. Ronald McGuire said.

   A district official in North
Rhine-Westphalia has been accused of embezzling $4.7 million to buy
antique cars, toy soldiers and teddy bears, authorities said.
   They said an investigation showed the 37-year-old man, who was
not identified, stole more than eight million marks, or $4.7
million, from district juvenile authority funds to finance
collections of antique toys and classic cars.
   Prosecutors said the man was in custody awaiting trial. They
said police who went to his home found two dozen crates filled with
toys, including porcelain dolls, teddy bears and tin soldiers.
   Authorities said they believed the man also had bought more than
30 classic automobiles.

<HEAD>Kunstler Says Case Is Political Effort to Silence Dissent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   William M. Kuntsler and other lawyers
defending six members of a left-wing group charged with setting off
a bomb in the U.S. Capitol derided the prosecution Friday as a
political effort to silence dissent.
   Prosecutors ``want to teach a lesson to all dissidents ... that
the penalties are very high if you commit crimes against the
government,'' Kuntsler said after he appeared with the defendants
and their lawyers before U.S. District Judge Harold Greene.
   Asked about Greene's reputation as a fair judge, Kuntsler said:
``His actions belie it. He's a product of the system.''
   ``A fair trial is impossible anyway for anyone like them, we can
only do the best we can do,'' said Kuntsler, who represents
defendant Laura Whitehorn.
   Earlier, Kuntsler was asked about Greene's reputation as a
liberal judge, to which he replied: ``To me, a liberal means
neo-fascist.''
   During the hearing, Greene denied a motion to remove a clear,
plastic wall between the spectators and the court that the defense
claims is intended to intimidate the defendants and prejudice
jurors once the case goes to trial.
   ``These women and men were accused by the government to, in
essence, criminalize their political beliefs,'' said defense lawyer
Russell F. Canan.
   By installing the shield and TV cameras, the government ``is
using the courtroom as simply just another tool for political
surveillance,'' Canan said.
   The strident political rhetoric by defense lawyers signaled
their intention to turn the proceeding into a trial of the politics
of the Reagan administration rather than the charges that the
defendants set off bombs in the Capitol and three other locations
in Washington.
   ``We are not terrorists nor criminals; we are anti-imperialist
political prisoners and we are guilty of no crimes,'' said the
statement by defendants Marilyn Buck, Linda Sue Evans, Susan
Rosenberg, Alan Berkman, Timothy Blunk and Whitehorn.
   ``The politically motivated indictment against us is part of a
program of repression against the most active elements in the
Central American solidarity movement that has grown among the
people of the U.S. over the past years,'' the statement said. ``We
will fight these charges but we will not allow ourselves to be part
of a governmental show trial.''
   The six plus fugitive Elizabeth Duke are charged with setting
off a bomb that blew a large hole in a wall outside the U.S. Senate
chamber on Nov. 7, 1983. They also are accused of detonating bombs
at three Washington military facilities in 1983 and 1984.
   Buck, Evans and Whitehorn also are charged with leading a
campaign of ``armed propaganda'' against ``imperialist rule'' by a
secret left-wing group that set off bombs in four locations in New
York City between 1983 and 1985.
   The other defendants are named but not charged as participants
in the alleged conspiracy ``to oppose, obstruct or change the
foreign and domestic policies of the U.S. government through
violent and illegal means.''
   None of the blasts caused any injuries.
   But after the Capitol bombing, a group calling itself the Armed
Resistance Unit issued a communique to National Public Radio
threatening possible future violence against ``individual members
of the ruling class and government.''
   ``We do not choose to kill any of them at this time. But their
lives are not sacred,'' the communique said.
   Rosenberg and Blunk are serving 58-year sentences for possession
of 600 pounds of ammunition and explosives. Evans is serving terms
totaling 45 years for illegal weapons charges.
   Buck, who was not in court Friday, is awaiting sentencing in New
York for murder and armed robbery in connection with a botched 1981
holdup of a Brink's armored car that left a guard and two policemen
dead.

   South Africa and Angola ended a day of
U.S.-mediated peace talks Friday still widely separated, with
neither side indicating it was willing to back down on positions
unacceptable to the other, sources said.
   South Africa is insisting on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from
Angola as a precondition for independence for South-West Africa,
also known as Namibia. Angola is demanding an end to South African
military and logistical aid to Angolan rebels.
   The talks are aimed at bringing peace to Angola, where civil war
has raged for 13 years, and to bring independence to Namibia, which
is controlled by South Africa.
   After a two-hour formal opening session, delegations dispersed
to discuss proposals put forward by South Africa and the joint
Angolan-Cuban group, sources close to the conference said.
   Further formal talks were scheduled for Saturday morning, the
second and final day of this third round of negotiations that began
in London last month.
   ``The talks went pretty roughly,'' a Cuban source said.
   Reports in the South African press said South Africa's foreign
minister, R.F. Botha, angrily led his delegation out of the
conference hall. South African, Cuban, Angolan and American
delegates denied it.
   The talks are taking place at three tables, with Chester
Crocker, assistant U.S. secretary of state for African affairs,
sitting at the head table as mediator.
   Delegates refused to talk officially on the substance of
proposals presented Friday, confirming only that the formal talks
would resume Saturday.
   But sources close to the conference, who insisted on anonymity,
said Botha insisted that, as a precondition for Namibian
independence, Cuba announce a date by which it would withdraw its
more than 50,000 troops from Angola.
   The sources said the Angolan delegation, headed by Foreign
Minister Afonso Van Dunem, demanded that South Africa halt its aid
to Angolan rebels.
   The sources also said that should a fourth round of talks be
needed, Angola and Cuba would insist that they be held in New York.
   The first two rounds of talks were in May in London and
Brazzaville, Congo.
   In New York on Friday, a senior Angolan official, Pedro
Van-Dunem, minister of state for petroleum and economy, asserted
that the United States had introduced a new ``double linkage'' in
its negotiating position.
   He told reporters that in a meeting Wednesday with Angolan
representatives, Secretary of State George P. Shultz not only
reiterated a U.S. call for a Cuban withdrawal from Angola, but also
pressed the Angolans to negotiate with the Angolan rebel group, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA,
which has U.S. support.
   Van-Dunem said such negotiations are ``out of the question.''
   Asked about Van-Dunem's statement, a State Department official
in Washington said it has long been the U.S. view that direct
discussions between the Angolan government and the UNITA forces are
needed for a settlement.
   ``It's not a condition that we are laying down. It's just a
fact, given the reality of the situation on the ground,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Massachusetts AG Says Dukakis Was Victim of Reagan Administration
Leak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic attorney general of Massachusetts
said Friday he believes that reports of an FBI probe of a state
prison project were probably a ``leak from the Reagan
administration,'' whose own top legal officer blasted leaks and
warned associates to keep quiet.
   State Attorney General James Shannon said he believes the FBI
investigation was leaked ``for political purposes.'' In Washington,
the reporter who first revealed the FBI probe said Shannon was
wrong.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, meanwhile, addressed the issue
of news leaks involving Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis at a Friday meeting of top Justice Department managers.
Spokesman Patrick Korten said Meese reminded his deputies there is
to be no ``leaking of information'' about any current
investigations.
   Meese described any leaking as ``highly unprofessional conduct
and extremely injurious and extremely unfair,'' according to Korten.
   On Thursday, the Washington Times cited ``law enforcement
authorities and others'' and said the FBI was conducting a
preliminary inquiry into ``the conduct'' of Dukakis and
high-ranking members of his administration in connection with the
1986 selection of a multi-million prison site in central
Massachusetts.
   The FBI confirmed the probe but said Dukakis was not a
``subject'' of the investigation.
   ``I don't know who did it,'' Shannon told reporters at a news
conference on civil rights. ``But when you see what is clearly a
leak from federal law enforcement authorities ... there are clearly
conclusions you're likely to jump to _ that it was a leak from the
Reagan administration.''
   Shannon supports Dukakis' campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination but holds office independently of the
governor and is not part of the Dukakis administration.
   Jerry Seper, who wrote the piece, said of Shannon's remarks:
``That's just absolutely false. No one from the Reagan
administration, the Justice Department, and no one from the FBI
leaked this story to the Washington Times.
   ``The story resulted from asking questions in Massachusetts of a
lot of people over several weeks.''
   Shannon said he called the FBI office in Boston after reading a
version of the Times story.
   ``They made perfectly clear to me that it's the most preliminary
of inquiries,'' Shannon said. He praised James Ahearn, the special
agent in charge of the Boston office, for issuing the statement
clarifying that Dukakis was not a ``subject'' of the FBI's inquiry.
   The case centers on a proposed prison that has met with vigorous
opposition in the community of New Braintree. Opponents charge that
the property owners _ one of whom is an acquaintance of Dukakis'
and a donor to his political campaigns _ stand to make millions of
dollars in profit from the sale.
   FBI officials have had no comment since releasing a carefully
worded statement that said the Boston field office is conducting an
inquiry into the proposed land deal and noting later in elaboration
that it is too soon in the inquiry for anyone to be called a
``subject.''
   Shannon said he has long been aware of complaints about the
siting process at New Braintree and that he has referred all
charges of impropriety to the state inspector general.
   ``I assume that what the FBI is doing is the same thing _ you
get an allegation and you have to ask some questions,'' Shannon
said. ``We felt that because allegations had been made, the proper
way was to have the inspector general take a look.''
   If the inspector general found grounds for a criminal
investigation, he would refer the matter back to the attorney
general's office, Shannon said, and that has not happened.

<HEAD>Honey Loaf Cold Cuts Recalled in Four New England States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Maine meat packer is voluntarily recalling
about 4,500 pounds of its honey loaf distributed in Maine, Vermont,
Massachusetts and New Hampshire because it possibly could cause
trichinosis, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The product, made by the Joseph Kirschner Co. of Augusta, Maine,
was underprocessed and because it contains pork, it could cause
trichinosis if eaten, the USDA said.
   There have been no reports of illness. The product being
recalled is labeled Kirschner Honey Loaf. It is sold in retail
packages and also produced for delicatessen use.
   The retail packages are the 5-ounce cold cut package and
12-ounce ``choice pack,'' which contains other cold cuts in
addition to the honey loaf.
   Both of these products are identified with a sell-by date of
``7-25-B-8-1C.'' ``EST. 2701'' is printed inside the USDA
inspection seal on the label.
   The honey loaf sold for delicatessen use is in 6- to 7-pound
packages with a code number of 368. The packages also are stamped
with either a number 22 or 23 indicating the week of the year in
which they were produced.
   The company said about 540 pounds have already been returned to
the plant by distributors, USDA said.
   ``Although no illnesses have been reported, anyone who has this
product should return it immediately to the store where it was
purchased,'' said Lester Crawford, administrator of the
department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
   Hogs slaughtered in this country may have living trichinae in
their muscle tissue. If the organisms have not been killed by
cooking or other processing methods, they can cause trichinosis, a
potentially life-threatening infection.
   Consumers who have questions about the recall can call the
toll-free USDA meat and poultry hotline at 800-535-4555. In
Washington, D.C., the number is 447-3333.

with federal regulators. The court, 6-3, said Mississippi
authorities are required to pass through to retail electricity

government's liability for negligence in personal injury claims.
Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said negligence

<HEAD>Hawke Departs After Warning Against Australian Backlash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke flew to
Texas Friday after warning top officials here that current American
farm support policies could produce a backlash in his country
damaging to U.S.-Australian military cooperation.
   During a two-day Washington visit, Hawke gave that message to a
meeting of both houses of Congress, to President Reagan at the
White House and to the two leading candidates to succeed Reagan _
Republican Vice President George Bush and Democratic Gov. Michael
Dukakis of Massachusetts.
   He said he believes that Bush, like Reagan, backs ending the
farm supports and he would be disappointed if Dukakis doesn't also.
   The Australian leader was scheduled to speak at the University
of Texas in Austin before returning home.
   Hawke spent his last half day in Washington golfing with
Secretary of State George P. Shultz on the fashionable Burning Tree
course and meeting an array of U.S. economic and business officials
at an Australian Embassy lunch.
   The guests included Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng,
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David S. Ruder,
Chairman Beryl W. Sprinkel of Reagan's Council of Economic
Advisers, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead and Washington
Post chairman Katherine Graham, the embassy said.
   Between meetings with Bush and Dukakis late Thursday, Hawke
asked Americans to recognize that the Australian military bases and
satellite tracking stations shared with U.S. forces have an
important role in the vital verification process of U.S.-Soviet
nuclear disarmament, including the treaty under negotiation to
reduce strategic long-range arms by 50 percent.
   The prime minister told a television interviewer he rejects
linking the future of the bases to U.S. farm subsidies damaging the
Australian economy but that, realistically, Australian public
opinion would link them.
   ``I'm simply saying, honestly and objectively, that if there
were to be an increase in this adverse impact upon our farmers, who
are unsubsidized and the most efficient in the world, there will be
a growth of resentment'' of the United States,'' Hawke said on the
MacNeil-Lehrer TV Newshour.
   He added: ``It would be wrong to close down those facilities
(military bases), but politicians, in the end, can't resist the
will of the people''
   The impact of subsidized U.S. wheat exports has been
considerable, Hawke said, declaring that the share of the world
wheat market for unsubsidized Australian wheat dropped from 20 to
12 percent during the three years of the U.S. wheat export subsidy
program while the U.S. share rose from 29 to 43 percent.
   ``Bush understands and, I think, supports my position,'' said
Hawke. ``I would be disappointed if (Dukakis) didn't adopt the same
position,'' he added in the interview, which took place before his
talk with Dukakis.

<TEXT>
   Leslie Manigat, the
deposed president of Haiti, knew when he fired Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy as military commander that the general would retaliate,
Manigat's wife said Friday.
   Myrlande Manigat said several ranking army officers advised her
husband to put Namphy in jail, but the president decided instead to
confine him to house arrest without a telephone or other means of
communication.
   Manigat knew Namphy ``would take action, but not in that
manner,'' she said in a televised interview, referring to the
palace guards who freed Namphy on Sunday and put him back in the
National Palace.
   Manigat, who arrived in the Dominican Republic with his family
the day after the coup and flew to Miami on Friday, has said he was
ousted because he tried to end corruption in the army and the
government.
   ``The confrontation with Gen. Namphy was inevitable sooner or
later because he and my husband had nothing in common morally, in
terms of humaneness, intellectually, in their values, in nothing,''
Mrs. Manigat said.
   Namphy led the junta that ruled Haiti for two years after
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled in February 1986. He turned over
power to Manigat on Feb. 7 after Manigat won a presidential
election with the army's help, and proclaimed himself presidend
Monday, after the coup.
   The night of the coup, many ambassadors called Manigat and told
him to hide, Mrs. Manigat said. Two ambassadors offered refuge in
their embassies but he ``refused to leave and said they had to come
arrest him,'' she said, without elaborating.
   After seing Namphy on television announcing the takeover with
all the ranking officers at his side, Manigat told his family:
``You have to prepare for anything, all is lost. ... We can't count
on the armed forces to overcome a military coup,'' she said.
   When soldiers arrived with tanks and began shooting at the
Manigat house, she said, the 20 people inside prepared to fight but
Manigat told them to surrender ``because you can't resist a tank
with a rifle.''
   The group shouted their surrender and went outside.
   ``They put us in line and started shooting again and I thought
they were going to kill us all, but they didn't,'' Mrs. Manigat
said. ``I think it was a psychological action to make us think they
were going to.''
   The Manigats and their daughter were taken to the airport and
flew to the Dominican Republic around midday.
   ``When I found myself in the hotel in Santo Domingo, when we
were alone, I simply started to cry without being able to control
myself,'' Mrs. Manigat said. ``It was a kind of relief ... to be
safe, to be in a friendly place and to no longer be alone.''

<HEAD>Canada Finds Itself Embroiled in Rare Spy Drama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada doesn't have spy scandals very often, but
it suddenly finds itself embroiled in an espionage drama involving
sophisticated U.S. naval technology, the banishment of 19 Soviets
and reprisals from Moscow.
   Yet nobody was supposed to know about it.
   As the Canadian Embassy in Moscow awaited the Kremlin's next
move Friday, officials here remained silent on exactly what the
Soviets they expelled were trying to do.
   In the latest retaliation by the Kremlin, the Soviet government
newspaper Izvestia on Friday accused three Canadians diplomats who
have been expelled or barred from the Soviet Union of specific acts
of espionage. Izvestia said one of them had collaborated with U.S.
diplomats who were also ejected as spies.
   According to intelligence sources, the Soviet spy ring was
trying to infiltrate the Paramax Electronics plant in Montreal,
where weapons guidance, communications and sonar systems for a new
generation of Canadian frigates are being supplied under a $830
million contract.
   Paramax is a subsidiary of the Detroit-based Unisys Corp., a
major defense contractor with access to highly classified
electronic warfare technology already in use in the U.S. Navy.
   Another target was the U.S. naval base at Argentia,
Newfoundland, where 400 members of the Naval Security Command
monitor the movement of Soviet submarines, the sources said.
   There was also an attempt to penetrate the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police intelligence service and its successor, the Canadian
Security Intelligence Service, according to Foreign Minister Joe
Clark. He refused to detail other alleged Soviet transgressions.
   In a statement to Parliament Wednesday, Clark announced eight
Soviets had been expelled and nine others formerly assigned here
were barred from returning.
   ``We are confident that Canadian security was not compromised,''
Clark said.
   The Soviets retaliated immediately, expelling two Canadian
diplomats and barring three others from returning to the Soviet
Union.
   Clark, proclaiming the innocence of his envoys, then escalated
the incident by expelling the senior military attache at the Soviet
Embassy in Ottawa, Col. Grigori Roublev, and barring a former
second secretary from returning.
   Paul Frazer, a spokesman for Clark, said he was aware of the
accusations in Izvestia but had no comment.
   The Canadian Press news agency quoted Izvestia as saying Ken
Moodie, former assistant air attache at the Canadian Embassy in
Moscow, was ``caught red-handed'' posing as a tourist at a military
installation in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk.
   Izvestia also named John DiGangi, a former second secretary in
Moscow, and Cmdr. Ray Steele, a naval attache who was scheduled to
leave Moscow today, Canadian Press said in its report. Izvestia
said DiGangi carried out instructions given by three U.S. diplomats
who were expelled for spying, but did not elaborate, the news
agency reported.
   Canadian officials rejected the charges, the news agency said.
   Intelligence Service spokesman Jerry Cummings and government
officials told The Associated Press the spy story was never
supposed to get out.
   It became known because a French-language reporter in Ottawa,
Normand Lester of Radio-Canada, got a tip from an intelligence
source that there was a mass exodus of Soviet diplomats last week,
with children suddenly withdrawn from schools and apartments
emptied overnight.
   Lester knocked on doors to confirm the exodus and broke the
story Tuesday, as Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was hosting the
seven-nation Economic Summit in Toronto.
   At his summit-closing news conference, Mulroney confirmed that a
group of Soviet representatives had been kicked out for spying but
gave no details.
   According to informed sources, the saga began June 11 when a
25-year-old Canadian of Hungarian descent, Stephen Joseph Ratkai,
was arrested in Newfoundland and charged with obtaining classified
U.S. military documents intended for the Soviet Union.
   The sources said Capt. Boris Tatarintsev, assistant naval
attache at the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa, left the country
immediately after Ratkai's arrest.
   Tatarintsev was one of the original eight diplomats on the
expulsion list made public Wednesday.
   Government officials would not confirm Tatarintsev's involvement
in the U.S. naval base case, but the sources said authorities
suspected him of working for the GRU, the Soviet military
intelligence agency, and of having overall responsibility for both
the Argentia and Paramax operations.
   The Soviet Embassy refused to return calls from the AP to answer
questions about Tatarintsev, but embassy spokesman Viatcheslav
Bogdanov earlier claimed none of the Soviets named were spies.
   Sources said Canadian authorities worked a double agent at
Argentia to prevent Soviet infiltration. Clark said a Russian
translator at the International Civil Aviation Organization in
Montreal provided information on some of the spying operations. The
translator, Yuri Smurov, has now defected with his wife and
daughter.
   Canada had military and commercial reasons for wanting to keep
the expulsions secret.
   Its navy is seeking U.S. approval for the transfer of nuclear
propulsion technology incorporated in the British Trafalgar-class
submarines it may buy. Lax security could make the Americans veto
the transfer.
   In addition, a public rift between the Soviet Union and Canada
might endanger Soviet purchases of Canadian wheat and potential
pipeline and dam projects for Canadian engineering firms.

repeated,'' and 7 new grafs at end, starting with graf 29 ``As
he,'' on more from Bush, quotes from Dole and Robertson, Bush
statement on drought</NOTE>

   Republican George Bush attacked Democrat
Michael Dukakis on Friday for increasing taxes in Massachusetts and
said, ``I will not raise your taxes, period. He just has, in his
home state.''
   The vice president indicated he would go even further than
President Reagan in ruling out all forms of new taxes, including
excise taxes.
   Bush repeated his criticism of Dukakis' tax increase at a GOP
unity rally, telling applauding Republicans: ``I promise you I'll
not raise taxes as a first, second or last resort. ... We don't
need more taxes, we need a president who can hold the line against
congressional overspending.''
   Bush told a news conference the Massachusetts governor ``refuses
to rule out a tax hike for the nation. We know what that means.''
   Bush said that differences between him and Dukakis ``were
brought into high relief by the announcement yesterday by the
governor of Massachusetts of a $115 million tax hike for his
state.''
   Dukakis on Thursday announced he would sign a package designed
to close an estimated $200 million state budget shortfall,
including a new $40 million tax on cigarettes.
   `I'm just pointing out a fundamental difference that I have on
the federal level in terms of what the governor himself has said.
It makes me wonder what his commitment is,'' Bush said.
   ``In his (Dukakis') announcement, he said this represented a
sharp contrast with the policies of the administration. I couldn't
agree more,'' Bush said.
   Asked whether he would rule out all forms of tax increases, even
excise taxes, Bush said he would _ although he would not extend
that pledge to ``user fees'' like those charged for entering
national parks.
   Bush's vow went further than the tax opposition voiced
repeatedly by President Reagan.
   The administration has supported about $200 billion in tax
increases during the past seven and a half years, including excise
taxes and a tax hike Reagan agreed to last winter as part of a
budget deficit-reduction compromise with Congress.
   Asked if he was concerned his stand would lock him in if
elected, Bush said he was not. ``I think it's reassuring to the
working men and women in this country.''
   Bush said he had a ``plain as day'' difference with Dukakis _
``tax cuts vs. tax hikes.''
   Bush was asked why he was criticizing Dukakis for a tax increase
in his state when, the week before during a campaign swing through
Illinois, he declined to criticize GOP Illinois Gov. James Thompson
for supporting a tax-increase package.
   ``Dukakis is running for president of the United States. Jim
Thompson is not,'' Bush said.
   New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who traveled to Cincinnati with
Bush, told reporters on Air Force Two that ``I don't know why
anybody's surprised'' that Dukakis signed a tax increase.
   ``Everytime he's had a problem, he's run to a tax increase,'' he
said.
   Bush was here for a unity rally and a series of Republican
meetings, including a session with Republican women.
   Sitting beside Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Maureen Reagan,
the president's daughter, Bush said the gender gap problem dogging
his campaign would close once he begins to speak out more on issues.
   ``We want to emphasize the strength of family,'' Bush said in a
portion of the meeting open to reporters. ``I think this gap will
go away.''
   Recent polls have shown that women voters prefer Dukakis over
Bush by 20 or more points.
   Bush told reporters: ``I think we've got a good message for
women, and I want to do a better job of getting that message out of
family and caring and equal opportunity and peace and jobs.''
   At the same time, Bush said he remains against the Equal Rights
Amendment but ``for women's rights.''
   Bush said he would soon unveil a child care program that would
be a major part of his campaign platform.
   Republican party Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, meanwhile, said
Reagan is eager to stump for Bush. But Fahrenkopf said Bush's
current problem in the polls partly stems from the fact that he is
the vice president.
   ``Being a vice president and running for the presidency is a
difficult position to be in,'' the party chief said.
   On the subject of a vice presidential choice, Bush said he had
assigned campaign aide Bob Teeter, his chief pollster, to develop a
process for coming up with a list of potential names.
   However, he said he still had not begun considering specific
choices.
   As he has been doing at nearly every stop during the past week,
Bush took another jab at the Massachusetts prison furlough program,
under which some convicts were released on weekend passes.
   Although the program was modified earlier this year to stop
furloughs for first-degree murderers, Bush said, ``the Dukakis
furlough program still applies to convicted drug dealers _ giving
them a chance to maintain their contacts in the criminal world and
peddle their illicit wares.''
   Two vanquished GOP rivals, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Christian
broadcaster Pat Robertson, praised Bush at the rally.
   ``The Republican Party is united and we are not about to see the
country go for a mediocre liberal like Michael Dukakis,'' Robertson
said.
   Quipped Dole: ``I'd accept the nomination but it's already
gone.''
   Bush also met with Dole and a group of local farmers to discuss
the drought afflicting most of the nation's central farm belt.
   ``We should be prepared, if conditions continue to deteriorate,
to provide more disaster relief as needed,'' Bush said in a
statement after the meeting. ``These programs should be funded from
savings from the reduced cost of this year's farm programs.''

<HEAD>Heat Wave Continues With Scattered Thunderstorms</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Temperatures soared into the 100s across the central part of the
nation Friday for the eighth straight day, and storms soaked the
western Gulf Coast.
   The heat wave extended from the central Plains through the
middle Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
   The Climate Analysis Center of the National Weather Service
issued the first of what it said would be weekly drought
advisories. It showed average precipitation from April 1 to June 18
was down by as much as 75 percent over parts of the lower Ohio and
Tennessee valleys, the lower Missouri Valley and western Texas.
   Rainfall was down 50 percent across the lower Mississippi Valley
and the northern Plains.
   Showers that brought much-needed moisture to northern and
eastern Iowa Friday morning moved through parts of northern
Illinois by afternoon.
   Showers and thunderstorms were most numerous along the western
third of the Gulf Coast, but also were scattered from northwest
Minnesota into the upper peninsula of Michigan. Other showers were
scattered across parts of North Carolina and the west-central
Florida coast.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included nearly an inch at New Orleans; more than a half-inch at
Galveston, Texas; more than a quarter-inch at La Crosse, Wis., and
nearly a quarter-inch at Moline, Ill.
   Fewer cities reached record high temperatures Friday. They
included 97 at Casper, Wyo.; 101 at Chattanooga, Tenn.; 93 at
Cheyenne, Wyo.; 100 at Des Moines, Iowa; 101 at Kansas City, Mo.;
101 at Paducah, Ky.; 103 at Sioux City, Iowa; and 103 at Sioux
Falls, S.D. It was Sioux City's fifth consecutive record.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees at Grand Marais, Minn., to 109 degrees at Pierre, S.D. The
nation's low Friday morning was 37 degrees at Watertown, N.Y.
   The forecast for Saturday offered no relief from hot and dry
weather for much of the western and central parts of the nation.
Showers and thunderstorms were expected to be scattered from the
lower Great Lakes through the eastern Ohio Valley and central
Appalachians into much of New England, and also from the lower
Mississippi Valley through the central Gulf Coast into the southern
Atlantic Coast and Florida.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 90s across much of the
nation, except 60s and 70s across central and northern New England
and along the central California coast, 80s along the northern
Pacific Coast and from the northern Plains into the upper Great
Lakes. Highs should reach from 100 to 105 from the central high
Plains into the middle Mississippi Valley, parts of southwest Idaho
and eastern Oregon and across the Southwest deserts, with highs
near 115 degrees in southwest Arizona.

   Joe Clark, the bullhorn-toting principal
who chained his inner city school's doors shut to drug dealers,
told 405 graduating seniors Friday national attention has brought
``resplendent moments'' and ``trials and tribulations.''
   ``We've gone from shame to fame, from disgrace to amazing grace.
Truly this is the most hallowed school in the nation,'' he said.
   Clark appeared on the cover of Time Magazine, received a job
offer from the White House and drew media scrutiny for his tough
ways, which included striding the halls with a baseball bat and
expelling underachievers.
   ``We have pricked the conscience of a nation and we have shown,
if nothing more, that black and Hispanic students in inner cities
can behave properly,'' Clark told nearly 1,000 friends, relatives
and students attending Eastside's 102nd graduation.
   The graduates, men in silver caps and gowns, women in pink, were
praised by Mayor Frank X. Graves for surviving ``what the press and
media have put you through the last few years. We're satisfied with
who you are and we wouldn't exchange you for any other students.''
   Clark was embroiled in controversy this year when the school
board started to take disciplinary action against him for kicking
out more than 60 students without informing the board, which
eventually dropped its effort.
   ``This has been a glorious experience for us,'' Clark said. ``We
have had resplendent moments, glorious moments. We've also had
trials and tribulations.''
   Addressing his critics, he said, ``The evil that you say doesn't
make us feel bad. How can you miss a friend you never had?''
   Several parents at the graduation praised Clark and his work
with students.
   ``He's trying to show that education is something that can't be
taken away from them,'' said Barbara Jennings, whose graduating
daughter, Tammy, 18, will attend Montclair State College.
   ``If we had more principals or teachers like him, we'd have
better children,'' she said.
   Grace Davis, whose 18-year-old daughter, Vanessa, is headed for
Spellman College in Atlanta, said: ``There has been a great
improvement in the school the last four years my daughter has
attended.''

   Fire rekindled in a gasoline storage
tank Friday, just hours after officials declared it extinguished
and 10,000 evacuated residents of the area started going home.
   Flames and thick black smoke shot into the air over this
industrial suburb of Monterrey for a second day. Radio and
television stations warned people to stay away from the San Rafael
gasoline depot, where three 40-foot-tall tanks exploded Thursday,
killing at least four people and injuring at least 18.
   It was the second explosion and fire in a month at a depot
operated by Pemex, the government oil monopoly. On May 24, more
than 100,000 people were forced out of the area around a gas and
kerosene supply depot in the northern city of Chihuahua. No one was
hurt.
   News reports in Monterrey said the death toll at San Rafael
might be higher. The daily El Sol said one of its reporters saw
seven badly burned bodies at a local morgue and ran a banner
headline saying: ``They're Hiding Deaths.''
   Officials declared two of the blazing tanks extinguished late
Thursday night. They reported the third one out Friday morning, but
then said the collapsed tank began burning again a few hours later.
   A Pemex statement Friday afternoon said two people were killed
Thursday and two of the injured died Friday. It said firefighters
had the new blaze under control and it was expected to burn out
within hours.
   One of the dead was Vicente Quiroga Garcia, owner-manager of the
Monterrey construction company Constructora Quiroga y Villarreal,
which Pemex hired to maintain fire-prevention equipment at the
depot, Maria Estella Garcia, a construction company secretary, said
by telephone Friday.
   The construction company gave the Monterrey newspaper El Norte a
list of the names of the 54 workers who were at the plant Thursday
and noted that 13 had not been accounted for.
   Some of the 13 missing, may have died ``because we've been told
there are people they haven't been able to identify because they
are so badly burned,'' Ms. Garcia said. She said she did not know
whether that information was from Pemex or state health officials.
   Raul Robles, assistant commercial director of Pemex, blamed the
explosions and fire on a leak in one of the tanks. Officials said
each of the 23 tanks at the depot holds 2.2 million gallons of
gasoline or diesel fuel.
   Thousands of people who fled on Thursday had begun heading home,
many searching for relatives lost in the rush to escape a fire that
police say reached temperatures of 5,400 degrees Farenheit and
melted several vehicles.
   ``We were going to take a bath and then get some sleep,'' said
Minerva Garcia, a housewife who had to leave her home a second time.
   ``All of a sudden, we heard the fire trucks again and the street
was full of smoke and flames. It was the same thing all over again:
people were running around the streets.''
   Mrs. Garcia said her quick trip home paid off because she found
her husband. They were separated in the first evacuation, but ``I
got home and there he was in the kitchen, waiting,'' she said in an
emergency shelter.
   When the fire began anew, police at barricades stopped residents
who were returning home. The shelters soon were full again.
   Concepcion Sierra Mendez, 32, among those prevented from
returning, said she had left her three children at home Thursday
while she went to a medical clinic.
   She said she spent the night walking from shelter to shelter,
searching for them and ``the despair is terrible.'' She sobbed as
she told the story.
   Behind her, white chemical foam used to fight the fires filled a
roadside ditch like a dirty bubble bath.
   ``I can't find my son. He's 10 years old,'' said Antonio Bernal,
36, walking through an auditorium packed with 300 people. ``All the
children were in the house and I guess he ran out. ... People left
their houses wide open and just ran.''
   Television and radio stations broadcast the names of the missing
throughout the greater Monterrey area, where 2.8 people live.
Monterrey is the capital of the northern state of Nuevo Leon and
Mexico's third largest city.

<HEAD>Magnetic Storm Warning Issued After Largest Solar Flare in Four
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest solar flare in four years
exploded from the sun Friday, spurring warnings that a major
magnetic storm probably will disrupt global communications and
satellite operations on Monday.
   ``I've got a major storm warning out for Monday,'' and it likely
will ebb into a minor magnetic storm Tuesday, said Chris Balch,
duty forecaster at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's Space Environment Laboratory in Boulder, Colo.
   The flare, an explosive release of hot gas, electrically charged
particles and X-rays, poses no direct threat to life on Earth. But
the magnetic storm could disrupt such ordinary matters as
long-distance phone calls and electric power transmission.
   Proton radiation associated with the solar flare should reach
orbiting spacecraft Saturday, said Gary Heckman, NOAA's chief of
space environment services. He said it should pose no danger to
Soviet cosmonauts orbiting Earth as long as they stay inside their
Mir space station.
   The magnetic storm is expected to push Earth's auroras away from
the poles, making the northern lights visible as far south as the
Great Lakes, Boston and England in the Northern Hemisphere, he said
during a telephone interview.
   X-rays from the flare probably disrupted communications briefly
Friday, although there were no immediate reports, he added.
   While officials can't forecast the magnetic storm with
certainty, Balch said there is a ``really high'' probability it
will start Monday as hot gases and charged particles emitted by the
flare hit Earth's magnetic field.
   The flare began at 9:44 a.m. PDT Friday and lasted nearly two
hours, Balch said. A smaller flare at 9:01 a.m. PDT lasted 41
minutes.
   Communications likely to be disrupted are short-wave, including
international broadcasts, ship-to-shore communications, polar
communications and contact between airliners and ground
controllers, Heckman said during a phone interview. A NOAA
statement said long-distance phone calls also might be affected.
   The magnetic storm also will cause ``errors in the orbits of
some satellites,'' he said. ``It will slow them down in orbit. Some
people will have trouble operating their satellites.''
   It also could induce stray voltages in electrical power
transmission systems, causing temporary outages and making lights
flicker, he added.
   Heckman said the magnetic storm warning was issued to the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Defense
Department, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.
   Dale Gary, a solar astronomer at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena, said the flare was the biggest since April
1984, and its visible portion extended perhaps 200,000 miles above
the sun's surface. He said it came from a group of about 20
sunspots, some up to three times larger than Earth.
   Heckman said the initial burst of X-rays and expected magnetic
storm disrupt communications by altering the shape of Earth's
ionosphere, a layer of electrically charged particles 100 to 500
miles above the planet's surface.
   Particles emitted by the flare disrupt satellites both by
hitting their electronics and by producing drag that slows their
speed.
   The last ``barn-burner'' magnetic storm occurred in for two days
in August 1972, although the one expected Monday shouldn't be that
large, Heckman said.
   The current 11-year sunspot cycle was expected to peak in 1991.
But scientists said months ago that it seemed to be rising much
faster than previous cycles and may peak by 1989.
   Gary said solar flares occur when ``the magnetic configuration
of sunspots gets complicated and twisted, then they release stored
energy.''
   Electrically charged particles and gases from the sun flow
toward Earth's poles along magnetic field lines to cause the
northern and southern lights, or auroras.
   The northern lights, normally visible over northern Alaska and
Hudson Bay, are pushed farther south during magnetic storms because
the Earth's magnetic field is altered as it is hit by particles and
gases from solar flares.
   Heckman said the impending storm should make the auroras visible
as far south as 50 degrees north latitude and as far north as 50
degrees south latitude.

   Pope John Paul II on Friday condemned
Nazism on the site where 110,000 World War II prisoners died, but
the pontiff angered Austria's chief rabbi by not making a specific
reference to Jewish victims.
   Earlier, John Paul urged Austrian Jewish leaders to accept the
Vatican's call for a Palestinian homeland. The Roman Catholic
leader did not respond to appeals for the Vatican to give full
diplomatic recognition to Israel.
   The pope also said Mass in Trausdorf near the Hungarian border
for an estimated 80,000 people, most of them Yugoslavs and
Hungarians.
   The emotional high point of the day came at Mauthausen,
Austria's most infamous death camp, where an estimated 110,000 Nazi
prisoners died or were murdered.
   On his arrival, six U.S. Jews who were opposed to the pontiff's
meeting Thursday with President Kurt Waldheim scuffled briefly with
police outside the camp. The group was kept away from the pope, and
it was not known if he saw the altercation.
   ``They threw me down, they used excessive force,'' Rabbi Avi
Weiss of Riverdale, N.Y., told The Associated Press.
   Earlier in Vienna, police detained Nazi hunter Beate Klarsfeld
and eight supporters.
   Ludwig Soswinski, the head of the camp survivors' group,
introduced the pope to 11 camp survivors, including a Polish
priest, Rev. Zdislaw Lipinski.
   The Polish-born pontiff, speaking outside a memorial chapel,
said: ``Here in Mauthausen were people who, in the name of a
lunatic ideology, set into motion a whole machinery of contempt and
hatred of others.''
   Delivering his remarks in German, the pontiff continued: ``They
tortured them, broke their bones, cruelly abused their bodies and
their souls.''
   Camp inmates were forced to work in nearby quarries, carrying
huge granite blocks up 189 steps known as the ``stairway of death.''
   The pontiff mentioned Marcel Callo, a Catholic activist who died
in Mauthausen, Polish priest St. Maximilian Kolbe, and two other
Catholics who died in Nazi camps. But the Roman Catholic leader
made no reference specifically to Jews.
   That angered Chaim Eisenberg, Austria's chief rabbi, who told
reporters in Vienna: ``A visit to Mauthausen without mentioning the
word Jews once is not satisfactory.''
   ``The only Jew he mentions who suffered is Jesus Christ, and he
didn't die in Mauthausen,'' Eisenberg said.
   During the visit, John Paul stood silently for nearly a minute
in front of a plaque written in Hebrew and German in memory of the
Jewish victims of Mauthausen.
   The Vatican, citing Austrian researchers, says that of the
44,000 Poles killed in Mauthausen, 7,000 were Jewish, while a
majority of the 32,000 Hungarians who lost their lives there were
Jewish. Tens of thousands of Soviets and Germans also perished,
although the Vatican provided no breakdown on the percentage of
Jews.
   The pontiff met earlier with Austrian Jewish community President
Paul Grosz and five other Jewish leaders in Vienna.
   The Klarsfeld group was outside the building voicing its
opposition to the pontiff's meeting with Waldheim, who has faced
allegations of complicity in Nazi war crimes.
   Mrs. Klarsfeld and seven supporters were released within several
hours, but her son, Arno, was detained for further questioning.
During the protest, he had been wearing a Nazi uniform, which is
illegal.
   ``The Jewish people have the right to a homeland, as any other
nation has according to international law,'' John Paul said. ``The
same goes for the Palestinian people, many of whom have become
homeless and refugees.''
   The pope reminded his audience he had made a similar call in
September in Miami.
   Grosz appealed to the pope to work with Jewish leaders to ``seek
a way to solve the problem of the Middle East together.''
   Grosz also said he regretted ``that full diplomatic relations
between Israel and the Holy See have not yet been established.''
The pontiff did not respond to that point.
   The Vatican has cited Israel's lack of settled borders and the
international dispute over Jerusalem for the absence of diplomatic
ties with Israel.
   Speaking of the Nazi murder of an estimated 6 million Jews, the
pope said: ``The incomprehensible pain, suffering and tears still
are before my eyes and etched deep in my soul.''
   But he added: ``It would be clearly unjust and untrue to charge
Christianity with these unspeakable crimes.''
   Some Jewish leaders have accused Christians and the Vatican in
particular of failing to do enough to prevent the Holocaust.
   Many Jews have criticized the pope for meeting with Waldheim at
the start of the five-day trip.
   Waldheim has faced allegations of complicity in Nazi war crimes
during his service in the German army. The Austrian president has
denied any wrongdoing.

   A Democratic panel on Friday unanimously approved
a preliminary draft platform that promises to restore ``competence,
caring and incorruptibility'' to Washington but avoids any talk of
higher taxes, a freeze on Pentagon spending or a Palestinian
homeland.
   The 16-member drafting committee finished work without resolving
the differences that still divide the Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson campaigns.
   But the campaign staffs said they would keep negotiating through
the night before the full 186-member Platform Committee begins work
Saturday on the document, which was shaping up as the Democrats'
shortest platform in half a century.
   Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, heading the drafting
effort, said, ``I think we have a document that is succinct, that
is clear and a document that will be readable.'' He predicted ``the
same spirit of collegiality and cooperation'' would prevail in the
Platform Committee.
   Before adjourning, the panel agreed to a motion by Dukakis
representative Michael Barnes to strike a vaguely worded paragraph
that said, ``We believe that executive-legislative cooperation
instead of confrontation can halt the debacle of deficit and debt
... (and) more nearly match our revenue base'' with urgent national
needs.
   Barnes said he hoped to offer more substantive language on the
deficit Saturday.
   ``We're going to be working hard through the night on a number
of issues,'' Barnes told reporters, but he said it was likely some
issues would not be resolved.
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief, said, ``While
we haven't erased the differences ... we have come closer
together.''
   Gray's panel began the day with a 3,500-word draft based on
agreements reached on a host of issues two weeks ago in Michigan.
It made numerous revisions, which were being incorporated in the
document overnight.
   The panel added a provision sought by Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., opposing legalization of illicit drugs.
   The document also endorses giving pension funds financial
incentives to invest in housing construction _ a variant of a
Jackson campaign proposal.
   Jackson, still in the running although Dukakis is virtually
certain to become the presidential nominee, has said previously he
may take his fight over such issues as higher taxes on the rich and
a Pentagon freeze to the floor of next month's Democratic
convention in Atlanta.
   But Norton said, ``There are no non-negotiable demands from the
Jackson campaign.''
   Dukakis has not ruled out the possibility of higher taxes if he
is elected, but he has refused to allow any discussion of higher
taxes in the platform.
   Dukakis has also rejected any mention of a Palestinian homeland.
   ``The fact that we may not get the words `Palestinian state'
does not mean that there are not ways to show greater recognition
of the rights of Palestinians,'' Norton said.
   The full Platform Committee will try to put the document in
final form by Sunday.
   The preliminary draft incorporated language on a dozen issues
that Dukakis and Jackson representatives agreed to two weeks ago on
Mackinac Island, Mich.
   But in every significant area of dispute, Dukakis' preferences,
not Jackson's, were embodied in the preliminary draft.
   Ted Sorensen, a John F. Kennedy speechwriter who penned an
earlier platform ``discussion paper'' for Democratic Party chairman
Paul G. Kirk Jr., said in an interview Friday, ``I am the drafter
of the present draft as well.''
   ``It's fairly clear now this will be the shortest platform in
over a hundred years,'' said Sorensen. ``It will be a thematic,
readable platform. It will not have the traditional, negative cast.
Reagan, Republican, Bush _ those words aren't even mentioned,''
said Sorensen.
   Sorensen apparently overstated the case. The shortest platform
in recent history was Franklin D. Roosevelt's platform in 1932,
which was under 2,000 words.
   In contrast, the 1984 platform ran to 58 pages and more than
40,000 words.
   The draft is headed ``The Restoration of Competence and Hope.''
It pledges party leaders and elected officials ``to restore
competence, caring and incorruptibility to the federal executive
branch and get it working again fairly for all Americans.''
   It calls for ``more stable defense budgets,'' appointment of a
drug czar and ``maintaining the special relationship with Israel''
while pursuing peace in the Middle East along the lines laid out in
the Camp David accords.
   It endorses ``freedom of reproductive choice'' without
mentioning abortion. It calls for an Equal Rights Amendment,
advance notice of plant closings and voluntary national public
service.
   Kirk has instructed the platform committee and its chair,
Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, to produce a short, visionary
document, not one weighted down with special interest planks.
   The preliminary draft also denounces South Africa as ``a
terrorist state,'' as Jackson wanted. Although it does not mention
Reagan or Bush by name, it derides ``voodoo economics'' and
promises the Democrats will ``promote peace and prevent war,'' but
``not by trading weapons for hostages, not by sending brave
Americans to undefined missions in Lebanon and Honduras ... (and)
not by toasting a tyrant like Marcos as a disciple of democracy.''

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bass guitarist for the rock group
UB40 was jailed after pleading guilty Friday to causing the death
of his brother by reckless driving.
   Earl Falconer, 29, had almost twice the legal limit of alcohol
in his blood following the road crash in November 1987 that killed
his brother, Ray.
   At Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Michael Dillon sentenced
Falconer to 18 months imprisonment, with 12 months suspended, and
banned him from driving for three years.
   Defense attorney Colman Tracey said Falconer was filled with
remorse and has not driven a car since.
   ``It was a great piece of good fortune there were not multiple
deaths in this accident,'' Dillon said in passing sentence.
   UB40, whose hits include ``Red, Red Wine'' and a remake of Sonny
and Cher's ``I Got You, Babe,'' had planned a world tour starting
next month. It was not immediately clear whether the tour would be
affected.
   Court testimony revealed that Falconer had approached traffic
lights in Birmingham, central England, at speeds estimated between
60 mph and 80 mph. Witnesses said he overtook a car moving away
from the lights, collided with it and lost control.
   His car demolished some concrete flower planters, a road sign
and a lamppost before slamming into a factory wall. Ray Falconer,
who was sitting in the back seat of his brother's car, was killed
instantly.

   Federal investigators probing possible
corruption in defense contracts have videotaped evidence of
Pentagon officials allegedly taking bribes from consultants for
inside information, NBC News reported Friday.
   NBC, citing sources it did not identify said the officials in
the videotapes are Victor Cohen, a deputy assistant secretary of
the Air Force, and James Gaines, a deputy assistant secretary of
the Navy.
   The consultants on the videotapes, NBC reported, include Melvyn
Paisley, a former assistant secretary of the Navy whose office was
searched by federal authorities last week.
   Paisley's attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella, denounced the
officials who provided the information to NBC.
   ``This is just a further example of the government trying their
case in the press rather than waiting for specific allegations to
try in court,'' Barcella said in a telephone interview Friday
night. ``If they want to try a case about leaking government
information, they should stop leaking information.''
   Federal authorities are investigating whether defense
contractors and consultants, many of them former military men,
bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that could be
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   NBC said officials close to the case said Cohen would clear his
calendar and leave the Pentagon whenever a defense consultant would
call. The meetings were recorded and videotaped and money changed
hands, NBC quoted the sources as saying.
   Gaines also was videotaped meeting with consultants, and highly
confidential documents relating to Pentagon contracts allegedly
changed hands, NBC said.
   Michael Schatzow, the attorney for Gaines, said Friday night
that he would have no comment on the NBC report.
   ``I'll just wait and allow everybody who's been reporting these
stories to wait and be embarrassed later,'' Schatzow said.
   A phone call Friday night to the home of Cohen's attorney,
Seymour Glanzer, was answered by a woman who said he was out for
the evening.
   The Washington Times reported Friday that a congressional staff
member who requested anonymity said that Henry Hudson, the U.S.
attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who is heading the
investigation, told members of Congress that the FBI had videotaped
some of the alleged crimes under investigation and agents had
``extensive'' tape and wiretap evidence.
   Both Cohen and Gaines have been temporarily reassigned to other
duties since their offices were searched last week by investigators.
   Gaines already has begun cooperating with prosecutors, and Cohen
is negotiating with the government on whether to do the same,
sources told The Associated Press earlier this week.
   Schatzow would not confirm that Gaines is cooperating with
authorities.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that investigators
believe Gaines was a principal supplier of Pentagon documents to
Paisley, who was Gaines' boss until he left the government in 1987.
   Paisley and Gaines worked together at Boeing Co. in Seattle in
the 1970s.

<TEXT>
   Indians who have refused to leave
rundown housing on federal land in the northern California town of
Central Valley were ordered evicted Friday by a federal judge.
   U.S. District Court Judge Milton Schwartz on Friday granted
summary judgment in favor of the government, which sought the
Indians' eviction because housing built originally for Shasta Dam
workers is unsanitary and unsafe.
   ``It isn't the happiest decision I've made,'' Schwartz said, but
added, ``No evidence has been produced as to ... the rights of
possession'' by the Indians.
   Deputy U.S. Attorney Steve Lapham will draft the eviction order
within 10 days. He said he hopes to draft the order in a way that
would avoid a physical confrontation between Wintu Indians and U.S.
marshals.
   The more than 30 Wintu Indian men, women and children at the
60-acre Toyon site were joined for a time in February by scores of
Indians from other areas when eviction notices were last posted in
the long-running dispute.
   The Indians could not be reached for immediate comment in
Central Valley, 160 miles north of Sacramento. The residents do not
have telephones and a woman, the only person a reporter found at
the site Friday, went inside a house when approached.
   The Indians' attorneys, Mike Bush and Bob Bryzman, said after
the court session that they were uncertain how their clients would
react.
   Earlier this year, Mickey Gemmill, a Toyon resident since 1984,
said, ``It will be a defeat for Indians nationwide if we are forced
to leave here.''
   Lapham, who represents the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, said
another of the buildings, which have no utility services, burned
down recently. ``There's a great deal of urgency'' to the eviction
proceedings, he said.
   Attorneys for the Indians argued that their clients had a right
to live on the land for a variety of reasons, including the fact
that their ancestors once occupied the region.
   The attorneys said a court settlement in April 1987 between the
government and a group representing some of the Indians, the
Toyon-Wintu Center Inc., did not include all of the Indians at the
site. The settlement ended the center's 15-year-old permit to use
the land.
   However, Judge Schwartz told attorneys Bush and Bryzman, who
work for Legal Services of California, that they had submitted
``very speculative theories'' in support of the Indians who remain
at the site.
   Originally built in the 1930s for Shasta Dam construction
workers, the vacant Toyon housing project was used by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs as a center for Indians beginnning in 1971.
   The agency decided in 1985 to demolish the buildings after they
became run down. About the same time, electricity and water were
cut off to the houses because of unpaid utility bills.
   Representatives of the Toyon-Wintu Center agreed last year to
vacate the buildings. Under the court settlement, an administration
building and a shop would be the only buildings not razed.
   The Wintus would then be given eight years to become federally
recognized as an Indian tribe, thereby eligible for federal funds
which would allow the Wintus to rebuild at the site.

<HEAD>Corps Will Try To Stop Saltwater Encroachment With Dike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Army Corps of Engineers is planning a
huge, temporary dike on the bottom of the Mississippi River to
block a drought-induced saltwater intrusion that threatens New
Orleans' drinking water.
   Salt water from the Gulf of Mexico is ordinarily blocked from
moving upstream by the river's flow, but the drought has dropped
the river to its lowest level in 120 years, said Robert Muller, the
state climatologist.
   Salt water, which threatens not only water supplies but also
marshes where oysters and other seafood grow, reached 57 miles
above the river's mouth Friday, said Corps spokesman Bruce Sossaman.
   The $600,000 dike of sand and clay will be constructed from bank
to bank near Myrtle Grove in Plaquemines Parish, 63 miles upstream
from the mouth of the river, the Corps said. New Orleans' Canal
Street at the edge of the French Quarter, is at the 95-mile mark.
   The dike will be about 600 feet wide at the base, 10 to 15 feet
high, and at least 45 feet beneath the surface so it won't disrupt
shipping, said Sossaman.
   Salt, which is heavier than water, travels in a wedge along the
river bottom.
   ``We know this is going to slow the salt down,'' said Joe
Dicharry, chief of the navigation section in the corps' engineering
division, ``but we don't know how much.''
   Construction is expected to take about 30 days, and the barrier
will be designed to wash away when the river flow returns to full
volume, he said.
   Sossaman said plans are for the structure to be built by Mike
Hooks Inc., a Lake Charles, La., company already under contract to
keep the river dredged in a broad area known as the Port of New
Orleans.
   ``What we hope to do now is to modify our contract (with Hooks)
so we can start on it next week,'' Sossaman said Friday.
   New Orleans and several other communities along the river in
south Louisiana draw their drinking water from the river.

   A Navy swimming instructor accused of
literally scaring a recruit to death by holding him under water has
been recommended for a court-martial, but five others accused in
the incident should face lesser punishment, a Navy spokesman said
Friday.
   Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael W. Combe, an instructor at the
Navy rescue swimmer school, was recommended for court-martial by
Rear Adm. David R. Morris, chief of naval air training, said Lt.
Cmdr. Dennis Hessler.
   The Navy accused Combe of holding the head of Airman Recruit Lee
Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., under water after Combe and other
instructors pushed or tossed the trainee into a pool when he
panicked and tried to quit the course.
   Morris, in Corpus Christi, Texas, recommended Combe's
court-martial to Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, chief of naval education
and training, the ranking officer in Pensacola, said Hessler,
Thunman's public affairs officer.
   Morris also decided to drop the manslaughter charges against all
of the instructors except Combe, Hessler said.
   Combe and four other instructors were charged with involuntary
manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery. Lt. Thomas A.
Torchia, the officer in charge of the school was accused only of
dereliction of duty, a lesser offense.
   At a hearing earlier this month, a pathologist testified that
Mirecki, who had a phobia about being dragged under water, died of
``sheer terror'' when he was forced back into the pool after trying
to quit the course.
   All five instructors were accused of shoving or throwing Mirecki
into the pool, while Combe was also accused of holding the young
man's head under water afterward. Mirecki died either of heart
failure brought about by fear or subsequently drowned, the
pathologist testified.
   All six defendants could have faced courts-martial, but Hessler
said Morris recommended that the other cases be resolved with
non-judicial punishment, a proceeding known as an ``admiral's
mast'' that only determines punishment, not guilt or innocence.
   Morris ``concluded that disciplinary action is appropriate,''
Hessler said.
   The five have until Monday to decide whether to ask for a formal
court-martial in hopes of clearing themselves outright or opting
for the lesser hearing on punishment, Hessler said.
   If court-martialed and found guilty, military defendants can get
time in prison and be removed from the service. Those penalties
cannot be imposed in a non-judicial proceeding, though lesser
punishment such as a reduction in rank can be ordered.
   Besides Torchia, the others recommended for the admiral's mast
hearing were Petty Officers 1st Class Richard E. Blevins and David
J. Smith and Petty Officers 2nd Class Frankie D. Deaton and John W.
Zelenock.
   Thunman will review Morris' recommendations and make the final
determination on whether Combe's case warrants a court-martial,
Hessler said.
   Mirecki's sister, Lynn Johansen, also of Appleton, said she was
not disappointed that some of the defendants could avoid a
court-martial.
   The family's main concerns were to find out how her brother died
and see that changes were made to prevent further deaths, Mrs.
Johansen said. The fact that new safety procedures were ordered at
the school after the death showed that ``Lee didn't die in vain,''
she said.
   Lawyers for Smith and Blevins said they had been told that
Morris had decided to dismiss the most serious charge against them,
the involuntary manslaughter count, but Hessler said he could not
confirm this.
   Several other defense lawyers declined comment.

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham said Friday he
will go to court to overturn his impeachment conviction and return
to office.
   ``We think that it's important to challenge this,'' Mecham said,
contending that leaving his conviction unchallenged would leave all
public officials open to impeachment.
   Mecham said he will not seek any political office this year but
will go to court in an effort to have his April 4 impeachment
conviction overturned.
   Mecham, in an interview on KTSP-TV, also blasted first-term Sen.
John McCain, a fellow Arizona Republican who has been mentioned as
a possible running mate for Vice President George Bush, the certain
GOP nominee.
   McCain, a first-term senator, called for Mecham's resignation in
January.
   ``No, John isn't qualified to be vice president,'' Mecham said.
``He doesn't have the intellect, he doesn't have the stature, he
doesn't have the honesty, he doesn't have the character that it
takes, and he certainly doesn't have the political foundation.''
   McCain, who was speaking Friday night in Watertown, S.D., on
Bush's behalf, said, ``Former Gov. Mecham is entitled to his
opinion. ... Nothing surprises me.''
   McCain said he was not seeking the vice presidential nomination,
noting that other qualified candidates come from states with more
electoral votes. He has said he backs Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.,
for the GOP second spot.
   Mecham and McCain are members of the Arizona delegation to the
national GOP convention in New Orleans Aug. 15-18.
   Mecham was convicted by the Senate on impeachment charges of
misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund, which he said
he did not believe was state money, and trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat. He was acquitted June 16
on criminal charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The former governor said he probably would take his challenge to
federal court, although the decision will be up to his lawyers. He
also said it was uncertain how soon it will be filed.
   Gov. Rose Mofford, the Democratic former secretary of state who
succeeded Mecham, said earlier Friday she plans to run for
re-election in 1990.

   A proposal being sent to President Reagan
would allow the federal government to draw up emergency evacuation
plans for nuclear power plants when local governments fail to do
so, published reports said Friday.
   The proposed executive order would give that authority to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, a move that could clear a
major obstacle to licensing the Seabrook plant in New Hampshire.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that White House aides
said the proposed order was endorsed by a cabinet-level group this
week and could be considered by Reagan as early as next week.
Formally composing and issuing the order could take several weeks,
the aides said.
   The Portsmouth Herald reported Friday that a draft of the
document directed FEMA ``to take immediately all action necessary
to ensure the establishment and maintenance of emergency
preparedness plans in circumstances where state and local
governments fail, for whatever reason, to come forward with plans.''
   That is the case at Seabrook, where Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis has refused to submit emergency plans for six Massachusetts
communities near the plant. The likely Democratic presidential
nominee says no plans could assure the safety of residents if there
were a major radiation release.
   Seabrook's utility owners have submitted emergency plans in
place of those Dukakis refuses to sign, but Massachusetts and other
opponents argue that utilities cannot legally pinch-hit for police
and other governmental agencies in a public emergency.
   The draft order addresses that issue by instructing FEMA ``to
ensure that the federal government, in a radiological emergency or
disaster, is prepared to assume any and all functions and
undertakings described.''
   Seabrook spokesman Rob Williams said he was unfamiliar with the
proposed order, but said plant owners and industry groups have been
pressing for some time for federal action to prevent Dukakis and
other governors from blocking nuclear-plant licenses.
   He said a number of plants nationwide ``have had experiences
where states have obstructed the emergency planning process, so we
have been pressing the federal government to resolve that issue.''
   Paul McEachern, a Democratic candidate for governor whose office
disclosed the proposed order on Thursday, said Reagan would be
breaking a promise he made in 1984 if he signed it.
   McEachern said Reagan ``pledged he would do nothing to curtail
states' rights to participate in the nuclear licensing process and
to protect the health and wefare of their citizens.''
   The anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance denounced the proposed
order. Alliance spokesman Roy Morrison said the order would amount
to a ``total collapse and corruption'' of federal regulation of
nuclear power.

   Defense Department and FBI investigators are
probing the thefts of two small computers on two consecutive nights
from the Star Wars offices in the Pentagon, a tightly controlled
security area.
   Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified said Friday
the theft of one privately owned computer and one government-owned
computer occurred two months ago and appeared to be ``an inside
job.''
   The thefts did not compromise any classified programs, but were
troubling because of the emphasis placed on physical security by
the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, the Pentagon unit
responsible for the Star Wars anti-missile program, the sources
added.
   The thief or thieves entered the facility by sabotaging the
security system protecting the Star Wars office, local television
station WJLA reported Friday. Videotape cameras failed to record
the theft because they had not been loaded _ a common occurence in
the high security office, the ABC affiliate, citing unidentified
Pentagon investigators for the information.
   Maj. Bill O'Connell, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement
that ``one privately owned stand-alone personal computer was stolen
from offices within the SDIO's Pentagon complex in early April.''
   ``Since that theft, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service
and the FBI have been conducting an investigation. The
investigation to date leads us to conclude that no national
security information was compromised in any way.''
   Late Friday, the spokesman released a second statement, saying
agents were investigating ``a potentially related matter
(involving) the disappearance of an IBM compatible AT class
personal computer ... from the SDIO computer training center.''
   ``No classified materials of any sort are used in the training
facility.''
   O'Connell declined to elaborate, but a source said the thefts
occurred over the weekend of April 9 and 10.
   The first theft, involving a Commodore personal computer owned
by a ``mid-level manager'' in the kinetic energy program, occurred
between Friday evening and Saturday morning. The second theft
occurred between Saturday evening and Sunday morning, the official
said.
   Kinetic energy weapons are designed to destroy enemy missiles
through the sheer force of impact.
   According to the source, investigators believe an SDIO employee
with the proper door-security card and clearances entered the
basement complex through the main doors, where a guard was on duty,
but then left with the computers through another security door that
is under television surveillance but not guarded.
   The Star Wars office complex is one of the few areas of the
Pentagon building that is off-limits to those without a special
security pass in addition to the normal building pass.

   The leftist Sandinista government
publicly urged the U.S.-supported rebels Friday to agree to renew
talks here next week to end Nicaragua's more than six-year-old
civil war.
   A statement by the presidential press office also suggested that
if the rebels refuse, a special preparatory meeting be held in
Miami to discuss prolonging the current cease-fire which ends June
30.
   The proposal coincides with a visit Secretary of State George P.
Shultz is making to Nicaragua's neighbors _ Guatemala, Honduras, El
Salvador and Costa Rica _ June 29-July 1 to discuss with the chiefs
executives of the four countries the situation in Central America.
   It also coincides with calls in Washington for the Reagan
administration to renew U.S. military aid to the Contras, as the
rebels are known. Shultz will not visit Nicaragua.
   The statement said the government made the proposal in a message
that Gen. Humberto Ortega, the Defense Minister, sent earlier
Friday to Alfredo Cesar, director of the Contra umbrella group
called Nicaraguan Resistance.
   Representatives from both sides have been negotiating one and
off since March 21 to end the war, agreeing so far only on a
provisional cease-fire. But they have been unable to agree on how
to make it permanent, and on Contra demands the Sandinistas
undertake democratic reforms before the rebels lay down their
weapons.
   The original 60-day truce ended May 30, and was extended by
tacit agreement for 30 days more, while the negotiations continued.
But the Contras broke off the last round of talks June 9 in
Managua, claiming the Sandinistas were not negotiating on good
faith over the reforms.
   Earlier this week, Ortega sent a message to the Contras urging a
new round of four days of talks in Managua beginning Sunday. The
rebel leaders have not replied.
   Ortega's brother, President Daniel Oretega, and other top
officials have been claiming the Shultz visit to the region is in
preparation for either direct or indirect U.S. military
intervention in Nicaragua.
   President Ortega repeated that claim Friday night, when he
publicly urged Sandinista soldiers to ``be ready to repel North
American aggression and quash the (Contra) mercenary forces.''
   Ortega spoke at a rally of 30,000 Sandinista supporters in the
main plaza of Masaya, a city 19 miles south of the capital.
   ``Today we face an enemy more powerful that Somoza and his
National Guard, and that is the government of the United States
which is trying to destroy the Nicaraguan revolution and does not
accept the reality of our democratic and revolutionary process,''
Ortega said.
   The Sandinistas seized power in July 1979, after overthrowing
the dictatorship of President Anastasio Somoza.

<TEXT>
   Mayflower descendant Phoebe Legere thinks her
ancestors might be rocking and rolling in their graves over her
nude photo spread in Playboy.
   She also plays with a rock band, stars in an upcoming horror
movie, lightens her blond hair, wears too much makeup and likes
body-revealing outfits.
   But the 26-year-old entertainer is ambivalent about her debut as
a centerfold, and was initially reluctant to even do the spread.
   She said the magazine ``niced'' her into doing the pictures. At
the time, she said, she felt devastated by the loss of a singing
job and the failure of her first record, which helped put her
$30,000 in debt.
   ``I was going through some very sad times,'' she said in an
interview. ``I felt a little degraded I guess, and I guess I wanted
to degrade myself even more. I guess I felt like I was just a piece
of flesh anyway and I thought maybe I should make enough money to
pay for my own funeral.''
   Someone at Playboy saw her picture on a promotional ad for a
performance at Carnegie Hall, and the magazine began courting her.
   She recalled telling the editors: ``Under no circumstances will
I perform nude. I'm a Mayflower descendant, a Vassar graduate (with
a 4.0 average), an intellectual. I'm a feminist.''
   She instead offered them erotic drawings she had done.
   ``They said ..., `Well this is fine but if you show us one
nipple we're going to make you very rich.' I said, `Absolutely not.
I'm an accomplished musician. I went to the New England
Conservatory (of Music).'''
   She eventually agreed to do it.
   ``They just wore me down,'' she said. ``I guess I just wanted a
little attention. I didn't have a boyfriend at the time. I was a
little lonely and that's about the size of it.''
   But life is pretty good these days for Legere. She has a part in
``Toxic Avenger II'' for Troma Productions, a New York-based
company of low-budget campy horror movies. Six of her songs will be
in the movie.
   She also has her own line of lingerie, designs her own clothes
and appears with her rock band, Blond Fox.
   In the recent movie, ``Mondo New York,'' which critics trounced,
she performs one of her own works, ``Marilyn Monroe.''
   Legere is no longer the innocent 17-year-old who came to New
York from Lexington, Mass., to attend Vassar College and take her
shot as a musician.
   ``I was totally preppy,'' she recalled. ``I was the flat shoe,
with my hair in a braid and no makeup and very politically
correct.''
   And, she said, it got her nowhere. So looked for inspiration to
the excesses of nightlife in the East Village.
   ``It wasn't until I started learning from the models and the
drag queens around me that I really began to attract attention,''
she said.
   She started to dress differently. She padded her face with
excessive makeup, lightened her blond hair and showed off her body.
And her popularity grew.
   But while she said she developed ``an appreciation of my own
anatomy,'' she says she remained true to her upbringing and her
ancestry, including Isaac Allerton and his daughter, Remember, who
rode the Mayflower to freedom.
   Legere said she seeks ``a kind of freedom of expression, freedom
to be beautiful and to make beauty, not just conform mindlessly to
some commercial notion of what music should sound like or what
women should look like.''
   She never quite felt comfortable in Massachusetts.
   ``There was great pressure to conform, to be normal. Blend.
Don't call attention to yourself. Wear brown,'' she said. ``All I
ever wanted was to be a great musician.''
   Still, if large-scale success comes her way, she might have to
tone down her act.
   ``I sort of imagine that when I get to the top I'll go back to
not wearing any makeup and wearing my hair in a braid,'' she said.

   New evidence has come in lately to buttress the
widely espoused belief that the stock market makes no sense.
   On May 17, the government reported a sharp drop in the trade
deficit and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 21.22
points.
   On June 14, the government reported another sharp drop in the
trade deficit and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
25.07 points.
   At least one large bank ran advertisements noting these
divergent performances, and suggested its certificates of deposit
as an alternative to stocks for people who wanted investments they
could understand.
   The bank had a point. Any investor with a strong desire for
order, simplicity and stability is probably better off avoiding any
strategy that depends on the day-to-day fluctuations of the stock
market.
   But to the charge that the market behaves irrationally, its
advocates respectfully plead innocent.
   Though the reasoning may get convoluted at times, they say,
there is almost always a method behind the madness portrayed on the
ticker tape.
   In the case of the recent trade reports, said Hugh Johnson, an
analyst at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y., the explanation for
the market's differing responses lay not far below the surface.
   ``In both instances,'' he noted, ``the trade deficit declined
significantly.
   ``However, the decline in the March deficit (reported in May)
signaled that the economy may be strengthening, and the decline in
the April deficit (reported in June) signaled that the economy may
be weakening.
   ``The March trade deficit improved because exports surged,
suggesting that domestic demand in West Germany, Japan, etc., was
strengthening and was placing pressure on U.S. manufacturers to
meet that demand.
   ``This was viewed by the financial markets as inflationary.
   ``The April trade deficit improved because imports declined,
suggesting that domestic demand in the U.S. was slowing. This
suggested inflation may not be as big a problem as it has been made
out to be.
   ``The two events, when taken together and reviewed along with
the market's reaction to other recent releases, demonstrate how
important it is to the financial markets that the economy slows
down from the pace of the prior three quarters.''
   In other words, stock traders' reactions to the trade reports
were simply a new variation on a theme that has become familiar on
Wall Street in the 1980s: ``Good news is bad news,'' and vice versa.
   Favorable news for near-term business activity conjures up
images of increased inflation, rising interest rates and
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve, all of which could serve
as prelude to a recession.
   Unfavorable news for near-term business activity evokes visions
of reduced inflation, falling interest rates and stimulative credit
policy from the Fed, all of which could set the stage for renewed
growth later on.
   Suppose you have worked your way through all this and you still
don't buy it.
   How could one monthly report on a single aspect of the economy
send fears of inflation rippling through the market, and another
four weeks later persuade thousands of investors that things were
not so bad after all?
   Well, one could argue, expectations do not really change that
radically. When the market rises or falls 20 points as measured by
the Dow, it is actually moving up or down by about 1 percent to
adjust for the latest information received.
   And at the same time, one could acknowledge that this
``adjustment'' process is emotional, messy and sometimes outright
violent.
   Most devotees of the stock market will readily admit to all
that. Just don't try to tell them it is nonsensical.

<HEAD>NBC's Summer Documentaries: Edward R. Murrows Need Not Apply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine Edward R. Murrow trying to sell CBS'
landmark 1960 documentary, ``Harvest of Shame,'' to NBC programming
executives these days:
   Murrow: ``This is an important story. Americans don't realize
the very food they eat is reaped by oppressed migrant farmworkers
who live in squalor, plagued by poverty, disease, indifference ..
.''
   NBC executives: ``Well, it might fit in our `Summer Showcase'
documentary series. But it's so depressing. There are no
celebrities. Just poor people who aren't even violent or anything.''
   Murrow: ``A television network is supposed to inform the
public.''
   NBC executives: ``Yeah, but did you see the lousy demos on that
homeless documentary?''
   Murrow: ``Is that all you people care about, ratings?''
   NBC executives: ``No, no, of course not. ... What if we got
Robert Redford to narrate it?''
   The network that has been No. 1 in the ratings for three years
but just can't seem to find room for a prime-time news show _ the
last, tellingly enough, was ``1986'' _ has chosen the season of
least viewership to run a series of documentaries packaged as a
yatta-yatta-yatta kind of entertainment event, ``Summer Showcase.''
   The first, airing Tuesday, is ``Of Macho and Men,'' another of
the lifestyle documentaries that are becoming endemic to NBC.
Admittedly entertaining and high-rated, they offer little new
information and their point of view is about as sharp as a
marshmallow.
   ``Life in the Fat Lane'' was a mostly light-hearted look at the
length to which Americans will go to stay thin, and ``Scared
Sexless'' took a walk down the well-trodden path of sexual
attitudes in the age of AIDS.
   ``Women in Prison'' was an exception, a thoughtful, informative
portrait of a part of society that most Americans tend to think of
in terms of stereotypes.
   And NBC has had a few worthwhile hard-news documentaries,
notably last year's ``Home Street Home'' about the homeless and
``Six Days Plus 20 Years: A Dream Is Dying,'' a hard-ball look at
the situation on the West Bank from the viewpoint of the
Palestinians.
   ``Summer Showcase'' will offer at least one serious documentary,
``The Pension Cookie Jar,'' a last offering from legendary producer
Reuven Frank before he retires to take a fellowship at Columbia
University's Gannett Center.
   In ``Of Macho and Men,'' correspondents Deborah Norville and
Lucky Severson interview men who complain of a variety of ills,
from being wrongly accused of sexual harassment to getting shot
point-blank by an angry wife. But the correspondents offer no point
of view and might as well have turned to the camera, shrugged and
broken into a chorus of ``Ain't That a Shame.''
   Norville interviews an inarticulate male strip teaser at the
nightclub Chippendales for his opinion on, like, whatever. Evidence
of ``male-bashing'' is provided by clips of Sam the bartender being
clobbered by various females in the NBC sitcom ``Cheers.'' Hey, why
pass up an opportunity to publicize the real entertainment on the
network?
   There is one enlightening segment, a comparison of two cases of
sexual abuse of minors _ one involving a 14-year-old girl seduced
by a male teacher, the other a boy the same age seduced by a female
librarian. The male teacher got 12 years in prison, the librarian
got no jail time. A judge didn't think a boy could be
psychologically damaged by such an experience.
   Then back to heart-warming segments as fathers show they are
good parents, too, not exactly stop-the-presses stuff. There is
passing reference to the number of divorced fathers who don't pay
child support.
   Norville sums up with the courageous stand: ``Obviously, we
haven't resolved any of these conflicts, but what we hope we've
done is open some eyes. Equality is a two-way street, and more and
more men are realizing these days they haven't always gotten a fair
deal.''
   Maybe NBC viewers will start noticing the same thing. Isn't
there a rerun of ``thirtysomething'' on the other channel?

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Are there circumstances in which it should be
permissible to take a terminally ill person's life? How should _
and how does _ society deal with mercy killings and the mounting
challenge of those who advocate euthanasia? A number of recent
tragedies have underscored the ethical, legal and medical dilemma.
This is the first of three articles exploring acts, attitudes, and
the current soul-searching on the subject.

   In a moment of abandon one March day a
year ago, in a respite from finality, Henry Brod and his wife, Li,
dined on roast duck and white wine at their favorite restaurant and
topped off the evening by watching ballet star Rudolf Nureyev
dance. It was one of those rare days.
   Then Li, 61, suffering from terminal cancer, went home to die by
eating Jell-O laced with the powder from 35 Seconal capsules,
washing it down with bourbon. Henry had helped her get the
barbiturates in small doses from two doctors under the pretense
that she was having nightmares. They had planned her death together
but she would choose the time, a little after midnight, March 12,
1987, without telling her husband.
   ``Facing pain and surgery without hope of cure, she decided on a
good death rather than a lingering one,'' says Brod, a 63-year-old
psychologist. ``The means was suicide. Morally and spiritually, we
were together. She took her own pills. I was not involved in the
legal sense.''
   The Brod case, several recent mercy killings and a sensational
article by an anonymous physician in a leading medical journal,
have given a fresh impetus to the long dispute over whether, when,
and in what circumstances, euthanasia would be legally warranted.
   Proponents of euthanasia tried to get the issue on the November
ballot in California, but fell short of the required number of
signatures on their petition.
   That campaign caused less of a stir nationally than an article,
``It's Over, Debbie,'' in the Journal of the American Medical
Association in January. The author, whose name has never been
disclosed, described the mercy killing _ through an injection of
morphine _ of a 20-year-old woman who was dying of ovarian cancer.
   Some physicians, including Dr. John H. Burkhart, chairman of the
AMA's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, have questioned the
authenticity of the account because some details don't jibe.
   ``We performed no independent investigation, so we can't assure
you whether the event occurred,'' says Dr. George D. Lundberg, the
journal's editor. ``We believe the author to be telling the truth.
   ``Many people who have been speaking loudly about this case have
assumed it was current and in this country. Neither assumption is
necessarily true. Our journal is read in every country in the world
and we receive articles from very many countries.''
   In any case, Lundberg adds: ``Whether the essay was true or not
is irrelevant to our purpose. Our plan was to stimulate debate on
the subject of suffering and dying from many viewpoints. We
succeeded extremely well.''
   Lundberg says the journal received about 300 letters, one of the
highest number ever for the publication, and that as a follow-up it
ran 10 pages of letters, editorials and commentary. He said the
article resulted in workshops and seminars across the country,
particularly on university campuses, and debate in the letters
columns of many newspapers.
   ``There is now more than ever a serious concern about prolonging
dying by technological means and there is much debate about the
process of dying and the alleviation of pain,'' he says.
   ``All of this is occurring at a time when the Netherlands allows
thousands of terminally ill patients to be put to death by doctors
without prosecution and California has been considering a
referendum to legalize euthanasia.''
   The National Hemlock Society, a Los Angeles-based organization
with 24,000 members, and its political arm, Americans Against Human
Suffering, are proposing legislation in California that would allow
doctors to give terminally ill adults lethal doses of drugs upon
the patient's written request.
   The present law permits the withdrawal or withholding of
life-support systems such as respirators under certain conditions.
These include a living will signed by the patient, specifying he or
she does not want to be kept alive by artificial means, or a power
of attorney if the person becomes incompetent or incapacitated.
   Thirty-seven other states and the District of Columbia have
adopted similar living will laws. A number of other states have
recognized the patient's right to refuse treatment through court
decisions.
   Under the proposal in California, the Humane and Dignified Death
Act, two physicians must certify that the patient would die within
six months. The patient's signed declaration must be witnessed
independently by two people who would not stand to gain from the
death. The family must be informed and anything they say must be
considered even though they can't stop it.

   The first effort failed when Americans Against Human Suffering
got only 250,000 valid signatures of the 372,128 required by the
May 8 deadline to put the issue on the California ballot.
   The Hemlock Society and Americans Against Human Suffering plan
to try again in 1990, not only in California, but also in Oregon,
Washington state and Florida.
   The Hemlock Society draws its name from the hemlock weed that
ancient Greeks used in suicide. It was founded in 1980 by Derek
Humphry, a 58-year-old English journalist, and his second wife, Ann
Wickett.
   Humphry, the society's director, watched bone cancer ravage his
first wife, Jean, for 2{ years, when the couple was living in
England. They talked about their plans for euthanasia for nine
months. She asked him to help her and picked the day: March 29,
1975.
   On that day, Humphry made her a mug of coffee mixed with
sleeping pills and pain killers that he obtained from a doctor
friend. He placed it on the table beside her. They embraced. She
said, ``Goodbye, my love.'' Fifty minutes later she was dead at age
42.
   Only a close circle of friends shared his secret until three
years after his wife's death when he published a book about his
experience, ``Jean's Way,'' which tipped off law enforcement
officials. He offered to plead guilty, but English authorities
decided against prosecuting him.
   By the time the book was published in America in 1979, he was
living in the United States, moving from the Sunday Times of London
to the Los Angeles Times. Deluged by invitations for speaking
appearances and hundreds of letters asking for help, he says, he
started the Hemlock Society.
   The society publishes a suicide manual, ``Let Me Die Before I
Wake,'' which Humphry says sells 1,500 copies a month.
   ``Obviously a fair number of people are using it,'' he says.
``Isn't it better that there be a tougher law, a tougher standard,
rather than the covert way it's happening now?''
   It was this book that the Brods used to plan Li's suicide after
hearing Humphry speak in Sarasota. She had the pills for two months
before choosing her time of death.
   ``Every night I was wondering if she'd do it,'' says Brod, now
an eastern regional director of the Hemlock Society. ``Once Li had
her 35 pills she was free of all worry, anxiety, of all the panic
that had to do with slow, painful death. We had decided to go out
and have all sorts of fun and do all of the things she wanted to
do.''
   Brod was questioned extensively by the county sheriff but no
charges were filed against him.
   While both he and Humphry walked away free men, that was not the
case with Charles Griffith and Roswell Gilbert, both serving 25
years in Florida jails without parole for mercy killings.
   Susan M. Wolf, an associate for law at the Hastings Center, a
research institute on medical ethics in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., is
troubled by the inconsistency and the enormous room for
prosecutorial discretion in mercy killings.
   ``I think the consensus among legal scholars remains that it
should not be legalized,'' she says. ``One of the proposals has
been to recognize mercy killing as a defense to a homicide charge
or in some ways treat mercy killing separately and more leniently.
Currently, it amounts to homicide but prosecutors handle it very
differently. So we have the extreme of the Gilbert case all the way
to complete non-prosecution.''
   By his own account in a recent telephone interview and in
testimony at his trial, Gilbert shot his wife of 51 years, Emily,
to death on March 4, 1985, as she lay on a sofa in their Fort
Lauderdale condominium, her mind wasted by Alzheimer's disease, her
body brittle from the bone disease osteoporosis. She was 72.
   ``Roswell, I love you dearly,'' she told her husband, a retired
electronics engineer. ``Why does everybody hurt me so. I don't hurt
anybody. Somebody please help me. Please, God, somebody help me.''
   ``Who's that somebody but me, you know,'' Gilbert asked himself.
``And there she was in pain and all this confusion and I guess if I
got cold as ice water that's what had happened. I thought to
myself, `I've got to do it, it's got to be mine. I've got to end
her suffering. This can't go on.'''
   Griffith shot his 3-year-old daughter, Joy, to death on July 3,
1985, in a Miami hospital where she had been for eight months with
brain damage suffered when she got her head caught in a recliner
chair. The oxygen to her brain was cut off long enough so that she
was left in a chronic vegetative state.

   ``They cut a hole in my baby's throat for the machine,''
Griffith wrote in a letter from his jail cell published in the July
1987 issue of Hemlock Quarterly. ``They drilled a bolt into her
head to monitor her brain's swelling. They also put a tube in her
stomach to feed her through and splints on her arms and legs to
keep her from curling up.''
   Griffith said he tried everything to wake her up but nothing
worked.
   ``I would rub lemon juice, saltwater and sugarwater on her lips.
I would put hot and cold washcloths on her arms and legs, telling
her, `This is cold, Joy,' or `This is hot, honey.' I also flashed
different colored lights in her eyes, telling her what each color
was. I would sit there and stroke her and cry and I heard her ask
me not to let her hurt anymore. I know that Joy is in heaven. She
can see, talk, play, and laugh again.''
   Griffith's attorney, Benedict P. Kuehne, called his case ``a
tragedy for the criminal justice system, which is not equipped to
resolve the problem of misguided mercy killings, and thus must
resort to murder prosecutions when such cases do not belong in that
category.''
   The Hemlock Society's Humphry says it does not approve of
violent mercy killings but that in the cases of Gilbert and
Griffith, they had no choice because nobody offered them a legal or
better way out.
   The American Medical Association and many doctors like Burkhart,
the chairman of its Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, oppose
active euthanasia.
   ``It is murder or manslaughter, depending on what the court
says,'' Burkhart says. ``As long as it is illegal, that in itself
is enough for the AMA to oppose it. It's against the medical oath
to kill. You can't be a healer and a killer at the same time.''
   Just the same, 60 percent of 2,218 Colorado doctors responding
to a survey in that state said they have had patients for whom they
thought euthanasia would be justified if legal. Almost all said
they would have given them a lethal drug if allowed.
   ``In one form or another, euthanasia is being practiced by
decent professionals and supported by the affected patients,'' says
Dr. Frederick Abrams, associate director of the Center for Health
Ethics and Policy at the University of Colorado at Denver. ``Yet it
is opposed by large numbers of people. We must develop consensus in
Colorado concerning legal and ethical ground rules.''
   AMA guidelines allow for passive euthanasia, the equivalent of
withholding and withdrawing care from terminally ill patients on
their instructions. In a recent survey by the AMA, 78 percent of
1,000 randomly selected physicians said they favor withdrawing
life-support systems, including food and water, from hopelessly ill
or irreversibly comatose patients if they or their families request
it.
   Like many other doctors, Nancy Dickey, a family physician in
Richmond, Texas, sees a distinction between active and passive
euthanasia.
   ``I think it's difficult to maintain the trust my patients have
when I also become an executioner,'' she said. ``I have an
obligation when patients are facing death to make that dignified
and as pain-free as possible. There is a difference in me no longer
delaying that from happening and in me deciding on the time and
place and mechanism of death. Doctors have been known to be wrong
both about diagnosis and time schedules.''
   At Griffith's trial, a pediatric neurologist testified that the
deeper areas in the base of his daughter's brain were spared
damage, that she was showing progressive recovery, could breathe by
herself, could see and possibly hear and could tell who was taking
care of her.
   In the Gilbert trial, Emily Gilbert's doctor testified that a
month before her death she was having less pain from her
osteoporosis, that she suffered no physical pain from Alzheimer's
and that she could have conceivably lived another 5 to 10 years.
   But Roswell Gilbert says he was desperate, that he didn't know
which way to turn, that he just went over the edge. He says he has
no regrets even though he will be 100 years old by the time his
sentence is up.
   ``If she'd continued to live, she'd have suffered a lot more
than I'm suffering in here,'' he says.

   While some see growing support for active euthanasia in certain
segments of the American population, many leading experts on
medical ethics, lawmakers, doctors, lawyers and religious leaders
remain strongly opposed.
   For some, the answer is living wills, directives to withhold
treatment and to give them as much drugs as required to keep them
free of pain even if it speeds up their deaths in cases of
incurable illnesses or irreversible injuries where two examining
doctors certify there is no hope for recovery.
   Dr. John Burkhart, chairman of the American Medical
Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, personally
opposes euthanasia but says:
   ``I think attitudes have changed to where active euthanasia
would find favor with many people and perhaps many of the newer
physicians.''
   Burkhart, a 67-year-old family physician in Knoxville, Tenn.,
who has been practicing 40 years, believes active euthanasia will
be the next step; he cautions that it would require many
restraints, consultations and supporting opinions.
   ``But there's a lot of problems with that,'' he says, ``because
once you get to where you can practice active euthanasia for people
who are terminally ill, the next step is to begin to do it for
people who are mentally incompetent, old and with no place to live,
just in the way, costing the family money, getting in their hair.
   ``Sooner or later it gets to the place where the unwanted are
the ones, for whatever reason, at risk.''
   Daniel Callahan, a noted author and expert on medical ethics who
is the director of the Hastings Center, says he opposes active
euthanasia because he, too, thinks the potential for abuse is great
and because he has not been persuaded that there is a desperate
need for it.
   Callahan and another author expert, Dr. Eric J. Cassell,
professor of public health at Cornell University Medical College in
New York City, say that doctors are not trained well enough in
making patients' last days comfortable and do not give them enough
painkillers.
   The reasons, Callahan says, are that marijuana and heroin, both
painkillers, are not legally or morally accepted, that there is a
lingering fear that patients will become addicted to other drugs or
that heavy doses may shorten their lives.
   ``There's a feeling if you do that, you might be accused of
murdering the patient,'' he said. ``So there's a kind of wariness
of going too close to that line and the result is that they stay
too far away from the line. I don't think that legally, or in terms
of medical ethics, it has been historically considered wrong to
provide pain relief even if it may have the effect of shortening
life.''

   Allan Bakke will say he has been working two
years as an anesthesiologist in a southern Minnesota town best
known for the Mayo Clinic.
   But the conversation ends there. Bakke, who claimed reverse
discrimination 15 years ago when his application for medical school
was passed over in favor of minority applicants, has maintained
silence over the case by refusing all requests for interviews. Even
with his colleagues the subject is taboo.
   ``I just really don't want to do it at all,'' Bakke said to an
interview request when reached by telephone at the Olmsted Medical
Group in Rochester, where he went on staff Aug. 11, 1986.
   According to the state Medical Examiners Board, the 48-year-old
Minneapolis native earned his medical degree June 18, 1982, from
the University of California Medical School at Davis. He served a
four-year residency at the Mayo Clinic and was licensed to practice
medicine in Minnesota in 1983. His file at the Medical Examiners
Board is free of any disciplinary reports.
   ``It would have been unfortunate had he not been able to pursue
his career,'' said Dr. Gary Oftedahl, medical director at the
45-doctor Olmsted clinic. ``Like any of us he could be replaced,
but it would have been unfortunate.''
   Oftedahl said Bakke doesn't socialize with his colleagues at the
clinic and is known for his quiet demeanor.
   ``He does a good job making patients feel comfortable before
they go into anesthesia,'' Oftedahl said. ``He's conscientious.''
   Bakke once led a fight to keep a federal prison out of a
Rochester neighborhood, said Dr. Gertrude Tyce, who worked with
Bakke as a member of the Olmsted Citizens for a Better Community.
The group's effort failed even though a non-binding referendum on
whether the city should allow the prison drew a record number of
voters who overwhelmingly opposed the prison.
   Tyce said the referendum was Bakke's pet project.
   ``I think Allan is a great guy,'' she said. ``He's a very
straight-up guy. Right is right and wrong is wrong.''
   But like Oftedahl, Tyce noted that Bakke steadfastly avoids
discussing the 10-year-old U.S. Supreme Court decision that cleared
his path into medical school.
   ``We thought he was sort of a local celebrity and introduced him
as such,'' Tyce said. ``He changed the subject immediately.''
   The blue-eyed, blond-haired Bakke, who worked 11 years as a
research engineer for NASA before studying to be a doctor, lives in
a $210,000 house just outside the city limits which he bought in
October 1986 with his wife, Judith, according to Olmstead County
real estate records. The couple has at least two children, Oftedahl
said.
   According to records at the state Board of Medical Examiners,
Bakke attended high school in Coral Gables, Fla., and earned his

   The first days of summer brought record heat, little rain and
wilting hopes of averting the Dust Bowl of 1988.
   ``Watching a drought is almost like watching paint dry,'' said
Ron Affeldt, director of the Office of Emergency Management in
hard-hit North Dakota, ``but out there today, it is happening fast,
extremely fast.''
   The impact was measured not only in failing crops, but in
frantic commodity trading, surging electric power demand,
restrictions on lawn-watering and car-washing in dozens of towns
and shipping backed up on the no longer mighty Mississippi. The
river was 20 feet below its year-ago levels at Memphis, Tenn.,
where more than a thousand barges were stranded.
   In some respects, it was already a lost summer. Rain could still
save some crops, said Kansas Agriculture Secretary Sam Brownback,
but ``the pastures are so short they're never going to get ahead of
the herd _ they're past their growing.''
   However, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said Thursday that
hard, steady rains in the next two weeks could still prevent major
damage and that it was still too early to commit federal money to
drought relief.
   In the past week, the drought was measured in many ways:
   _ The U.S. Department of Agriculture listed 1,231 counties, 40
percent of the total, as having a drought emergency.
   _ The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the number of streams
with normal flow in May was the lowest in six years, with only 54
percent of 191 river measuring stations at normal or better.
Streamflows in California were 42 percent below average in May. The
Saline River in Arkansas had only 10 percent of normal flow, while
the Tombigbee River at Coatopa, Ala., was 15 percent of normal.
   _ Sixty-one cities had record high temperatures on Tuesday, 64
set records on Wednesday and 35 on Thursday.
   _ Cows were selling for 39 cents a pound, down from 51-52 cents
two weeks ago, as farmers rushed to get rid of herds they could no
longer feed.
   _ Tom George, administrator of Soil Conservation Service erosion
surveys, said wind erosion damaged 13.1 million parched acres in
the Great Plains this year, about three times the annual average.
   _ Corn prices have doubled in a month, from $1.70-$1.85 in May
to $3.48 at Thursday's close. Soybeans nudged close to $11 a bushel
for July delivery.
   ``With the corn crop, each week that goes by without rain means
another 10 percent is lost,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with
Research Department Inc. in Chicago. Some estimate anywhere from 10
percent to 30 percent of the U.S. corn crop already has been ruined.
   While that was bad news for consumers, farmers with adequate
rain and those with grain in storage stood to reap windfall profits.
   ``I'm afraid we're going to lose some farmers, and we've lost
enough already in my state,'' said Gov. George Sinner of North
Dakota, one of 10 Midwest governors who met with Lyng in Chicago
last week.
   The bottom line for consumers, the Agriculture Department said,
is a 1 percent increase in food prices if the drought persists.
   Grain-based foods, such as bread and pasta, were likely to
increase the most, economists said, but drought was also likely to
raise the price of beer. Barley, a prime ingredient in beer, had
increased from $2.55-$2.60 a bushel to $4.30-$4.50 since June 6,
said Marge Jones, owner and publisher of the Brewers Bulletin in
Woodstock, Ill.
   Low river levels also posed a pollution threat, because there
wasn't enough water in many places to properly dilute sewage and
other wastes.
   Flows were barely adequate to handle discharges from pulp and
paper mills along the Fox and Wisconsin rivers, said Bruce Baker,
director of water resource management for Wisconsin's Department of
Natural Resources.
   ``Once a flow drops below risk level, waste from the plants
exceeds a river's capacity to assimilate it,'' Baker said. ``At
that point, we must just sit back and watch the fish die.''
   But it's not so easy to raise levels even where stored water is
available. The Army Corps of Engineers found that discharging water
from the Gavins Point Dam on the South Dakota-Nebraska border might
wash awy the nests of piping plovers and interior least terns, both
federally protected species.
   ``I guess we've got conflicting interests here,'' said Chet
Worm, chief of reservoir operations for the corps in Omaha, told
The Kansas City Star. ``Sometimes you forget the river has all
kinds of users, not just people.''
   The dry heat raised concern about the dreaded ``greenhouse
effect,'' the theory that all the carbon dioxide pumped into the
atmosphere by our cars, furnaces and factories, was warming the
climate.
   ``Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe
with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship
between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming,'' James
Hansen, a climatalogist at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York
City, told a congressional committee.
   However, Hansen added, there was no way to prove the
``greenhouse'' caused this heat wave.
   Hot it was, but it wasn't miserable for everyone.
   ``The weather's been really nice ident and wine maker for Glenora Wine
Cellars near
Dundee, N.Y.
   Hot weather was great for business at Press Box East, an
air-conditioned restaurant in Charlotte, N.C. ``People are staying
longer,'' said general manager Bobbie Barley. ``Instead of having
just a cold beer, they're staying for dinner.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's a school for do-it-yourself sheep shearers
in western Pennsylvania, where sheep farmers are largely
part-timers who have small flocks of 50 or less. But somebody still
has to shear them and therein lies the problem. Commercial shearers
don't want to fool with small flocks.

   Shearing a sheep is nothing like cutting hair.
There's no delicacy, no style, and no one seems to mind if the
customer suffers a few nicks, scrapes or even gouges _ as long as
they're not near a vital organ.
   The idea is to cut off the fleece as quickly as possible
because, like little boys, sheep get fidgety around barbers.
   ``It's harder than it looks,'' says Shirley Mounts of
Claysville, wiping the sweat off her brow with the back of a hand
after tackling a half-shorn ewe seeking freedom. ``I'm always
afraid I'm going to cut the daylights out of them.''
   One sad ewe ambled off with about four sizable cuts, but nobody
seemed concerned.
   ``They're a long way from the heart,'' remarked one student as
Mrs. Mounts, 32, fretted over her blunders.
   Mrs. Mounts was one of 18 sheep fanciers who recently took a
class on how to cut fleece without cutting the animal. The two-day
program, sponsored by the Washington County agricultural extension
office, is held once a year during the spring shearing season in
this hilly, farm-studded corner of southwestern Pennsylvania.
   Sheep farmer David Horn opens up his large, wooden barn, perched
on a slope overlooking neatly grazed pastures, and provides
students with as many ``customers'' as they need to hone their
skills. In return, Horn gets about half of his flock of 180 shorn
for free, although the results are a little ragtag.
   ``I was going to experiment with mine, but I'm sort of glad I
didn't. I think I would have killed them,'' said Dave Krupski, 30,
who raises 15 sheep on a relative's farm in Independence Township.
   ``It's hard work, believe it or not. A lot of them aren't lambs,
they're lions. Some will sit and lay in your lap, but the ones with
the horns are real feisty. I've done five sheep in eight hours, and
they say the Australians can do a sheep every 1{ minutes.''
   Agricultural extension agents say that after two days of
classes, students are able to shear a sheep in about five minutes.
   Speed means money to commercial shearers, who charge about $2 a
head. But for the students, who just want to learn enough to shear
their own flocks, speed means the difference between doing it right
and not doing it at all.
   Sheep get fussy if they're fussed over for too long.
   After years of hard times, sheep farming in this country is on
the rebound. In the West, it's a full-time job because flocks
number in the hundreds and thousands. But in Eastern states like
Pennsylvania, sheep farmers are largely part-timers who have small
flocks of 50 or less, says the appropriately named Joanna Shepherd
of the Washington County extension service.
   In Washington and neighboring Greene County, the state's two
leading sheep-raising counties, commercial shearers are a premium,
she says. Sheep farmers, particularly those with small flocks, have
been turning to the classes mainly because they can't find anyone
to do the job.
   Last year, nine people signed up for beginning sheep shearing.
This year, 22 wanted to attend, but four had to be turned away
because there weren't enough instructors.
   ``We have only 35 sheep. People don't want to be bothered with
them,'' says Bill Smith, 39, of Lagonda. ``Then when you do find
someone, they don't show up till the end of June, and your sheep
are about dying from the heat.''
   At one end of the barn, extension agent Ed Wood coached a
teen-age boy on the importance of keeping his free hand away from
the clipper's sharp teeth.
   ``Get your hands out of the wool or you'll cut yourself,'' Wood
barked over the incessant buzzing of a dozen clippers.
   But as the teen moved his hand away, he failed to pull the skin
taut, causing the clippers to leave about a {-inch layer of fuzz.
   ``You're leaving too much wool on her,'' Wood complained. ``If
you sold wool you wouldn't have enough money to go out on Saturday
nights.''
   To get the maximum value for a fleece, it has to be cut closely
with long strokes so it comes off all in one piece. Shearers start
from the back left side, work up to the belly, head and back, and
then repeat the procedure on the right side, ending up at the back
right leg.
   Proper clipping technique means nothing, though, if the shearer
can't pin down a struggling, 130-pound sheep.
   ``You need to know where to put your legs, how to hold the
animal, how to stretch their skin,'' Ms. Shepherd says. ``You
concentrate on how to get the wool off later.''
   For Horn and most of the country's sheep farmers, who mainly
raise sheep for meat, wool is a secondary commodity. A fleece from
most meat breeds weighs about five pounds, with the price per pound
averaging just under $1, Ms. Shepherd says. After paying for the
price of shearing, the farmer makes about $3 per animal from the
wool.
   If the fleece is cut improperly or is too dirty or coarse, he
gets even less.
   Sheep are shorn late in the spring after cold weather has passed
but before the onset of summer's high temperatures. Domestic sheep
have to be shorn once a year to maintain a high-quality fleece and
to rid the animal of accumulated dirt and parasites. And it simply
helps them feel more comfortable.
   Sometimes, though, their drastic change in appearance is
unsettling _ especially to their own lambs.
   ``A lot of them don't recognize their mothers at first,'' Horn
says. ``They'll bawl for a while.''
   An increasing number of people in Pennsylvania are turning to
sheep as a hobby or to supplement their incomes, Ms. Shepherd says.
   ``People like sheep,'' she says. ``It's an animal most of us can
physically handle without a lot of fuss. They don't take a whole
lot, they just eat grass and a little bit of grain. And they're
nice. They must be, just look at what these students are doing to
them.''

   The U.S. economy grew at a strong 3.6 percent
rate in the first three months of 1988, prompting the Reagan
administration to boost its growth forecast for the remainder of
the year.
   After the October stock market collapse, many private economists
expected a slowdown or recession this year. But booming growth in
the last quarter of 1987 and continued strength this year had
analysts revising their forecasts.
   Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, raised the administration's GNP forecast for all of 1988
to 3.5 percent on Thursday. He also predicted consumer price
inflation would hold steady at 4.3 percent.

   The Commerce Department said Thursday that profits dipped to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $144.2 billion, down $1.4
billion from the last three months of 1987.
   It was sharpest drop since first quarter 1987, when profits fell
3.7 percent.

   Domestic car sales were up 11.9 percent and domestic light truck
sales gained 14.3 percent from mid-June 1987, automakers reported
Thursday. The sales rate picked up considerably from early June,
industry analysts said.
   In the eight selling days of June 11-20, automakers sold 222,262
domestic cars and 127,195 domestic light trucks, up from 223,376

   Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter says
the already-costly farm subsidy battle could escalate further
unless progress is made on eliminating all subsidies by 2000.
   Yeutter said Thursday that Congress could increase export
subsidies, just as it did in 1985, if it appeared that current
global trade negotiations on the matter are at a stalemate.
   ``Sometimes one must have a higher level of confrontation in
order to achieve progress,'' Yeutter told a news conference held
during trade talks with America's largest trading partners.

   Democrats have mounted an ambitious attempt to
put a layoff notice bill on President Reagan's desk by July 4 while
holding a revised trade bill hostage to overriding an expected
White House veto before the Republican National Convention.
   But, using a combination of speeches and long periods of silence
on the Senate floor Thursday, Republicans thwarted Democratic
efforts to win passage of the layoff-plant closing notice bill by
the end of this week.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, on Thursday re-introduced _ without
the plant closing provision _ a trade bill vetoed by Reagan last
month. A similarly stripped-down bill was introduced in the House
last week.

   A one-time associate of former Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger who was brought to the Pentagon to
control procurement says he quit in frustration last fall because
Weinberger and President Reagan failed to support his management
reforms.
   ``I differ 100 percent with the (former) secretary of defense
who said the system is fine but we have a few bad apples,'' said
Richard P. Godwin, former undersecretary of defense for acquisition.
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Godwin, the former president
of Bechtel Civil and Minerals Inc., called the Pentagon procurement
process a ``national crisis,'' as serious for the country as drug
trafficking and the AIDS epidemic.

   Growth in the communications industry over the
next five years should exceed the expected growth in the overall
economy and expansion in other leading industries, according to an
investment banker that specializes in media deals.
   The industry is expected to grow at an average annual rate of
10.1 percent through 1992, down from its 10.9 percent expansion
pace for the previous five years, the firm Veronis, Suhler &
Associates Inc. reported Tuesday.
   The firm's report covers revenue forecasts for radio,
television, newspapers, magazines, recorded music, books, films and
information services.
   Veronis Suhler said gross revenue in the communications industry
should rise to $218 billion in 1992 from $134.9 billion in 1987.
   The report said the overall economy is expected to grow at a 7.5
percent rate annually over the next five years.
   Veronis Suhler said the communications industry's growth will
exceed what it expects will be the annual growth rates for 11 other
major industries over the next five years, including 9.6 percent in
health and medical services, 8.5 percent in educational services
and 8.4 percent in electronic equipment.
   It was the second annual five-year forecast from the investment
firm. Last year, it forecast a 10.3 percent growth in the
communications business for the period 1987 through 1991.
   A slowdown in the expansion of fast-rising home video, cable and
business information segments accounted for the lower expansion
projection for the next five years.
   Television broadcast ad spending is expected to rise 11.5
percent a year to $40.4 billion by 1992, the report said. That
includes 8.5 percent annual growth in spending on the broadcast
networks to $13.3 billion in 1992, it said.
   ``Network television will continue to lose both audience share
and share of advertising dollars over the next five years,'' the
report said.
   Television stations revenues should grow at an annual rate of
12.8 percent to $25.1 billion by 1992, the report said, while
barter syndication, a system under which programs are exchanged for
the rights to sell commercials on the shows, will account for
another $2 billion in revenue.
   Veronis Suhler said the increased availability of quality
programming should enable independent stations to compete more
effectively with network affiliates.
   Cable television revenues are expected to grow at a rate of 9.2
percent a year to nearly $16 billion by 1992, including $13.5
billion from subscription fees and $2.5 billion from advertising,
the report said.
   By 1992, Veronis Suhler estimates that 57 percent of the homes
with televisions will have cable in 1992, up from 50 percent in
1987.
   Higher basic cable fees are expected to propel a 10.4 percent
annual growth rate in basic cable over the next five years. But
those higher basic cable fees and competition from rental cassettes
should limit pay cable growth to less than 4 percent a year, the
report said.
   Radio revenues are expected to grow by about 10 percent a year
to $11.65 billion by 1992.
   Veronis Suhler said newspaper revenues are expected to rise at a
rate of 10 percent a year to $60.9 billion, including 10.9 percent
annual growth in advertising revenue and 6.2 percent annual growth
in classified advertising.
   Book publishing revenues should rise 9.4 percent a year to $18.1
billion in 1992, with the biggest increases expected in elementary
and high school textbooks and in professional books, the report
said.
   Magazine revenues are expected to rise at an annual rate of 8.4
percent to $21.4 billion, including a 9.0 percent annual rise in
consumer magazines and a 5.9 percent rise each year in business
magazines.

<HEAD>N.C. Hosiery Firm Goes to Andes Mountains To Test Hiking Socks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A North Carolina hosiery firm has gone to
new heights to test its hiking and mountaineering socks _ the Andes
Mountains.
   Thor-Lo, a division of Statesville-based Thornesburg Hosiery
Co., was the corporate sponsor of the American Andes Biomedical
Research Expedition to several Peruvian mountain peaks _ including
22,205-foot-high Mount Huascaron.
   While other participants such as NASA and New York University
Medical Center conducted physical tests on climbers, Thor-Lo
provided socks to be used in its own testing.
   ``I'm a little tired but I loved it,'' said Michael Shadroui,
Thor-Lo's national field coordinator, who returned home last week
after climbing 19,000-foot Mount Pisco.
   ``My previous high climb was 14,000 feet,'' Shadroui said in a
telephone interview Tuesday from the company's office. ``The last
5,000 feet was a revelation.''
   The expedition, which began June 4 and still is under way, was
sponsored primarily by New York University Medical Center. Medical
research conducted during the climb included field tests for NASA
and Walter Reed Army Hospital.
   Among the 17 climbers in the expedition were Dr. William
Bernhard, of NYU Medical Center; Col. Thomas Mader, of the Madigan
Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Wash.; and Col. Lawrence Mohr, the
White House physician.
   Areas of study included altitude mountain sickness, hypobaric
hypoxia, and brain response time at high altitudes, Shadroui said.
   Thor-Lo became involved in the expedition after a conversation
six months ago between Bernhard and Jim Thornesburg, president of
the privately-held hosiery company, Shadroui said.
   Thor-Lo usually tests its products in the field with fitness
buffs, hikers, members of the ski patrol and long distance runners,
according to Enid Walker, the company's director of communications.
   Thornesburg decided the Peruvian expedition was an excellent
opportunity to conduct tests on the company's hiking and
mountaineering socks. Each climber was given a set of socks for
testing of moisture management, abrasion, and thermal quality.
   ``The temperatures ranged from 85 degrees during the day to
sub-zero at nights,'' said Shadroui, who also participated in a
barrage of tests conducted by the medical teams.
   Results of Thor-Lo's own tests won't be known for some time,
Shadroui said, and much of the information will remain secret for
competitive reasons. Based on the reaction of his fellow climbers,
the company's products apparently held up well under tough
conditions.
   ``Dr. Bernhard said he'd never been on an expedition with fewer
foot problems,'' Shadroui said.

<HEAD>Growers Support Proposed Apple Firmness Standards; Would Be
Nation's First</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Washington growers worried that mushy
apples could harm the reputation of the state's fruit say it's
crunch time for the nation's biggest apple crop.
   A number of growers on Thursday spoke in favor of a state
Agriculture Department proposal to grade Washington apples not only
by external appearance but also by internal firmness.
   ``We in effect would guarantee that apples have a good chance of
reaching consumers with crunch and crispness,'' said Jim Clements,
acting chairman of the Washington Association of Apple Growers.
   Such a proposal has been in the discussion stage for three
decades, and if adopted would make Washington the first state to
use such a standard for its apples. The Agriculture Department,
after weighing testimony, is to decide on July 6 whether to adopt
the proposal.
   At a public hearing in Yakima, most growers and industry
officials supported the change, saying it was needed to ensure that
Washington apples could compete with other states and countries in
the international marketplace.
   But others complained the proposal was an overreaction based on
one bad crop, and would reduce income for growers.
   Grower Charles Boone said production costs will rise next year
as farm labor becomes scarcer because of federal immigration
reform, and said the timing of the change was wrong.
   Les Barbee, a Zillah grower, said the problem was with
distributors and retailers, not growers.
   ``Most all apples are good when they leave our warehouses,'' he
said, in arguing against the change. ``What happens en route to the
market is the question that needs to be addressed.''
   The issue is of tremendous economic importance to Washington
apple growers, who earned $489 million from the state's biggest
cash crop in 1986.
   Washington, which produces half the nation's supermarket apples
and 80 percent of the exports, has been saddled with a record crop
this year that also suffered severe weather damage.
   Economic pressure is forcing many poor quality apples into the
marketplace, ruining consumer confidence and future sales, some
growers complained.
   ``The junk sent out there for the consumer to buy is shameful,''
said Dave Larson, a grower who lives in Bellevue. ``I've seen our
industry lose customer after customer this year.''
   With Washington's apple trees producing larger and larger crops,
repeat business is the key to economic survival, said Richard
Clements, chairman of the Washington State Horticultural
Association's grade and pack committee, which proposed the change.
   Apple grades, which determine prices, are based on color and
other surface conditions like blemishes. Only ``controlled
atmosphere'' apples, those held in a special low-oxygen,
high-nitrogen environment, currently are under firmness standards.
   While the controlled atmosphere apples are two-thirds of the
fresh market crop, they are sold later in the year, after the
damage to consumer confidence has already occurred, some growers
contend.
   The state's growers are facing increasing competition from
high-quality apples from Michigan, New York and Southern Hemisphere
nations, said Gaylord Enbom, a Yakima grower.
   ``We can't be like other industries in the U.S. that failed to
make changes when required,'' he said.

<HEAD>Combined Domestic Sales Up 12.8 Percent in Mid-June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of domestic-made cars and light trucks rose
12.8 percent in mid-June from a year ago, resuming 1988's robust
pace after a brief lapse in early June, automakers reported.
   Domestic car sales were up 11.9 percent and domestic light truck
sales gained by 14.3 percent from mid-June 1987. The sales rate
picked up considerably from early June, industry analysts said
Thursday.
   In the eight selling days from June 11-20, automakers sold
222,262 domestic cars and 127,195 domestic light trucks, up from
223,376 cars and 125,193 trucks in nine days a year ago.
   The two periods are compared on the basis of sales per day
rather than total sales during the period.
   ``It's certainly a marked improvement over the first 10 days of
June,'' said Chris Cedergren, analyst with J.D. Power and
Associates in Agoura Hills, Calif.
   Cedergren said the strong mid-month sales mean that the
early-June lag wasn't a sign of a longer-term slowdown.
   Meanwhile, the National Automobile Dealers Association on
Thursday released an updated 1988 U.S. sales forecast of 15.2
million cars and light trucks, imported and domestic.
   The projection is similar to others, including Ford Motor Co.'s
current 15.6 million forecast which unlike the NADA forecast
includes several hundred thousand heavy trucks.
   NADA spokeswoman Jennifer Hunt said the group based its decision
to increase its forecast from 14.7 million vehicles was based on
current sales trends and a quarterly survey of dealer attitudes
that found the highest level of optimism in three years.
   Mid-June domestic car sales rose from a year ago for all makers
except Volkswagen, which closes its only U.S. plant at the end of
the month, and Nissan, which is building more trucks than cars this
year at its Tennessee plant. Nissan's domestic truck sales jumped
50.6 percent from a year ago.
   Chrysler Corp., the nation's No. 3 automaker, gained the most
among the Big Three in sales and market share.
   Chrysler's combined domestic car and light truck sales rose 24.5
percent and its share of the combined market rose to 17.3 percent
from 15.6 percent from mid-June a year ago.
   Chrysler car sales were up 21.7 percent from a year ago and
truck sales jumped 27.6 percent, helped along by record Jeep sales
for the period.
   General Motors Corp., the nation's largest automaker, sold 12.5
percent more domestic cars and light trucks than a year ago. Car
sales rose 9.1 percent and truck sales were up 20.3 percent.
   GM's share of the combined market held nearly steady at 46
percent as a drop in car share was balanced by a gain in the
industry-leader's share of the hot truck market.
   Ford Motor Co., the No. 2 U.S. maker, sold 10.2 percent more
domestic cars but 0.8 percent fewer domestic light trucks than a
year ago, for a total 5.7 percent increase in combined sales.
   Ford's share of the combined market fell to 31.2 percent from
33.3 percent a year ago, with its car share dropping slightly to
30.1 percent of the market and truck share falling five percentage
points to 33.2 percent.
   Ford spokeswoman June Larsen said Ford trucks are in short
supply. Ford is planning to increase production at its truck plant
in Wayne by adding a second shift.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for June 11-20.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and nine last
year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Volkswagen, Honda,
Nissan, Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this
table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Crysler

   The nation's heat wave is producing dangerous
conditions at factories around the country, few of which are
air-conditioned, union officials say.
   The risks of heat stress or stroke are greatest where heat isn't
a normal part of working conditions, said Frank Mirer, director of
the United Auto Workers union's health and safety department.
   ``People who are not acclimated to the hot environment are at
greatest risk,'' Mirer said. ``If you don't consume sufficient
fluids during the day you lose your acclimatization, suffer great
heat stress and greater risk of heat stroke.''
   In factories such as foundries and steel mills, where workers
and machines handle molten metal, workers' bodies are used to the
temperatures and work rules help by providing more breaks and
relief workers, he said.
   But where it's not normally hot and humid, workers' bodies can
become overheated as they try to discharge their own heat into
uncooled air. Symptoms such as headaches, nausea, heat cramps,
fatigue and ``feeling funny'' can mean heat stress, Mirer said.
   ``If the symptoms are being experienced, they have to be rapidly
reported to the medical department and action taken,'' he said.
Workers can get ``heat passes'' _ medical passes allowing them to
leave hot areas.
   At a Chrysler Corp. factory in Fenton, Mo., workers blamed the
death of a 54-year-old paint shop worker Wednesday on extreme high
temperatures, but an autopsy found the man died of a heart attack
caused by diseased arteries.
   Several hundred workers in the paint shops of that plant and an
adjoining Chrysler factory walked off the job on Wednesday and
again on Thursday, complaining of temperatures as high as 110
degrees.
   ``Heat stress is a very well-documented medical condition,
governed by temperature, humidity and the rate of work someone is
doing,'' Diane Factor, industrial hygienist in the AFL-CIO's
Washington, D.C., occupational safety, health and Social Security
office, said Thursday.
   ``The heat can surpass the threshold of what your body can
handle,'' Factor said.
   During the heat wave that baked much of the nation this week,
temperatures in plants without air conitioning factories such as
auto assembly and metal stamping plants climbed well into the 100s.
   Workers tried to keep cool by soaking towels in ice water,
drinking free beverages from vending machines and spending their
breaks in air-conditioned cafeterias.
   ``It's unbearable in that plant. I don't have enough fans in my
building,'' said Maurice Mitchell, an official of UAW Local 1264 at
Chrysler's 4,000-worker stamping plant in Sterling Heights.
   Mitchell said the mercury climbed above 110 Wednesday in the
plant. He blamed the heat on a lack of outside air. The plant's
windows are sealed to keep out cold and the union has to bargain
with management for fans.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has no
regulations governing heat in the workplace, Factor said.
   The AFL-CIO wants standards that would require air conditioning
or other engineering means of cooling the workplace, as well as
rules that require longer, more frequent breaks away from hot areas
and machinery and switching of work shifts from the hottest parts
of the day, Factor said.
   ``Heat stress is a preventable occurrence,'' she said.

   A small Japanese trading company convicted of
illegally selling security-sensitive electronic equipment to China
will be barred from exporting its products for one month, the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Friday.
   An MITI official said the ban against the Shinsei Koeki Co.
stemmed from the company's conviction Monday in a district court,
and will begin July 1.
   The court found Shinsei Koeki guilty of selling two sets of
electronic measuring equipment to China between June 1985 and
November 1986 without government permission. It fined the small,
Tokyo-based trading company 200,000 yen, or about $1,550.
   The high-technology equipment is among 178 strategic items
restricted by the government under the rules of the Coordinating
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, a Paris-based watchdog
body on trade with communist countries.

<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp.'s plans to restructure
its three worldwide businesses could be a prelude to the company's
spinning off one of the companies to raise capital and reduce debt,
analysts said.
   Some analysts also said after Union Carbide announced the
planned restructuring Thursday that the company also could be
trying to protect itself from lawsuits stemming from the 1984 gas
leak in Bhopal, India.
   Union Carbide Chairman Robert D. Kennedy also unveiled plans to
spend $450 million to expand and add product lines at the company's
plants in Seadrift, Texas, and Taft, La.
   Kennedy announced the new strategies after Union Carbide's board
approved a management recommendation seeking the new structuring.
The plan would have Union Carbide become the holding company for
the newer companies.
   The restructuring must be approved by shareholders.
   Carbide remains deeply indebted after fending off a hostile
takeover two years ago by GAF Corp., analysts said. As of March 31,
Carbide reported total debt of $3.2 billion compared to total
capitalization of $5.1 billion.
   The 63 percent ratio of debt to capital is about twice that of
Carbide's competitors and the company may hope to reduce that,
analysts said.
   ``It gives them increased flexibility to raise capital in the
future,'' said Leslie Ravitz, a financial analyst with Salomon
Brothers Inc. in New York. ``It opens up the potential to spin off
pieces of their business to the public or to a third party.''
   James Wilbur, a vice president with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co. Inc., said there has been speculation that Carbide might
want to restructure so it can go public with one division while
keeping the others private.
   Wilbur said it was possible the company was restructuring as ``a
defensive strategy ... to get the Bhopal monkey off the operating
division's back,'' although he viewed that as the the least likely
motivation.
   Wilbur also said the restructuring could be strictly
organizational.
   ``Carbide has long been an amalgam of different companies,'' he
said. ``The feeling may have been that it (had become) too
centralized for the nature of its business.''
   Ravitz said Carbide has a history of going through a
restructuring every several years and dismissed any link to Bhopal.
   The Indian government has filed $3 billion in lawsuits against
Carbide on behalf of all victims of the Bhopal gas leak. At least
2,660 people died in the accident, the world's worst industrial
disaster.
   The board also approved a proposed joint venture with Allied
Signal's UOP subsidiary. The deal will combine UOP with Carbide's
catalysts, absorbents and process systems businesses.

<HEAD>EEC Finalizes Farm Price Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 12 European Economic Community nations,
overcoming a Greek veto threat, on Friday finalized an accord to
limit spending on support prices for EEC farmers this year to $31.9
billion, or two-thirds of the total EEC budget.
   The long-awaited agreement could blunt criticism by the United
States that Europe does not do enough to rein in farm subsidies.
   While the 1988-89 farm package generally freezes prices at last
year's levels, it cuts prices for some of the EEC's 10.3 million
farmers by as much as 5 percent, officials said.
   The deal was clinched after Greece lifted its June 17 veto to a
compromise deal keeping the farm budget at last year's level.
   The agreement calls for a gradual dismantling of the EEC's
so-called monetary compensatory amounts, or MCAs, which comprise a
highly complex system of border taxes on exports of farm produce
from countries with weak currencies.
   Greek MCAs now range from 29.1 to 48 percent. Last week, the
EEC's executive commission, proposed to offer Greece a 14.5 percent
cut, including an immediate 10-point reduction.
   Early Friday, Greece accepted an immediate dismantling of its
MCAs by 15 to 20 points. This adds at least $116 million to the
farm budget but officials were confident they could keep overall
spending at last year's levels.
   The agreement in effect means lower support prices for EEC
farmers for the second straight year. Last year, prices declined by
3.5 percent on average as part of a package that also generally
froze subsidies.
   In consultations with the United States, the EEC will likely use
Friday's accord to underscore that Europe is serious about curbing
farm subsidies after years of runaway spending that has brought the
community to near bankruptcy.
   The United States, long a critic of the EEC's farm subsidies,
has suggested an end to all such subsidies by the year 2000.
   While the EEC agrees that farm subsidies must be reduced to
prevent the build-up of huge, unmarketable surplus stocks of food,
it has rejected the proposal to do away with farm subsidies
altogether as dangerous and undesirable.

<HEAD>Suchard Sells Rowntree Stake to Nestle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacobs Suchard AG on Friday bowed out of the
battle for Rowntree PLC, selling its 28.4 percent stake in the
British confectioner to rival Nestle SA for 690 million pounds, or
$1.2 billion.
   Suchard's decision hands control of Rowntree to Swiss foods
giant Nestle, ending a months-long takeover battle and creating the
world's second-largest confectioner after Mars Inc.
   Suchard, which had ranked second worldwide, will fall to third
place.
   On Thursday, Rowntree accepted Nestle's improved offer of 2.55
billion pounds, or $4.5 billion. Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle's
original offer amounted to 2.1 billion pounds, or $3.7 billion.
   Zurich-based Suchard, which has interests in chocolate and
coffee, said it agreed to sell its 64.2 million Rowntree shares at
Nestle's offer price of 10.75 pounds, or about $18.81 a share.
   Nestle later confirmed it had purchased the Suchard block,
giving it control of about 51 percent of Rowntree's outstanding
stock.
   Suchard said it would allow its 2.32 billion-pound offer for
Rowntree to lapse, adding that it could not afford to top Nestle's
bid.
   Analysts expect Suchard will reap more than 200 million pounds
in profits from the sale.
   They speculate that the confectioer now might turn its attention
to Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the British confectioner and soft drinks
company in which General Cinema Corp. of the United States holds an
18.4 percent stake.

<TEXT>
   The Mexican stock exchange, one of the
world's hottest before October's global collapse, is struggling to
regain some of its lost luster amid a scandal that has shaken up
its top management.
   The Index of Prices and Quotations, the main gauge of market
activity, recently surpassed the 200,000 mark, surging more than 90
percent from the start of the year.
   But it fell off sharply this past week in response to the recent
turmoil inside the exchange. On Wednesday alone, the market closed
down 10,968.95 points, a loss of about 5 percent.
   Two top officials resigned after an audit revealed the exchange
was missing about $7 million. One of the departing executives,
operations director Reynaldo Hernandez Balsaldua, has been in a
coma since attempting suicide last month when the funds came up
missing.
   In the wake of the resignations, the exchange is said to be
revamping its internal controls and finances, officials said.
   The index of 50 stocks has made strides since the October crash
nonetheless. Up as high as 373,216.24 on Oct. 6, it plummeted to
86,606.75 on Jan. 7 before beginning a slow rebound.
   Rogelio Ramirez de la O of the private Ecanal forecasting firm
describes the market as ``cautiously up.''
   Other analysts say the exchange may be reflecting the initial
success of the government's Economic Solidarity Pact, the
anti-inflation program put in place in mid-December by President
Miguel de la Madrid.
   The program has frozen the minimum wage, the prices of
government-regulated goods and services and the peso-dollar
exchange rate. It also has promised to cut government spending,
restrain monetary and credit policy, and open the economy to more
foreign trade.
   Since its inception, interest rates have tumbled sharply. The
interest rate on 28-day treasury bills has plunged from a high of
nearly 160 percent in February to about 40 percent. Bank interest
rates have taken a similar dive.
   With a steady exchange rate, Mexicans have been bringing their
money back from foreign, mostly U.S. banks and investing in
short-term instruments and the stock market, analysts said.
   A breakdown of index figures by sector shows the value of mining
stocks soared 51 percent from the end of January to the end of May;
manufacturing stocks were up 40 percent; construction stocks
increased 17 percent; and communications and transportation issues
climbed 59 percent. The stocks of service companies were off 8
percent during the same period.
   The index gained 124 percent in all of last year, off from the
stunning 321 advance of 1986.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Robert Maxwell said Friday
that he has agreed to invest up to one billion Belgian francs, or
$26 million, in the Belgian printing and publishing group Dupuis.
   The group, one of Europe's leading French-language comic strip
publishers, is currently controlled by Groupe Bruxelles-Lambert,
but Maxwell told a news conference the deal will give him a stake
of about 50 percent in the company.
   Societe Generale de Belgique, the country's largest holding
company, and Maxwell announced earlier this week that they are
launching a new company specializing in communications.
   Maxwell said that his investments in Belgium could in the future
make him the largest single foreign investor in the country.
   ``We are in the business of acquiring Belgian media properties
but only if we are invited and it won't be on a controlling
basis,'' Maxwell said. ``We aren't going to tell them how to do
their business.''
   Maxwell said that his investments in Belgium will involve both
Societe Generale and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert. They are the
country's two largest holding companies, competing in most fields.
   The 65-year-old Maxwell is chairman of British Printing &
Communication PLC, which has interests in printing and publishing.
   He is planning to launch a new European newspaper, and expects
the first million test copies will be issued before the end of
July. He said that the Dupuis facilities may be used for printing
some of the editions of the paper ``if the capacity is available.''
   He also owns Pergamon Press, a publisher of scientific journals,
and publishes the Mirror group of newspapers, which include the
Daily Mirror, two national weeklies and two big Scottish newspapers.

<HEAD>Leveraged Buyout of Retailer Completed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior management of Montgomery Ward & Co. have
completed their leveraged buyout of the Chicago-based retailer from
Mobil Corp.
   In a two-step transaction, the management group, led by
Montgomery Ward chairman Bernard F. Brennan, paid Mobil $1.6
billion in cash for the 315-store company and assumed $2.3 billion
in debt.
   In the second step, the retailer sold its credit card subsidiary
to General Electric Capital Corp. for $1 billion in cash. General
Electric Capital will assume $1.8 billion in debt, primarily
customer receivables, from the credit card operation.
   ``We're returning as a Chicago-based, independent company,''
Brennan said Thursday before taking over the 116-year-old company
that was purchased by Mobil in 1976.
   Montgomery Ward plans to open about 225 new shops during the
next five years under its specialty format emphasizing automotive
services, home furnishings or electronics and appliances.
   For the first quarter, Wards earned $19 million, it highest
first-quarter profit, on revenue of $1.23 billion, up from $8
million on revenue of $951 million a year earlier.
   For all of 1987, the retailer earned $130 million on sales of
$4.64 billion.

<HEAD>Court Limits States' Authority to Lower Electric Rates in
Mississippi Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a ruling that will cost
Mississippi consumers $326.5 million, today limited severely
states' authority to lower the electric rates public utilities
charge as a result of agreements with federal regulators.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, said Mississippi authorities are
required to pass through to retail electricity customers a
utility's federally determined share of the costs of constructing
the Grand Gulf 1 nuclear power plant.
   ``States may not regulate in areas where (the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission) exercised its jurisdiction to determine just
and reasonable wholesale rates or to insure that agreements
affcting wholesale rates are reasonable,'' Justice John Paul
Stevens wrote for the court.
   ``Mississippi, therefore, may not ... conduct any proceedings
that challenge the reasonableness of FERC's allocation'' of costs,
Stevens said.
   Mississippi Power & Light Co. provides electric service to about
330,000 customers in the western half of Mississippi.
   Its electric generation and transmission facilities are planned,
constructed and operated on a coordinated basis with those of three
affiliated utilities _ Arkansas Power & Light Co., Louisiana Power
& Light Co. and New Orleans Public Service Inc.
   In all, the companies provide electricity to customers in four
states _ Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Missouri.
   Each of the four companies is a subsidiary of Middle South
Utilities Inc., an interstate public utility holding company.
   Middle South in 1974 formed a new subsidiary to finance,
construct and operate a nuclear generating station, Grand Gulf 1,
near Port Gibson, Miss. It cost $3.6 billion to complete _ about
500 percent more than originally anticipated _ and began operations
July 1, 1985.
   After three years of proceedings, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission decided that the costs of Grand Gulf 1 ``should be
shared equitably by all four operating companies and their
customers.''
   It ruled that MP&L should be required to pay for 33 percent of
the nuclear power plant's cost.
   The Mississippi Public Service Commission and various other
governmental agencies and officials from Mississippi, Arkansas,
Louisiana and Missouri appealed the commission's ruling. But the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld most of it last year.
   The federal commission's decision required MP&L to pay enormous
amounts of money for Grand Gulf 1 power, and to get the money MP&L
asked the state Public Service Commission to approve a rate
increase.
   The state commission approved a $326.5 million increase
stretched over a 10-year period but state Attorney General Edwin
Lloyd Pittman and the Mississippi Legal Services Coalition
challenged the state commission order.
   The state Supreme Court overturned the rate increase, refusing
to accept as reasonable the federal commission's allocations of
cost.
   ``Since Mississippi cannot use 33 percent of Grand Gulf's power,
the (federal commission's ruling) providing for the allocation of
33 percent of its cost would seem to be imprudent,'' the state
court ruled.
   The state court's ruling was reversed today.
   MP&L had told the justices that the state court's ruling
conflicts with their 1987 ruling in a case from North Carolina and
Tennessee.
   In it, the justices said states must allow as reasonable
operating expenses the costs incurred by a utility as a result of
paying a wholesale price determined by federal energy regulators.
   Today's decision against Mississippi relied heavily on the 1987
ruling.
   ``Mississippi's effort to invade the province of federal
authority must be rejected,'' Stevens wrote for the high court.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A.
Blackmun dissented.
   The case is Mississippi Power & Light vs. Mississipi, 86-1970.

For Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans' personal income, held back by a decline in subsidy
payments to farmers, rose a modest 0.3 percent in May, the
government said today.
   But because of a decrease in federal tax payments, which
followed a big tax bite in April, Americans' disposable personal
income shot up 1.5 percent in May, the Commerce Department said.
That followed a 1.0 percent decline in after-tax income in April,
the biggest drop since April 1987.
   Before-tax income had edged up 0.1 percent in April after a 1.2
percent surge in March.
   Today's report said both the April and May increases look weaker
because March income was boosted by profit-sharing payments to auto
workers and retroactive Social Security payments. A lag in federal
payments to farmers also held back the May advance.
   Excluding those special factors, the government said personal
income would have advanced 0.8 percent in April and 0.4 percent in
May.
   On Thursday, the Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew
at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year,
still strong although less than the previously estimated 3.9
percent rate.
   Separately, the president's Council of Economic Advisers said it
was confident enough in the economy this year to boost its growth
forecast for all of 1988 to 3.5 percent from the original estimate
of 2.9 percent.
   ``Our rosy forecast wasn't rosy enough,'' Beryl Sprinkel,
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters. ``The
economy is doing better than even we expected.''
   In another report, the Commerce Department said the after-tax
profits of U.S. corporations fell 1.0 percent in the first quarter,
the poorest showing since the first quarter of 1987.
   Frenzied trading in Chicago pushed the July contract for
soybeans to a 15-year high, but prices fell sharply when
uncertainty about the weather caused a nervous wave of selling.
   Corn and wheat futures also retreated on the Chicago Board of
Trade, while oats rose to record highs on fears of further damage
to the drought-ravaged crop.
   ``We're trading hysteria right now,'' Cathy Leow, a New
York-based grain analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.,
said of the soybean market's erratic performance.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.91
points to 2,148.29, following a nearly 70 point rise over the
preceding two sessions.
   After the October stock market collapse, many private economists
expected a slowdown or even a recession this year. But the economy
boomed.
   The administration is looking for a sixth straight year of
economic expansion, the longest in peacetime since the Civil War,
to bolster the chances for a Republican presidential victory in
November.
   Sprinkel said the expansion ``gives every indication of
continuing...on into next year.''
   A price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 1.4
percent, slightly lower than the previously estimated 1.7 percent
and well below the 2.7 percent pace of the fourth quarter.
   The concern now is that too much demand _ from American
consumers as well as from overseas buyers _ will strain factory
capacity, causing shortages and driving up prices later this year.
   In other economic news, automakers reported that sales of
domestic-made cars and light trucks rose 12.8 percent in mid-June
from a year earlier, resuming 1988's robust pace after a brief
lapse earlier in the month.

   The stock market retreated further early today,

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which lost 3.91 points
to 2,148.29 on Thursday, was down another 5.69 to 2,142.60 after a
brief rise at the opening of trading.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues fell 0.53 to 154.50. The
American Stock Exchange market-value index fell 0.61 to 308.21.
   Gaining stocks outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 on the NYSE,
with 692 down, 504 up and 507 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board
totaled 75.24 million shares after the first hour.
   The retreat came despite further strength in the dollar, which

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, then steadied and began
climbing back again.
   The corn, soybean and wheat markets sold off sharply Thursday
after some meteorologists increased the amount of rain in their
weather forecasts for the parched Midwest.
   Scattered showers dampened southern Minnesota and northern Iowa
overnight and those rains were expected to move eastward today and
Saturday, bringing rain to parts of Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan
and Ohio, analysts said.
   The rainfall is light and not widespread, but analysts said it
put a scare into the heavily overbought grain markets Thursday and
should keep a lid on futures prices today.
   ``It's a very modest improvement in the weather and a lot of
people seem to think the market has topped out for the time
being,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Prices for near-term deliveries of oats rose sharply at the
opening on reports of severe, irreversible drought damage to the
oat crop.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 3{ cents lower with July
at $3.79 a bushel; corn was 2} cents to 6 cents lower with July at
$3.42 a bushel; oats were 6 cents lower to 15 cents higher with
July at $3.63 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 12{ cents lower
with July at $10.24 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
to lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .08 cent to .68 cent higher with August at
62.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent to 1.05 cent
higher with August at 70.80 cents a pound; hogs were .95 cent lower
to .45 cent higher with July at 44.55 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.12 cents lower to .65 cents higher with July at
39.45 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed lower on Thursday.

   Senate Democrats today defeated a Republican
attempt to exempt employers from giving workers and local officials
advance warning of large layoffs and plant closings if they provide
60 days' severance pay to laid off employees.
   On a 59-31 vote, the Senate rejected an amendment by Sen. Dan
Quayle, R-Ind., that would remove the obligation of employers to
provide advance notice under a Democratic-sponsored bill if the
severance pay is provided.
   ``The practice of paying severance pay in lieu of notice is a
common one and ought to be encouraged,'' Quayle said. ``The earlier
an employee can go out and develop some new skills and not be
pinned down to a job that no longer is going to be there, the
better off that employee will be.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, the primary author of the legislation,
said the amendment would defeat the bill's primary purpose.
   ``This bill is about giving notice, it's not about requiring
severance pay,'' Metzenbaum said. ``The object is not to put an
additional financial obligation on employers.''
   The vote was the first in three days of Senate debate on the
bill as Republicans attempted to stall a Democratic effort to link
enactment of the layoff notices to winning passage of a trade bill
later.
   Senate Democratic leaders had hoped to get a vote this week on
the plant closing-layoff measure, which has been separated from the
trade bill that President Reagan vetoed last month. House leaders
on Thursday promised immediate action as soon as the Senate
finished its vote.
   But GOP opponents, using lengthy speeches and long periods of
silence, thwarted any votes Thursday while declining to offer
amendments they had promised throughout the day to introduce.
   ``We're trying to make a case on this and the strongest case we
can make is on one clearly defined amendment,'' said Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``We wanted to have that vote
first.''
   However, Republicans agreed to allow votes today on other
amendments aimed at weakening the notice requirements.
   After caucusing in Dole's office, Republicans decided to have
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., offer an amendment to strip the word
layoffs from the bill and make the mandated 60-day advance notices
apply only to plant closings.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, complained that advance notices in
cases of layoffs will ``tilt the delicate labor-management
balance'' that now exists in favor of unions.
   ``It makes it almost impossible for a business to lay off 50
people when it needs to and it will discourage union leaders from
negotiating productivity improvements,'' he said.
   Mrs. Kassebaum, however, declined to offer the amendment
Thursday out of fear that opponents would vote it down immediately.
Then she said she would be out of town Friday, effectively
forestalling any action on her amendment or a final vote on the
bill itself until at least next week.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Mrs. Kassebaum's amendment
would create a loophole big enough to allow an employer to lay off
980 of 1,000 employes at a plant without giving them any notice.
   ``This is a killer amendment,'' said Senate Majority Leader
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. ``Not only does it kill this bill but it
will kill the trade bill.''
   Democrats still hoped to send the plant closing bill to the
White House by July 4 for an expected veto by Reagan while holding
a revised trade bill hostage to overriding the veto.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, with the backing of 71 other
senators, on Thursday reintroduced _ without the plant closing
provision _ the trade bill vetoed by Reagan last month. A similarly
stripped-down bill was introduced in the House last week.
   Reagan cited the provision requiring employers to give workers
and local officials 60 days advance notice of layoffs of 50 people
or more as his main objection to the trade bill. But he indicated
he would sign a trade bill that did not include the layoff
provision.
   ``We may not get any, but we're not going to settle for half a
loaf,'' Byrd said Thursday. ``I've maintained all along that the
president doesn't want a trade bill.''
   Organized labor leaders agreed to removal of the layoff notice
provision from the trade legislation only on the condition that
Congress would act on it before reconsidering the trade bill.
   Since recent polls indicating that more than 80 percent of
Americans favor requiring businesses to provide workers with
advance notice of layoffs and plant closings, the issue has become
a major campaign topic.
   ``Our COPE people out in the field wanted another up-or-down
vote on plant closing alone before the election,'' one labor
official said, speaking of the AFL-CIO's Committee on Political
Education offices in the 50 states.
   Without enactment of mandatory layoff warnings as a separate
law, the AFL-CIO has threatened to withdraw its pivotal support for
any trade bill that does not include the provision.
   ``We would have no reason to support it, nor oppose it,'' said
Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the federation.
   Other supporters of the trade bill, including many business
groups, acknowledge that the political impetus behind it might
falter without labor's support.
   Republicans admit the strategy has put them on the defensive.
   ``The judgment has been made by the majority that this is a
`hot' issue that ought be brought up and maybe we can singe a few
Republicans in the process,'' said Dole. ``Who might win in
November suddenly has become the issue, not the merits of this
bill.''
   At least one Republican senator standing for re-election, Sen.
John Chafee of Rhode Island, said he has switched during the past
month from opposing the mandated notices to supporting them.

   Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti
ended his battle for control of Societe Generale de Belgique on
Friday by announcing plans to sell most of his stake in Belgium's
largest holding company.
   Despite the outcome, De Benedetti said his bid for Societe
Generale had been a financial success. In an interview with Italian
television, he estimated he earned about $1 billion from the sale
of his stake.
   ``I would like to repeat every six months what I did in the last
six months,`` De Benedetti said at a news conference where he made
the announcement.
   Under terms of a settlement, De Benedetti's French investment
firm Cerus SA will sell 7.75 million Societe Generale shares to a
rival Franco-Belgian group. Cerus currently owns 14.25 million of
million Societe Generale's 42 million outstanding shares.
   In return, De Benedetti will boost his holding in Cie.
Financiere de Suez, a Paris-based financial services group and his
chief rival for control of Societe Generale. Suez's main ally is
Groupe AG, Belgium's largest insurance firm.
   The agreement marked the end of a bitter battle for Societe
Generale, which started in January when de Benedetti acquired 18.6
percent of the company and vowed to buy at least 15 percent more.
   The sale will reduce Cerus's holding in Societe Generale to 16
percent, thus handing control of the company to Suez and its
allies. The Franco-Belgian group currently holds about 55 percent
of Societe Generale's stock.
   In return, De Benedetti will obtain an undisclosed cash payment,
will raise his stake in Suez to about 4 percent from the current 1
percent, and will be made one of three vice presidents of Societe
Generale.
   De Benedetti said he did not believe he miscalculated his
strategy, particularly as he still will play an important role in
the new management of Societe Generale.
   The two sides said Societe Generale would continue to trade on
the Belgian stock market becuse they wanted ``once more to give the
public greater access to the capital of Societe Generale.''
   Most of Societe Generale's stock was acquired by the two groups
earlier this year at the height of the takeover battle when the
price of Societe Generale reached record levels of 8,000 Belgian
francs per share.
   Societe Generale stock closed at 4,495 francs on Thursday.
   A special shareholders meeting will be held soon to approve the
new management structure of the holding company.
   The two groups said the board would be invited to appoint De
Benedetti, Suez Chairman Renaud de la Geniere and Groupe AG
Chairman Maurice Lippens as vice chairmen of Societe Generale.
   Societe Generale, which has stakes in more than 1,200 companies,
controls about a third of Belgium's economy.
   Both De Benedetti and the Franco-Belgian group have said they
want to turn the company into a pan-European holding company ahead
of the European Economic Community's plans to eliminate trade
barriers by the end of 1992.

<HEAD>Issue of Farm Subsidies Still Separates Allies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRAINERD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, Canada, Japan and the
European Community concluded a round of trade talks today with
negotiators saying they had reslved some questions but remained far
apart on the contentious issue of farm subsidies.
   At a news conference concluding the two days of meetings, U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said that much more work was
needed before the farm subsidy issue could be resolved and at least
for the present the United States was not willing to modify its
demand for the elimination of all subsidies by the year 2000.
   ``We are not moving off any options. Maybe in 1990 we will make
some adjustments, but not in 1988,'' he said. Yeutter and the other
trade ministers pronounced themselves pleased with the progress
made on some other, less contentious issues during the two days of
talks at a resort in the Minnesota lake country.
   They said they had narrowed the differences separating them on
expanding the rules governing global trade to include trade in
services and investment, two high priorities for the United States.
   Yeutter called the talks ``productive and well-focused'' and
said they would help pave the way for successful conclustion of a
meeting of all 96 countries involved in the current trade talks to
be held in Montreal in December.
   In addition to services and investment, officials reported
progress on other issues such as protection of intellectual
property rights and reform of the process by which trade
disagreements get settled.
   The discussions by the four countries were aimed at narrowing
the differences between them before a critical trade conference in
Montreal in December.
   One area where officials said progress had been made was in
reforming the process by which the 96-member General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade resolves disputes between countries.
   ``Everybody is in favor of a better dispute settlement
mechanism,'' said Willy de Clercq, trade representative for the
European Community. ``We have to make the system run smoother and
quicker.''
   An American official, who spoke on condition his name not be
used, suggested that the countries meeting in Montreal could well
agree to the removal of some trade barriers as early as 1989.
   The current round of trade liberalization talks began in 1986 in
Uruguay and is scheduled to end in 1990. The Montreal meeting is
aimed at settling as many issues as possible and providing momentum
for the two remaining years of negotiations.
   But on the No. 1 priority of the United States, reform of
agricultural subsidies, all sides agreed they are far apart,
reflecting the heated debate that took place between Reagan and the
other six summit countries at the just-concluded Toronto summit.
   The $200 billion subsidy war has contributed to surplus
production and slumping prices, but the allies rebuffed Reagan's
call for totally scrapping subsidies. The final economic communique
simply repeated language calling for further negotiations aimed at
reducing subsidies, rather than eliminating them.
   Yeutter said that Congress could very likely increase export
subsidies, just as it did in 1985, if current global trade
negotiations on the matter appear to be at a stalemate.
   ``Sometimes one must have a higher level of confrontation in
order to achieve progress,'' he told reporters here.
   ``I am not making legislative threats. I am just giving you an
assessment of what could happen,'' Yeutter said.
   In another form of pressure, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III said earlier this week that country-by-country trade deals,
such as the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement, might be the way to
force other nations to capitulate in their opposition to
eliminating farm subsidies.
   Baker said that if the United States and Canada join together,
the two countries ``may be able to dislodge obstacles in special
areas of common concern such as agriculture.''
   All countries agree in principle that farm subsidies are a major
drain on their treasuries, but Europeans claim that political
pressures make it impossible to totally eliminate farm support
programs.
   Western Europe, the world's largest food importer in 1970, is
now second to the United States in the amount of food it exports.
   The United States is still the world's largest exporter of farm
commodities, accounting for about 40 percent of the volume of wheat
and feed grains sold on world markets. But since reaching a record
of $41.7 billion in 1981, U.S. farm exports steadily declined to a
low of $26.6 billion in 1986.

   Allegheny International Inc. said it would
merge the headquarters operations of its flagship Sunbeam and Oster
appliance divisions.
   ``It's way past high time for it to happen,'' said analyst
Gregory Drahuschak of investment firm Butcher & Singer Inc. in
Pittsburgh. ``Their products are so similar.''
   Financial, research and development, engineering and personnel
functions will be combined at Sunbeam's headquarters in Downers
Grove, Ill., the company said Thursday.
   An unspecified number of employees among the 300 people at Oster
headquarters in Milwaukee, Wis., will be laid off, Allegheny
International said.
   Sales staffs will remain independent. None of the manufacturing
plants will be closed.
   The combined business, to be known as Oster-Sunbeam Appliance
Co., will have 3,000 employees at seven locations in the United
States and Mexico.
   Allegheny International plans to change its name to Sunbeam
Corp. The company is reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy laws and awaiting results of a proxy contest with
dissident shareholders.

   Stocks were mixed today in moderate trading, at
least temporarily discounting the news of a rising dollar and lower
interest rates in the credit markets.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which lost 3.91 points

   The mixed showing came despite further strength in the dollar,
which benefited prices in the bond market and caused a consequent

   The jury in a case linking the hazards of
asbestos and smoking found today that American Tobacco Co. was not
liable in a former shipyard worker's lung-cancer death but should
have put warning labels on cigarette packs sooner.
   The federal jury awarded no damages in the death last year of
John Ray Gunsalus, 55, of Chester.
   The case was decided less than two weeks after a jury in Newark,
N.J., decided three tobacco companies should pay $400,000 to the
widower of a lifelong smoker. It was the nation's first monetary
award against a cigarette maker.
   The jury in the Gunsalus case had to answer two questions: were
Pall Mall cigarettes prior to 1966 ``defective at the time sold in
that they failed to provide a warning,'' and were they a
substantial cause of Gunsalus' death?
   The panel answered yes to the first question, faulting the
company for not cautioning of the dangers of tobacco before 1966,
when warnings began to be printed on cigarette packages as mandated
by Congress.
   To the second question, the jury answered no. To award damages,
it had to find that cigarettes were a substantial cause of
Gunsalus' death. Gunsalus' estate had sought an unspecified amount
for pain and suffering.
   Attorneys for American Tobacco cheered the verdict outside the
courtroom, but declined to comment to a reporter.
   The eight-member jury had begun deliberations Thursday.
   American Tobacco attorney Edward F. Mannino had contended
smoking's dangers were not the issue, but instead told the jury
that Gunsalus drank heavily, suffered multiple stab wounds and had
three heart attacks before dying of lung cancer.
   Attorneys for Gunsalus' estate tried to show American Tobacco
produced a defective product because cigarette packages carried no
warnings for people who work near asbestos. Gunsalus worked for
several years at a Chester shipyard where asbestos was prevalent.
   According to testimony from Dr. Paul Epstein of Graduate
Hospital in Philadelphia, Gunsalus died of cancer caused by smoking
and asbestos exposure.
   Epstein, a witness for the Gunsalus estate, said the interaction
of asbestos and cigarette smoke causes a far greater risk of cancer
than either substance does on its own.
   In closing remarks Thursday, Mannino said Gunsalus smoked
because he chose to. He called Gunsalus as a ``strong-willed''
person who ignored six doctors' warnings to quit smoking.
   ``Nobody told John Gunsalus what to do,'' Mannino repeatedly
told the jury.
   He described Gunsalus as a heavy drinker who drifted from job to
job, lived with other women while still married, suffered multiple
stab wounds and three heart attacks before dying last year, still
unable or unwilling to give up his habit of smoking two packs of
Pall Mall cigarettes a day.
   Thomas F. Johnson, the attorney for Gunsalus' estate, angrily
rebutted Mannino's comments.
   The ``unspoken assumption'' of American Tobacco's argument ``is
what does it matter if we kill a bum?'' he told the jury.
   ``He doesn't want to make it into a product liability case, and
wants to make it into a plaintiff liability case,'' he said.

   Share prices finished lower Friday on the London
Stock Exchange as the market paused to catch its breath after a
strong rally over the past week.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 7.6
points, or 0.4 percent, lower at 1,871.3, below the day's best
level of 1,875.4. The session low of 15 points down came in early
trading.
   Volume was 589.0 million shares, up from Thursday's 558.9
million.
   ``The market's become very tired and emotional,'' one equity
analyst said, adding that ``it's been a reasonable week of gains
and now people are thinking that perhaps it's a bit overdone.''
   Analysts said Monday's release of British trade data for May
kept players on the sidelines. Dealers also said there was a
lingering fear that British interest rates may have to be raised
next week to support the sagging pound.
   The biggest feature of the market was news that Jacobs Suchard
AG of Switzerland withdrew from the bidding war for British
confectioner Rowntree PLC by agreeing to sell its 28.4 percent
stake in Rowntree to winning Swiss bidder Nestle SA for 690 million
pounds, or around $1.2 billion.
   On Thursday, Rowntree announced it had accepted a sweetened
Nestle offer of 2.55 billion pounds, or around $4.5 billion.

<HEAD>Farmers Adopts `Poison Pill' Takeover Defense</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers Insurance Group Inc., battling a
hostile $4.5 billion takeover bid by Batus Inc., announced Friday
that it had adopted a ``poison pill'' defense.
   Farmers' board of directors will issue shareholder rights
entitling holders to buy additional stock in the insurance company
at half price in the event an outsider acquires 20 percent or more
of the company's stock. Also, if the company were bought,
shareholders would be entitled to buy stock in the acquiring
company.
   Such plans, common among companies worried about takeovers, are
called ``poison pills'' because they dilute the value of the
holdings of the buying company, forcing a hostile bidder to spend
more in order to swallow the target company.
   Batus, a conglomerate based in Louisville, Ky., whose operations
include the maker of Kool cigarettes and retailers led by New
York's Saks Fifth Avenue, is offering to buy Farmers' stock for $63
a share. It has failed to persuade Farmers' management to negotiate
a friendly merger and the companies are battling in hearings before
insurance regulators in nine states who must approve a buyout.
   Batus said Friday that Farmers' adoption of the ``poison pill''
defense was ``a desperate attempt by the board to further
obstruct'' Batus' takeover bid.
   ``The adoption of this poison pill is not in the best interest
of the shareholders and policyholders, since it is intended to
retain Farmers' board's entrenched position,'' the company said in
a written statement. ``Obviously, Farmers board is responding in a
self-serving manner to increasing pressure from shareholders which
will inevitably lead to the successful completion of the
acquisition.''
   The statement also said that Friday's action ``is also a clear
signal that Farmers' board does not in reality believe it will be
successful in stopping the acquisition at the state regulatory
level.''
   Last week, California became the first state to reject Batus'
application. Batus challenged the decision by the California
Insurance Department in Los Angeles Superior Court this week.
   Earlier this month, Batus said it had received offers to sell
from holders of 28 percent of Farmers stock.
   Farmers shareholders rights are to be issued July 5 and are
valid for 10 years unless recalled by management.

<HEAD>Jacobs Suchard Walks Away from Candy Bar Wars with Hefty Profit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacobs Suchard AG conceded defeat on Friday in the
takeover battle for British confectioner Rowntree PLC to Swiss
foods giant Nestle SA, which now will displace Jacobs Suchard as
the world's second-largest confectioner.
   But Jacobs Suchard, which agreed to sell its 28.4 percent stake
in Rowntree to Nestle for 690 million pounds, or $1.2 billion, is
walking away with a hefty profit, which analysts estimate at more
than 200 million pounds.
   Jacobs Suchard is now expected to turn its attention to Cadbury
Schweppes PLC, the British confectioner and soft drink company in
which General Cinema Corp. of the United States holds an 18.4
percent stake.
   On Thursday, Rowntree, the York, England-based manufacturer of
candies such as the Kit Kat bar, announced that its board had
accepted a sweetened Nestle offer of 2.55 billion pounds, or 10.75
pence a share.
   Jacobs Suchard said it would allow its own rival offer for
Rowntree of 2.32 billion pounds, or 950 pence a share, to lapse,
and Nestle later confirmed it had purchased Jacobs Suchard's entire
stake. That gives Nestle about 51 percent of all Rowntree's stock.
   Jacobs Suchard's decision to bow out gave control of Rowntree to
Nestle, ending a months-long takeover battle which created a huge
controversy in Britain and was dubbed the candy ``bar wars.''
   Critics have objected to the purchase of a 263-year-old British
company by a foreign one and have feared an acquisition would
result in layoffs.
   The merger of Rowntree into Nestle will create a confectioner
that ranks only behind Mars Inc. of the United States, the world's
biggest confectioner. Jacobs Suchard falls to third place.
   Zurich-based Jacobs Suchard, which has interests in chocolate
and coffee, said it agreed to sell to Nestle its 64.2 million
Rowntree shares at Nestle's offer price.
   Jacobs Suchard said the increased Nestle offer was higher than
the maximum price it could afford.
   Nestle, based in Vevey, Switzerland, had raised its offer 21
percent from 2.1 billion pounds, or 890 pence a share, and 13
percent above Jacobs Suchard's offer.
   The Rowntree takeover battle began April 13 when Jacobs Suchard,
which makes the Toblerone chocolate bar, snapped up nearly 15
percent of Rowntree's shares in a ``dawn raid.''
   That move prompted Nestle to jump in with its original offer
April 26. Suchard countered with its bid a month later.
   Analysts speculated Jacobs Suchard will try to reach a friendly
agreement with Cadbury Schweppes or will try to split up the
company with General Cinema, taking the confectionery business for
itself and leaving the soft drink operations with the U.S.-based
company.
   General Cinema, whose headquarters are in Chestnut Hill,
Massachusetts, has interests in movie theaters, soft drink bottling
and retailing.
   Cadbury is ``the last one that's publicly available if you want
to be among the top three world confectionery companies,'' said
Michael Landymore, a food companies analyst with the London
investment firm Henderson Crosthwaite Ltd.
   Richard Allan, a food companies analyst with Kleinwort Grieveson
Securities Ltd., said Cadbury ``is the most obvious alternative.
It's the only apparent major play in the chocolate confectionery
business left with Suchard.''
   Analysts said Jacobs Suchard's other alternatives are to acquire
small independent producers piecemeal, spend a lot of money
developing business in the Far East, where it sees the biggest
opportunities in the long term, or it could decide to develop in a
totally different direction.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Close Mixed To Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed
to higher Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a volatile
session that saw corn and soybean prices yo-yo as bulls and bears
wrangled over the weekend weather outlook.
   ``This thing has more lives than a cat. It kept coming back and
coming back,'' Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said of the market's erratic performance.
   Reports of scattered showers in the Farm Belt and indications
that the pattern could continue into the weekend dampened the
buying enthusiam that has driven prices up sharply this month. But
the market's resilience suggested prices could skyrocket on Monday
if the weekend is dry, Lespinasse said.
   Soybeans opened lower, climbed higher, fell sharply, then came
back to finish higher for the session but substantially lower than
the 15-year high of $10.99{ a bushel reached Thursday. Corn futures
followed a similar path but closed mixed.
   Wheat was slightly higher and 1988 oat futures, which reached
record highs earlier this week, soared the daily limit for the
fifth consecutive session on estimates that the drought in the
northern Plains has claimed 50 percent to 70 percent of the crop.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.82 a bushel; corn was 5{ cents
lower to 1{ cents higher with July at $3.42{ a bushel; oats were 8
cents lower to 15 cents higher with July at $3.63 a bushel;
soybeans were unchanged to 10 cents higher with July at $10.33 a
bushel.

   The stock market retreated Friday in moderate
trading, apparently discounting the beneficial effects of a
stronger dollar and eased interest rates in the credit markets.
   Some traders said they weren't surprised that investors would
cash gains made earlier in the week, when the Dow Jones industrial
average hit a post-crash high on the dollar's resurging value.
   ``As far as the stock market is concerned, you might get a
breather in here,'' said Gerald Rivlin, executive vice president at
Rodman & Renshaw Inc. in Chicago.
   But others who had thought the dollar move possibly signaled the
start of a sustained upward move in stock prices were disappointed.
   Some said talk had resurfaced that the dollar's new strength,
instead of helping stocks by easing inflation and attracting
foreign buyers, could prove harmful by blunting the improvement in
the nation's trade deficit.
   ``Anytime the market makes a good run, somebody comes out with
something on the negative,'' said Philip C. Puccio, senior vice
president and manager of institutional trading at Dillon Read & Co.
in New York. ``People should stop thinking about the short term and
take the blinders off.''

   Africans have cautiously hailed the
decision by the world's seven richest nations to ease the
continent's massive debt burden, but they're not expecting it to
solve their economic woes.
   ``We have reservations about the blueprint on Africa's debt,''
the Times of Zambia said in a typical African editorial reaction to
the Toronto economic summit that ended Tuesday.
   ``But there can be no doubt that it was the most significant in
the series, particularly for Africa.''
   The continent's leaders have refrained from commenting publicly
about the 14th economic summit of the United States, Britain,
Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany, evidently wanting
time to assess the implications of the final communique.
   In it, the industrialized powers pledged to do more to lift the
crippling debt burdens of the poorest nations, particularly in
Africa, but made no new initiative to help Latin American debtors.
   The leaders who gathered for three days in Toronto backed a plan
offering a variety of options that will benefit most sub-Saharan
countries, such as lowering interest rates and scrapping some loan
repayments.
   But those measures fall far short of persistent African pleas to
Western creditors to write off most of their $200 billion in debts,
and reschedule others, at a time when servicing saps most of their
export income.
   French President Francois Mitterrand had appealed to summit
leaders to follow his government's example of cancelling a third of
all debts owed by sub-Saharan nations.
   On the eve of the Toronto talks, former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere reflected most African leaders' repeated appeals
when he told reporters in Rome: ``It is not possible for a minority
of northerners to control the wealth of the world and hope to live
in peace. Sooner or later it (the debt crisis) is going to
explode.''
   Nyerere, chairman of the South Commission set up in 1986 to
promote economic cooperation between Third World countries, urged
the rich nations to defuse a ``poverty bomb'' by writing off all
debts.
   Leaders like Nyerere argue that they have been virtually
bankrupted by foreign-fixed low prices for their exports and high
costs of imports, particularly oil. But they resist some calls to
arbitrarily cancel the debts, fearing they will be denied future
credits and trade.
   Some Western economists also cite natural calamities like
drought and famine and man-made tragedies such as civil war,
rampant corruption and government mismanagement for Africa's
economic ills.
   But all agree that most of the continent's 550 million people
suffer from lack of development and limited spending on schooling,
health and housing.
   The Toronto plan for the poor nations calls for creditor
countries to reschedule official debts, according to the final
communique.
   But it did not hold the seven powers to any particular pledges,
offering them instead options including reduced interest rates on
short-term loans, extended repayment periods at higher interest
rates, partial cancellation of loans or a combination of all those
measures.
   ``It marked the end of the disturbing silence which those
countries that Africa owes money had long maintained on the debt
issue,'' the ruling party-owned Times of Zambia noted in its
editorial.

<HEAD>EEC Decides To Free Steel Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community decided Friday
to free its steel market, ending a protection system that imposed
maximum production quotas on steel companies for the past eight
years.
   Taking advantage of an improving market and under pressure from
the European Commission, which is in charge of steel policy, the 12
EEC industry ministers decided to lift by July 1 the quotas applied
to four products: coils, cold-rolled sheets, heavy plates and heavy
sections.
   Quotas will remain on heavy-section steel.
   The EEC steel industry, which already lost 280,000 jobs since
the quota system was started in 1980, is bound to lose between
80,000 to 100,000 more, said European Industry Commissioner
Karl-Heinz Narjes.

<HEAD>Dollar Continues Upward Surge; Gold Falls</HEAD>

   The dollar continued its upward surge Friday,
piercing key psychological resistance points to reach levels
against many major currencies not seen in eight months.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid price of $443 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down
sharply from $447.90 late Thursday.
   Traders said activity was hectic, particularly following a
report that quoted an unnamed U.S. official as saying the dollar
could rise as high as 138 Japanese yen before diminishing the
competitiveness of the nation's exports.
   The report said ``a 5 percent increase (in the dollar) would not
be that big a deal, and we traded right up to that point,'' said
Stephen Flanagan, an assistant vice president at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co.
   While the dollar gyrated up and down, Flanagan said the
currency's basic upward direction is ``being sparked by some very
large buying.''
   He said the dollar is ``seeing good investor demand from
Japan,'' where investors are attracted by relatively higher U.S.
interest rates as well as strong recent rallies in the stock and
bond markets.
   Still, some analysts remained puzzled by the dollar's strong
showing.
   ``From an economic point of view, there's really not all that
much fundamentally to support the dollar,'' said Jack Barbanel, a
senior vice president at Gruntal & Co.
   He noted, however, that a Commerce Department report that
personal income rose a modest 0.3 percent in May supported the
contention that inflation is in check.
   Traders shrugged off rumors of central bank intervention to stem
the dollar's advance, and the currency pushed beyond the sharp
gains it posted earlier Friday in European trading.
   Overseas, active buying by U.S. banks helped push the dollar
past the psychologically important barrier of 1.80 West German
marks late in European trading, despite midday dollar sales by the
West German central bank.
   ``People were expecting a downward correction, and when it
didn't materialize, the dollar went higher,'' said Robert Bauer, a
senior dealer at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 1.15 Japanese yen to a closing 129.70 yen. Later in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 130.05 yen. In New York
the dollar posted further gains, finishing at 130.53 yen, up from
128.62 yen on Thursday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7430 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7565 late Thursday. In
New York a pound cost $1.7270, cheaper than Thursday's $1.7552.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.8155 West German marks, up from 1.7850;
1.5030 Swiss francs, up from 1.4763; 6.1110 French francs, up from
6.0050; 1,344.00 Italian lire, up from 1,323.88, and 1.2033
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2022.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.8010 West German marks, up from 1.7855; 1.4945 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4800; 6.0635 French francs, up from 6.0245;
2.0305 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0145; 1,330.37 Italian lire, up
from 1,326.50, and 1.2050 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2030.
   Gold prices fell. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold closed
at $443 per troy ounce, down from $447.70 late Thursday.
   In London gold fell to a late bid price of $442.90 a troy ounce,
down from late Thursday's $448.75. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold
closed at a bid $443.50, down from $448.50. Earlier, the metal
closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $448.55, down from $449.78.
   Silver on New York's Comex fell to $6.800 a troy ounce from
$6.967 on Thursday. In London the metal was trading at a late bid
price of $6.84 a troy ounce, down from Thursday's $7.02.

   Bond prices advanced Friday in quiet dealings as
the dollar extended its recent gains in foreign-exchange trading.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose half a point, or $5
per $1,000 in face value, as its yield fell to 8.85 percent from
8.92 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said the price increase was due to another rise in the
dollar, which has gained ground steadily this week against other
major currencies.
   A higher dollar increases the yields available to foreign
investors on dollar-denominated securities, such as U.S. bonds and
notes.
   Most of the gains occurred early in the session, and trading was
described as relatively light.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose 5-32 point, intermediate maturities rose by
between 7-32 point and 13-32 point and 20-year issues rose ] point,
according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a
business-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.27 to 110.13. The Shearson Lehman Hutton
Daily Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose
3.01 to 1,153.19.
   Corporate bonds were little changed. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.60
to 284.19.
   In the tax-exempt market, prices edged up 1-16 point, according
to the Bond Buyer Municipal Bond Index.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell 4 basis points to 6.49
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills were unchanged at 6.76 percent and one-year bills
fell 3 basis points to 6.98 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7| percent, down from 7 9-16
percent late Thursday.

   A cold front brought rain to parts of the parched upper Midwest
on Friday and record chill to the sweltering Northeast, but hot,
dry weather elsewhere withered crops and boosted the cost of
everything from grain to fish bait.
   It was the eighth straight day of 100-degree heat over the
central part of the nation.
   A plan to pour more water into the Missouri River for shipping
ran aground because it would have destroyed nesting areas for
endangered birds. But the Mississippi was reopened to barges at
Memphis, Tenn., after dredging opened a channel through a shallow
area.
   Forest fires fanned by hot wind blazed in Montana and Idaho, and
at least seven North Dakota counties have banned fireworks on July
4 because of the fire danger. Wisconsin banned outdoor smoking,
open fires and fireworks in all state parks, forests and other
state land Friday.
   Temperatures soared again at the end of a week that saw scores
of high temperatures records shattered. The sun was barely directly
overhead when the temperature at Sioux Falls, S.D., hit 100 degrees
and tied the record. The overnight low at North Platte, Neb., was
hardly low at all, dipping only to a record 74.
   Fewer cities reached record high temperatures Friday. They
included 97 at Casper, Wyo.; 101 at Chattanooga, Tenn.; 93 at
Cheyenne, Wyo.; 100 at Des Moines, Iowa; 101 at Kansas City, Mo.;
101 at Paducah, Ky.; 103 at Sioux City, Iowa; and 103 at Sioux
Falls, S.D. It was Sioux City's fifth consecutive record. The
official 3 p.m. EDT high for the 48 contiguous states was 109 at
Pierre, S.D., the National Weather Service said.
   In St. Louis, the medical examiner's office said three elderly
women had died of hyperthermia. In Georgia, Thomas County Coroner
Sam Brown said a woman died of a heart attack brought on by heat
stroke while working in a tobacco field.
   In Savannah, Ga., the Senior Citizens of Savannah-Chatham County
and the Savannah Energy Aging Consortium distributed 25 fans to the
elderly Thursday, making it 424 given out since May.
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower Friday on the Chicago
Board of Trade after overnight thundershowers spread rain over
parts of Minnesota across Wisconsin and Iowa into Illinois.
   Some parts of Iowa got more than 2 inches of rain before the hot
air returned to bake the soil.
   ``Last week the (soy) beans and corn were all curled and
shriveled, and now it looks like they're coming back,'' said Morris
Greenley, who farms near Independence, Iowa. But he said he still
faces a 20 percent cutback on his normal yields even if he gets an
average of 1 inch of rain per week for the rest of the growing
season.
   Steve Hollinger of the Illinois State Water Survey said that as
of June 15 there was ``virtually no moisture available to plants in
the top six inches of soil.'' Below that, down to 40 inches, he
said, there is about a two-week supply of moisture.
   The front ushered cool air into the Northeast and record lows
were reported in a half-dozen cities, including Burlington, Vt.,
with a chill 40 degrees. Cool air also hit the Northwest, and
Olympia, Wash., tied its record of 39.
   It's not just plants that suffer in the heat.
   Farmers have dumped about 40,000 pounds of dead cattle and hogs
a day at the Worthington Rendering Co. in southwestern Minnesota,
four times the usual volume, said manager Marlin Terhark. The
majority were victims of heat, he said.
   ``It just hurts more when you stand there and count 'em,'' said
Loren Forest of rural Luverne, Minn., saying he couldn't bear to
count the 3-month-old pigs that died this week when a cooling
sprinkler failed at his farm.
   Urban shoppers may notice some price hikes caused by the
drought, but a more immediate effect is visible at farmers' markets
in some cities.
   Candi Elston, who manages a farmers' market in Urbana, Ill.,
said five to seven regular vendors were missing this week and
people who do show up have ``less and less to sell. The drought is
the major topic of conversation.''
   Even the price of fishing is going up because nightcrawlers, a
large variety of earthworm popular as bait, have gone deep
underground seeking cooler, moist habitat.
   ``Wholesale prices of nightcrawlers are the highest in the 46
years we've been in business,'' said Phil Koep, who runs a
wholesale bait supply business in Clitherall, Minn. By July 4, he
said, the wholesale price of nightcrawlers will have doubled from a
year ago.
   On the Missouri River, the Corps of Engineers can't increase the
flow of water from the Gavins Point Dam on the South
Dakota-Nebraska border to aid shipping because that would threaten
nests of the federally protected piping plover and interior least
tern. ``Our attorneys tell us the Endangered Species law takes
precedence over the corps' obligation to maintain navigation,''
said Chet Worm, chief of reservoir operations in Omaha, Neb.
   Barges are carrying reduced loads because of low water, and
corps officials fear two weeks more without rain could endanger
traffic in some sections.
   Dredging continued on the Ohio River near Mound City, Ill.,
which was closed Tuesday when a towboat ran aground in shallow
water.
   A section of the Mississippi north of Memphis, Tenn., also was
closed much of the week for dredging.
   A fire in ponderosa pine forest grew to 15,000 acres Friday in
the Custer National Forest of southeastern Montana and was fought
by 600 firefighters. The blaze shifted late Thursday and trapped
firefighters, injuring 18. They survived by lying inside one-man
aluminum fire shelters while flames passed over them, said Bureau
of Land Management spokeswoman Michelle Ravnikar.

   Stocks retreated again Friday in moderate
trading, which brokers attributed largely to investors cashing
profits from the market's big advance earlier in the week.
   The weakness came despite news of a sharply higher dollar and
lower interest rates in the credit markets, which some traders
believe could emerge as key elements for a sustained summer rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 3.91
points Thursday, lost another 5.33 to close at 2,142.96, finishing
the week with a gain of 38.94 or 1.9 percent. Broader market
indices were mostly lower, although they ended with the week with
gains.
   Some traders said they weren't surprised at the profit-taking,
given the market's unpredictability. Others were disappointed.
   A few said talk had resurfaced that the dollar's new strength,
instead of helping stocks by easing inflation and attracting
foreign buyers, could prove harmful by blunting the improvement in
the nation's trade deficit.
   ``Anytime the market makes a good run, somebody comes out with
something on the negative,'' said Philip C. Puccio, senior vice
president and manager of institutional trading at Dillon Read & Co.
in New York. ``People should stop thinking about the short term and
take the blinders off.''
   But Gerald Rivlin, executive vice president at Rodman & Renshaw
Inc. in Chicago, said he believed the investing climate had
shifted, with more emphasis on the healthy elements in the economy.
   Despite the weakness Friday, Rivlin said he expected foreign
investors, particularly Japanese, to be aggressive buyers of stocks
if the dollar's strength persists.
   ``I think the market in Japan is topping it up,'' he said.
``There's only one place to go, and that's the U.S.''
   Declining stocks outnumbered advances by more than a 7-to-6
ratio in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 774 issues down, 662 up and 525 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 179.88 million shares,
down from 185.77 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
205.59 million shares.
   Among the most notable issues, Middle South Utilities jumped 2[
to 13\ on volume exceeding 9 million shares. The Supreme Court
severely limited state authority to lower electric rates, reversing
a lower-court ruling that had voided a $326 million rate increase
by one of the utility's subsidiaries.
   Mergers and acquisitions, rumored and real, affected several
stocks. Payless Cashways rose 2| to 25| after management offered to
buy the company for $26 a share. MacMillan rose 2\ to 74~ after
Texas investor Robert M. Bass said he was prepared to start a
hostile tender offer at $73 a share. Gould rose 2~ to 17~ on talk
of a possible takeover offer from Westinghouse.
   Oil stocks were widely lower on reports that Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait might increase production sharply. Chevron fell 1{ to 48\,
Amoco fell 1[ to 76{ and Atlantic Richfield fell ~ to 82|.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and over-the-counter issues, fell $5.4 billion or 0.2
percent.
   The NYSE composite index of all listed issues fell 0.47 to
154.56.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 1.40 to 316.18,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index fell 1.04 to 273.78.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.33
to 308.49. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 391.62, up 0.59.

<HEAD>Grain Rally Stalls As Skittish Market Takes A Breather</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Retransmitting to fix header.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought-driven rally in most grain and soybean futures
markets stalled Friday as scattered showers forced skittish traders
to pause for a look at reality, analysts said.
   Prices yo-yoed on the Chicago Board of Trade but finished mixed
with only oat futures continuing the sharply higher trend
established earlier in the week.
   On other exchanges, precious metals futures fell sharply;
livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures slipped; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   ``This thing has more lives than a cat. It kept coming back and
coming back,'' Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said of the grain market's erratic performance.
   Reports of scattered showers in the Farm Belt and expectations
for more rain dampened the buying enthusiam that has driven grain
and soybean futures prices up sharply this month. But the market's
resilience suggested prices could skyrocket again next week if the
weekend is dry and meteorologists continue to foresee drought
conditions, analysts said.
   Soybeans opened lower, climbed higher, fell sharply, then came
back to settle mixed for the session but substantially below the
15-year high of $10.99{ a bushel reached Thursday. Corn futures
followed a similar path.
   ``It's a particularly sensitive time right now as far as the
market is concerned,'' said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The crop is still under stress but traders are trying to
answer the question, `Has this recent runup in price discounted a
lot of the potential damage or is there a lot more discounting that
has to take place?' And that will be answered early next week.''
   Wheat finished slightly higher and 1988 oat futures, which
reached record highs earlier this week, soared their daily limit
for the fifth consecutive session on reports of severe,
irreversible crop damage.
   Wheat settled 2} cents lower to 6 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in July at $3.80{ a bushel; corn was 5{ cents lower to
2{ cents higher with July at $3.42{ a bushel; oats were 6 cents
lower to 15 cents higher with July at $3.63 a bushel; soybeans were
10 cents lower to 10 cents higher with July at $10.29{ a bushel.
   Precious metals futures fell sharply on New York's Commodity
Exchange in response to the dollar's strong gains against other
currencies.
   A stronger dollar is perceived as reducing the potential for
inflation, analysts said. A variety of government reports issued
this week indicating only modest growth in the economy also helped
cool inflation fears.
   Precious metals, which are perceived as an investment hedge
against inflation, tend to rise and fall with inflationary
expectations.
   ``The markets are feeling that maybe the economy is nt
overheating and that's helped to reduce concerns about inflation,''
said Craig Sloane, a metals analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
& Co. in New York.
   Gold settled $4.70 to $6.60 lower with August at $446 a troy
ounce; silver was 17.5 cents to 18.1 cents lower with July at $6.81
a troy ounce.
   Copper was 1.55 cents to 4.60 cents lower with July at $1.045 a
pound.
   Cattle futures advanced, hogs were mixed and frozen pork bellies
continued their steep slide on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The steadying grain futures boosted cattle futures on ideas that
feed prices may not rise high enough to force as much herd-thinning
as had been feared, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling
Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   The grain markets also supported hog futures but not enough to
overcome the bearish implications of Wednesday's Agriculture
Department report showing large supplies of pork and poultry in
cold storage, Morgan said.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .65 cent higher with August at
62.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent to 1.08 cents
higher with August at 70.85 cents a pound; hogs were .95 cent lower
to .52 cent higher with July at 44.92 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies, falling the 2-cent limit for the third straight day, were
1.8 cents to 2 cents lower with July at 38.20 cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices skidded as profit-taking ended a three-day
rally in the gasoline pit at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 27 cents to 36 cents
lower with August at $16.01 a barrel; heating oil was .77 cent to
.97 cent lower with July at 43.14 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .05 cent to .36 cent lower with July at 50.91 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures posted moderate losses on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of
the Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 1.95 points lower at 275.20.

   Foreign ministers of Mexico, Brazil,
Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay planned to spend
the weekend discussing ways to integrate Latin America's economies.
   The agenda for the two-day meeting also included the problem of
drug trafficking and ways of improving cooperation in technical,
educational and cultural areas.
   Only seven foreign ministers in the so-called Group of Eight
were attending the meeting in this state capital 300 miles south of
Mexico City.
   Panama was suspended in February because of the political crisis
precipitated by the U.S. drug-trafficking indictment against its
military ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The sensitive issue of Panama's standing will be taken up Monday
at a separate meeting in Mexico City, officials said. The group has
also deferred its discussion about the slow progress of a regional
peace plan for Central America until Monday.
   Officials of several regional economic and development
organizations were at the Oaxaca meeting to ``exchange points of
view about schemes for coordinating the process of integration,''
the Mexican Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
   The statement said the foreign ministers would also discuss the
recent economic summit of the major industrialized nations in
Toronto.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines said Friday it expected to
report a second-quarter loss because of a $131 million upward
revision in estimated expenses for foreign currency fluctuations
and passenger scheduling foulups.
   Continental said in a statement that the revised estimate would
be identified separately in the second-quarter earnings report of
its parent firm, Texas Air Corp.
   The Houston-based airline said its estimates for categories such
as ticketing errors and currency fluctuations were short by $67
million, while estimates for reaccommodation costs for transporting
ticketholders on other airlines was off by $64 million.
   ``These accounts are really unearned revenue,'' spokesman Bruce
Hicks said. ``When we collect for tickets, until flights are flown,
it is unearned revenue and an air traffic liability.
   ``The number always is an estimate. We noticed a decline in that
account very recently and did a thorough review and in last few
days determined the magnitude of this.''
   The airline said that like other carriers, it conducts an annual
verification of such accounts, but made the review earlier than
normal because the accounts had been declining in recent months.
   Hicks said the changes in estimates would have no impact on
current or future cash levels of Continental and that the airline
expects to be profitable for the last half of 1988.

<HEAD>Payless Management Offers $875 Million for Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top management of Payless Cashways Inc.
offered to acquire the building materials company for $875 million
in an apparent effort to discourage unwanted attention from New
York investor Asher B. Adelman.
   A group headed by Payless chairman David Stanley offered to pay
$26 a share for the company's 33.6 million shares of common stock
outstanding.
   The management offer pre-empts any attempt at making a bid by
Edelman, who has been building a stake in Payless and has said he
might be interested in bidding for the nation's third-largest
building materials retailer.
   Stanley, who is also chief executive, and other members of
management acknowledged two weeks ago they were considering a
buyout.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Payless Cashways rose
$2.62{ a share to $25.62{. It was one of the 10 most-active issues.
   Edelman amassed his stake with Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc.
of Kansas City, a privately owned Payless competitor that operates
about 86 building materials stores in Midwest and Southern states.
   At one point the Edelman group held about 9.9 percent of
Payless's outstanding shares but has recently been reducing its
holdings, which now account for about 8.1 percent of the company's
shares.
   Perry Sutherland, an executive in Sutherland Lumber, said the
group was still interested in acquiring Payless.
   The Payless management group said it has received commitments to
finance the entire offer, which would be structured as a leveraged
buyout. In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy a
company and then pay off the debt with the target company's cash
flow or the sale of its assets.
   The group headed by Stanley owned less than 2 percent of the
company stock at the time of the last proxy statement on Feb. 25.
   Payless said a special committee of independent directors formed
to consider takover proposals would evaluate the proposal.
   Payless serves the home improvement, maintenance and repair
market with 200 retail stores in 26 states.
   Other managers involved in the offer include Larry P. Kunz,
president and chief operating officer, and Melvin Cohen and Harold
Cohen, co-chairmen of Somerville Lumber and Supply Inc., a Payless
subsidiary.
   The Edelman group had said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it would consider selling Payless
operations as ``going concerns'' in many regions of the country.
   Bruce Benteman, a research analyst at the securities firm Wealth
Monitors Inc., said he didn't expect Edelman to make a serious
counteroffer for Payless. Benteman said Edelman had probably sold
off more Payless stock since the last report.

   A floating general store and fuel depot
that ferries supplies to passing towboats has seen business dry up
as the worst drought in 50 years has sporadically halted barge
traffic on the shrinking Mississippi River.
   ``The boats are just sitting out there. The diesel fuel sales
have all but come to a halt. Things have come to a standstill,''
said Robert Luttrell, executive vice president of Waterways Marine
Inc. He estimated the shutdown has caused a 30 percent to 40
percent drop in business.
   ``We've never seen anything like this. We're working on unplowed
ground,'' Luttrell said.
   The mighty Mississippi is at an all-time low since records were
first kept in 1872. It was closed to commercial traffic from
Tuesday evening until Friday because the channel about six miles
north of Memphis was six inches shy of the 9-foot depth needed to
allow towboats and their barges to pass.
   A 35-foot-wide dredge was sent in to clear the channel, and
until it finished 56 towboats and their barges were parked along a
40-mile stretch of river around Memphis. The river has fallen so
low, some boats had trouble finding trees near enough to the water
for anchor lines.
   ``We should have all the backup cleared out of here by mid-day
Sunday,'' Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Donohoe said after the one-way
channel was reopened, for south-bound traffic first.
   When traffic was at a standstill, Waterways Marine was ferrying
groceries, drinking water, newspapers and mail to the idled boats.
   ``It's a mess,'' said general manager David Cummings, an
ex-river pilot whose first job was on a steam-powered, sidewheeled
paddleboat.``The problem here is there's no relief in sight as far
as the rain forecasts go. This is a crisis.''
   In normal times, 30 to 50 towboats churn past Memphis daily,
pushing barges loaded with wheat, corn, fertilizer, coal, steel,
gas, jet fuel, oil, chemicals, cement, auto parts and other bulk
goods.
   It would take 27,000 trucks to haul a day's cargo on the
Mississippi, which is like a natural interstate highway that serves
as a lifeline to the nation.
   Some of the larger towboats cost $1,000 an hour to run, so they
lose money if they stop. They like to refuel and restock supplies
on the run.
   Waterways Marine can deliver more than 5,000 items. All a boat
has to do is radio in orders for steaks, potatoes, coffee, flour,
sugar, ice cream, watermelons, milk and all types of hardware.
   ``I can't remember it being this dry for this long. I can't
remember the river being closed this long,'' said Cummings. ``We've
just got to live with it if that's what the Lord wants and pray for
rain.''
   Tommy Pinion, 38, of Lambert, Miss., pilots fuel boats for the
depot.
   ``I've never seen the water so low that the boats can't get
through,'' Pinion said. ``It's going to hurt a lot of people if the
companies have to start laying people off.
   ``The whole river industry will be hurt.''

<HEAD>GE Workers at Indiana Plant May Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,800 workers at General
Electric Corp.'s plant here may be headed to the picket line if
their union's local and national negotiators don't reach a contract
settlement soon.
   Representatives of the company and the dozen labor unions which
represent GE's 67,000 union employees have been meeting in New York
since June 17 trying to negotiate a national contract. The current
contract expires at midnight Sunday.
   A bargaining team from the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers Local 2249 has been trying to negotiate a local
contract for workers. But, those negotiations have been postponed
until next week because the union's president is involved in
national negotations in New York.
   Most of GE's unionized workers are covered by the national
contract. However, the electrical workers union operates
independently, which means that salary and benefits settlements are
based on those reached in national negotiations, but are not
formally bound by national contracts. Work rules and other local
issues are negotiated separately as part of the local contract.
   A telephone taped message for unionized GE employees from the
national negotiating committee Friday said negotiations were
stalemated and urged workers to prepare for a possible strike.
   ``So far, bargaining progress is non-existent,'' the recording
said. ``There is a real possibility we will be forced to strike.
Members are urged to prepare for a job action, and make sure
management knows you are militant.''
   However, a clause in the existing contract requires the union to
give the company 10 days notice before calling a strike. GE
Bloomington Manager of Employee Relations Mike Horrigan said the
electrical workers local is not technically required to follow the
terms of the national contract, but has always done so.
   GE officials at company headquarters in Fairfield, Conn.,
believe that the differences between the company and the unions can
be resolved.
   ``There are still differences to resolve, but we believe that
both parties will make every effort to work out agreement,'' said
Jack Batty, a GE spokesman.
   ``We still have two days to go, and we'll be negotiating right
up to the deadline. We're still very hopeful that there will be a
satisfactory settlement,'' he said.
   ``We're working toward a Sunday deadline, and the two sides are
meeting continuously,''said Jerry Borstel, a spokesman for the IUE
and the joint union bargaining committee. ``We don't know at this
point what's going to happen, but we do expect to get an offer from
GE on Sunday.
   ``It's important that our members not assume that this thing is
going to be easy or anything like that,'' he said.
   Borstel said job security has been a major issue in the national
negotiations because of a large number of layoffs, cutbacks and
plant shutdowns during the past few years. He said the union also
hopes to win a substantial wage increase for workers.

   Americans' personal income and spending grew
modestly in May, but economists said consumer spending likely will
weaken this summer as wages lag behind inflation.
   The Commerce Department reported Friday that income rose 0.3
percent last month following a 0.1 percent gain in April.
   Meanwhile, personal consumption expenditures, which include
virtually everything except interest on debt, rose a moderate 0.5
percent in May following a 0.4 percent increase in April.

   Riverboat business has shriveled as the
worst drought in 50 years slowed traffic on the mighty Mississippi
River.
   Boats and barges were parked along a 40-mile stretch of the

was reopened after a three-day shutdown because of low water levels.
   Floating stores, fuel depots and other river businesses depend
on healthy traffic along the river for their survival and some say
the prolonged drought is responsible for a 40 percent drop in
