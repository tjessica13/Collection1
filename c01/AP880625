<HEAD>GM Executive To Return To Chicago Law Firm, Sources Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elmer Johnson, executive vice president and a
director of General Motors Corp., plans to leave the automaker and
return to a Chicago law firm, the Detroit Free Press reported in
Saturday's editions.
   The official announcement is expected to come when GM's board of
directors meets Monday, according to GM executives who spoke to the
newspaper on the condition of anonymity.
   Johnson, 56, decided to leave his job because his
often-controversial ideas to change the nation's top automaker have
been ignored, the executives said.
   Johnson was on vacation and couldn't be reached and GM declined
official comment, the newspaper said.
   Dan Vittum, a partner in the Chicago law firm of Kirkland &
Ellis, wouldn't confirm that Johnson was returning to the firm.
   Johnson has remained a partner in the firm since joining GM in
1983. He sits on its management committee, for which he receives
$30,000 annually, Vittum said.

<TEXT>
   The Polk County Sheriff's Office is making
its own crack these days, having decided it is a safer and more
efficient way to supply its undercover agents for sales to drug
buyers.
   While most law enforcement agencies use crack confiscated during
investigations for undercover operations, Polk officials decided
they needed more than the ``very limited supply'' of crack they had
on hand, a department report said.
   In addition, there were worries about impurities sometimes found
in confiscated crack.
   Turning powder cocaine into crack cocaine requires a powdery
base substance as well as the drug. Some dealers have been known to
use Drano or other toxic chemicals as the base, sheriff's Lt. James
Madden said recently.
   ``After reviewing all our options and checking with other
agencies in the state that are taking an aggressive approach to
crack, we felt the safest and most reliable way to handle these
reverses would be use crack that was produced in a clean,
controlled environment,'' the report said.
   Polk County deputies posing as drug dealers have routinely set
up shop in known drug neighborhoods and sold crack to drug buyers
in cars. Deputies have made more than 600 reverse-sting arrests
since the campaign began in earnest last fall.
   The Sheriff's Office crack was made at the department by a
supervisor in the drug unit who had gone over the fairly simple
cooking procedure with technicians from the Florida Department of
Law Enforcement. Baking powder was used as a base substance.
   The cooking session produced 11 ounces, enough to make several
thousand pieces of crack in the size commonly sold on the street,
officials said.

   Looking for a unique setting to exchange vows?
How about an old pier, complete with dramatic view of the city, a
gentle lake breeze, and a couple of fishermen and joggers thrown in
for charm?
   The city's Marriage Bureau offers the service at Navy Pier on
Lake Michigan as an alternative to the mundane civil ceremony at
City Hall.
   The $10 price won't hurt the wallet much and the view is almost
guaranteed to take the wedding party's breath away.
   ``A judge from Circuit Court marries the couples. ... It's like
getting married at the City Hall only you get married at lovely
Navy Pier,'' said Susan Wayman, who coordinates the weddings for
the Department of Cultural Affairs.
   ``You can be as elaborate as you want, within reason,'' Ms.
Wayman said Friday.
   ``I've seen six bridesmaids and flower girls'' at one wedding,
she said. ``I've seen couples arrive by horse and carriage ... and
a lot of people walk out just casually dressed. It runs the gamut.''
   The pier, which once was bustling with Great Lakes' shippers, is
frequented by athletes and anglers, so couples who marry there
should be prepared for ``fishermen sitting right next to them ...
and joggers jogging right by,'' Ms. Wayman said.

<TEXT>
   From a distance, there's no telling
sign that the noisy children and teen-agers romping around a summer
camp share the deep emotional and physical scars that accompany
disfiguring burns.
   ``We try to give them a whole week to be free of their burn,''
said Shirley Turner, who heads the special camp.
   It's called Wonder Valley Ranch, this secluded spot nestled in
the Sierra Nevada Mountains 200 miles southeast of San Francisco.
This week 77 young burn survivors from Mexico to Washington state
frolicked in a swimming pool, rode ponies or cast a fishing line
into a trout pond.
   ``If my mom wouldn't have taken me, I would have walked here,''
declared David, an 11-year-old enjoying the camp sponsored by the
Alisa Ann Ruch California Burn Foundation. ``The counselors are
real cool. They treat you really nice.''
   Mrs. Turner, the foundation's executive director, described the
camp as therapy to help fortify a burn victim's self-esteem. Most
important, it lets them simply be kids free from a society too
often repelled by the disfigurement of burns.
   There is one strict rule: No one can ask the children about
their accident.
   ``That's why camp is so good for them _ they don't have to deal
with the accident,'' said Mrs. Turner. ``We don't want them
reliving that.''
   The children splashing in the pool on a hot summer morning
played as if they never had endured painful skin grafts, worn an
uncomfortable pressure garment to reduce swelling or been cruelly
teased by peers.
   As Corky and Cecily splashed around, Corky stretched her scarred
arm around Cecily's back, proclaiming with a wide smile: ``We're
friends.''
   Mrs. Turner's husband, Jim, a Los Angeles County firefighter and
foundation member, said there's little reluctance among these
summer campers to test new experiences.
   ``They've been through so much pain, they'll try anything,''
Turner said.
   The camp is rewarding for the volunteer counselors, mostly
firefighters and their spouses.
   ``If you come up here for a week, you get enough hugs and kisses
to last a year,'' said Nan Ziegler, a nurse from Long Beach.
   ``I love them. They are just little kids. They can forget what
they look like,'' said Christen Powell, a lifeguard from Clovis.
``I'm going to miss these kids.''
   Mrs. Turner said such a loving and accepting environment isn't
typical for burn survivors. Society is wary of burn victims, she
said. Some gawk at a survivor's blistered and grafted skin, while
others treat them like pariahs. She told of an incident of a
restaurant owner asking a family to leave because the sight of
their child, a burn victim, made his patrons uncomfortable.
   These experiences, along with the fact that many burn victims
remain physically scarred for life, add up to a ``devastating''
psychological effect on the victims and their families, Mrs. Turner
said. Easing such trauma is one of the foundation's goals.
   ``Now that (doctors) have solved the major medical problems and
are able to keep them alive, they are now concentrating on the
quality of life,'' she said.
   She estimated that 4,000 children are seriously burned in
California each year.
   All expenses for the children at the camp are paid by the
foundation's fund-raising efforts and volunteer labor. Mrs. Turner
estimated that the week in Wonder Valley, which ends with a trip to
Disneyland, cost the group about $100,000.
   Judging by the the children's grins, it appeared to be money
well spent.
   ``Today and this week they are just kids,'' said Mrs. Turner.
She said she hopes the camp will help make them ``strong enough
inside to take and handle the pressures their peers and adults give
them.''

<DATELINE>RIDGEFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Robert Daley knows that the
quick grip of fear and split-second decisions that can make or
break a cop's career are not just the stuff of police fiction.
   A former deputy commissioner of the New York City Police
Department, Daley has grabbed the attention of readers on subjects
ranging from treasure diving in Florida to bullfighting in Spain,
but is best known for his insider's tales of street crime and
police bureaucracy.
   During an interview at the converted cottage on his Ridgefield
estate where he does his writing, the best-selling author of ``Year
of a Dragon,'' ``Hands of a Stranger'' and ``Prince of the City,''
explained how fact and fantasy merge in his latest novel, ``Man
With a Gun'' (Simon & Schuster, $19.95).
   ``Most of the incidents happened to me one way or the other, but
they didn't happen just that way,'' Daley said. ``All of them have
been extracted from the way they actually happened and moved
together to make a story.''
   The story of ``Man With a Gun'' is loosely based on events
surrounding the Harlem Mosque murder of 1972, when a police officer
was killed during a confrontation between black Muslims and
authorities. The book deals with the power and politics behind the
police handling of a situation where every decision has long-term
consequences.
   ``In moments of terror you do what it seems like you have to do
and no one is responsible for that,'' Daley said.
   ``I made some mistakes which didn't seem like mistakes at the
time,'' he said of his involvement in the Mosque riots.
   Daley and the central character in ``Man With a Gun,'' Phillip
Keefe, are alike in many ways. Keefe is a deputy police
commissioner and, like Daley, resigns after the incident. Keefe is
a former journalist. Daley worked for five years as a foreign
correspondent for The New York Times. Keefe drives a Porsche; so
does Daley.
   However, Keefe is not Daley, the author insists. ``I have no
ghosts to exorcise.''
   For one thing, Keefe is not a successful author. Daley has 20
books to his credit. Five novels have been made into films, and
Paul Newman is slated to play the lead role in ``Man With a Gun.''
   In his novels, the 57-year-old Daley aims to provide more than a
mirror image of life. Literature should provide ``new insights into
your own life, into everybody's life, a new understanding of what
we are all up against,'' he said.
   Novels about the police, however, tend to be grouped together as
thrillers, said Daley, who considers thrillers to be books with
``preposterous characters doing preposterous acts all the time.''
   ``Thriller means discardable, thriller means light
entertainment, thriller means not important,'' he said. ``The word
denigrates what I am trying to do. I think I am writing something
else and keep getting accused of writing thrillers.''
   As an undergraduate studying literature at Fordham University,
Daley said he wanted to be the greatest writer that ever lived. He
has since lowered his goal to writing books that will stand the
test of time.
   Translations of Daley's books cram his closets. ``I can't throw
them away because they are books and books are icons.'' Samples of
his photographic work decorate his walls.
   Daley bought a camera when The New York Times offered to pay him
$15 extra for every photograph used in the newspaper. His
photographs have since been exhibited at the Baltimore Museum, the
Art Institute in Chicago and the New York Gallery of Modern Art.
   But he prefers writing.
   ``To me literature is the greatest of the arts because it takes
you further outside yourself than any other,'' he said, adding
there's also a practical side to his work. ``I don't want to be
poor. I wouldn't give up the things we have in order to be a
renowned writer that no one ever reads.'' He keeps apartments in
France and New York, as well as his Connecticut home where he lives
with his wife.
   Currently working on a ``part personal memoir, part history of
France,'' Daley said he considers the time spent writing the book
as a rest period from the pressures of producing what is expected
of him.
   ``I have to write something that's going to sell,'' he said.
``(You) get trapped in whatever it is that you are doing that's
successful.''

   An art thief who apparently knew a man wanted
to sell a $70,000 painting by Diego Rivera, went to the victim's
residence, asked a maid for the painting and walked away with the
canvas, police said.
   A Mexico City judiciary police report said the theft occurred
last Monday, but the victim, Gonzalo Faustino Gonzalez, didn't find
out about it until Friday.
   When questioned by police, the maid claimed that a black-haired
man with a beard and dark eyeglasses rang the bell of Gonzalez's
home when he was away. The man said he had come to pick up the
painting that Gonazlez wanted to sell, the report said.
   The maid, Aurelia Delgado, said she gave the painting to the
man, the report said.

<TEXT>
   A French judge has prohibited a private television
station from broadcasting a colorized version of ``Asphalt
Jungle,'' a classic John Huston film.
   The ruling Friday was the first of its kind in France.
   Lawyers for the station, La Cinq (Channel 5), said they would
appeal. The colorized version of the 1950 film had been scheduled
to run Sunday night.
   Judge Huguette Le Foyer de Costil said the ruling affected all
of Huston's films. She noted that Huston, who died in August,
opposed colorization and it was her duty to respect his will.
   The French Society of Film Directors, which representives of
Huston's estate in France, had requested the injunction.
   ``We hope the first blow to the `colorizers' will put a
definitive stop to the surge of profiteering against creativity,''
the group said in a news release.
   Huston was so vehemently opposed to the tinting of his films
that he attended a news conference denouncing the process not long
before his death.
   A spokeswoman for La Cinq said the station had aired colorized
films previously, but none in which the authors had expressed their
disapproval.
   French laws protecting the control by artists of their works are
among the strongest in Europe but it has no specific legislation
dealing with colorization.

<HEAD>Europe Has Its Arms Scandals, But Of A Different Kind

<TEXT>
   Europe has its arms scandals, but the
kind that has shaken Washington is unlikely because procurement
programs are run differently and governments generally avoid direct
competition among contractors.
   In Washington, a 2-year-old investigation has focused on
allegations that private consultants bribed government employees to
obtain Pentagon secrets that could help their clients win huge
contracts.
   Proportion alone is a significant factor in the relative
opportunity for corruption. Nothing in Europe even approaches the
colossus of the U.S. defense budget, $290 billion for 1988.
   Sweden and Norway _ respective recent budgets of about $4
billion and $2.8 billion _ have had scandals recently, but they
involved bribery and illegal exports. Both Scandinavian are
considering measures to control their arms traders.
   Even Britain, France and West Germany spend only one-tenth the
amount of money on defense that goes through the Pentagon funnel
every year.
   The giant British Marconi communications group currently is the
object of a year-long fraud investigation, but defense scandals in
Europe seldom are publicized. The Marconi case is based on
suspicions that the company made excessive profits and did not pay
royalties it owed the government.
   Italy had a major bribery scandal a decade ago in which a former
defense minister and an air force chief were convicted of accepting
payoffs from Lockheed, the U.S. aircraft manufacturer.
   In West Germany, Franz Josef Strauss was accused of taking
millions from from Lockheed when he was defense minister in 1961,
but the case was dropped.
   ``The Europeans deal with these things differently. They don't
want to know about them,'' said Aaron Karp, an American who tracks
worldwide weapons sales for SIPRI, the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute.
   ``All over Europe the procurement networks are much smaller than
in the United States.'' he said. ``There are real old-boy networks
here. ... The Europeans are very hesitant to prosecute people on
the team.''
   David Greenwood said European governments seldom use middlemen
on contracts and most weapons come from ``preferred sources'' that
coordinate development programs with defense ministries.
   Greenwood, a professor at Aberdeen University in Scotland, said
in an interview that European governments and companies have
``almost a symbiotic relationship'' and few secrets from each other.
   Lack of competition sometimes bloats prices. London's Guardian
newspaper said recently Parliament's Public Accounts Committee has
complained to the Defense Ministry for years about ``unsatisfactory
administration'' and a ``disturbing failure'' to control costs.
   Karp said corruption is hard to pin down in European
procurements, but some armaments in Europe are three or four times
the price of comparable U.S. weapons systems.
   ``Europeans expect to pay more and they accept that. It's the
price they pay to keep their independence from the United States,''
he said.
   According to Greenwood, ``The key difference with the Americans
is that in Europe until recently you didn't have consultants, the
`Beltway Bandits,' or people who are hungry for contracts.''
   France's Defense Ministry controls 15 percent of the national
arms production and the government has a share in companies that
handle about half the rest, a ministry spokesman said.
   Supervision of arms sales in Europe is handled by government
agencies, sometimes by parliaments. Italy has no oversight process,
said a spokesman for the prime minister's office.
   When corruption occurs in the European arms trade, it usually
involves export sales, especially to Third World countries.
   Bofors AB, the privately owned Swedish munitions company, is
accused of paying $50 million in bribes and commissions to get a
$2.4 billion artillery contract from India.
   Some of the money allegedly found its way to Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party, spawning charges in New Delhi of
government corruption.
   For deals in many parts of the world, bribery payments are
incorporated in to the prices of weapons, two sources said
privately.
   One, a retired Swedish salesman of defense equipment, said of
India: ``It was taken for granted that you can't secure an arms
deal without bribes.''
   Bofors, the largest arms maker in Sweden, also is accused of
circumventing rules against selling weapons to nations that are at
war or located in volatile regions. The rules are meant to
safeguard Swedish neutrality.
   Four former Bofors executives were indicted this week on charges
of smuggling anti-aircraft missile systems to Dubai and Bahrain in
the Persian Gulf, where Iran and Iraq are at war. None was accused
of profiting personally.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson threatened to halt all arms
exports unless the companies follow the regulations.
   Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk, Norway's largest defense contractor,
admitted violating Western export controls by selling equipment to
the Soviet Union that would enable it to built quieter submarines.
   The deal, revealed last year, led to a public apology from Prime
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland to President Reagan.

   Floods and landslides caused by more than a week
of heavy rains have killed 62 people in two provinces in eastern
China, official reports said today.
   Six of the victims were children killed when a waterlogged
school building collapsed in Zhejiang province's Longquan County,
the official China Daily reported.
   Heavy rains also fell this week in Jiangxi province on
Zhejiang's western border, causing a landslide that killed at least
17 people, the paper said.
   Reports today did not specify where or how the other 39 people
died.
   The Xinhua News Agency said 212,420 acres of farmland have been
flooded and nearly 6,400 homes destroyed in Zhejiang since the
rains began June 15.
   The rains in Jiangxi have flooded 568,000 acres of farmland and
forced 14,000 people to flee their homes, the China Daily said.
   The report said four to 12 inches of rain fell on various parts
of Zhejiang during a 10-day period ending Friday. Zhejiang normally
receives about four inches of rain during the entire month of June.
   In China, the rainy season generally lasts until mid-July and
more storms are forecast.
   Heavy storms last month in the same area of China killed at
least 131 people and heavily damaged crops.

<HEAD>Under Glasnost, School History Exams Give Way To `Discussion'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Saturday AMs report.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Before glasnost, School No. 734 would have looked
like this: 17-year-olds lined up in the hall in the summer heat,
nervously awaiting a grilling on Soviet politics and history by a
panel of teachers.
   That's what lanky, blond-haired Dmitri Predkov and his
classmates at the school in eastern Moscow had been expecting
Friday. But last month, the head of Soviet education, Gennady A.
Yagodin, suddenly ordered the tests canceled.
   The reason: The final exams would have made students in the
final year of school parrot material in textbooks now contradicted
by the revelations of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for more
openness in history and other areas.
   Instead, Dmitri and his 24 classmates, like 10th graders
nationwide, were called into school for a three-hour ungraded
``discussion'' to gauge their knowledge of the past and awareness
of problems facing the Soviet Union today.
   ``We want to be sure that the children can take part in
discussions and are able to to voice their opinion anywhere,'' said
their teacher, Vera F. Zorich, 53.
   Despite that wish, most of the teen-age Muscovites who gathered
at 9 a.m. Friday around four tables in a geography classroom said
nothing during the ensuing ``discussion,'' despite repeated
prompting from teachers.
   Some, however, aired views at odds with official ideology, and
that presumably would have gotten them into trouble only a few
years ago. One even joked about the Russian Revolution.
   Predkov stood up to say that Gorbachev's program for
``perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring, was not a
natural consequence of the growth of Soviet socialism, and that
people who say otherwise do so ``only because Gorbachev is the head
of our party.''
   ``We don't have any rights. They're just words on paper,''
declared the son of a building engineer.
   Glasnost, Dmitri added, may allow more candor about history, but
it doesn't mean Soviet citizens are getting more information about
current political problems.
   Another 17-year-old, wearing a thin black tie, said Soviets of
all schools of thought, even ``fascists,'' should have the legal
right to form their own political parties to challenge the
Communist Party that Gorbachev heads.
   Gennady Kaztman, whose father works as a printer, made his
classmates and teachers roar with laughter by telling this
bittersweet joke about the legacy of the 1917 Russian Revolution:
   When the Bolsheviks seized power, Gennady said, a Russian
countess whose grandfather had been a 19th-century revolutionary
summoned her maid to see what the shouting in the streets was about.
   ``Why, Madame, it's the revolution,'' the maid replied.
   ``Oh yes, grandfather dreamed of that. Tell me, what do they
want?'' the countess asked.
   ``Why, they want a society where there are no more rich people.''
   ``Strange,'' the countess replied. ``Grandfather wanted a
society where there were no more poor people.''
   ``Four years ago, maybe even a year ago, they would not have
dared speak like that,'' a beaming Mrs. Zorich told a visiting
reporter at the end of the meeting.
   In recent months, Soviet educators and official media have
heaped scorn on the country's history textbooks, which have been
outpaced by criticism in the glasnost-revitalized media about the
crimes of dictator Josef V. Stalin and corruption and stagnation
under Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   ``Frankly, the books are of the `hooray' type,'' said Tatyana
Cherkashena, head of teaching methods in the Moscow neighborhood
where School No. 734 is located. ``In our country, they say,
everything is wonderful _ `hooray.' Those who perished in the
repressions, those who were imprisoned, are not even mentioned.''
   A recent competition was held to select a new generation of
Soviet textbooks, but it is uncertain whether they will be ready
for the next school year in September. In the meantime, many Soviet
teachers have been using articles published in the press as the
basis for their history lessons.
   In years past, 10th grade students taking their final exams were
given a slip of paper that bore two questions on history and
civics. After a half-hour or more to prepare, they were called
before a panel of teachers to speak and answer questions.
   In May, the principal of School 734, Alexander N. Tubelsky, was
informed by the State Committee on Education that the customary
year-end history exams for senior school pupils had been canceled.
   ``We weren't told about how to structure the discussions, so we
decided to use the regular form of our history class, which the
students would feel comfortable with,'' Tubelsky said.
   ``We need to change out textbooks,'' he added. ``They are based
on a Stalinist conception that sees every event, every historical
figure, through the dogma of class warfare.''

   The trustees of Atlanta University and Clark
College voted Friday to merge the schools into a new entity, Clark
Atlanta University.
   Atlanta University is the financially troubled graduate school
of the Atlanta University Center, a consortium of Clark, Morehouse
College, Morris Brown College and Spelman College, the Morehouse
School of Medicine and the Interdenominational Theological Center.
   The merger of Clark, an undergraduate school, with the graduate
school alters a nearly 60-year-old agreement among the seven
historically black colleges to jointly finance maintenance,
management and some academic programs.
   The new school will become the largest member of the consortium
in terms of students and budget, with its annual budget placed at
$30 million and 2,000 undergraduates and 1,000 graduate students.
   Clark president Thomas W. Cole Jr., will be chief executive
officer of the new institution.

   These days, this East River enclave is a
magnet for peace marchers, Buddhist monks, Nigerian ``drummers of
passion,'' victims of Hiroshima, poets and blues singers of the
nuclear age.
   All have converged on the Third Special Session on Disarmament,
a monthlong gathering ending this week.
   They have camped on the sidewalks and exploded 1,000 balloons to
symbolize nuclear tests. They have gathered at a corner coffee shop
to discuss radioactive military landfills, the evils of
transnational corporations, and the future of the Siberian crane.
   They range from a 12-year-old California girl who invented a
peace game to Mother Teresa, the 77-year-old Nobel laureate.
   But all the spinning of prayer wheels, scattering of flower
petals, chanting of mantras, and meditation on brotherhood have not
harmonized discordant views on disarmament.
   The 159 U.N. members are trying to devise a realistic agenda for
peace, and delegates hope they'll be able to adopt a final document
by concensus, without divisive voting that usually pits the United
States against most of the developing world and socialist countries.
   The superpower backdrop is positive: the Moscow summit, the
Soviet pullout from Afghanistan, and the treaty on elimination of
intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   But differences over such issues as nuclear and conventional
disarmament and a nuclear test ban treaty are enormous.
   The United States has made clear it will not reaffirm what it
calls a sweeping and unrealistic U.N. disarmament document adopted
10 years ago.
   Last year, the United States voted alone on most disarmament
issues in the General Assembly, ranging from a demand for a
comprehensive nuclear test ban to prohibiting the military uses of
outer space.
   It refused to participate in a conference on the relationship
between disarmament and development.
   Third World nations have been clamoring for a disarmament fund
of military savings in the industrialized world to be diverted
toward economic and social development in poor countries.
   Western diplomats say that the developing world should do its
part by halting its regional wars and curbing its massive spending
on conventional arms _ spending that deprives people of food,
health care and education.
   The American positions have not changed in the current
disarmament session.
   The U.S. administration and Western allies emphasize the
importance of bilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union in
nuclear and other fields and do not want bilateral talks subject to
multilateral pressures.
   ``We are hearing a lot of cant,'' said one Western diplomat.
``The U.S. and the Soviets are doing just fine. What we need is a
realistic approach that will leave nations free to pursue their
bilateral actions without multilateral interference.''
   At this session, the Soviet Union is a major player and is seen,
far more than the United States, as a team player in the world body.
   The Soviet Union has been calling for a larger and more powerful
role for the United Nations in multilateral arms negotiations,
disarmament verification and monitoring, expanded peacekeeping
operations and crisis management. It has called for a new U.N.
naval peacekeeping force and U.N. space agency.
   But the United States, more than $400 million in arrears in U.N.
dues, doesn't want to see expanded U.N. operations infringe on
traditional areas of national prerogative.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, unfurled a
sweeping blueprint of disarmament proposals and in a grand gesture,
invited the U.N. secretary-general, Security Council and nonaligned
leaders to attend the first Soviet destruction of
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   ``The first and perhaps the hardest thing to do,'' Shevardnadze
said, ``is to abandon the myth of nuclear weapons as the guarantor
of peace ... We are convinced that ensuring security by non-nuclear
means is possible.''
   The speech initially was praised by U.S. Ambassador Vernon A.
Walters as constructive and deserving of study. But U.S. officials
have not responded to specific proposals, such as a permanent
moratorium on nuclear testing, slashing conventional armies in
Europe by 500,000 soldiers each, and announcement of port calls by
warships with or without nuclear arms.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz outlined the standard U.S.
positions. He emphasized the dangers of proliferation in nuclear,
conventional, ballistic, chemical and other weapons and cited the
dangers of the Iran-Iraq war and the rivalry between India and
Pakistan.
   He did not mention the Soviet proposals.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe sounded the theme of
nuclear deterrence _ considered anathema to most U.N. delegates.
``It may be that one day we shall find a better way to prevent war
than through nuclear deterrence,'' he told the General Assembly.
``But to suggest that between East and West such an alternative is
within reach is to deny reality.''
   Meanwhile, 12-year-old Michelle Robyn Alexander of Fresno,
Calif., was promoting her game, ``Give Peace a Chance,'' and saying
her dream was to play it with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
She said she still was waiting for a White House response.

   Unaccredited workers botched asbestos removal at
a high school and exposed students to cancer-causing fibers, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency charged Friday in its first
enforcement of new regulations.
   The agency, which proposed a $5,000 fine, said 6,400 square feet
of asbestos-containing floor tiles were improperly removed in
February from a hallway at Thornton Township High School in
suburban Harvey.
   Workers who were not accredited by the EPA ``had sanded, chipped
and cut the tiles, releasing clouds of dust containing asbestos,''
the agency said in a statement.
   The district overseeing the school in southwest suburban Harvey
failed to ``post signs and restrict the affected area to only those
persons necessary to do tile removal and cleanup,'' the EPA said.
   School officials have until July 11 to respond to the complaint.
They can either seek an informal hearing with EPA officials in
Chicago or request a hearing before a federal administrative law
judge, EPA spokeswoman Nancy Sullivan said.
   The school was closed Friday afternoon and officials could not
be reached for comment.
   Ms. Sullivan said school officials did not know the tiles
contained asbestos when the removal began, but suspected they might
and ordered tests.
   The EPA called the complaint its first enforcement action
nationwide under last year's Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response
Act, which specifies procedures for removing asbestos in public and
private elementary and secondary schools.

<TEXT>
   Two years of turmoil has taken a physical
toll of Arizona's lawmakers, who had to deal with the governor's
time-consuming impeachment trial and face raising taxes $200
million just months before re-election bids.
   Their current session set a record Friday as the longest in
state history and they're far from finished with their business.
   ``I don't think there's a member here who's not among the
walking wounded,'' said House Minority Leader Art Hamilton, a
Phoenix Democrat.
   ``I'm just exhausted,'' said Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane,
a Republican from Scottsdale.
   ``It doesn't feel good,'' said House Speaker Joe Lane.
   Friday was the 166th day of the session, but taxes, budgets, and
about 50 other pieces of legislation are still not settled. And the
lawmakers are operating on reduced pay, increased fatigue and, in
some cases, worse health.
   In theory, legislative sessions are supposed to end by the
Saturday of the week in which the 100th day falls.
   But the House impeachment and Senate trial of Gov. Evan Mecham
took weeks out of each chamber's schedule this year. And the trauma
started last year, when Mecham faced off against a largely
inexperienced set of legislative leaders.
   The stage was set in 1986, when then-Gov. Bruce Babbitt decided
to run for president, House Majority Leader Burton Barr decided to
run for governor, Speaker James Sossaman ran for Senate and Senate
President Stan Turley and Minority Leader Alfredo Gutierrez retired.
   Mecham beat Barr in a rough Republican primary election and
clashed repeatedly with the Republican-controlled legislature,
until this year when the Senate ousted him on April 4.
   Now, Mecham loyalists are vowing revenge at the polls and
Democrats are drooling at the prospect of increased numbers in both
chambers.
   Many Republican incumbents simply aren't running for
re-election, and others, such as Lane, face uphill election fights
_ if they find the time to gather signatures on their nominating
petitions before the June 30 deadline.
   Among the casualties:
   _ Hal Runyan, the Senate's majority whip, suffered a stroke
while undergoing an operation and is confined to a wheelchair. He
comes in only for key votes and will not seek re-election.
   _ Greg Lunn, touted as one of the GOP's rising young stars,
aggravated a pre-ulcerous condition and has decided to run for
county supervisor instead of re-election.
   _ Jim Ratliff, the House majority leader, suffered a heart
attack and is retiring.
   _ Sterling Ridge, a Glendale Republican, also is retiring,
citing health reasons.
   Hamilton, in his 16th year as a representative, said it was a
very stressful session. ``It is the cumulative effect of the Mecham
administration and the kind of meanness that was there _ all of
this madness.''
   Hamilton and Senate Democratic leader Alan Stephens say
Republican leaders bear some of the blame for allowing the session
to continue drifting along.
   ``We've been putting things off and putting things off and
putting things off,'' said Stephens, who estimated that 75 bills
were languishing without debate while lawmakers cool their heels.
   ``To paraphrase Winston Churchill, `Never have so many worked
for so long for so little,''' Hamilton said Thursday after Senate
Finance Committee Chairman Jeff Hill staged his second walkout of
the week, spiking a tentative tax agreement.
   Other than Mecham's impeachment, lawmakers faced three major
issues this year: air quality, indigent health care, and a state
budget of about $3 billion.
   An air-quality bill is on the governor's desk, but there's no
agreement on indigent health or budgets.
   Lawmakers draw salaries of $15,000 a year and extended their
regular expense pay for 30 days beyond the normal 120-day limit,
but since then they have been operating on reduced pay of $10 a day
for Phoenix-area lawmakers and $20 a day for those from outside
Maricopa County.
   Some grouchiness is a standard feature at every end-of-session
crunch as lawmakers confront issues they avoided at first. But
between the Mecham trial's unheeled scars and the prospect of
election fights ahead, lawmakers, lobbyists and others say things
seem worse than usual.
   ``It just isn't as much fun,'' said Lunn.
   The previous record, 165 days, was set in 1976.

   Authorities in the Soviet republic of Kazakhstan
have bowed to public pressure and decided to halt two controversial
irrigation projects that would have damaged a vast inland lake,
TASS reported.
   The official news agency said Friday that the projects were
halted because studies showed they would cause the water level of
Lake Balkhash to drop sharply. The lake, located in Central Asia,
covers 320 square miles.
   TASS said the decision was preceded by a campaign of letters and
articles in Kazakhstan's state-run media against the scheme.
   The lake in eastern Kazakhstan helps modify the dry, scorching
climate of the area, home to about 2.5 million people, TASS said.
   Since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985, Soviet
authorities have stopped a number of controversial large-scale
projects that scientists say would have done irreversible damage to
the environment.

   U.S. drug agents and Paraguayan police
captured three alleged drug smugglers and seized 590 pounds of
cocaine shortly before the drugs were supposed to go to Europe, a
newspaper reported.
   In an attempt to break what U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
agents called the ``Asuncion Connection,'' police arrested a
Bolivian and two Colombians last Saturday. The trio allegedly were
couriers for the notorious Medellin drug cartel of Colombia, the
daily independent Hoy reported Friday.
   Hoy said 222 packages of 97 percent pure cocaine, worth about
$100 million, were found jammed in nine suitcases at Asuncion's
airport hours before a regularly scheduled commercial flight to
Madrid, Spain.
   It was the largest drug bust in Paraguay since 1982, when 92
pounds of cocaine were found at a ranch, 217 miles northeast of
Asuncion.
   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents have been working
with Paraguayan police since December when they re-opened an office
in the capital to counter the growing drug trade in this landlocked
South American nation
   Investigators say private aircraft registered in bordering
Bolivia were used to drop the cocaine at a ranch in the remote
Chaco region of western Paraguay. From there, the cocaine was flown
to Asuncion in other small planes, the newspaper said.
   U.S. officials say the Medillin cartel sends to the United
States about 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in America.

   They could have been cremation pits,
cock-fighting rings, animal pens, Civil War foxholes or secret
hiding places for moonshine equipment.
   Maybe they were prehistoric Indian burial sites, charcoal pits
or foundations for native American abodes. Or maybe, some say, the
stone circles dotting the western slope of Polish Mountain
encircled apple trees in the early 1900s.
   For more than a decade, 150 to 200 circles of sandstone rock
have puzzled area residents and archaelogists. Virtually hidden by
brush and poison ivy, the gray-colored rocks of various shapes and
sizes are neatly arranged in circles.
   No one knows their purpose, or who put them there.
   ``Everybody that goes up there has some kind of weird theory,''
said John Mash, manager of Green Ridge State Forest, where the
circles are found. ``One guy even mentioned that they could have
been sweat lodges _ like a Turkish bath.
   ``The Indians would have these rituals when they would go into
manhood,'' he said. ``They would go in these buildings with hot
rocks and put water on them _ something like a sauna.''
   But 150 to 200 saunas on one hillside in western Maryland?
   Mash said rangers noticed the stone rings in the early 1970s. In
1975, Mash contacted State Archaeologist Tyler J. Bastian, who
visited the site and put the circles on a list of archaeological
areas in Maryland.
   But it was not until last year that some archaelogists and
volunteers excavated one of the circles. ``They did the dig and
found zip, except for the rattlesnakes,'' Mash said.
   Hoping to uncover clues, another group conducted a dig this
spring.
   ``In a nutshell, we didn't discover anything. They still remain
a mystery,'' said Charles McVeigh Jr., a member of the Western
Maryland Archaeological Society. ``We dug out in the center of
them. We didn't go down very far before we got to bedrock. We found
no artifacts. We found nothing to indicate prehistoric use.''
   No future digs are planned, and two local archaeologists who
took an interest in the circles, Robert D. Wall and Connie
Huddleston, both have moved from Maryland. Neither could be reached
for comment recently.
   Meanwhile, the state forest has put the circles on its historic
preservation list to ensure the five-acre tract remains untouched,
Mash said. The site could be eligible for the National Register of
Historic Places if additional information could be found to
document the age of the rings, their use and significance.
   Mash has dismissed the moonshine theory because there is no
nearby water source needed to make moonshine. He said he did not
think they were cock-fighting rings because only one pit is needed
to hold a fight. And the rings are too close together to have been
foxholes during the Civil War, he said.
   ``The site has no strategic value,'' Mash said. ``(And) the guy
in the middle foxhole is going to be shooting his own pals before
he can get his bullet out to hit the bad guys.''
   Until someone conjures up a more believable theory, Mash said he
puts the most stock in the orchard theory _ that someone placed the
stones around apple trees that once grew in the area. There were 1
million apple trees in Green Ridge by 1914, he said.
   ``It is possible that they hired immigrants who could not
understand directions given in English and some of them were told
to clear the rocks away to plant the apple trees,'' he suggested.
   ``They were new in America and wanted to do a nice, neat job, so
they put these rocks in nice neat little circles and left a space
in the middle for the tree. And they might have worked on these for
a couple of days, or a week until somebody stopped them. That could
be a theory ...''

   A report said Friday that rainfall over the past 20 days in the

   The rivers Pripyat and Stokhod have burst their banks, flooding
573,040 acres planted with crops and more than 296,400 acres of

   Roads, bridges, dykes and buildings have also been damaged, it

   There were no reports of any casualties.

   Two Cambodian immigrants were jailed
after police discovered a partially skinned puppy with its throat
slit lying in a pool of blood on the men's kitchen floor, officials

   Neighbors who heard the puppy's whining as it was allegedly
being beaten to death called officers Thursday night to an
apartment in a predominantly Cambodian neighborhood, said police
Sgt. David Bauer.
   Caea Sokheng and Ou Seng K, both 32, were arrested and booked

   ``Well, our guys found the dead dog in the kitchen so you can

   Investigators estimated the dead puppy was 4 months old. Another
puppy of similar age was rescued unharmed from the apartment, Bauer
said.
   Both men denied ownership of the dead dog, he said.

   Pop singer George Michael will undergo
surgery next week to remove a cyst from his vocal cords, forcing
him to cancel the rest of his scheduled performances in Europe, a
spokesman says.
   The operation will be performed Wednesday at an undisclosed
London hospital, publicist Phil Lobel said Friday.
   ``It will be four weeks before Michael can sing again,'' Lobel
said.
   Exploratory surgery this week found the cyst, he said.
   ``While I am very sad that I will have to disappoint my fans,''
Michael, 25, said in a statement, ``I am at least relieved that at
long last the real reason for my problems has been discovered.''
   Throat problems forced Michael to drop 20 shows in Australia at
the beginning of his tour in March, and he had feared he would lose
his voice.
   The remainder of Michael's European tour was cancelled, but the
North American leg of his world ``Faith Tour'' will proceed as
planned beginning Aug. 6 at the Capitol Center in Washington, D.C.

   President Reagan reminisced about his acting
days in a telegram to this central Missouri town, saying a scene in
the movie ``Kings Row'' was the finest he ever did.
   The 1941 movie was based on a book of the same name about
growing up in Fulton, which is holding its Kingdom Days celebration
this weekend.
   In the scene, Reagan, waking up after a leg has been amputated,
screams, ``Where's the rest of me?''
   ``We did this scene without rehearsal and you know or will soon
see the results,'' he said in the telegram Friday. ``I don't
believe I ever did quite as well again in a single shot.''
   The movie is to be screened during Kingdom Days, held to
celebrate the Civil War heritage of Callaway County. Robert
Cummings, who starred with Reagan in the movie, is scheduled to
appear and clothes worn in the movie will be displayed.

   To raise additional funds, $2 postcards are being sold through a

   High atop the Chicago Board of Trade building a
statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess of grain, stared unflinchingly
into the searing, cloudless sky. If anybody was praying to her for
rain, she hadn't heard them.
   Besides, the whispered plea of an Iowa corn farmer wouldn't
stand a chance against the din from the floor of the world's oldest
and largest grain exchange, where bushels of grain are traded in
millions and blessings are counted in dollars.
   The Board of Trade's grain floor, abandoned by many traders when
prices and trading activity slumped in the mid-1980s, is filled
these days with people looking to profit from the Midwestern
drought.
   As the drought withers crops across the Farm Belt, it ignites
big rallies on commodity exchanges, where contracts for future
delivery of grain grow more precious by the day.
   ``This is the only place I could think of where I can make a lot
of money in a fairly short period of time,'' said Brad Whitacre,
21, an entry-level employee of a large investment firm who dreams
of owning his own seat on the exchange.
   Whitacre's job is to stand just outside the apparent chaos of
the jam-packed corn futures pit and report to his boss on the moves
of the market's major players. He has put his college education on
hold for this opportunity, which was created by the dramatic rise
in trading activity accompanying the drought-driven jump in prices.
   ``If you start out working at a corporation it takes years to
work your way up to the top,'' Whitacre said. ``But you come down
here, after a couple of years you buy a seat, and you can be making
a lot of money.''
   How much? ``Your imagination's the only limit.''
   Whitacre isn't the only one lured to the Board of Trade by one
of the biggest grain rallies in the exchange's 140-year history.
The population of the grain trading floor has swelled more than 40
percent to nearly 2,000 in just the past two months, according to
exchange figures.
   About half of those people are traders. Their job is to face
each other on the steps of circular pits and use a combination of
hand signals and shouted bids to strike deals for deliveries of
grain and soybeans in 5,000-bushel lots.
   Big trading companies such as Refco Inc. and C&D Commodities
frequently trade thousands of contracts, totaling millions of
bushels, during a session.
   Perhaps a third of the traders are independents, called
``locals'' or ``scalpers,'' who trade for their own accounts and
drift from pit to pit in search of action. When grain trading
slowed after the volatile, dry-weather period of late 1983 and
early 1984, many locals moved to the exchange's financial-futures
room to bet on the performance of stocks and bonds.
   Because of its boisterous nature, trading in the pits is usually
perceived as a young person's game. But among the recent returnees
to the grain room are a good number of silver-haired veterans, some
of whom say their experience gives them an edge.
   ``I can tell what's going on standing here with a blindfold
on,'' said 74-year-old Paul McGuire, a former Board of Trade
chairman, as he surveyed the scene from the sidelines while waiting
for the right moment to strike.
   ``I can tell whether the markets are going up or down by the
sound.''
   Although this is the fifth significant dry-weather boom the
grain markets have seen since the record-setting rally of 1973, the
timing and severity of this drought makes it unique, traders said.
   ``Nobody here has ever really traded (on) the fear of a real
potential disaster,'' said one trader who asked not to be
identified. ``That's what makes this market different from any
other time in history.''
   Independent traders resent the perception that they seek to
profit from the nation's misfortune, a view that inspired a recent
Chicago Tribune editorial cartoon depicting commodity traders as
vultures descending on a drought-stricken farmer.
   ``When the traders start to make a little money, some people
begrudge it to us but they don't realize we've had a severely
depressed business here the last four years,'' said Bernard Dorman,
an independent grain trader who also runs a small trading company.
   ``We feel very badly that the farmers are hurt but we can't do
anything about that,'' Dorman said. ``We just follow the market, we
don't make the market.''

<HEAD>Ambulance Association Asks Probe of Ford Recall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ambulance operators say Ford Motor Co. may
have done an inadequate job of repairing up to 14,500 fire-prone
ambulances, and they are calling for an investigation by federal
transportation officials.
   Ford counters that its recall work on the ambulances has been
more than adequate and that some ambulance operators have been slow
to bring in the vehicles for repairs.
   The American Ambulance Association, a Washington-based
organization representing private ambulance operators, said Friday
in a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
that it had received reports of long delays, unavailable parts,
shoddy work and added bills for fixing the ambulances.
   ``It would appear that a significant number of ambulances are
still not fully retrofitted,'' the association wrote.
   Ford recalled about 14,500 of the vehicles, converted to
ambulances by other companies from the 1983-1987 Ford Econoline
E-350 models, after reports of fuel-system problems that caused
fires.
   The recall came in two phases, one in July 1987 for rerouting of
the fuel line and a second in August 1987 for installation of
further safety precautions.
   More than 20 fires were reported and were blamed on
overpressurization of fuel tanks and lines caused by muffler heat.
   ``We feel (the recall) is certainly more than adequate,'' said
Mike Parris, a Ford spokesman in Dearborn, Mich. ``We're concerned
with it. We don't take it lightly at all. We don't drag our feet.
... We've made every effort to try to get these people in here to
get this recall taken care of.''
   He said some 700 Ford dealers had parts available for the recall
work. ``If these people will bring these vehicles in, they can have
it done,'' Parris said.
   Eighty percent of the recalled ambulances were brought in for
the first phase of work, but only 65 percent have undergone the
second phase, Parris said.
   NHTSA has 120 days to respond to the ambulance association's
petition.

<HEAD>Church Charges Army Prevented Delivery Of Supplies To Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives from eight
California churches say El Salvador's army stopped them from
delivering food, medicine and fertilizer to resettled refugees in
northern El Salvador.
   Eight representatives of Bay Area churches and synagogues told a
news conference Friday that the 4th Army Brigade blocked their
three-truck convoy on June 16.
   The convoy, which was carrying about $7,000 worth of supplies,
was stopped in Chalatenango, the capital of the northern province
of the same name.
   The supplies, which were bound for the towns of Guarjila and Los
Ranchos, were left in a convent in the town while efforts to
deliver them continued, the church workers said.
   Leftist guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed government of
President Jose Napoleon Duarte maintain a strong military and
political presence in much of Chalatenango province.
   Dean McFalls, a member of the church group and a student at the
Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, Calif., said the delegation
had obtained permission to deliver the supplies from military
officials in San Salvador before leaving for the region.
   Los Ranchos and Guarjila were evacuated in the early 1980s
because of heavy fighting in the civil war. The towns were
resettled last fall under the auspices of the non-governmental
National Committee for Repopulation. They now have a combined
population of about 1,800.
   Over the past year the armed forces have allowed some relief
shipments to reach their destinations but have held up others.
Military authorities have expressed concern the supplies might end
up in rebel hands.
   People who answered the phone at 4th Brigade headquarters and
the army's public relations office said no one was immediately
available for comment on the blocked convoy.

<HEAD>Pentagon Relaxes Some Spending Limits After Cost-Cutting Freeze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon plans to resume offering
contracts for research and consulting work next month but other
restrictions on military spending will remain in effect in order to
hold down costs.
   Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV on Friday announced
plans to relax a freeze on outside contracting for supplies and
services starting July 1. The freeze had been imposed in May to
limit spending in fiscal 1988, which ends on Sept. 30.
   Taft said Friday he would begin allowing some new contracts to
be awarded for research, development and evaluation work and for
consultant services on July 1.
   But all other restrictions remain in effect, including a ban on
purchases of office supplies, an end to overtime pay and limits on
civilian hiring, Taft said.
   Active-duty personnel and civilian employees also can forget
collecting their Oct. 1 paychecks a day early just because Oct. 1
falls on a Saturday, Taft declared. The Pentagon doesn't want any
extra outlays before the current fiscal year ends, he wrote in a
memo to Pentagon offices.
   The Pentagon's No. 2 executive said he still wanted some
controls on the research and consultant contracts, however,
specifying that ``total obligations during any month of the fourth
quarter may not exceed 75 percent of the average monthly
obligations incurred to date.''
   The ban on new purchases of office supplies and other equipment
will continue to cover everything from magazine and newspaper
subscriptions to TV sets, library materials, recreation equipment,
lawnmowers and furniture, tools, paint, lumber, air conditioners
and fork lifts, he said.
   Also still prohibited is any spending on new leases for cars,
office space or computer equipment.
   The spending restrictions originally were promulgated by Taft to
comply with a deficit-reduction compromise reached last November by
Congress and the Reagan administration. That compromise was crafted
to control government outlays _ the amount of money actually paid
out during the fiscal year.

<HEAD>Dangerous Biological Agents To Be Banned From Mail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service is proposing new rules
to ban germs and dangerous toxins from the mail just as the
military reportedly was planning to increase shipments of such
materials.
   The regulations were announced Friday, but must go through a
formal rule-making process before they take effect.
   The Postal Service said it took the action because of concern
``that some customers are planning increased use of the mails for
sending disease germs or hazardous toxins (etiologic agents).''
   Jeremy Rifkin, an activist who heads the Foundation on Economic
Trends in Washington, hailed the decision as a step toward avoiding
a potential catastrophe. He had petitioned the Postal Service to
ban such shipments.
   Rifkin said he plans to push the Transportation Department to
investigate shipments of dangerous products by private carriers.
   Various products, including biological warfare toxins, have been
mailed in the past under strict packaging and labeling rules, and
postal officials say no problems have occurred.
   But following reports that the Army planed to expand research
facilities in Utah, California Attorney General John Van de Kamp
complained that the need for increased shipments of dangerous
biological products could create a hazard.
   Army officials have told a House subcommittee that they actually
ship very few parcels containing biological items, and those almost
always by private, commercial carrier.
   The packages have been tested and are literally able to survive
an aircraft or highway crash, said Thomas R. Dashiell, director of
environmental and life sciences at the Defense Department.
   While attention has focused on shipments of germs and toxins by
the military, the federal Centers for Disease Control and other
medical establishments also make such shipments, officials report.
   ``Our experience to date seems to support the opinion, expressed
by medical experts, that there is little risk associated with
handling properly packaged etiologic agents,'' Postmaster General
Anthony Frank said in a letter to Rifkin.
   The planned new rules would cover dangerous items, but would not
affect the mailing of blood samples and other such materials being
sent to laboratories for routine medical testing, the Postal
Service said.
   Postal regulations already prohibit the mailing of a variety of
items, including strike-anywhere matches, explosives, fuses, many
poisons, most flammable liquids and certain chemicals.

   Here are some of the latest comments from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, commenting on the so-called gender gap _ the
indication in polls that women voters support Dukakis by a far
highter percentage than do men: ``I am confident we can overcome
this gender gap. I want to be sure I'm as sensitive as possible to
the concerns of these activist women in our party. I think we've
got a good message for women.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, after divulging that New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley has apparently taken himself out of the running for the
vice presidential nomination: ``In any event, we're going to keep
in touch.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, dismissing a published report saying he told
aides he would not accept the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket:
`` Whoever was talking was not authorized, but also was not dealing
in the truth. The matter of the vice presidency is a serious
matter.''
   
   FRANK J. FAHRENKOPF Jr., Republican party chairman, saying the
presence of Ohio Sen. John Glenn on the Democratic ticket would
make the GOP's job harder in November: ``He is a national hero.
People take a lot of pride in that and it can transcend party
affiliations.''

<HEAD>Showdown Vote Nears On Requirement For Notice Of Plant Closings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is headed for a showdown vote next
week on a proposal that would require companies to give their
workers advance notice of major layoffs or plant closings.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said a GOP amendment
would be proposed Monday to either eliminate the 60-day notice
requirement for layoffs or shorten it.
   Democrats in the Senate on Friday overwhelmingly defeated a pair
of Republican amendments to the legislation.
   Defeated on respective votes of 60-27 and 59-31 were amendments
to make picket line violence during a labor dispute a federal crime
and to exempt from the notice requirements employers who give
laid-off workers 60 days of severance pay.
   After stalling action on the legislation for three days,
Republican leaders agreed Friday to allow a vote late Monday on
their main attempt to derail the notice requirements.
   The notice provision has come before the Senate after being
separated from a trade bill that President Reagan vetoed last month
because it contained that requirement.
   Dole said a GOP amendment would be offered on Monday by Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan. Mrs. Kassebaum has said she supports 60
days' notice in cases of plant closings but not when an employer is
just laying off 50 or more workers, as the Democratic-sponsored
bill requires.
   Democratic leaders have threatened to kill to any chance of
winning enactment of either the advance notice requirement or the
trade bill if Mrs. Kassebaum's amendment is approved.
   ``This is a killer amendment,'' said Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va. ``Not only does it kill this bill but it will kill
the trade bill. I've maintained all along that the president
doesn't want a trade bill.''
   Democrats still hope to send the plant closing measure to the
White House by July 4 for an expected veto by Reagan.
   Byrd said Friday he anticipates final passage of the plant
closings bill by the Senate on Tuesday. House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, has vowed to seek its passage in the House immediately
after the Senate's approval.

<HEAD>Study Finds US Sanctions Cut Exports To South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government study of U.S. sanctions against
South Africa says that nation in the past two years has suffered a
$624 million reduction in exports of sanctioned goods to the United
States and other trading partners.
   The General Accounting Office report, presented Friday to the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said exports to the United
States had been cut by about $417 million and that the remainder of
the reduction was in South Africa's exports of sanctioned goods to
19 other countries.
   ``Only in the agricultural products market was South Africa able
to offset losses from U.S. sanctions and to actually increase its
total exports,'' said Allan I. Mendelowitz, an associate director
of the GAO's international division.
   Mendelowitz said that since the enactment of the sanctions over
President Reagan's veto in 1986, South Africa experienced sharp
losses in exports of coal, iron and steel, uranium and textiles.
   ``I think the bottom line, in shorthand, is that sanctions are
working in terms of economic impact,'' said Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., a member of the Senate panel. ``What we cannot know is
whether this will result in a policy change by South Africa.''
   The testimony came as the committee concluded three days of
public hearings on legislation to tighten sanctions against South
Africa by requiring a near-total trade embargo and by requiring all
U.S. companies to withdraw from the country.
   Mendelowitz said that since 1984, 162 U.S. companies have
withdrawn from South Africa and that nine of the 150 companies
remaining have announced their intention to leave.
   Opponents of the new sanctions have raised the possibility South
Africa might retaliate by cutting off exports to the United States
of a list of strategic minerals of vital importance to U.S.
industry.
   Mendelowitz noted the U.S. Bureau of Mines recently reported
there are sufficient alternative sources of supply for manganese,
chromium, palladium, titanium and vanadium but not for platinum and
rhodium.
   The mines bureau also said that cobalt supplies would remain
available from Zaire if new routes for shipping it were developed
to bypass South African railways and ports.

   ``For the Love of Louis,'' the concert of Louis
Armstrong's music that kicked off the JVC Jazz Festival at Carnegie
Hall, provided an evening of full of high notes.
   One such high note came from Lionel Hampton and Wynton Marsalis
as they played in duet on vibraphone and trumpet. Dizzy Gillespie
gave us others as he softly improvised on ``I'm Confessin' That I
Love You'' and then sang it, sounding a lot like Louis.
   Clark Terry recalled that Armstrong once advised him: ``You got
to do more singing. People like singing. And you save your
(trumpet-playing) chops.''
   Terry played ``You Rascal You,'' which Sam Theard composed for
Armstrong. Then Terry sang it, imitating Armstrong.
   Dick Hyman organized the Friday night program, conducted and
played piano.
   Master of ceremonies Phil Schaap called Armstrong ``the most
important musician of the 20th century.'' He gave particulars about
Armstrong's recordings, which were then played live on stage.
   The concert's first half represented the Hot Five, Hot Seven and
other small groups that Armstrong made music with in the 1920s and
'30s. Carrie Smith sang some of the songs Armstrong and Bessie
Smith recorded. Trumpeter Ruby Braff played a medley.
   Three members of Armstrong's last band, clarinetist Joe Muranyi,
bassist Arvell Shaw and pianist Marty Napoleon, joined Miss Smith,
trumpeter Jimmy Maxwell and trombonist George Masso for ``Basin
Street.''
   Five trumpeters in the big band after intermission were
impressive. Warren Vache soloed on ``Sunny Side of the Street,''
Jimmy Owens on ``When Your Lover Has Gone'' and Jon Faddis on
``When You're Smiling.''
   A film showed Armstrong telling how he composed ``Someday You'll
Be Sorry'' on a cold night in North Dakota. Randy Sandke soloed on
that. Maxwell soloed as Miss Smith sang ``Mack the Knife.''
   Gillespie, Clark, Marsalis and Hampton returned for ``Ding Dong
Daddy from Dumas.'' Hampton started a nostalgically played encore
of the ``Memories of You,'' the first recording he ever played on,
which was a Louis Armstrong date.
   The evening was a benefit for Queens College, which administers
the house in Queens where Louis Armstrong lived the 30 years before
he died July 6, 1971, and which was willed to New York City. Queens
College intends to turn it into a museum. The college hoped to
raise $80,000 from the evening, which also would benefit its
Armstrong archives project and music scholarships.
   A block of benefit tickets sold for $100 or $250, which included
a dinner afterwards. Festival impresario George Wein announced that
Ruby Braff, Dizzy Gillespie, Lionel Hampton, Wynton Marsalis and
Clark Terry donated their appearances and other musicians rehearsed
for three days for scale.

   A security guard opened fire in the lunch
room of a water treatment company on Friday, wounding six people,
authorities reported.
   Details were sketchy, although preliminary reports suggested the
security guard was known to workers at the Micropure Co. warehouse,
where the shooting took place.
   A suspect was arrested for investigation of attempted murder
about three hours later, according to Oakland Police Sgt. Bob
Crawford. His name was not released.
   ``He just drove up in the Cadillac and got out (went in the
building) and started firing,'' said an employee who answered the
phone at Micropure. He declined to give his name.
   There were no reported fatalities, but five of the victims were
in serious condition.
   All of the victims were in the break room in the company's
warehouse when they were shot, said the employee, who did not
witness the shooting.
   Three shooting victims were taken to John Muir Medical Center in
this community about 25 miles east of San Francisco, according to
hospital spokeswoman Sandra Ryan. Three other victims were treated
at Mount Diablo Hospital, said nursing supervisor Alison Karim.
   Micropure is a distributor of water treatment equipment for
household use.

<HEAD>U.S. Forecasts Major Magnetic Storm In Wake Of Huge Solar Flares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major magnetic storm is expected to envelop
the Earth on Monday as particles spewed by giant explosions on the
sun disrupt global communications, alter satellite orbits and
impair electric power systems.
   The warning issued Friday by the federal Space Environment
Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., was spurred by a series of solar
flares _ huge sunspot-related explosions that hurl X-ray,
electrically charged particles and hot gases toward Earth.
   One of the blasts was the largest flare since April 1984, said
Dale Gary, a solar astronomer at the California Institute Of
Technology in Pasadena.
   The laboratory issued a major magnetic storm warning for Monday
and a minor magnetic storm warning for Tuesday, forecaster Chris
Balch said by telephone from the lab.
   The flares pose no direct threat to Earth life. But the magnetic
storm could interfere with long-distance phone calls, electric
power transmission, radio broadcasts, pipeline control systems and
communications with airplanes and ships, said Gary Heckman, space
environment services chief at the lab.
   The storm was also expected to push Earth's auroras away from
the poles, making the northern lights visible as far south as the
Great Lakes, Boston and England, Heckman said.
   Proton radiation associated with the solar flare was expected to
approach Earth today, he said. Heckman added that it should be mild
and pose no radidation hazard to two Soviet cosmonauts orbiting
Earth, especially if they stay inside their Mir space station.
   The magnetic storm also will cause ``errors in the orbits of
some satellites'' because of increased drag as well as particles
hitting electronic parts, Heckman said. ``It will slow them down in
orbit. Some people will have trouble operating their satellites.''
   It also could induce stray voltages in power transmission
systems, causing temporary outages and making lights flicker, he
said.
   The last significant magnetic storm occurred in August 1972 and
disrupted communications worldwide for two days, although the one
expected Monday shouldn't be that large, Heckman said.
   The warning was sent to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the Defense Department, the Federal Aviation
Administration and other agencies whose satellites or
communications could be disrupted. The Space Environment Laboratory
is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   X-rays from the biggest flare probably disrupted communications
briefly Friday, although there were no immediate reports, Heckman
said.
   Friday's big flare started at 9:44 a.m. PDT and lasted nearly
two hours, Blach said. Another, somewhat smaller one began at 9:01
a.m. and lasted 41 minutes. A much smaller flare lasting 47 minutes
exploded at 2:20 p.m., forecaster Norman Cohen said.
   Two other flares were observed Thursday, Gary said.
   ``We're expecting high levels of (sunspot and flare) activity
for the next three days,'' Cohen said from Boulder.
   The sunspots and flares occurred on the west edge of the sun,
and their influence on Earth will diminish as they migrate toward a
part of the sun not facing the planet, he added.
   Magnetic storms occur about six times every 11-year sunspot
cycle, while flares erupt three or four times annually during the
active phase of the sunspot cycle, Cohen said.
   Solar flares occur when ``the magnetic configuration of sunspots
gets complicated and twisted, then they release stored energy,''
Gary said.
   Magnetic storms disrupt communications by altering the shape of
Earth's ionosphere, a layer of electrically charged particles 100
to 500 miles above the planet's surface, Heckman said.
   The visible portion of Friday's big flare was observed from
Caltech's solar observatory near Big Bear, Calif., Gary said. It
extended perhaps 200,000 miles above the sun's surface, and came
from a group of about 20 sunspots, some up to three times larger
than Earth, he said.

<HEAD>Gasoline Tank Farm Closed After Blasts And Fire, Two More Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUADALUPE, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials closed a major gasoline
supply depot as two more victims of the explosions and fire there
died, lifting the official number of dead to four.
   One company however said 13 of its workers were missing, and a
newspaper accused authorities of hiding deaths.
   A press release from Pemex, the government oil monopoly, also
said 18 people were injured, four of them seriously.
   The disaster began Thursday afternoon when three huge tanks
filled with gasoline exploded one after another. The blasts and
resulting fire with temperatures up to 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit
forced about 10,000 residents of this northern industrial city to
flee.
   Many evacuees headed home Friday, though officials said a small
fire still burned at one tank.
   It was the second explosion and fire in a month at a depot
operated by Pemex. On May 24, more than 100,000 people were forced
from the area around a gas and kerosene supply depot in the
northern city of Chihuahua. No one was hurt, but Pemex shut down
that tank farm permanently.
   The Monterrey company Constructora Quiroga y Villarreal, which
maintains Pemex fire-prevention equipment, gave the Monterrey
newspaper El Norte the names of 54 of its workers who it said were
at the plant when the tanks exploded. It said 13 of those people
had yet to be found.
   Maria Estella Garcia, a company secretary, said that some of the
missing ``possibly died, because we've been told that there are
people that they haven't been able to identify because they are so
badly burned.''
   She said she did not know if that information came from Pemex or
state health officials.
   One of the dead, Vicente Quiroga Garcia, was owner-manager of
the company, she said. She added that his son, company manager
Vicente Quiroga Villarreal, was hospitalized with severe burns.
   ``They're Hiding Deaths,'' read a banner headline in the daily
newspaper El Sol. The story said an El Sol reporter sneaked into
the Monterrey Green Cross morgue wearing a Green Cross jacket and
saw seven badly burned bodies.
   Efforts to reach Pemex spokesmen, in both office visits and by
telephone, were unsuccessful. Secretaries said they did not know
when officials could be reached.
   Many residents were ignoring police barricades and returning
home early Friday, when it appeared the last flames had been
extinguished. However, they fled in panic again when a fire
reignited in one tank.
   Reporters outside the depot gates watched about 20 firefighters
man equipment 10 yards from the burning tank as thick swirls of
fire and smoke poured out.
   A few minutes later, the tank collapsed, but the flames
continued licking another charred tank next to it. Firefighters had
already managed to empty the second tank.
   About 150 feet away, modest homes and businesses line the avenue
in this city on the eastern outskirts of the Nuevo Leon state
capital of Monterrey, which has a metropolitan population of about
2.8 million.
   Raul Robles, assistant commercial director of Pemex, blamed the
explosions and fire on a leak in one of the tanks. The tanks that
blew up each contained 2.2 million gallons of gasoline.
   The tank farm was closed Friday by both company and government
officials.
   Raul de la Garza, the Nuevo Leon state press secretary, said the
depot will remain closed at least until safety experts look it over
and complete an investigation.
   The depot, one of two petroleum supply facilities in the area,
contains 23 tanks that provide regular and unleaded gasoline and
diesel fuel to gasoline stations and other users in the state.
However, closure of the Guadalupe plant was not expected to have a
major impact, because gasoline can be supplied from a huge refinery
at Cadereyta, about 30 miles away.
   Garza said residents were being allowed to return to their homes
late Friday although ``minuscule amounts'' of gasoline was still
burning in one storage tank.
   Thick clouds of black smoke poured across the Monterrey
metropolitan area Friday evening.
   Many of the nearly 500 evacuees who packed one emergency shelter
said Friday night they were fearful of going back.
   ``I'm too frightened to return now,'' said Sofia Villegas, a
41-year-old mother. ``We were so happy to be going home this
morning, and then it happened all over again.''
   ``I'm staying the night (here),'' she added.
   Meanwhile, Guadalupe Mayor Adan Lopez said in an interview at
one shelter that he would ask the state government to relocate the
huge tank farm.
   Asked if he considered the depot a risk to the public safety,
Lopez said, ``It never stops being one.''

   A memorial will be built to honor thousands of
victims who perished in the Nazi destruction of Lvov's Jewish
ghetto and in a nearby concentration camp, Tass said.
   The official news agency announced Friday plans for the memorial
in a report on the end of ceremonies marking the 45th anniversary
of the ghetto's destruction by the Nazis and Ukrainian nationalists.
   Lvov is a city in the Ukraine.
   Zigmund Lainer, a survivor from the Lvov ghetto, was quoted as
saying that the Nazis burned bodies and crushed the skeletons of
those who perished at the nearby Yanovsky concentration camp to
hide their crimes.
   ``Very few people survived that inferno,'' Lainer was quoted as
saying. ``But the memory and the truth about the Lvov ghetto still
exist.''
   Tass said city authorities have discussed creating a school and
a synagogue to preserve the Jewish culture that once flourished in
the city.

<HEAD>Two Egyptians, Rocket Specialist Accused In Illegal Export Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HOWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A noted rocket specialist, two
Egyptian army officers and two others have been charged with
illegally exporting U.S. technology used in sophisticated weapons
like the Stealth bomber and missile nose cones.
   All were charged Friday with illegal export and money
laundering, and conspiring to ship hundreds of pounds of a
substance called carbon-carbon, or carbon composite, to Europe and
Egypt.
   Rocket specialist Abdelkader Helmy, described by U.S. Attorney
David Levi as the director of the American end of the alleged
international export ring, was jailed Friday in Sacramento County
Jail. A detention hearing was scheduled Monday in federal court.
   The special carbon material, developed in the United States, is
used extensively in high-speed aircraft, missiles and rockets
because it has a low visibility level to radar and is heat
resistant.
   The carbon is on the federal restricted list, and requires
special licenses to be exported.
   Two of those named in the complaint filed by the U.S. attorney's
office were in custody Friday, and a third was at large but
expected to surrender voluntarily. The remaining two, both Egyptian
army colonels with diplomatic immunity, were free _ one in Austria
and the other in the United States.
   ``This is conspiracy with deep roots in the Sacramento area,''
Levi said in announcing the government's 35-page complaint.
   Helmy, an Egyptian with American citizenship, received $1
million in payments from apparent Egyptian sources through a
Swiss-based bank for his role in the scheme, U.S. authorities said.
   Carbon-carbon ``is an American technology that shouldn't be
given to foreign nations,'' said Dan Brown, a spokesman for Aerojet
Solid Propulsion Co., which employed Helmy.
   The Egyptians apparently intended to use the material in a
program with Argentina to develop a surface-to-surface missile,
Reagan administration officials told The New York Times.
   Levi said Aerojet cooperated with federal agents who conducted
the investigation. The probe is still under way, Levi added.
   Hundreds of pounds of the carbon composite were believed to have
been shipped to a Washington, D.C., building owned by the Egyptian
government, as an apparent stopover for eventual transfer to Egypt,
investigators said.
   About 430 pounds of the material was seized at the
Baltimore-Washington International Airport Friday as the defendants
allegedly attempted to take it out of the country on an Egyptian
C-130 military air transport.
   The alleged operation apparently began last year, headed overall
by an Egyptian colonel based in Vienna, Austria.
   Under arrest were Helmy of El Dorado Hills, Calif., a research
engineer at Aerojet; and James Huffman of Lexington, Ohio, the
Midwest marketing representative of Teledyne, McCormick, Selph, a
defense aerospace company based in Hollister, Calif. Helmy's wife,
Albia Eltayeb Helmy, was also named in the complaint and was
scheduled to surrender voluntarily.
   The two Egyptian army colonels are Mohamed Abdella Mohamed of
Baltimore and Hussam Yossef of Salzburg, Austria. Mohamed, who was
detained, claimed diplomatic immunity and was immediately released.
Justice Department spokesman John Russell said Yossef wasn't in
custody, but Levi said officials sought to interview him in Austria.
   The complaint alleged that Helmy, using his technical knowledge,
directed Huffman to buy various chemicals and supplies and ship
them to Baltimore, where Mohammed made plans to ship them without
complying with U.S. export controls.
   Brown said Helmy apparently used ``his position in our plant''
to receive sensitive materials. A woman answering the phone at his
home about 110 miles northeast of San Francisco refused to talk to
a reporter. ``I have no comment on this at all,'' she said.
   Mohammed Wahby, press attache at the Egyptian Embassy, said
officials here were awaiting additional details from the Justice
Department before they would comment on the charges.
   Egypt, the second-biggest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel,
gets $1.3 billion in military assistance annually and $815 million
in economic support funds.

<HEAD>Jackson Starts Gaining Delegates In Puerto Rico</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, who defeated Michael
Dukakis in a ``beauty contest'' presidential ballot in March, says
he is finally starting to gain some of Puerto Rico's delegates to
the Democratic National Convention next month.
   Although Jackson had won the March 20 primary, the voting was
only advisory. In April, Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon said he and at
least 53 others in the Puerto Rico delegation would support Dukakis
at the national convention in Atlanta.
   After meeting Friday night with the governor and legislative
leaders, Jackson said he has picked up at least eight of Puerto
Rico's 57 delegates to the Democratic convention since arriving
here Thursday night, and his campaign said he wants at least 17.
   ``What is at stake here is more than the nomination. It's the
future of our country, the future of relations. When we get to
Atlanta, he may very well have more delegates, but I will have more
supporters,'' Jackson told reporters.
   The 3.2 million Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens who are largely
self-governing but subject to federal laws. They have delegations
at the presidential nominating conventions. But Puerto Rican
residents do not vote in national elections and their
representative in Congress has no vote.
   Jackson said he supports Puerto Rican self-determination. Puerto
Ricans, he said, should ``choose their own form of government with
no interference and without intimidation.''
   He has indicated he supports a transfer of powers from the
United States before a Puerto Rican vote on political status. The
governing party supports commonwealth status, established in 1952,
but wants greater local power.
   Some believe ending legal ties to the United States before
voting on status would virtually rule out statehood. Republican
presidential nominee-to-be George Bush supports statehood for
Puerto Rico.

   The Joseph Kirschner Co. of Augusta, Maine is
voluntarily recalling about 4,500 pounds of its honey loaf because
it could possibly cause trichinosis, according to the Agriculture
Department.
   The Kirschner Honey Loaf contains underprocessed pork that could
cause trichinosis if eaten, the USDA said Friday.
   ``Although no illnesses have been reported, anyone who has this
product should return it immediately to the store where it was
purchased,'' said Lester Crawford, administrator of the
department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
   The product, sold in 5- and 12-ounce cold cut retail packages
and 6- to 7-pound delicatessen packages, was distributed in Maine,
Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
   The packages are identified with a sell-by date of
``7-25-B-8-1C''and ``EST. 2701'' printed inside the USDA inspection
seal on the label.
   The delicatessen packages are stamped with a code number of 368
and either a number 22 or 23 indicating the week of the year in
which they were produced.
   Consumers who have questions about the recall can call the

<TEXT>
   Haiti's ousted President Leslie Manigat planned to
spend the weekend with friends in Miami before flying to Europe
Sunday in search of the support he failed to find in the Haitian
expatriate community here.
   Manigat, who arrived here Friday with his wife Myrlande and
teen-age daughter Beatrice, said he had not decided where to settle
or what to do in the immediate future.
   Exiled to the Dominican Republic last Sunday when he was
overthrown by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, Manigat appealed to Americans
for support in freeing Haiti from the military dictatorship.
   ``Give us your support against the military coup,'' Manigat
pleaded at Miami International Airport. ``Give us your support for
the reestablishment of democracy in Haiti.''
   He said he shared the basic U.S. democratic values and was
overthrown for trying to ``put forward the fundamental principle of
civilian power over the military.'' He also said some in the
military were angered by his fight against corruption and smuggling.
   But local leaders in South Florida's Haitian community, thought
to number up to 100,000, said they would ignore Manigat's visit,
calling him a discarded military puppet installed through a rigged
election.
   ``We could care less about Manigat,'' said Roger Biamby,
president of the Haitian-American Community Association of Dade
County.
   Only about 25 Haitians _ many of them worried family members of
Manigat advisers imprisoned in Haiti after the coup _ showed up at
the airport to greet him.
   Asked why U.S. Haitians did not support him, Manigat noted that
many of Jesus Christ's followers had not supported him at the time
of the crucifiction, but cautioned he was not comparing himself to
Jesus.
   Manigat called on the U.S. to pressure Namphy's government to
release his advisers, whom he said were still being arrested on a
daily basis.
   He ignored shouted questions about his relationship with Col.
Jean-Claude Paul, under indictment here for drug trafficking.
Manigat's decision to side with Paul against Namphy triggered the
coup which once again put Namphy in control of the country, the
poorest in the Western Hemisphere.
   The ousted leader plans to fly Sunday to Rome, where he will
attend a meeting of Christian Democratic party leaders.

   Amid shouts of ``Fire!'' and the thunder
of cannon, thousands of men in blue and gray stormed each other to
re-enact the opening of the Battle of Gettysburg, 125 years after
the Civil War's bloodiest confrontation.
   A total of about 8,000 men representing Union and Confederate
troops traded mock rifle volleys and cannon bursts Friday, ripping
open paper gunpowder cartridges with their teeth while enemy lines
closed in.
   The Confederate troops pushed back the Union's black-hatted
``Iron Brigade,'' as scores of men on both sides feigned death in
the tall grass and spectators watched from a hill overlooking the
field.
   ``When it gets to firing, you're not in 1988 anymore, you're in
1863,'' said Jeff Douthit, a 28-year-old farmer from Unionville, Va.
   The participants, among them teachers, engineers, artists and
soldiers, had invested $1,000 to outfit themselves with the
uniform, gear and guns needed to become Civil War soldiers, if only
for a day or two.
   Soldiers in the 23rd New York Regiment, played by a group from
Arizona, went so far as to follow Union recipes down to ``hard
tack,'' hard, flat squares of bread.
   ``You might think it was made 125 years ago. It's that
indigestable,'' said Ed Gouvier, a 37-year-old engineer from
Phoenix.
   Mentioning anything modern by members of the 23rd New York
resulted in punishment: standing on a wooden crate at the end of
one of the rows of white, canvas tents.
   Gouvier said people joined the outfit for a chance to relive
history, for the camaraderie, or to take part in the battles.
   ``I've always been a history fanatic,'' he said.
   Others had more personal reasons for joining one of the ersatz
armies.
   Steve DiCarlo, of Owings, Md., said he became a member of the
18th Virginia Regiment in part because his
great-great-great-grandfather was a captain in the Confederate Army.
   ``My wife thinks I'm crazy,'' he said.
   Napoleonic Tactics Inc., which sold tickets to cover its
$450,000 budget for staging three days of ersatz warfare, has
billed the event as the largest Civil War re-enactment ever. The
consulting company was hired by the event's sponor, the American
Civil War Commemorative Committee Inc.
   A total of 75,000 spectators were expected to attend the
re-enactment on farmland five miles south of the actual
battlefield. The event ends Sunday with the restaging of Pickett's
Charge.
   The Battle of Gettysburg took place from July 1-3, 1863, and
resulted in a total of close to 50,000 dead and wounded.
   Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was moving from the north toward
Gettysburg to get shoes for his troops and secure the roads running
through the southern Pennsylvania town, said Kim Bernard Holien, a
historian for the U.S. Army Center of Military History.
   The Union's Army of the Potomac was moving north when the chance
encounter at McPherson's Ridge touched off the bloody battle, he
said.
   Many of the current ``soldiers'' said they prepared for the
battle for months because its size set it apart.
   Tactical commanders for both sides met Thursday night to map out
the next day's skirmish.
   ``Supposedly everything's supposed to happen according to the
script,'' said Paul Baebler, a spokesman for Napoleonic Tactics.
   ``The people who won the first time will win again.'' he said.
   Organizers had said the number of troops falling ``dead'' in
Friday's skirmish would be proportionate to actual losses.
   But Michael Kraus, commander of the Union forces, said troops
often improvise on the field.
   ``It's an individual thing,'' said Kraus, a 34-year-old artist
from Creston, Ohio.
   The largest previous Civil War re-enactment was the Battle of
First Manassas in July 1986, involving 6,000 re-enactors, according
to Napoleonic Tactics.

<HEAD>Mecham Says He Will Challenge Impeachment Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham says his
impeachment conviction was unfair and he'll go to court in a bid to
get his job back.
   ``We think that it's important to challenge this,'' Mecham said
Friday.
   Leaving the conviction unchallenged would open all public
officials to impeachment, Mecham said, adding, ``Who knows? You may
see me back on the ninth floor (the governor's office) before the
next election.''
   The former governor on Friday also delivered a harsh attack on
Arizona Sen. John McCain, saying he is dishonest and is not
qualified to be vice president.
   McCain, a first-term senator who called for Mecham's resignation
in January, has been among those mentioned as a possible running
mate for Vice President George Bush, the certain GOP nominee.
   ``No, John isn't qualified to be vice president,'' Mecham said
in an interview with KTSP-TV. ``He doesn't have the intellect, he
doesn't have the stature, he doesn't have the honesty, he doesn't
have the character that it takes, and he certainly doesn't have the
political foundation.''
   McCain, who was speaking Friday night in Watertown, S.D., on
Bush's behalf, said, ``Former Governor Mecham is entitled to his
opinion. ... Nothing surprises me.''
   McCain said he was not seeking the vice presidential nomination,
noting that other qualified candidates come from states with more
electoral votes. The senator has said he backs Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum, R-Kan., for the GOP second spot.
   Both Mecham and McCain are members of the Arizona delegation to
the national GOP convention in New Orleans Aug. 15-18.
   Mecham was convicted April 4 by the Senate on impeachment
charges of misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund and
trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat. He
was acquitted June 16 on criminal charges of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan.
   Mecham was the first U.S. governor to be impeached and removed
from office in 59 years.
   The former governor said he probably would take his challenge to
to federal court, although the decision will be up to his lawyers.
He also said it was uncertain how soon it will be filed.

<TEXT>
   Police today seized 15 radical
students who briefly occupied the office of the top prosecutor in
South Korea and demanded the punishment of former President Chun
Doo-hwan.
   Police said the students used iron bars and firebombs to force
their way into the prosecutors' building in downtown Seoul and
staged a violent protest for 15 minutes before being overpowered.
   Riot police squads using tear gas arrested five students at the
gate and another 10 who resisted on the second floor of the
building, which houses offices of the prosecutor general and other
senior prosecutors.
   ``Punish Chun'' and ``Drive out Yankees,'' the students shouted
as they smashed windowns and furniture and demanded the punishment
of the former president and his wife.
   On Friday, scores of people were detained when riot police
roughly broke up a sit-in protest by 150 students and dissidents in
front of the National Assembly. Police kicked and punched the
protesters who urged Chun's punishment.
   Chun and his family have been the target of opposition charges
of corruption and embezzlement since he stepped down from the
presidency in February.
   Dissidents also criticized Chun for being responsible for
numerous cases of torture and brutality during a civil uprising in
the southern city of Kwangju.
   They accused Chun, President Roh Tae-woo and the United States
of masterminding the South Korean army's suppression of the Kwangju
uprising.
   Nearly 200 people were killed in the uprising, and dissidents
charge the United States with condoning the suppression.
   Radical students have staged violent anti-government and
anti-U.S. protests in the past months, demanding the removal of the
42,000 U.S. troops stationed here under a mutual defense pact.
   They contend the United States has enforced partition of the
Korean peninsula and rules the south as a colony. The United States
and the Soviet Union divided the peninsula at the end of World War
II.
   Meanwhile, thousands of war veterans and others held a peaceful
anti-communist rally in Seoul today to mark the 38th anniversary of
the three-year Korean War.
   ``Safeguard the Olympics and our nation from communists,'' they
shouted as speakers also denounced leftist groups in the south and
the communist north.
   Government officials have accused radicals of playing into North
Korea's strategy of formenting anti-U.S. sentiment and demanding
the co-hosting of the Olympics opening Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   In a memorial statement, government spokesman Chung Han-mo
charged that some radical groups even consider the Korean War as
``a proper effort to unify the Korean land.''
   North Korea invaded the south on June 25, 1950. The United
States and 15 other Western countries formed the U.N. Command to
help repel the North Korean invasion. China sided with North Korea
in the war.

<HEAD>Japan Says Noriega Government In Panama Not Illegal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan announced today that unlike the United States
it does not believe the government of Panamanian military leader
Gen. Manual Antonio Noriega is illegal.
   ``We have found no evidence that the present government of
Panama is illegal,'' said a Foreign Ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Whether or not their government is legal
is no longer an issue in Panama either.''
   On Thursday, the Japanese ambassador to Panama, Teruyuki Sawai,
met Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Abadia Arias for the first
time since Noriega engineered the ouster of former President Eric
Arturo Delvalle.
   On Feb. 25, the military-controlled legislative assembly ousted
Delvalle, who had tried to fire Noriega, commander of Panama's
15,000-member Defense Forces.
   Noriega has been indicted by two U.S. federal grand juries on
drug- trafficking charges. He has successfully resisted U.S.
economic sanctions aimed at forcing him to step down. President
Reagan has consistently called the present Panamanian government
illegal.
   The Japanese official declined to elaborate on Thursday's
meeting, which was held in Panama, saying only that it followed
actions by other countries, including Italy, France, Spain, Mexico,
and West Germany.
   Japan had withheld its official position on Panama, apparently
for fear of antagonizing the United States.
   Panama is a major consumer of Japanese goods. In addition, the
Panama Canal serves as a vital link for Japanese products bound for
the East Coast of America and for agricultural products headed for
Japan.
   Japan, Panama's second largest trading partner after the United
States, maintains a $3.2 billion trade surplus with the central
American nation. In turn, Panama is Japan's largest export market
in Latin America as well as the top recipient of Japanese direct
investment in the region.

   A shirtless fugitive's distinctive tattoos
led him back to jail after local police identified him from an FBI
flier as a suspect wanted in connection with a burglary in Illinois.
   David Easton, 50, who had no permanent address, was arrested
Friday after a purse-snatching and car wreck in Acworth, police
Capt. Nolan Sturdivant said. He was not wearing a shirt, revealing
two tattoos on his chest, one above each nipple, saying ``sweet''
and ``sour,'' the captain said.
   ``The thing that did it was the tattoo. ... It was the first
time I had ever seen a tattoo in that location,'' Sturdivant said.
``He didn't have a shirt on, so it stood right out.''
   The captain said he recalled reading about the ``unusual''
tattoo on an FBI flier he received in February describing Easton as
a suspect in a Springfield, Ill., burglary.

   A concrete ceiling weakened by a long-term leak
that had been covered up collapsed on a guest at the Helmsley
Windsor hotel, killing him as he slept in his $200-a-night,
top-floor suite, authorities said.
   The victim, Carmello Liuzzo, 35, of Greensboro, N.C. was buried
under the debris that fell onto and around his bed early Friday.
One 4-foot hunk of concrete about 10 inches thick fell squarely on
his body, said police Lt. Steve Davis.
   Between 1{ and 2 tons of concrete, plaster and cinder crashed
into the small bedroom.
   City Buildings Commissioner Charles Smith said a summons will be
issued to Harry and Leona Helmsley, who head the organization that
controls the hotel. They would be cited for ``failure to maintain a
structurally sound building,'' which could bring up to a $5,000
fine and 30 days in jail.
   ``I think it's clear that they were aware that there had been
deterioration,'' Smith said at a news conference. ``The false
ceiling is evidence that they tried to cover up a badly damaged
ceiling.''
   He said his inspectors found an indentation 3 inches deep and 6
feet across on the roof in which rain and melted snow collected and
leaked into cinder insulation between two concrete slabs.
   Over time, the insulation became heavy and compacted and the
water visibly rusted and deteriorated reinforcement in the lower
slab, he said.
   ``It had not been repaired _ it had been covered up,'' said
Smith. ``Someone did not do their job.''
   The 304-room hotel, which Smith said dates from 1926, is leased
by Winmar Operating Corp., a subsidiary of the Helmsley
organization, said hotel spokesman Doug Hearle.
   A statement issued in the name of Mrs. Helmsley, president of
Helmsley Hotels, said, ``We were shocked and devastated to hear of
the tragedy. ... Our hearts go out to the family.
   ``We have a team of consulting structural engineers conducting
an in-depth examination of the entire building. Until that is
completed, we won't comment on the buildings commissioner's
statements,'' the statement said.
   According to Inspector James McCabe, Liuzzo checked into the
midtown hotel Wednesday with his wife.
   The couple had asked for a $120-a-night room, Hearle said.
Because none was available, they were given a better accommodation
at the same price _ Room 1628, a $200 corner suite with a bedroom,
parlor, pantry and bath, Hearle said.
   Mrs. Liuzzo checked out Thursday, McCabe said.

<HEAD>Thousands Rally in Estonia to Cheer Political Demands For
Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With PM-Soviet-Party

<TEXT>
   About 150,000 Estonians gathered in meadow outside
the capital of Estonia and demanded that Soviet officials grant
greater autonomy to its republics, a newspaper said.
   The group also denounced Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who
seized Estonia, according to the report in Tuesday's edition of
Soviet Estonia newspaper, seen in Moscow on Friday.
   The call for a Soviet federation of republics with the right to
manage their own affairs came at a rally organized by the National
Front, a group of Communist Party members and other people founded
in April with official backing.
   The paper quoted leaders of the rally in the Baltic republic as
saying Estonia's 32 delegates to next week's party conference in
Moscow should seek approval to turn the region into a sovereign
republic.
   Five of the delegates spoke at the meeting. They said they
wanted Estonia to be given the right to fix its own prices, pay and
investments, and to formulate its own cultural, ecological and
other policies.
   Tiit Vyakhi, a delegate from an Estonian auto repair shop, told
the crowd, ``I think it's very important for Estonia and all
republics to get their sovereignty recognized. It's necessary to
confirm the principle of a united federation composed of sovereign
states with fully equal rights.''
   Hundreds of intellectuals in Latvia have made similar demands
for a form of home rule for the Soviet Union's 15 republics. The
Baltic republics, incorporated into the Soviet Union under a secret
protocol of the 1939 Soviet-Nazi pact, have long been the country's
most economically developed and Westward-looking regions.
   Other delegates and speakers at the unprecedented meeting in a
meadow outside the Estonian capital of Tallinn demanded immediate
condemnation of Stalinism and, by implication, of the Soviet
seizure of the Baltic republics in 1940.
   The official news agency Tass reported Friday that Estonia has
set up a commission chaired by republican president Arnold Ruutel
``to do justice'' to thousands of victims of Stalinist deportations
in 1941 and 1949.
   ``Dear delegates,'' a lathe operator from Tartu told the rally,
``you don't have any time to wait for the final, titanic works of
doctors of science about our history.
   ``Within a few days, you must make clear who it was in 1940 who
hacked up our science books and children's books with axes and make
clear that we are a people of many centuries of culture.''
   The report said speeches at the rally were greeted ``not just
with applause, but with the thunder of ovations.'' Pictures
published with the accounts showed crowds waving banners calling
for an end to privilege and praising the new Estonian Communist
party leader Vaino Vyalyas, named to his post June 16.
   Although speakers emphasized nationalist demands, they stressed
they did not want to secede from the Soviet Union, and none was
quoted as challenging the rule of the Communist Party.
   Dissatisfaction has been rising in Estonia over the migration of
ethnic Russians into the republic where ethnic Estonians are now a
minority, and over what is seen as the diminishing role of Estonian
language and traditions.
   Conference delegate Mare Rossmann, a teacher, was quoted as
saying Estonians ``simply want to live freely and happily on our
land.''
   ``We want to decide ourselves what happiness is. We think this
is the right of all peoples,'' she said.
   The newspaper did not explain why it took four days to publish
an account of the meeting, which it said was held June 17, a day
before Estonia's state-run media published the republic's platform
for next week's national party conference in Moscow.
   The account of the rally suggested the militant mood in Estonia
has at least the tacit backing of the republic's Communist Party
and that citizens expect immediate results from the Moscow
conference opening on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Briton Held In Iran Pleas For Better Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British businessman held in an Iranian prison
has issued a plea for better relations between Britain and Iran.
   Roger Cooper's appeal came in a 16-page handwritten letter
released Friday by a parliamentary delegation back from an
unofficial mission to Iran.
   John Lyttle, spokesman for Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, said Cooper gave him the letter while he was in Iran. He
passed it on to the four-member delegation, which returned to
Britain on Wednesday.
   The letter, dated June 20, said news of the mission ``filled me
with hope,'' and urged Britain to take the initiative to improve
relations.
   Cooper, 53, has lived in Iran for more than 20 years. He was
arrested in December 1985 and jailed for alleged spying. He is
being held in Tehran's Evin Prison.
   ``Britain is seen as a sly neo-colonialist, `an old fox' much
more skilled than the Americans or Russians in politics _ and
therefore potentially more dangerous,'' the letter said.
   It said Iranians criticized Britain for participation in a
U.S.-led economic blockade of Iran and for supplying Iraq with
materials useful in its nearly 8-year-old war with Iran.
   The letter pleaded for increased aid, trade and cultural
relations with Iran.
   Runcie, leader of the Church of England, arranged the mission's
three-day visit to explore ways of bringing about the release of
Britons in Lebanon who are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem extremists.

   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the drought
and weather picture:
   _Dredging crews reopened the drought-stricken Mississippi and
Ohio rivers to most barge traffic on Friday, but narrow channels
kept traffic backed up.
   _A cold front brought rain to parts of the upper Midwest and
record chill to the Northeast, but hot, dry weather elsewhere
continued to break temperature records. It was the eighth straight
day of 100-degree heat over the central part of the nation.
   _In St. Louis, the medical examiner's office said three elderly
women had died of hyperthermia.
   _In Georgia, a woman died of a heart attack brought on by heat
stroke while working in a tobacco field.
   _The Army Corps of Engineers said it will build a huge
underwater dike on the bottom of the Mississippi River to block a
saltwater intrusion that threatens New Orleans' drinking water
because of low river levels.
   _Health officials in Silver Lake, Kan. dumped 1,000 pounds of
lime in the 180-acre lake to battle odors caused by decaying fish.
The fish have died because of the declining water level and a
reduction in oxygen.
   _A fire Friday spread over 27,000 acres in the Custer National
Forest in Montana and spread into South Dakota.
   _Seven North Dakota counties have banned fireworks on July 4
because of fire danger.
   _Wisconsin banned outdoor smoking, open fires and fireworks in
all state parks, forests and other state land.
   _Several scientists told a Senate committee Thursday the weather
troubles could be the result of normal climate fluctuations, but
the current hot, dry weather is an example of things to come
because the long-dreaded ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the Earth
has begun.
   _A plan to pour more water into the Missouri River for shipping
ran aground because it would have destroyed nesting areas for an
endangered bird.
   _The Illinois State Water Survey said that as of June 15 there
was ``virtually no moisture available to plants in the top six
inches of soil.'' Below that, down to 40 inches, there is about a
two-week supply of moisture.

   Hundreds of barges began creeping along the Mississippi and Ohio
rivers through newly dredged channels, while farmers, clergymen and
politicians prayed for relief from the hot, dry weather that has
baked fields of crops.
   A cold front brought scattered rain to parts of the upper
Midwest and broke a heat wave in the Northeast, but Friday was the
eighth straight day of 100-degree heat over the central part of the
nation. Four people have died as a result of the heat.
   Nineteen Miss Indiana contestants donned raincoats and umbrellas
to sing ``Come Rain or Come Shine,'' but there was more shine than
rain in the state.
   Along the Mississippi, dredging crews removed sand that caused a
30-mile-long traffic jam of towboats and 1,100 barges near Memphis,
Tenn., but low water levels forced slow-going on the river.
   ``We should have all the backup cleared out of here by midday
Sunday,'' Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Donohoe said.
   Authorities hoped to have the remaining blockage on the
Mississippi cleared today above Cairo, Ill., said Robert W. Page,
assistant secretary of the Army for civil works in Washington, D.C.
   The drought has left the Mississippi so low that its current is
too slow to prevent saltwater from creeping upstream from the Gulf
of Mexico, threatening drinking water supplies and marshes where
oysters and other seafood grow.
   The Army Corps of Engineers announced plans to build a $600,000
dike near Myrtle Grove, La., 63 miles upstream from the mouth of
the river, to block some of the saltwater.
   On the Ohio, 87 towboats and their barges began moving Friday,
but traffic went in only one direction because of the narrow
channel that crews dredged, said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Jim Clifton
at Paducah, Ky.
   Forty-two cities on Friday from Florida to Oregon either tied or
broke high temperature records for the date.
   In the Northeast, readings dropped into the 70s and lower 80s,
and record lows were reported in a half-dozen cities, including 40
degrees at Burlington, Vt.
   Reno, Nev., Rapid City, S.D., Huron, S.D., and Casper, Wyo.,
tied or broke hig- temperature records for June, while Valentine,
Neb., hit 110 degrees for its high record on any date.
   In St. Louis, the medical examiner's office said three elderly
women had died of hyperthermia. In Georgia, a woman died of a heart
attack brought on by heat stroke while working in a tobacco field,
Thomas County Coroner Sam Brown said Friday.
   Missouri's Department of Social Services said $400,000 would be
made available to lend low-income households fans and air
conditioners and help pay their electric bills.
   Scattered rain Friday brought some relief to parts of the upper
Midwest before the hot air returned to bake the soil.
   ``It's unbelievable how much the crop is stunted. It's about
half the size in growth it should be, but now it's perked up
because of the rain,'' said farmer Morris Mick Greenley near
Independence, Iowa, which got about an inch. ``The nourishment we
took from this rain left the crops with a happy face.''
   But he said he still faces a 20 percent loss on his normal
yields of corn and beans even if he gets 2 inches of rain per week
for the next several weeks.
   Hot wind fanned forest fires in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, and
at least seven North Dakota counties have banned fireworks on July
4 because of the fire danger. Wisconsin banned outdoor smoking,
open fires and fireworks in all state parks, forests and other
state land Friday.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton asked citizens to join him in praying
for rain Sunday and several Indiana churches were holding nightly
prayer meetings to plead for rain.
   In Eureka, S.D., about 400 residents and five clergymen prayed
for rain Friday afternoon in 101-degree heat. It rained a small
amount, but not in town.
   ``God answers our prayers, whether it's today or tomorrow,''
resident Mary Lou Gruebele said. ``Maybe he says yes and maybe he
says no _ and maybe he says wait.''

<HEAD>Mao's Grandson a `Huge Monster' But an Average Student</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chairman Mao's grandson might be tall and hefty
but that's the only thing that makes him stand out in a crowd, a
newspaper reported today.
   China Youth News said the 18-year-old grandson of late leader
Mao Tse-tung ``could be considered a `huge monster' when compared
with the average high school student.''
   Mao Xinyu, who stands 5-foot, 10-inches tall and weighs nearly
220 pounds, is the son of Mao Anqing, Mao Tse-tung's only known
living son.
   A report last December said the 62-year-old Mao Anqing, his
wife, Zhang Shaohua, and their only son were living quietly in a
Beijing villa.
   Mao Tse-tung married four times and had nine children, including
a daughter by his last wife, Jiang Qing. He died in 1976. Jiang
Qing is believed alive.
   Detailed reports of the lives of China's leaders and their
families are rare.
   The paper described the high school senior as an amiable and
cheerful youth who gets along well with his classmates and is
treated just like any other student.
   He is fond of history ``perhaps because of the historical legacy
of his forefathers,'' and his best grades are in history class, the
report said.
   Besides his schoolbooks and some historical writings, Xinyu also
likes to read classical novels, historical drama and classical
poetry, it said.
   As he prepares for the nationwide college entrance exams that
will be administered next month, Xinyu is still trying to decide
what to study. He likes history, but thinks law or philosophy might
be more practical, the newspaper said.
   Philosophy is considered practical in China because graduates in
the field are often assigned jobs in poweful propaganda bureaus.
   Xinyu was born Jan. 17, 1970, in the midst of the ultra-leftist
Cultural Revolution, and rarely saw his father for the first six
years of his life, the report said.
   ``However, this has not prevented Xinyu from respecting his
father,'' the report said. Mao Anqing is believed to suffer from
mental illness, but the paper made no mention of his health.
   Xinyu's classmates often discuss their impressions of Chairman
Mao and his mistakes, and Xinyu willingly joins in these
discussion, it said.
   ``Actually, except that he is Mao's grandson, Xinyu's appraisal
of this great historical figure is no different from that of his
classmates,'' the report said.
   Since the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Mao has been
criticized for creating a cult of personality and for leftist
excesses that drove China's economy into the ground.

<HEAD>Party Conference to Take Up Freer Economic Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speakers at next week's national Communist Party
conference will plea for greater economic competition in the
state-run economy, an adviser to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
said.
   Leonid Abalkin, head of the economics institute in the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, called Friday for an ``atmosphere of
competition, winning over the consumer,'' and open competition by
individual enterprises for state orders.
   Reformers have heavily criticized the centrally controlled
system of economic planning.
   However, Abalkin said the country's economic system will be
radically changed beginning in the early 1990s, and those changes
will be discussed at the conference that begins Tuesday.
   Abalkin said several speeches to the conference of 5,000
delegates will be devoted to encouraging economic competition. His
comments represented one of the few signs from officials of a
specific topic to be considered and an indication of the issue's
importance in the eyes of economic reformers.
   The economist is a delegate to the party conference and a key
adviser to Gorbachev.
   Several speeches to the party conference will criticize the
system of government procurement, now accomplished by a vast system
of orders to individual state-run businesses, he said.
   Reforms don't intend to do away with government procurement, but
change ``the ways they reach the enterprises, not the old ways _
command and bureaucratic _ but the method based on competition
between enterprises to win government orders,'' Abalkin said.
   ``I am certain that more than one statement will be devoted to
this question,'' he said.
   He added that satisfying pent-up demand for consumer goods and
services ``will be possible only if the monopolization by the
producer is ruled out and economic competition between individual
enterprises is asserted.''
   Reformers trace many of the Soviet Union's economic problems to
a bureaucratic system of management that stifles local initiative
and ignores market demands.
   Asked about a radical Estonian economic program for the party
conference, Abalkin said central authorities must allow local
officials more economic freedom but be careful not to permit a rise
of nationalism.
   The Estonian platform for the party conference asks central
authorities to give the republic complete control over prices,
wages and investment policy.
   Officials have indicated that the conference will discuss
problems among the more than 100 ethnic groups that live in the
Soviet Union.
   The problems have been highlighted in recent months by unrest in
Estonia and other Baltic republics and a tense dispute between
Armenia and Azerbaijan over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region
of Azerbaijan.
   The conference, the first since 1941, is to consider a program
put forth by the party's policy-making Central Committee that calls
for party bureaucrats to stop interfering in government decisions
and economic management.
   It also seeks to limit the terms of elected party officials.

<HEAD>Official Report: Lebanon's Waters Not Radioactive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanese territorial waters are neither
radioactive nor contaminated by tons of Italian toxic waste that
have been dumped in recent months in this chaotic country, news
reports said today.
   Beirut's daily As-Safir said the Lebanese Health Ministry issued
a report saying the waters were not contaminated after an expert
committee examined samples of sea water Friday.
   A Lebanese businessman imported 2,400 tons of toxic chemical
waste from Italy two weeks ago and some of it was reported dumped
on the Kesrouan coastal strip 20 miles north of Beirut.
   In addition, about 40 barrels inscribed ``Cairo Oil'' and
containing suspicious-looking pink and golden powder were
discovered off the coast of Tyre in south Lebanon, and Tabarja in
the north.
   The two events, combined with an outbreak of skin rashes among
people who swam in the sea, drove the usually stoic Lebanese off
their beaches.
   ``The contents of the barrels, the sea water and fish examined
are not radioactive,'' said the report.
   ``The barrels contain organic brown powder that does not include
any heavy poisonous metallic material,'' it said.
   The ministry qualifed the report in saying it was sending
``maritime biological and geological samples for further
examination abroad to determine whether future risks are
involved.'' It did not elaborate or say where it was sending the
samples.
   The statement urged the Lebanese not to swim in the sea and to
avoid eating fish, pending the outcome of the final report expected
in two weeks.

<HEAD>British Envoy Says Chinese Sensitive to Hong Kong Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese officials are listening carefully to Hong
Kong residents' worries about laws that will govern them when the
colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, a British envoy said today.
   Meanwhile, Hong Kong's government announced today that Britain
will increase its share of the colony's defense costs during the
nine years before China takes over.
   In a brief statement, the government said Britain will shoulder
35 percent of defense costs, up from 25 percent under the formula
that expired March 31.
   About 13,000 British soldiers and dependents are stationed on
the colony.
   In Beijing, Lord Glenarthur, Britain's state minister for Asian
affairs, told a news conference that he discussed Hong Kong
residents' concerns with Chinese officials.
   Many in Hong Kong fear the draft of its future ``basic law,'' or
constitution, does not adequately protect civil liberties and could
be changed by the Chinese after 1997 to further reduce freedoms.
The draft was completed in April, and the Chinese legislature was
expected to pass a final version by 1990.
   ``It was quite clear to me that (Chinese Vice Foreign Minister)
Zhou Nan paid careful attention to what I was saying and that the
Chinese government is taking equally careful note of the views
expressed in Hong Kong,'' the British envoy said.
   Britain has ruled the thriving port of Hong Kong, on China's
southeast coast, since 1842.
   The British official also said Chinese leaders expressed support
for the recent decision by Hong Kong's colonial government to
repatriate those Vietnamese boat people not fleeing political
persecution.

<HEAD>Challenge To Small Town's Ban On Dancing Heading To Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA BRYSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PURDY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students in this small southwestern Missouri
town who just wanna dance go to court Monday to see if a federal
judge will strike up the right tune.
   ``I didn't think it would go this far,'' said George Fox, 18, a
spring graduate of Purdy High School, where about 160 students were
enrolled. ``We started this, I just want to see it get finished.''
   At issue is one sentence that has been part of the Purdy school
board's policy book for as long as anyone can remember:
   ``School dances are not authorized and school premises shall not
be used for purposes of conducting a dance.''
   Residents say generations of students in the town of about 900
people have made an annual ritual of appealing to the school board
to rescind the ban, then quietly accepting a refusal that came as
regularly as a final exam. Fox's class was different.
   Fox is among 21 Purdy students and their parents who filed suit
in 1986, asking the courts to strike down the ban as an
unconstitutional encroachment of religious values on public life.
Fox said fellow students have told him they're against dancing
because parents and ministers have told them it is a sin.
   Pro-dancers believe the ban _ unique among southern Missouri
school districts _ has endured because many in the community have a
Southern Baptist-inspired opposition to dancing.
   ``That's not true,'' said Ransom Ellis III, the attorney
representing the school board. ``The motivation was purely
secular.''
   Ellis said he would not expand on his argument because it would
mean revealing evidence he planned to present in court.
   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark has set aside four days
beginning Monday to hear the case in Springfield. Clark was also
considering a countersuit filed by the school district in which
officials seek $1 million in damages, claiming students and parents
have harassed them over the dancing issue.
   The suit filed by students and parents, with backing from the
American Civil Liberties Union, seeks a court order to keep the
school from enforcing the dance ban, attorneys fees and $1 in
damages.
   In 1986, Purdy students signed a petition in support of a school
dance and asked for their parents' help when they took the request
before the school board. They were met with resistance organized in
local churches. So many people were drawn to the school board
meeting at which the ban was challenged that it had to be moved to
the high school gymnasium.
   Dance supporters were unable to get the school board to end the
ban, though they followed the petition drive with a rally that drew
national attention. The students invited stars of the musical
``Footloose,'' a movie about a fictional Texas town where dancing
was banned, to the rally. Actors Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer were
unable to attend.
   In April 1986, school district voters re-elected by wide margins
the anti-dancing board members.
   The controversy escalated to the point where dance supporters
and opponents walked on opposite sides of the street.
   ``A lot of people refer to me as a troublemaker, an outsider,''
said Joan Fox, George Fox's mother.
   Her family has lived in Purdy for 13 years, but remain newcomers
in the eyes of lifelong residents, Mrs. Fox said. It hasn't helped
that she is a vocal supporter of what she says is her children's
right to dance at school.
   ``They shouldn't be barred from homecoming and prom at school _
it's a public school,'' she said.

<HEAD>Jury Says Cigarettes Should Have Carried Warning, But Awards No
Damages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE LLOYD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury's decision that cigarettes should
have carried a warning label before 1966 should encourage other
lung-cancer victims to sue manufacturers, despite the fact that no
damages were awarded, an attorney said.
   ``This is very similar to the history of asbestos litigation
where at the beginning cases were lost and now liability is clearly
established,'' said Ben Shein, an attorney for the estate of John
Ray Gunsalus.
   A federal jury said Friday that cigarettes manufactured by
American Tobacco Co. were defective prior to 1966 because they did
not have a warning label. But it said the lack of a warning was not
a ``substantial factor'' in Gunsalus' death of lung cancer last
year at age 55.
    Gunsalus, a Pall Mall smoker who first lit up at age 11, worked
at the Chester shipyards where asbestos was prevalent, and the case
brought by his estate sought to tie the hazards of smoking to those
of working around asbestos.
   Dan Conforti, public information director for American Brands,
the Stamford, Conn.-based parent company of American Tobacco, said
the company was pleased with the verdict.
   The case was decided less than two weeks after a jury in Newark,
N.J., decided a tobacco company should pay $400,000 to the widower
of a lifelong smoker. It was the first monetary award from a
cigarette maker after about 300 attempts in courtrooms from coast
to coast.
   Shein said Friday's ruling poses a ``serious threat to (tobacco
companies) in the future.'' Attorneys were considering an appeal,
he added. The estate had been seeking unspecified damages for pain
and suffering.
   ``We intend to continue this area of litigation and believe this
should encourage other injured parties who have brought similar
actions against tobacco companies,'' he said.
   According to testimony from Dr. Paul Epstein of Graduate
Hospital in Philadelphia, Gunsalus died of cancer caused by smoking
and asbestos exposure.
   Epstein, a witness for the Gunsalus estate, said the interaction
of asbestos and cigarette smoke creates a far greater risk of
cancer than either substance does on its own.
   But American Tobacco attorney Edward F. Mannino argued that
Gunsalus' health history, not smoking's dangers, were the issue. He
pointed to Gunsalus' history of heavy drinking, multiple stab
wounds and three heart attacks.
   In closing remarks Thursday, Mannino said Gunsalus smoked
because he chose to and described him as a ``strong-willed'' person
who ignored six doctors' warnings to quit smoking.
   Thomas F. Johnson, an attorney for Gunsalus' estate, responded
by telling the jury the ``unspoken assumption'' of American
Tobacco's argument ``is what does it matter if we kill a bum?''

<TEXT>
   Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi's fervor for
stopping communism in his homeland was hailed by Cuban exiles here,
yet his acceptance of arms from South Africa has raised questions.
   Savimbi, head of Angola's UNITA rebels, spoke here Friday as
part of a U.S. tour to drum up support and discuss peace talks
aimed at ending the 13-year civil war with Angola's Marxist,
Cuban-backed government.
   But the burly, personable Savimbi has found himself on a public
relations tightrope. He is cheered for his struggle for democratic
freedom, yet denounced for accepting arms from a government that
openly practices racial discrimination.
   ``I'm not here to discuss the policies of South Africa, which I
condemn. I'm fighting for freedom and you must do it any way you
can,'' Savimbi told a news conference. ``When you are fighting for
your country, you must get help from even the devil himself.''
   Savimbi, who has been criticized by Democratic presidential
contender Michael Dukakis and influential blacks, said that even
American patriots enlisted the aid of European monarchies in the
revolution against the British monarchy.
   ``In a fight for freedom, sometimes you have to look out for
your interests first,'' he said.
   Savimbi said a Cuban troop buildup in Angola clouds the peace
talks that began this week in Cairo, Egypt, the third round of
discussions in two months.
   The United States, which also helps arm the Angolan guerrillas,
is mediating between South Africa and a joint Angolan-Cuban
delegation to resolve Angola's civil war and end South African rule
over neighboring Namibia.
   The talks have so far hinged on South Africa's demand that Cuba
withdraw its troops from Angola as a precondition for Namibia's
independence.
   ``There were 45,000 Cuban troops in March, and now there are
57,000,'' Savimbi said. ``They're not withdrawing; they're
increasing tremendously.
   Savimbi's one-day visit to Miami was sponsored by the
Cuban-American National Foundation, a staunchly anti-communist
group with offices here and in Washington.
   Foundation head Jorge Mas Canosa said a private dinner honored
Savimbi Friday night to show support for his cause but not to raise
money.
   ``He knows he has our support,'' Mas Canosa said. ``We've
provided hospital beds, food and medicine to his troops in the past
and we are ready to do it again.''
   Savimbi plans to meet with President Reagan in Washington next
week.

<HEAD>Gandhi Reshuffles Cabinet To Allow More Time For Politics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi reshuffled
his Cabinet today and said he would no longer serve as his own
foreign minister because he wanted to devote more time to politics.
   The Cabinet changes, Gandhi's 13th since he took office in 1984,
followed setbacks for his Congress Party in last week's
parliamentary elections.
   By divesting himself of the foreign minister's job, Gandhi can
turn fuller attention to the challenge posed by his chief political
rival, former Defense Minister V.P. Singh.
   Singh, who broke with the prime minister last year over the
government's slowness in investigating allegations that bribes were
paid in foreign arms deals, won a parliamentary seat in the
Allahabad district.
   He easily defeated the Congress Party candidate by a 2-to-1
majority, boosting his chances of opposing Gandhi himself for
national leadership in the coming 18 months.
   National elections must be conducted no later than January 1990.
   Asked today whether ``panic'' over Singh's Allahabad victory was
the reason for the Cabinet reshuffle, Gandhi replied: ``Not at all
... Do I look panicky?''
   He said he would not resign and would not call an early election.
   The country's two national news agencies, the United News of
India and the Press Trust of India, quoted the prime minister as
saying he wanted to devote more time to political work.
   Gandhi assigned the post of foreign minister to P.V. Narasimha
Rao, who had served as minister of human resource development in
the last Cabinet.
   He was one of nine men given new Cabinet-level responsibilities
in the reshuffle. All are Congress Party veteran politicians.
   Two of the new Cabinet members, Finance Minister S.B. Chavan and
Commerce Minister Bir Bahadur Singh, stepped down as chief
ministers of Indian states on Friday following allegations they had
been inept in upholding the Congress Party banner.
   Their inclusion 24 hours later in Gandhi's new Cabinet brought a
scathing retort from L.K. Advani, president of a right-wing
opposition group, the Bharatiya Janata Party. He called the new
Cabinet ``a waste basket of rejected chief ministers,'' PTI
reported.
   Bir Bahadur Singh was chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, where the
Congress Party lost one parliamentary seat and two state assembly
seats to opposition candidates in the June 16 elections.
   Chavan was chief minister of Maharashtra, where a militant Hindu
party, the right-wing Shiv Sena, won recent city council elections
in Bombay, the state capital.
   Since Gandhi took office in 1984 following the assassination of
his mother and predecessor, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the
Congress Party has lost 10 of 14 state elections.
   In another key Cabinet appointment, Baburao Shankaranand was
named minister of law, justice and water resources.
   Shankaranand was water resources minister in a previous Cabinet
but resigned last summer to head a parliamentary investigation that
kickbacks were paid to facilitate India's purchases of artillery
guns from the Swedish company, Bofors. The investigation concluded
there was no evidence that kickbacks were paid.
   Following new reports this week in the daily newspaper, Hindu,
that commissions were paid in the Bofors deal, Gandhi said he had
asked the Central Bureau of Investigation to look into the matter.
   The Cabinet now has 20 members, including Gandhi who retains
responsibility for science and technology, atomic energy and space.
The last Cabinet had 16 members.

   Gunmen killed a human rights lawyer
as he stood with his daughter in his house in the central
Philippine island of Cebu, police reported today.
   Alfonso Surigao, 41, was the second human rights lawyer killed
in the country in a week. Last Saturday, five unidentified men shot
dead Ramon Cura in his home near the U.S. Clark Air Base north of
here.
   The leftwing Partido ng Bayan (People's Party-PNB) said Surigao
had been a candidate in congressional elections last year. He also
chaired the Visayas region chapter of Amnesty International and was
a member of various human rights groups.
   In a statement released today, the party denounced the killing
of the two lawyers and said the incidents ``are part of a
systematic plan to eliminate leaders of legal democratic
organizations.''
   Police said the gunmen entered the house of Surigao in Pardo
district in Cebu, about 360 miles southeast of here, and shot the
lawyer twice in the head. No suspects have been arrested.

   Plans to install floating toilets for the

exactly getting flushed down the tubes by concerned officials.
   ``It may seem that this is something kind of frivolous, but when

   For a boater on the northeast corner of Lake Pleasant, ``your
only alternative is to go ashore and get behind a cactus or go over
into the water and do it,'' Richwine said.
   Richwine envisions two floating toilets anchored in the upper,
more remote regions of the lake about 25 miles northwest of Phoenix.
   Each would be a one-holer restroom floating on pontoons. They
would have holding tanks similar to those in the portable toilets
used at construction sites, golf tourneys and concerts.
   Richwine said he would make the county Board of Supervisors
privy to his plans in two weeks in order to apply for a $90,000
State Lake Improvement Fund grant to pay for the restrooms and a
trailer to haul them.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service is considering putting six
floating potties on Roosevelt Lake about 60 miles northeast of
Phoenix, said David Killebrew of Tonto National Forest.
   The toilets are part of an $18 million improvement plan for the
popular water-sports site, Killebrew said. Construction is to begin
in 1990.

   A small alligator found snoozing in a
Memphis vegetable garden is just a run-of-the-mill reptile and not
a missing sex-changed gator stolen from Memphis State University, a
biologist says.
   The researcher who changed the missing alligator's sex examined
the garden gator and pronounced it a different, ordinary reptile,
Memphis State biology department Chairman Jim Payne said recently.
   The missing alligator was stolen last November from a biology
laboratory at Memphis State.
   The 2-foot-long gator was one of a dozen or so used to study the
effects of hormones and environment on reptile sex determination.
While still in the egg, it was changed from a boy to a girl.
   An alligator fitting the missing animal's description turned up
in a garden June 14, but the only person who could confirm the
reptile's identity, biologist William Gutzke, was in the Galapagos
Islands inspecting the sex organs of turtles.
   Gutzke passed through town a few days ago, examined the
alligator and decided it was not his, Payne said.
   A Memphis resident says the garden gator might be Allie, a
missing pet he brought back from Louisiana for his

<HEAD>Admiral Calls For One Court-Martial In Recruit's Death</HEAD>

   An admiral has called for the
court-martial of a Navy swimming instructor accused of holding a
recruit's head under water and literally scaring him to death, a
Navy spokesman said.
   Four other enlisted men and an officer accused in the death have
until Monday to decide whether to accept more lenient disciplinary
action or pursue a court-martial, Lt. Cmdr. Dennis Hessler said
Friday.
   Rear Adm. David R. Morris of Corpus Christi, Texas, chief of
naval air training, also dropped involuntary manslaughter charges
against the enlisted men, except for Petty Officer 2nd Class
Michael W. Combe, for whom he has recommended the court-martial,
Hessler said.
   The Navy accused Combe of holding Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki,
19, of Appleton, Wis., under water after Combe and other
instructors pushed or tossed the trainee into a pool when he
panicked and tried to quit the course.
   Morris recommended the court-martial to Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman,
chief of naval education and training, the ranking officer in
Pensacola, said Hessler, Thunman's public affairs officer.
   ``It seems like he felt possibly that Combe was the most
culpable, and I have to respect his decision because we are not
part of the military process,'' Lynn Johansen, Mirecki's sister,
said in Appleton.
   The decisions show all six defendants share the blame, she said.
   ``These men lacked professional judgment, and that's obvious,''
she said. ``Everyone's saying that the system failed, but these men
were part of it.''
   At a five-day investigative hearing two weeks ago, defense
attorneys argued the system was at fault because Mirecki was
allowed to return to training through a series of mix-ups after a
flight surgeon declared him unfit and because use of force was a
common practice condoned by authorities to keep scared, tired or
malingering trainees in the pool.
   Mirecki had been described at the hearing as having died from
``sheer terror.'' A pathologist testified Mirecki had a phobia
about being dragged under water, which triggered heart failure
followed by drowning, although there was no determination of which
factor killed him.
   Combe and the four other instructors had been charged with
conspiracy to commit battery and involuntary manslaughter. Lt.
Thomas A. Torchia, the officer in charge of the school, was accused
of dereliction of duty and transferred.
   Morris offered to resolve the cases of Torchia, Petty Officers
1st Class Richard E. Blevins and David J. Smith and Petty Officers
2nd Class Frankie D. Deaton and John W. Zelenock with non-judicial
punishment, Hessler said.
   If they decide to accept the offer, the extent of punishment
would be determined at a proceeding known as an admiral's nest.
They could face a pay cut, reduction in rank, restriction to the
base or other penalties.
   A court-martial would enable a defendant to be cleared if
acquitted but carries the risk of penalities that include prison
time and removal from the service for a conviction.

<HEAD>Fire Burning Out Again, Some Remain Evacuated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CROFTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers began to dismantle the exterior of a
derailed CSX tanker in preparation for its move to a safe place
today after awaiting the burnout of a toxic fire that prompted the
evacuation of 15,000.
   The fire had died down enough by late Friday to allow workers to
remove the ruptured steel jacket of the car.
   James H. ``Mike'' Molloy, executive director of the state
Division of Disaster and Emergency Services, said a survey team
determined at mid-afternoon Friday that 20 percent of the caustic
white phosphorus remained in the tanker.
   Don Armstrong, a DES spokesman, said plans called for placing
the hull on a flat-bed rail car today and shipping it to a safe
area to remove the remaining phosphorus.
   About 40 families displaced when the tanker derailed Wednesday
night, creating a toxic cloud that forced the evacuation of 15,000
people from eight western Kentucky counties, will be allowed to
return home once the car is removed, Armstrong said.
   Meanwhile, CSX Transportation Corp. conducted a drug test on the
train's engineer, but the results will not be available for several
weeks, said Tim Hensley, a spokesman for CSX. Hensley refused to
identify the engineer.
   The tanker was part of a CSX train that officials say was going
too fast through rural Christian County when 34 of its cars
derailed Wednesday night in a ravine near Crofton. The phosphorus
spilled from the ruptured tanker and burned for more than 12 hours
after the crash.
   Phosphorus inside the tanker reignited Thursday night as workers
righted it and although more toxic smoke billowed over the area,
there were few additional evacuations and no injuries, officials
said.
   The CSX engineer said he did not see a sign marking the section
of the track under a slow order and did not receive a computer
message about it, Hensley said. He said a warning marker was found,
but was not standing.
   ``Our position is ... he failed to receive and comply with a 10
mph slow order,'' Hensley said. ``Whether the fault was on his part
or our part, that really hasn't been determined.''
   He said the wreckage would be put through a battery of tests,
including chemical and X-ray analyses, to determine if there were
equipment or material failures. A tape located in the engineer's
quarters, as well as handling and operational procedures, will also
be reviewed, he said.

   Poor mothers told a congressional
committee investigating hunger in Appalachia that their families
would not have enough food to live on if they didn't grow some of
it themselves.
   Two congressmen, committee staff members and reporters visited
homes of poor West Virginians on Friday before they listened to
experts tell why some people go without food.
   ``The problems (with poverty programs) all originate with the
notion that low-income people are deadbeats, lazy and shiftless
people. This is not true,'' said Milton Ogle, director of the
Appalachian Research and Defense Fund based in Charleston.
   Testifying before the U.S. House's Select Committee on Hunger,
Ogle said much of West Virginia's problem stems from the lack of
money to supplement federal programs. That's because much of the
state's wealth _ its surface land and mineral resources _ is
controlled by out-of-state corporations.
   ``The absentee holders of wealth display an arrogance based on
power that causes our state leaders to crumble and turn to mush,''
Ogle said. ``Thus, the burden of paying for public services falls
disproportionately on low- and moderate-income people.''
   The situation in West Virginia and other rural states appears to
be dire, said Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas.
   ``We have heard from mothers in West Virginia that they would
not be able to adequately feed their families if they didn't have
their gardens,'' said Leland, the committee chairman.
   ``For many residents of this state, the outlook for prosperity
in the near future is dismal. Most families don't even think about
how things look down the road because they are exhausting every
thread of energy confronting the day-to-day struggles of making
ends meet. But West Virginians are a proud people and they will
stretch themselves to the farthest limits to survive.''
   Earlier, the committee toured the homes of several residents to
learn how they manage to make ends meet when state and federal
programs are insufficient. Ocie Taylor, a 90-year-old resident of
Oak Hill, told the congressmen she cherishes her independence but
fears that it is threatened by her inability to make ends meet on
Social Security, a modest Veterans Administration pension and the
local Meals on Wheels program.
   ``When I get so I can't wait on myself, I hope the good Lord
takes me,'' Taylor said. ``They want me to come live with my
children, but I'd rather live in my own house.''
   Down the road in Robson, Gwendolyn Cole is having an even harder
time feeding herself and two children, her 3-year-old son and a
6-year-old girl she took in when the girl was abandoned by her
mother.
   Because the little girl's mother is reluctant to allow her to be
adopted, Cole _ who lives on $201 a month in welfare benefits and
$228 a month in food stamps _ has been unable to obtain medical
coverage for the child.
   ``What if she gets sick? I just pray that she don't,'' Cole said.
   Often, Cole's food stamps don't stretch nearly far enough. With
nearly a week remaining before she gets her next allotment of
stamps, she showed visitors a refrigerator virtually empty of
anything except some bread and bottles of water that she has
because her water pipes are broken.
   ``I was working, but now that I've got the kids I can't,'' said
the single mother. The nearest available day care center is in Oak
Hill, 20 miles away, and Cole has no transportation of her own.
   ``Whatever job I could get, I'd have to take the bus, and
getting the kids to day care would be hard,'' she said.

<HEAD>Burma's Universities Shut In Wake Of Rioting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has closed almost all
universities and institutions of higher learning in this Southeast
Asian nation after students rioted in at least four cities over the
past week, local residents said today.
   Rangoon, where rioting erupted Tuesday, was calm although
traffic was lighter than normal today. A dusk-to-dawn curfew
remained in force.
   Residents contacted by telephone said classes had been suspended
at universities and secondary schools in Mandalay, the country's
second largest city, as well as Taunggyi, Moulmein, Pegu, Bassein,
Myitkyina and Akyab.
   The government imposed a series of restrictions hours after
students and other demonstrators clashed with police in Rangoon
last Tuesday. Over the next few days the protests spread to Pegu,
located north of Rangoon; Moulmein, on the southeastern seacoast,
and the Irrawaddy delta center of Bassein.
   Residents in Moulmein said out-of-town students at the
university were quickly sent home on buses, airplanes and boats by
authorities. They also reported the arrest of several student
leaders.
   There has been no comment to date on the disturbances in the
government-controlled media and no public announcement since June
23 on the closure of the schools.
   Although details were not available, authorities in Rangoon
appeared to be searching for student leaders, most of whom have
been expelled from schools and universities following a bloody riot
in the capital last March.
   The latest protests were sparked by the government closure of
the Rangoon Arts and Science University where students last week
staged a peaceful demonstration demanding release of arrested
students and the legalization of student unions.
   Shouting anti-government slogans, thousands took to the streets
and battled police with rocks. The government announced that nine
persons were killed and 77 arrested in the third major violent
protest since last October.
   The outbreak appears to reflect a widespread disillusionment
with the 26-year-old regime of strongman Ne Win. His socialist
economics have turned a once prosperous country into one of the
world's poorest nations and the one-party rule has curtailed many
civil liberties.
   The stagnant economy has created widespread unemployment or
under-employment among university graduates, who spearheaded the
week's anti-government drive.
   The 78-year-old Ne Win came to power in a 1962 coup and has
since ousted a number of potential rivals. But until last year,
overt, mass opposition had been sporadic with the last major
protests prior to October occuring in 1974.
   The government has said that the curfew as well as a ban on
public meetings and demonstrations would last until Aug. 19. It has
not said when classes would be resumed.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has been using his
Austrian visit to emphasize that Christians as well as Jews were
among the victims of Nazi persecution.
   Shortly after arriving in Austria on Thursday afternoon, the
pontiff began drawing attention to the non-Jews who suffered under
Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.
   The pontiff did not mention Jews during his formal, televised
speech during a Friday afternoon visit to the site of the former
Mauthausen Nazi death camp, angering Austria's chief rabbi by the
omission.
   Today, the pontiff again brought up Christian suffering during a
prayer service in the town of Lorch, 25 miles from the Czech border.
   ``Not far from here is Mauthausen, where Christians, Jews and
others were persecuted for many reaons, including their religion,``
the pope said. ``Their suffering was a gift to the world.``
   In addition to killing six million Jews, the Nazis also killed
hundred of thousand of others, including gypsies, homosexuals,
priests and political opponents.
   On his five-day Austrian tour, the pope appeared to be trying to
make sure the memories of the other victims, especially Christians,
are not forgotten.
   ``Amongst the many who were persecuted for religious, racial and
political reasons were large numbers of Catholics _ priests,
members of religious orders and lay people,'' he told President
Kurt Waldheim and other Austrian politicians Thursday evening.
   John Paul also brought up the issue in a meeting with leaders of
Austria's Jewish community Friday morning as he talked about
inquiries into the causes of the Nazi dictatorship.
   The pope spoke of studies into the ``the Holocaust as well as
martyrdom of the Polish people and other European peoples during
the Nazi era.''
   Many of the Poles who were killed _ though not all _ were Jews.
   John Paul reminded the Jewish community leaders that the Nazi
machine was aimed not only at the Jewish people ``but also against
the faith of those who worship Jesus of Nazareth, a Jew, as the
savior of the world.''
   Then, in an emotional visit to the site of the former death camp
on Friday afternoon, the only victims he mentioned by name were
Polish priest St. Maximilian Kolbe, religious activist Marcel Callo
and two other Catholics.
   He also called attention to ``all people, especially those who,
when World War II was raging in Europe, suffered the torture of
such camps.''
   Austrian chief Rabbi Chaim Eisenberg responded to the Mauthausen
speech by saying: ``A visit to Mauthausen without mentioning the
word `Jews' once is not satisfactory.''
   ``The only Jew he mentions who suffered is Jesus Christ, and he
didn't die in Mauthausen,'' Eisenberg added.
   The pontiff's pronouncements come as some historians have been
promoting revised views of the Holocaust and Nazi atrocities.
   Conservative West German historians in particular are saying
that Nazi horrors should be compared with Stalinist-era mass
killings in the Soviet Union and similar atrocities by totalitarian
regimes.
   The historians' views have angered many Jews, who say they are
denigrating the memory of Jews who died in the Holocaust.
   It is not known whether the pope is versed in this historical
debate.
   However, after condemning the Nazi atrocities at Mauthausen,
John Paul used the phrase: ``Here ... and in so many places under
totalitarian rule.''
   Later in the speech, he added: ``If a machine of destruction
still exists anywhere in the world, tell us, what can our century
pass on to the generations to come?''

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Blow Down Barns, Power Lines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A band of powerful thunderstorms sped eastward across part of
the drought-battered Midwest today after unleashing a tornado and
blowing down a barn as record heat cooked America from West Coast
to East.
   The storms pushing across parts of the eastern Dakotas and
Minnesota into northern Wisconsin and western Upper Michigan
prompted severe thunderstorm watches in the latter two states.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms weakened from east Tennessee
to Georgia and northeast South Carolina, also suffering from the
drought, and widely scattered thunderstorms lingered over southern
Texas and western Louisiana.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms extended from northern
California to Nevada and the southern Rockies and from south
central Montana to Wyoming and western Nebraska.
   On Friday, the storms triggered a tornado just southeast of
Claire City, S.D., downed power lines there and left eight-tenths
of an inch of rain.
   In Minnesota, strong winds blew down a barn in De Graff and
toppled trees in Roseau. Golf ball-size hail pounded Brainerd and
Ellendale, and smaller hail fell in or near other cities.
   In Georgia, thunderstorm winds blew part of a roof off a house
near Uvalda, knocked down a barn near Eastman, and downed power
lines south of Forsyth and trees in Ailey and west of Thomaston.
Three-fourths of an inch of rain fell in Albany in an hour.
   Showers and thunderstorms diminished Friday night across the
southern Plains, also seared by drought. In the late afternoon and
evening, 2{ inches of rain soaked Broken Bow, Okla., and nearly an
inch fell in Maud, Texas. Streets in and around Laredo, Texas,
flooded.
   Temperature records up to 87 years old were shattered or tied in
43 cities from Oregon to Florida, with the mercury over 100 degrees
in 25 of those cities.
   It was a sizzling 110 degrees in Valentine, Nev., torching the
record for the date of 99 degrees set in 1917 and tying the
all-time high. Other records included 109 degrees in Huron, S.D.,
(99, 1923); 101 in Minneapolis-St. Paul (99, 1952); and 103 in
Paducah, Ky. (99, 1952).
   Bullhead City, Ariz., had the nation's high with 114 degrees.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from southern Wisconsin to lower Michigan and the eastern Great
Lakes to much of New York and New England, with thunderstorms most
numerous near the Canadian border from New York to Maine; scattered
thunderstorms from Florida and Georgia to the lower Mississippi
Valley and much of Texas, with thunderstorms most numerous along
the central Gulf Coast and southeast Texas; and thunderstorms in
much of the Rockies and parts of California.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 90s to near 100 degrees
over most of the nation; near 105 degrees in parts of Illinois,
Missouri, Kansas, eastern Montana and Utah; near 115 degress in
parts of the desert Southwest; in the 70s and 80s from North
Carolina to New England, with some 60s in Maine and New Hampshire,
and from northern Michigan to Minnesota and in the Pacific
Northwest; and in the 60s and 70s along the Oregon and California
coasts.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 50
degrees at Houlton and Limestone, Maine, and Atlantic City, N.J.,
to 96 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

   A man who allegedly broke into two luxury
apartments, including the home of designer Bill Blass, was caught
as he tried to leave a building with a backpack full of loot,
police said.
   Ronald Miller, 24, of Pennington, N.J., was arrested about 5:45
p.m. Friday and charged with burglary, said Sgt. Maurice Howard, a
police spokesman.
   Miller entered Blass' penthouse on Manhattan's posh East Side by
breaking a window and allegedly stole several items, Howard said.
Blass was not home at the time.
   He then climbed over a fence to the roof of the next building,
and entered an apartment there, removing money and jewelry, Howard
said.
   The man then moved over to another apartment, where a resident
heard the commotion and called the doorman, who called police.
   Miller's backpack contained jewelry, foreign currency and silver
dollars, Howard said, apparently all taken from the second
apartment.

<HEAD>Fiji Deports New Zealand Lawyer For Chiefs, Alleged Gun Smugglers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A lawyer arrived home today after
he was expelled by Fiji as he tried to represent chiefs charged
with plotting to form a new government and other men accused of gun
smuggling.
   Attorney Christopher Harder, 39, was deported from the South
Pacific island of Fiji and flown to Auckland about 1,300 miles to
the south. He said he had been held by the Fijian military for
three days.
   He went to the archipelago to represent eight chiefs from the
island of Rotuma charged with plotting to break away from the
central government. Sources in Rotuma said men had plotted in May
to declare Rotuma's secession from Fiji, a British colony until
1970.
   Harder also intended to act as attorney for five men of Indian
descent charged after the discovery of Soviet-made weapons on Fiji
earlier this month.
   He said he had arrived Monday and attempted the next day to
arrange a meeting with Fijian military leader Lt. Col. Sitiveni
Rabuka. But his calls went unanswered, he said.
   On Wednesday morning, he said two plain-clothes security men
arrested him at his hotel and drove him to the army barracks. He
said he was not mistreated by authorities.
   Harder did not say whether he had been given an explanation for
his detention and deportation.
   However, he was arrested after he wrote a letter to the local
judiciary objecting to a new security decree that affected his
clients.
   The measures, imposed Wednesday, allow mandatory life
imprisonment for arms smuggling, detention without trial for up to
four years, sweeping powers of arrest and search, and restriction
of freedom of expression.
   New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange on Friday attacked the
measures, saying Fiji had become the South Pacific's first police
state.
   There has been unrest among the majority Indian population of
Fiji following two coups carried out last year by Rabuka, an ethnic
Fijian who said he intended to ensure the rights of his people.
   Ethnic Fijians are outnumbered by Indians in the 715,000
population of the island nation.
   The five men whom Harder wanted to represent are among 21
Fijians of Indian descent, some businessmen, charged after the
weapons _ including hand grenades, machine guns and missile

the cache was part of a plan to overthrow Fiji's government by

<TEXT>
   A man who has been arrested 11 times on
drunken driving charges since 1978 was sentenced to jail for the
first time _ for reckless driving.
   Traffic Court Judge Louis Trent on Thursday revoked Gary Roth's
probation from a reckless driving conviction on April 12 and
ordered him to serve 90 days in jail.
   Roth, 33, had been given a 90-day suspended sentence after the
city attorney's office agreed to allow him to plead guilty to a
reduced charge of reckless driving. He was arrested Feb. 2 on
charges of driving while intoxicated.
   Prosecutors said they did not take Roth to court on the earlier
DWI charge because Roth had refused to take any breath or field
sobriety tests, leaving prosecutors with insufficient evidence.
   Roth's lawyer had assured the court that his client would place
himself in an institution for drug rehabilitation as a condition of
the reckless driving conviction. But testimony Thursday indicated
Roth had failed to do so.
   Since 1978, Roth has been arrested 11 times for DWI but has been
convicted only once following a 1982 accident on the Seabrook
Bridge in which two people were injured.
   He also faces trial on DWI charges stemming from arrests on May
17 and June 6.

   A 6-year-old rust-colored dog named Rosie
got plaques and flowers and all the dog biscuits she could eat
after being honored by the American Humane Association for saving
the life of her owner.
   ``She thinks it's some kind of big party,'' said owner Marie
Murphy, who has been paralyzed from the neck down since a 1953
polio attack and depends on an iron lung to breath.
   Murphy, 58, was sleeping in an iron lung when a power failure on
March 27 shut down the machine and the auxillary generator failed
to kick in. With the electricity out, Murphy was unable to get help.
   ``I realized the only thing I had was Rosie,'' she said Friday.
   Rosie, who was sleeping one room away, heard her owner's calls
for help and barked until Murphy's brother-in-law, asleep upstairs,
came down and connected batteries to the iron lung.
   ``It doesn't sound like the most unusual, heroic thing the world
has ever seen,'' said M. Christie Smith, executive director of the
Robert Potter League for Animals, which nominated Rosie for the
honor. ``But she doesn't bark on command. There was something that
night, the sound of the machine stopping, the panic in Marie's
voice.''
   Rosie was honored in a ceremony Thursday at the Potter Leaque,
the Middletown animal shelther where she had been adopted by Murphy
four years ago.
   The dog, a Doberman-Labrador cross, wore a garland of flowers
and sat quietly next to Murphy's bed during the ceremony.
   ``Formally, she's trained to do nothing,'' Murphy said. ``Even
when you say `bark' to her now, she won't do it.''
   ``We've had so much fun together over the years,'' Murphy said.
``I just love her a lot, and I think I appreciate her a lot more
than I did before.''

   Delegates returned to U.S.-mediated talks
today in an effort to bridge deep differences over how to achieve
peace in southern Africa.
   The delegates from South Africa, Angola, Cuba and the United
States faced widely divergent proposals presented in Friday's
opening session, conference sources said.
   The participants are seeking a formula for ending a 13-year
civil war in Angola and ushering in independence to South-West
Africa, or Namibia.
   The leading Cairo newspaper Al-Ahram reported today that the
Cubans offered to withdraw their troops from Angola over four
years, but that the South Africans wanted a pullout in eight months.
   The South Africans and the joint Angolan-Cuban delegation
consulted separately Friday night with Chester Crocker, the U.S.
assistant secretary of state for African affairs. Crocker is acting
as mediator.
   In keeping with a news blackout imposed Friday, the sources said
nothing about whether Crocker's consultations brought the positions
closer for today's second and final day of negotiations. Two
previous rounds of peace talks, in London and Brazzaville, Congo,
failed to achieve settlements last month.
   The conference sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said today's one-hour morning session was meant to enable the
opposing sides to reply formally to each other's proposals. The
delegates also agreed to hold an afternoon meeting.
   South African Foreign Minister R.F. ``Pik'' Botha told reporters
after the morning session: ``We had good, excellent talks.'' But
under the blackout, he and other delegates refused to discuss
substance.
   Botha told reporters Friday that his government was insisting on
Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola as a prerequisite for Namibian
independence.
   At the negotiating table on Friday, Botha demanded that Cuba set
a date for pulling out its more than 50,000 troops from Angola, the
conference sources said.
   South African sources have spoken of a reciprocal military
buildup near the border between Namibia and Angola, with the Cubans
deploying 15,000-17,000 troops and South Africa calling up reserves.
   Angola is demanding an end to South African military and
logistical support for Angolan rebels of UNITA, the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola. UNITA, which has been
fighting the Marxist central government in Luanda, also obtains
arms from the United States.
   In 1978, the United Nations revoked South Africa's League of
Nations mandate in Namibia and called on the Pretoria government to
relinquish the territory. The resolution also provided that Namibia
be put under U.N. trusteeship pending independence.

   Outspoken playwright Harvey Fierstein says that
although he has lost many friends to AIDS, the epidemic has had
some positive fallout.
   ``First, no one can deny any more how many of us there are,''
said Fierstein in the August issue of Playboy. In addition, ``a lot
of gay people are being more supportive of one another than ever
before.''
   Fierstein, who won Tony awards for ``Torch Song Trilogy'' and
``La Cage Aux Folles,'' was scheduled to be among the speakers
today at the unfolding of the New York AIDS Memorial Quilt in
Central Park as part of Gay Pride Weekend.
   ``When you have AIDS, you don't simply have a disease like
cancer,'' Fierstein, a homosexual whose works deal with gay life,
said in the interview. ``To start with ... you're part of a media
event. When you have AIDS, you also have everything that comes with
it ... every nasty, filthy lie that is told about homosexuals.''
   Fierstein, who stars with Matthew Broderick and Anne Bancroft in
the movie version of ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' to be released this
year, said he would like to see more people talking about AIDS,
particularly leaders in the minority community, which also has been
hard hit.
   ``They're not out there educating,'' he said. ``They're very
happy to lay the problem on gays, because everybody knows we're
somebody to kick around.''

<TEXT>
   Two candidates vied for the presidency
of Iceland in today's election and opinion polls predicted a
landslide victory for incumbent Vigdis Finnbogadottir.
   Some of the 170,000 eligible voters on this sparsely populated
island cast ballots shortly after polls opened at 9 a.m. (5 a.m.
EDT). Polls close at 11 p.m. (7 p.m. EDT), with results expected
one hour later.
   The presidency is largely ceremonial. Real power rests with the
prime minister, Thorsteinn Palsson.
   The challenger, 46-year-old housewife Sigrun Thorsteinsdottir,
captured eve-of-election headlines when her Friday afternoon rally
in the Icelandic capital was disrupted by a bomb scare.
   Police said they received an anonymous telephone call claiming
that a bomb had been planted in Laekjartorg, the main square in
downtown Reykjavik, where about 100 supporters and spectators had
gathered. Police searched the square but no bomb was found.
   Recent opinion polls suggest Mrs. Thorsteinsdottir will secure
less than 3 percent of the vote.
   Ms. Finnbogadottir, 57, is campaigning for a third four-year
term. She defeated three male candidates in 1980 to become the
North Atlantic island's fourth president and the world's first
female state president. In 1984, she won automatic re-election when
no rivals registered.
   Today's election marks the first time an incumbent president has
faced a re-election challenge since this nation of 243,000 became a
republic in 1944.
   Mrs. Thorsteinsdottir is a member of the anti-establishment
Humanist Party, which has so far failed to win a seat in the
63-seat Althing, or parliament.
   She has challenged Ms. Finnbogadottir's role as a figurehead
president with traditionally limited powers, arguing that the
constitution apportions far greater power on the presidency than
commonly supposed.
   But constitutional experts say that although the president has
power to introduce bills to the legislature, form governments and
subject proposed legislation to a plebiscite, the constitution
makes clear that the prime minister and the Cabinet are solely
responsible for all government action.
   All the major political party leaders have expressed support for
the status quo and some have ventured to suggest that Mrs.
Thorsteinsdottir's campaign is based on ignorance of the
constitution.
   Icelandic women have in recent years begun to carve out a larger
slice of political power. The left-wing Women's Alliance _ which
made history in 1983 when it became the first feminist movement in
the world to win parliamentary seats _ doubled its tally to six
seats in last year's general election.
   The Reykjavik daily newspaper Morgunbladid recently published a
poll showing the opposition Women's Alliance equal with the
Independence Party, with each enjoying the support of about 30
percent of the electorate.
   The Independence Party is the country's largest political party
and a dominant force in the three-party coalition government,

<HEAD>Treatment for Hypertension Could Increase Heart Attack Risk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Medication sometimes prescribed to lower high
blood pressure in younger patients paradoxically may increase the
risk of heart attack by harming blood fat levels, researchers say.
   High blood pressure can be accompanied by abnormal blood fat
levels that, left undetected and untreated, could pose a greater
danger than hypertension, Dr. Roger R. Williams of the University
of Utah said Friday.
   Two types of drugs commonly used to treat hypertension _
diuretics and beta blockers _ often adversely affect the
relationship among the three blood fats: high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol or ``good'' cholesterol; triglycerides; and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol or ``bad'' cholesterol, he said.
   The three are the components of total blood cholesterol.
Cholesterol is manufactured by the body and necessary for building
cells, making hormones and helping digestion. But in excess, it is
a contributor to fatty build-up in blood vessels that can lead to
heart attacks.
   High blood pressure, which afflicts about 20 percent of all U.S.
adults, is a leading cause of heart attack and stroke.
   But by giving hypertensive patients with abnormal blood fat
levels diuretics and beta blockers, doctors may be further knocking
the proportion among the three blood fats out of line and
contributing to the risk of heart attack, the researcher said.
   ``The level of abnormality of lipids puts them at much greater
risk of heart attack than high blood pressure,'' said Williams,
director of the university's Cardiovascular Genetics Research
Clinic.
   ``The point is that doctors are getting their (patients') high
blood pressure treated, but their underlying lipid (blood fat)
abnormalities are not being treated,'' he said.
   Williams and fellow researchers found high levels of bad
cholesterol and triglycerides and low levels of good cholesterol in
many of the subjects they studied while they were looking for
inherited factors in high blood pressure.
   The team reported its findings in Friday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Their study used sets of siblings diagnosed with high blood
pressure, all of whom had received treatment before the age of 60.
Of a total of 131 subjects, 69 had abnormalities in cholesterol and
triglyceride levels in addition to their high blood pressure.
   But only three of those 69 were getting treated for the blood
fat abnormalities, Williams said.
   ``Unfortunately, that's not surprising,'' said Dr. R.W. Wissler,
a noted cardiovascular pathologist at the University of Chicago.
   ``It's only been a few years since doctors learned about any
relationship between anti-hypertensives and the lipids, and it is
just now being reported in more detail,'' he said. ``Things
sometimes build up slowly in medicine, which makes it all the more
important that this be given more attention.''

   Workers chipping away at old floor tiles in the
hallway of a suburban high school sent clouds of dust containing
cancer-causing asbestos into the air, federal officials charged.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lodged a complaint and
proposed a $5,000 fine against Thornton Township High School in
Harvey, a spokeswoman said Friday. It is the first complaint the
EPA has brought under new asbestos-safety rules that went into
effect in December.
   The complaint says students and other school personnel were
exposed to asbestos fibers during the improper removal of 6,400
square feet of hallway flooring.
   ``We had received several calls from teachers and students and
actually the workers in the school that the tile was being removed
in the hallway and clouds of dust were being raised, and they were
very concerned about it,'' said EPA spokeswoman Nancy Sullivan.
   School officials have until July 11 to respond to the complaint,
which names Thornton High School District 205. The school was
closed Friday afternoon, and officials could not be reached for
comment.
   The violations were discovered during an EPA inspection March 1,
and the school immediately discontinued the flooring removal
project at the agency's request, the EPA said.
   Asbestos, a mineral that has been used in building materials,
can cause lung cancer and other disorders when airborne fibers
enter the body.
   When the tile was removed in February, school officials did not
initially know that it contained asbestos, Ms. Sullivan said.
Later, officials had the tile tested and the presence of asbestos
was confirmed, she said.
   Workers who were not accredited by the government to remove
asbestos ``had sanded, chipped and cut the tiles, releasing clouds
of dust containing asbestos,'' the EPA said in a news release.
   The complaint against Thornton is the EPA's first enforcement
action nationwide under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act,
the agency said.
   Under the law, which took effect Dec. 14, specific safety
measures must be taken when removing asbestos from elementary and
secondary schools.
   If they decide to contest the complaint, school officials can
seek an informal hearing with EPA officials in Chicago or request a
hearing before a federal administrative law judge, Ms. Sullivan
said.

   A bomb ripped apart a three-story
hotel in the center of the old city, killing 13 people and wounding
four others, police said.
   Police said four of the dead were Afghan nationals.
   Abdul Ahmed Khan, assistant inspector of crimes, said the blast
was set off by an 11-pound explosive device. It tore through the
second and third floors of the hotel after sunrise, as Moslems were
finishing their morning prayers.
   The hotel ``collapsed just like a sandwich,'' Khan said.
   He said two people died on the way to the hospital after
surviving nine hours beneath the rubble.
   Among the dead were an Afghan woman and her 3-year-old child who
had come to Peshawar for medical treatment, according to Omar Amer,
a Pakistani journalist.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast,
but police said they suspected agents of Afghanistan's communist
government.
   ``Previously, they have committed all these things,'' Khan said,
referring to dozens of terrorist bombings over the past two years
in Pakistan. Hundreds of Pakistanis and Afghan refugees have died
in the blasts.
   Pakistan backs Moslem insurgents fighting the Afghan government,
which is backed by Soviet forces who are withdrawing after an
eight-year involvement in Afghanistan's civil war. Peshawar, 30
miles from the Afghan border, is headquarters of the seven-party
guerrilla alliance.
   On Friday, small explosive devices went off outside the
headquarters of two of the rebel groups but there were no serious
injuries, Khan said.
   Until Friday, Khan said, Peshawar had been enjoying a respite
from terrorist bombings, which had become almost a weekly occurence
prior to the signing of the April 14 Geneva accord on the Soviet
withdrawal.

   Principal Joe Clark, who roams the halls
of Eastside High School with a baseball bat and bullhorn, traded
his instruments of discipline for rhetoric in his commencement
address to 405 graduating seniors.
   As nearly 1,000 friends, relatives and students crowded onto an
athletic field for Eastside's 102nd graduation Friday, Clark
described the pain of poverty he experienced as youth in Newark and
how it motivated him.
   ``Regardless of the vicissitudes, regardless of the
difficulties, I declare that this little brat welfare boy from
Newark was not going to give up and he was going to go to the
pinnacle of success,'' Clark said.
   Clark, who in the past few months has appeared on the cover of
Time magazine, received a job offer from the White House and
inspired an upcoming Hollywood movie about his tough ways, struck a
chord with the departing seniors.
   ``I'm going to miss him,'' said Diedra M. Bethea, 17, who plans
to study chemistry at Trenton State College. ``He's just like a
father to me.''
   Clark has been credited with bringing law and order to a rowdy
inner-city school and was held up as an example of a tough urban
educator by the Reagan administration.
   He banned underachieving students, chained doors shut to
drug-dealers and strode the halls with a bullhorn and baseball bat.
   But the Paterson school board considered disciplinary action
against Clark for kicking out more than 60 students without going
through proper procedures, though it eventually dropped its effort.
Even the movie film crew's presence at the school drew controversy.
   ``We learned something from it,'' said Erving Ruiz, 18,
referring to the disputes. ``You have to go to battle sometimes.''
   The principal lauded the students and told them the success of
Paterson rests in their hands.
   ``We have pricked the conscience of a nation and we have shown,
if nothing more, that black and Hispanic students in inner cities
can behave properly,'' Clark said.
   Several parents at the graduation praised the principal.
   ``He's put the school back on its feet,'' said Larry Smith, who
graduated from Eastside two decades ago and whose daughter,
LaVetta, will attend Penn State in the fall to study engineering.

   Arab protesters clashed with Israeli soldiers
outside a West Bank mosque and pelted a police van with stones in
Arab east Jerusalem, witnesses said. Police arrested nine people
and closed two Arab schools.
   In the occupied West Bank town of Nablus, a Palestinian youth
was wounded in the leg when troops opened fire to disperse
stone-throwers in the casbah, or Arab marketplace, the army said.
The youth was not identified.
   The clash followed Friday's incident in which a Jewish settler
fired on Palestinians who stoned his car in Nablus, wounding seven
people.
   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, soldiers fired tear gas and
rubber bullets to disperse about 200 Moslem fundamentalists who
protested after a meeting at a nearby mosque, Israeli witnesses
said. No injuries were reported.
   In east Jerusalem, dozens of police vehicles and policemen in
riot gear, some carrying tear gas launchers, patrolled the streets
and stood guard at the entrances to the walled Old City.
   Israel radio reported that nine Palestinians were detained after
the scattered stone-throwing incidents in east Jerusalem. Several
youths hurled stones at a police van and a private car, but there
were no injuries.
   Also today, police closed two Arab private schools. Jerusalem
police spokesman Rafi Levy said the closure followed stone-throwing
attacks on police in which students took part.
   Police have linked renewed tension in Jerusalem to the latest
leaflet put out by underground leaders of the 6{-month Arab
uprising. The leaflet called on the Arabs to intensify protests in
Jerusalem and challenge Israeli rule of the city. Israel captured
the eastern part of Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   On Friday, angry Jewish settlers demanded the mass expulsion of
Palestinians and blamed the army for failing to protect them after
an American-born settler was stabbed in the back by a Palestinian.
   ``We must throw out a couple of thousand Arabs,'' said Elyakim
Haetzni, a right-wing Israeli lawyer and West Bank settler.
``Israel can't dry the swamp by swatting a mosquito or two.''
   Yohan Chaikeh, a computer programmer from Boston who now lives
in the West Bank city of Hebron, was attacked Friday while shopping
before the Jewish Sabbath in the city's Arab marketplace. He
suffered stab wounds in the shoulder and lower back.
   Chaikeh, 33, pulled out his gun, chased his assailant about 50
yards and shot him in the elbow, said Zeev Hever, a Jewish leader
in Hebron, about 20 miles south of Jerusalem. About 200 Israelis
live among the city's 80,000 Arabs.
   He was reported later in stable condition at Jerusalem's
Hadassah Hospital.
   Chaiken's assailant was also said to be in stable condition at
Hebron's Alia hospital. He was identified as Abdel Majid Sharawneh,
22, from the nearby village of Dura.
   The stabbing marked the second serious attack on an Israeli in
less than a week. On Sunday, an Israeli farmer was stabbed and
bludgeoned to death, bringing to four the number of Israelis killed
since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8. So far, 211 Palestinians have
died.
   The army immediately closed Hebron to traffic and clamped a
curfew on the marketplace area.
   Chaiken, who emigrated to Israel four years ago, was identified
by Israel televison as an activist of American-born Rabbi Meir
Kahane's anti-Arab Kach Party.
   In other violence Friday, an Israeli couple opened fire on young
Palestinians who stoned their car in Nablus. Israel television
filmed the incident and later showed the bearded settler firing at
the Arabs.
   Officials at the city's Al Ittihad Hospital said seven Arabs,
including two 8-year-old boys, were hit by bullets, all in the arms
or legs.
   An army spokesman said the settler's car was stoned outside the
central Mazuz Masri mosque after noon prayers. The settler got out
and fired an Uzi submachine gun, and his female companion fired as
well, the spokesman said.

   A man claiming to suffer from amnesia, who
was arrested on murder charges after a newspaper publicized his
plight, now says he remembers his real name.
   ``I am Mr. Peabody. I remembered,'' Robert Peabody said outside
a New Bedford, Mass., courtroom Thursday after he was turned over
to Newport detectives for transfer to Rhode Island.
   When asked when he remembered his real name and how much else he
recalled, Peabody said, ``I don't have any other comment.'' His
attorney, John Coyne, also wouldn't comment.
   Peabody was arraigned in Newport District Court on Friday in
connection with the death last month of William Capuano, 34, in a
Newport inn where both men had been staying. Judge Paul Del Nero
ordered Peabody held until a July 5 bail hearing.
   Peabody was found at a highway rest stop near Bourne, Mass., May
30 with razor cuts on his arm. He gave his name as Robert
Christopher Anderson, told of being born in California in 1944 but
said he didn't remember his more recent past.
   A story about ``Anderson'' published in the New Bedford
Standard-Times on June 18 led police to investigate and resulted in
Peabody's arrest Wednesday.
   Capuano's bullet-ridden body was found wrapped in green garbage
bags in Peabody's room at a Newport inn May 31. Police said he had
been dead at least 24 hours.
   Police issued a warrant for Peabody's arrest soon afterward but
didn't realize he was the man found in Massachusetts until seeing
the news story and photograph.
   Peabody told the newspaper that he was born July 5, 1944, in
Fairfield, Calif., putting his age at 43. Police say he is 49 and
has lived in the Newport area most of his life.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today paid tribute to
Jewish and other victims of Austria's most notorious Nazi
concentration camp, saying ``their suffering was a gift to the
world.''
   The Roman Catholic leader spoke after Jewish leaders criticized
his formal speech the day before during a visit to the site of the
former Mauthausen camp, where thousands of Jews were among the
110,000 inmates who perished. The speech omitted any specific
reference to Jews.
   The criticism prompted Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro to tell
reporters today that the pontiff had no intention of slighting the
Jews. Navarro said the pontiff mentioned the Jews who died at
Mauthausen during a brief stop at a memorial plaque set up in their
memory.
   John Paul spoke before 80,000 people today in the town of Lorch,
just 25 miles from the Czechoslovak border, on the third day of his
visit to Austria.
   ``Not far from here is Mauthausen, where Christians, Jews and
others were persecuted for many reasons, including their
religion,'' the pope said, referring to his visit to the
concentration camp site.
   He continued: ``Their suffering was a gift to the world.''
   John Paul has been using the current, five-day Austria trip to
discuss various aspects of the Nazi past. The country is marking
the 50th anniversary year of its annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938.
   After his arrival Thursday, the pontiff, despite protests of
some Jewish leaders, met with controversial President Kurt
Waldheim. The Austrian president has faced allegations of
complicity in Nazi war crimes but has denied wrongdoing.
   On Friday, Waldheim received Holy Communion from the pontiff
during an outdoor Mass for 80,000 people in the town of Trausdorf
near the border with Hungary.
   In Lorch, John Paul also addressed the concerns of workers and
farmers in the area. Many of the farmers in the far northern region
are having trouble staying in business, often forced to take second
jobs to make ends meet.
   ``The church stands by you when you have social and economic
problems,'' the white-robed pontiff said during the outdoor prayer
service.
   John Paul frequently has called for respect for workers' rights
and warned about the potential dangers of unbridled,
profit-motivated capitalism.
   The Polish-born pontiff set off a wave of Jewish protest Friday
when he failed to mention Jews during the Mauthausen speech.
   ``The failure of Pope John Paul to make any specific reference
to the suffering of the Jews while visiting the site of the
infamous Mauthausen concentration camp is a matter of deep shock to
the Jewish community,'' said World Jewish Congress executive
director Elan Steinberg.
   ``This, together with the pope's unwillingness to confront Kurt
Waldheim over his Nazi past or address the historical complicity of
Austria in the crimes of Hitler's Germany, are failures that
constitute a tragic lost moral opportunity,'' Steinberg added in a
statement from New York.
   Also faulting the pontiff on Friday was Austria's chief rabbi
Chaim Eisenberg, who leads the country's 12,000 Jews.
   On Friday while at Mauthausen, the pontiff cited only four
concentration camp victims by name, all of them Catholics. However,
he stopped in silence for nearly a minute at a plaque set up in
memory of the Jewish victims.
   Navarro said the pope, standing beside a camp survivor in front
of the plaque, spoke of the Jews and said ``never again'' three
times.
   Navarro said the survivor was supposed to have been wearing a
tiny microphone so that the pope's words could have been heard but
that for some reason officials had removed the device.

   A security guard apparently frustrated
with his job shot six workers at a water purification equipment
company, killing two and leaving one in critical condition, police
said.
   Sebron Flenaugh, 45, of Wells Security Services, was arrested
without incident at a house in Oakland, about 25 miles west of
here, three hours after the shootings Friday evening, according to
Concord Police Lt. Jim Jennings.
   He said Flenaugh would be booked for investigation of murder and
five counts of assault with a deadly weapon.
   Several employees of Micropure said they heard Flenaugh say,
``This is a lousy job'' or ``This is a crummy job,'' as he moved
through the one-story building gunning down terrified workers.
   ``Everybody was screaming and running,'' said Germaine Reyes,
17, who was in the shipping room when the gunfire broke out. ``I
hit the ground and went under the table.''
   Employees said Flenaugh, who was not supposed to be armed on
duty, ``seemed depressed during the past couple of days (but the
employees knew) of nothing to indicate why,'' according to Jennings.
   The gunman entered the Micropure building about 6:30 p.m. Friday
from a rear parking lot, walked onto the loading dock, and suddenly
opened fire on employees, said Jennings.
   Three employees were wounded on the dock before the attacker
entered the lunch room and shot two more people. A sixth person was
shot just outside the room.
   One of the victims, Jennifer Hollis, 17, of Martinez, died about
11 p.m. Friday from wounds to the abdomen and chest, said Sandra
Ryan at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek. Jim Disney, 19,
of Concord, who was hit in the stomach, died at 4 a.m., the
hospital said.
   Three other victims were seriously injured, and one of those was
listed in critical condition early today. The sixth victim suffered
a superficial wound on the back.
   Three victims were taken to John Muir Medical Center in this
community about 25 miles east of San Francisco, Ms. Ryan said. The
others were taken to nearby Mount Diablo Hospital.
   Flenaugh had worked for the last 18 months as a guard at
Micropure, a distributor of water treatment equipment for household
use. Employees described him as congenial but added that he was
often serious, and declined invitations to go out.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis have agreed
to overhaul Democratic Party rules for 1992, eliminating provisions
that Jackson said prevented him from getting as many delegates as
he deserved, a Dukakis spokesman said today.
   The changes include cutting the number of super delegates by
nearly half, and requiring that all other delegates in all states
be awarded to presidential candidates in proportion to the votes
they receive.
   The agreement between the two campaigns virtually assures that
the proposed changes would be ratified by the party's national
convention in Atlanta next month.
   Dukakis campaign spokesman Tad Devine said that the
Massachusetts governor would have won the nomination even if those
proposed rules were in place this year.
   ``The reason that Mike Dukakis is the nominee of the party is he
was the overwhelming choice of the voters,'' said Devine, who is in
charge of delegate selection for Dukakis' presidential campaign.
   Jackson had complained that the rules which allowed party
leaders and elected officials to hold automatic seats as national
convention super delegates were unfair. Of the 643 super delegates
to the convention, Dukakis is supported by 362 while Jackson has
just 55, according to The Associated Press delegate count.
   In addition, Jackson said that some states which hold direct
election of delegates and others which weight the process toward
the overall winner do not hand out delegates fairly. The proposed
changes would require all of the states to adopt rules that would
award delegates proportionally.
   If adopted by the rules committee and ratified by the national
convention, the rules would take effect in 1992.
   Devine said that the agreement between the two campaigns was
reached after several days of negotiations. He said it represented
compromise on both sides.

   Almost one-third of Yugoslavia's
labor force may lose their jobs as a result of the government's
economic austerity program, a trade union leader was quoted as
saying today.
   Dusan Koceljevic made the statement during a session of a
government commission which is preparing economic reforms, the
Belgrade daily Politika reported.
   The government earlier this month began an economic austerity
program to ease Yugoslavia's 170 percent inflation rate and its $21
billion foreign and to steer the country toward a more open market.
   The government also linked wages and employment to the currently
low industrial productivity. As a result, wage cuts of up to 30
percent have been enforced under the new measure.
   ``Because of the restructuring of the economy, 2 million workers
will lose their jobs,'' Koceljevic was quoted as saying.
   About 1.1 million Yugoslavs are unemployed, out of a labor force
of 6.6 million.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan hailed his final economic
summit as a triumph for his long-held, free-market philosophy, but
in one key respect his current policy is radically different from
the early days of his administration.
   The president who once was content to sit idly by while the
dollar soared in value has become an active meddler in currency
markets _ anathema in the early days of Reagonomics. Then the cry
was: ``Let the markets decide'' the fair exchange value of the
dollar, left untouched by government.
   But the final economic communique issued after the Toronto
summit by the leaders of the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britian, France, Italy and Canada brags that their policy of joint
intervention has been a success and should be continued.
   Intervention is the process by which countries buy and sell
currencies on the open market in an effort to influence their price.
   Reagan and his first Treasury secretary, Donald T. Regan,
disdained such actions during the president's first term,
contending that the dollar's surge in value during those years was
a sign of economic strength.
   The administration turned a deaf ear to pleas from American
manufacturers and farmers who contended that they were being
battered by an over-valued dollar which had made their goods
uncompetitive on world markets.
   At the dollar's highest point in February 1985, Reagan replied
that the greenback's strength ``wasn't a problem. It was a
blessing,'' demonstrating how attractive the United States was to
foreign investors.
   Critics contended that this hands-off policy was eroding
America's industrial base and bringing on record trade deficits as
American manufacturers and farmers were priced out of more and more
foreign markets.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who replaced Regan in
early 1985, decided that with protectionist forces gaining the
upper hand in Congress, it was time for a new approach.
   The change turned out to be a surprise announcement by the
United States and its major allies in September 1985 at the Plaza
Hotel in New York that they would jointly intervene in currency
markets to drive the dollar lower in an effort to make American
products competitive once again.
   ``The administration changed views quite radically because of
the near-recession in certain sectors of the economy in late 1984
and 1985,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
``They went to work to fix the problems in trade, manufacturing and
farming.''
   Since that time, the dollar has fallen by 50 percent against the
Japanese yen and German mark and by somewhat smaller margins
against other currencies.
   The effort began to pay off in the middle of 1986 as U.S.
exports in volume terms started improving even though the trade
deficit in dollar terms continued to worsen because the weaker
dollar made imports more expensive.
   But after posting a record deficit of $170.3 billion in 1987,
the deficit for the first four months of this year has declined
sharply to an annual rate of $141.8 billion.
   With that improvement has come a surge in the U.S. growth rate,
as manufacturing companies have been busy hiring to meet the
increased export demands.
   In February 1987, the summit nations switched from a policy of
trying to drive the dollar lower to one of stabilizing the dollar
for fear that any further decline would threaten a resurgence of
inflation in the United States and frighten away the foreign
investors the country has come to depend on.
   For most of last year that effort was a failure as market forces
continued to push the dollar lower. The dollar's continued decline
forced the Federal Reserve to step in and tighten interest rates to
prevent a surge in inflation. This combination of a weak currency
and rising interest rates has been blamed in a part for the October
stock market collapse.
   The market crash, raising fears of a global recession, convinced
the summit countries of the critical need for stronger efforts at
stabilizing the dollar's value. They issued a Dec. 22 communique
pledging closer cooperation and that, so far, has done the trick.
   In the Toronto economic communique, the countries repeated their
pledge for close economic coordination, building on commitments
made at the Tokyo summit in 1986 and the Venice summit last year.
   Baker said he believed the coordination process has proved so
successful that it would last long after Reagan was out of office.
   But some critics are not so sure, contending that policy
squabbles are inevitable when dealing with sovereign nations.
   ``The notion of coordination is something we keep talking about,
but it doesn't really exist. No country is willing to be lectured
to by the other side,'' said George Perry, an economist at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
   ``What we really have is a heavy open-mouth policy (on the part
of government officials) providing guidance to the markets and that
has been backed up by intervention.''
   Perry said that this fragile arrangement can come apart at any
time with the resultant discord jolting markets as it did last
October.
   But President Reagan and the other world leaders concluded their
gathering on a more upbeat note, praising the ``strengthened ties
of solidarity, both political and economic,'' between them.

<TEXT>
   A Beirut magazine reported today that the
Iranian government hopes to influence the U.S. presidential
elections by releasing British hostages close to the Nov. 8 vote.
   The weekly Ash-Shiraa reported that the agreement to release the
hostages emerged during a three-day unofficial visit by four
British legislators to Iran that ended Wednesday.
   ``Reliable Moslem fundamentalist circles have confirmed that
British-Iranian negotiations to free British hostages held in
Lebanon will result (in their release) on the eve of the American
presidential elections,'' the report said.
   The magazine gained international fame when it broke the story
of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in return for releasing American
hostages in 1986. The magazine's more recent reports on hostage
developments have proved inaccurate.
   The four British legislators returned to London Wednesday saying
Iranian officials offered to use their influence to release the
three British captives in Lebanon.
   Ash-Shiraa said the ``Iranian leadersip was seeking to postpone
the release until late summer so that it will be the biggest voter
in the coming American presidential elections.''
   Ash-Shiraa said the Iranian move of postponing the release
``aims at besieging and embarrassing the official American stand
(of the Reagan administration)'' for failing to obtain the release
of American hostages.
   The United States and Britain had agreed not to negotiate for
the hostages' release. However, France ``negotiated with Iran for
the release of French hostages and that was achieved'' the report
said.
   French diplomats Marcel Fontaine and Marcel Carton as well as
journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann were released in Beirut May 4.
   Britain's foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, on Thursday
denied that Britain was negotiating for the release of Anglican
Church envoy Terry Waite, journalist John McCarthy and teacher
Brian Keenan.
   No group has claimed responsibility for abducting Waite and
McCarthy, although they are widely believed held by fanatic Shiite
Moslem kidnappers affiliated with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
   The magazine report compared the anticipated release to that of
of 52 Americans held hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran for 444
days. They were released on inauguration day as president Jimmy
Carter left office.
   ``The aim of the delay was to bring Carter down and the hostages
were only released after a new president (President Reagan) took
over'' the magazine article concluded.
   In all, 18 foreigners are missing and believed kidnapped in
Lebanon, including nine Americans. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   A cartoon in the Toronto Star captured the scene:
with dynamite bulging out of her purse, a smiling Margaret Thatcher
marches away from the Canadian Parliament as an explosion blows the
top off the building.
   Such was the impact of the British prime minister's
characteristically forthright expression of conservative views last
week in a speech to a joint session of Parliament.
   Not since French President Charles De Gaulle intervened in the
Quebec separatist debate in 1967 by declaring ``Vive le Quebec
Libre!'' (Long live a free Quebec) has a foreign leader stirred so
much controversy.
   Fresh from the Toronto Economic Summit, Mrs. Thatcher was in
Ottawa for talks with Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
and to accept an invitation to address Parliament.
   A standing ovation greeted her, but Mrs. Thatcher quickly
angered opposition parties by endorsing Mulroney's Free Trade
Agreement with the United States and his decision to buy a $6.6
billion fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.
   Both the main opposition Liberal Party and the socialist New
Democratic Party were outraged, and a furious exchange erupted two
hours later during Commons question period.
   ``What right does she have to come here and meddle in Canadian
affairs?'' New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent shouted.
   Liberal leader John Turner asked if Mulroney had vetted
Thatcher's remarks, they were so partisan.
   ``We are no longer a colony of Great Britain and we do not want
to become a colony of the United States,'' Turner said.
   Both opposition parties say they will tear up the trade deal and
cancel the submarine program if they win the next election, which
Mulroney may call as early as this fall. The New Democrats also
want to take Canada out of the NATO alliance.
   Mrs. Thatcher paid special tribute to Canada's contribution to
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, including its decision to
permit tests of U.S. cruise missiles and bolster its navy with
nuclear-powered subs.
   She also took a broad swipe at the ``the debilitating concept of
the all-powerful state'' before embracing the Canada-U.S. Free
Trade Agreement, which would dismantle trade barriers over a
10-year period.
   The Liberals and New Democrats say the deal sacrifices
independence and threatens to make Canada the 51st state of the
union.
   ``On the basis of Britain's experience of joining the European
Community, you need have no fear that Canada's national personality
will be in any way diminished,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   ``Fifteen years of EC membership have left our people no less
British and no less proud of their history and independence.
Moreover, protectionism is not a life belt which keeps an economy
afloat; it is a millstone that drags you down and penalizes
consumers and work force alike.''
   Liberal Lloyd Axworthy likened Mrs. Thatcher's intervention to a
Canadian prime minister telling the British what to do about
Northern Ireland.
   In defense of Mrs. Thatcher, Deputy Prime Minister Don
Mazankowski called the opposition ``whiners and complainers.''
   Ironically, there were no protests a week earlier when West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl addressed the same chamber and, in a
more general way, endorsed both the Free Trade Agreement and
Canada's contribution to NATO.
   Sensitivities were much greater toward Mrs. Thatcher, since it
was only in 1981 that Canada repatriated its Constitution from
Britain and since Queen Elizabeth II remains Canada's head of state.
   The opposition suggested that Mrs. Thatcher may have been trying
to butter up Mulroney in hopes he will opt for the British
Trafalgar-class submarine over its French rival, the Rubis-Amethyst.
   By week's end, furor over the speech had turned to humor.
Toronto columnist Gary Lautens offered Mrs. Thatcher some advice on
a few problems of her own.
   He suggested a two-year sabbatical for composer Andrew Lloyd
Webber, of ``Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Cats'' fame, ``so
somebody else can have a chance to write a musical.'' Lautens also
asked Mrs. Thatcher to ban the use of incomprehensible British
expressions such as ``lift'' (elevator), ``tube'' (subway train)
and ``bonnet'' (car hood).
   ``While I'm at it,'' Lautens added, ``send some Brits to this
country immediately so we can teach them how to make a good
hamburg, not one of those Wimpy things.''

   Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson took steps today to avoid a
contentious debate over Democratic Party rules, as party officials
met to draft a platform that Dukakis will stand on in the fall.
   The two Democratic presidential rivals reached an agreement to
eliminate beginning in 1992 provisions that Jackson said prevented
him from getting as many delegates as he deserved, according to
Dukakis spokesman, Tad Devine.
   The new rules, being worked on by party officials in Washington,
are now virtually assured of ratification by the party's national
convention in Atlanta next month. They would cut the number of
super delegates by nearly half, and require that all other
delegates in all other states be awarded in proportion to votes
they receive.
   Meanwhile, in Denver, the party's platform panel is taking up a
preliminary draft document pledging that Democrats would ``restore
competence, caring and incorruptibility to the federal executive
branch and get it working again fairly for all Americans.''
   Dukakis was vacationing today in Massachusetts. On Friday, he
said Bill Bradley appears uninterested in being the one to run for
the No. 2 spot on the ticket. And he was attacked by Republican
George Bush, who said, ``we don't need more taxes, we need a
president who can hold the line against congressional
overspending.''
   Jackson, who was in Puerto Rico today, has complained that his
delegate total this year does not reflect his strength at the polls.
   Devine said that the Massachusetts governor would have won the
nomination even if those proposed rules were in place this year.
   ``The reason that Mike Dukakis is the nominee of the party is he
was the overwhelming choice of the voters,'' said Devine, who is in
charge of delegate selection for Dukakis' presidential campaign.
   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas and Christian broadcaster
Pat Robertson, whipped by Bush in the battle for the delegates who
will pick the Republican presidential nominee in New Orleans in
mid-August, praised the vice president at a party unity rally
Friday in Cincinnati.
   ``The Republican Party is united and we are not about to see the
country go for a mediocre liberal like Michael Dukakis,'' said
Robertson. ``I'd accept the nomination but it's already gone,''
quipped Dole.
   Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. said today that
Bush ``is the candidate of safe change.''
   ``God help us if Michael Dukakis wins. He is the candiate of
radical and dangerous change,'' Haig said.
   Dukakis said Thursday he supports $115 million in new taxes to
``make sure the state's fiscal base is solid and strong,''
announcing he would sign a $40 million cigarette levy and favored
raising another $75 million by bringing the state's tax code into
line with federal tax law changes.
   In Cincinnati on Friday, Bush attacked Dukakis on the tax issue,
saying: ``I will not raise your taxes, period. He just has, in his
home state.'' At a news conference, Bush said Dukakis ``refuses to
rule out a tax hike for the nation. We know what that means.''
   Asked if he would rule out all forms of tax increases, even
excise taxes, Bush said he would, but would not extend that pledge
to ``user fees'' such as those charged for entering national parks.
   Bush said he had a ``plain as day'' difference with Dukakis,
``tax cuts vs. tax hikes,'' and added he is not concerned his stand
would lock him in if he is elected. ``I think it's reassuring to
the working men and women in this country,'' Bush said.
   At the unity rally, Bush said: ``I promise you I'll not raise
taxes as a first, second or last resort. ... We don't need more
taxes, we need a president who can hold the line against
congressional overspending.''
   Back in Massachusetts, Dukakis opened a four-day vacation on
Nantucket Island and said Friday that it appears Bradley, a senator
from New Jersey, isn't interested in joining the Democratic ticket
as the vice presidential candidate.
   ``We haven't talked personally about it,'' said Dukakis. ``He's
somebody I have a lot of respect for.'' Dukakis said Bradley
apparently told Paul Brountas, a senior adviser leading Dukakis'
search for a vice presidential candidate, that he wasn't interested
in the vice presidential slot.
   ``I respect that,'' Dukakis said.
   ``In any event, we're going to keep in touch,'' he added.
   Dukakis also said that Jackson, reported by The Boston Globe to
have said privately he would turn down the vice presidential
nomination, had not sent any such word to the Dukakis campaign and
``I don't know anything about'' that published report.
   In San Juan, Puerto Rico, Jackson denied on Friday he had told
aides he would reject the vice presidential spot on the Dukakis
ticket. Asked about the report quoting unidentified aides as saying
he would turn it down, Jackson responded: ``No, absolutely not.
Therefore, whoever was talking was not authorized, but also was not
dealing in the truth.''
   Said Jackson: ``The matter of the vice presidency is a serious
matter. The destiny of our nation, perhaps the rest of the world,
rests on the campaign in July and in November. To that extent,
there will be no intrigue about that decision.''
   Jackson also said Friday that he has picked up eight of Puerto
Rico's 57 delegates to the Democratic convention, and his campaign
said he wants at least 17. Jackson had won a March 20 ``beauty
contest'' primary in Puerto Rico but the entire delegation had
voiced support for Dukakis for the presidential nomination.
   In Denver, a 16-member drafting panel unanimously approved a
preliminary version of the proposed Democratic platform Friday, in
advance of today's meeting of the 186-member Platform Committee.
   Some differences still divided the Dukakis and Jackson camps but
campaign staffs said they were continuing their negotiations.
   The preliminary document avoids discussion of higher taxes, a
freeze on Pentagon spending or a Palestinian homeland. It urges
``more stable defense budgets,'' calls for appointing a drug czar,
and says South Africa is a terrorist state. Without mentioning
abortion, it endorses ``freedom of reproductive choice.''

<HEAD>Key Defense Lawmakers Get Millions from Contractors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense contractors under investigation in
the Pentagon procurement case have poured millions of dollars into
the pockets and campaign treasuries of members of Congress, legally
doing on Capitol Hill what would be crimes elsewhere in official
Washington.
   The principal beneficiaries are the lawmakers who make crucial
decisions about Pentagon spending and procurement priorities
through their memberships on the House and Senate armed services
committees and defense appropriations subcommittees.
   Last year, 37 of the 101 members who serve on the four military
committees reported receiving about $137,100 in speaking fees from
defense contractors publicly linked to the Pentagon probe.
   All but $10,000 went to the House side of the Capitol, with 33
members _ Democrats and Republicans alike _ averaging $3,852 each
in so-called honoraria.
   The Associated Press surveyed the 1987 financial disclosure
statements of committee members and campaign contribution reports
filed with the Federal Election Commission for the 1988, 1986 and
1984 elections.
   The reports were filed by political action committees maintained
by six of the defense contractors who have been searched under
warrant issued in the massive probe of alleged Pentagon procurement
fraud and bribery.
   They are McDonnell Douglas, the nation's No. 1 defense
contractor; Litton Industries; United Technologies-Pratt & Whitney;
Northrop; Cubic Corp. and Hazeltine Corp.
   The survey hit only the tip of the iceberg. The companies tied
so far to the probe are part of a huge defense industry, with
dozens of other firms routinely making campaign contributions and
paying honoraria to members of Congress.
   Congressional leaders said last week that they had been told by
the chief prosecutor, Henry Hudson, that no lawmakers were targets
of the 2-year-old investigation or had had their records seized by
the FBI.
   Speaking fees are legal on Capitol Hill, but they are forbidden
by law among executive branch officials. Senators can pocket up to
$35,800 a year in such outside income, House members up to $26,850.
   The destination of the speaking fees _ often accompanied by free
trips for lawmakers and their spouses to defense plants and resorts
_ tells a lot about where the real power of the Pentagon purse lies
on Capitol Hill.
   Twenty-two of the 52 members of House Armed Services Committee
reported getting speaking fees from the surveyed defense
contractors. This panel sets broad policy and authorizes items like
weapons systems.
   But a new tank is worthless unless there is money to build it,
and that money on the House side of the Capitol comes from the
smallest military panel in Congress, the 11-member House defense
appropriations subcommittee headed by Rep. William Chappell, D-Fla.
   Last year, Chappell and eight colleagues on the subcommittee
reported getting $46,250 _ an average of $5,138 apiece _ from
contractors tied to the investigation.
   Chappell may head the committee, but he wasn't the favorite
speaker among the contractors with subpoenaed records. That was
Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., who said he collected $8,000 for four
appearances. Chappell reported $4,000.
   Others on the subcommittee getting money from the surveyed
contractors included Reps. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, $7,000; Les
AuCoin, D-Ore., $6,250; Bob Livingston, D-La., $6,000; and Bill
Young, R-Fla., $6,000.
   Young's disclosure statement illustrated a practice among
defense contractors, who may fight each other for Pentagon jobs but
can cooperate when it comes to taking a lawmaker on a grand tour.
   Between Jan. 12 and Jan. 16, 1987, nine ontractors _ seven of
them not named in the probe _ shared the costs of flying, housing
and feeding Young for a trip that included visits to facilities in
California and Texas.
   For nine speeches in the five-day stretch, Young picked up
$13,000 in honoraria, according to his disclosure statement.
   Speaking fees are small change for defense contractors compared
to what they pour into campaign treasuries.
   In the last three election cycles, nearly $3 million was spent
on all candidates by political action committees representing six
of the companies linked to the Pentagon investigation, according to
FEC reports.
   Nearly half of this money _ 47 percent _ was channeled to
members of the four military committees. Members of these panels
received average contributions of $1,293, compared to an average of
$961 for lawmakers not on the military committees.
   The biggest spread was in 1983-4 by Northrop's PAC: an average
of $2,014 for members of military committees, $876 for non-members.
   Again, the defense appropriations subcommittees were favored PAC
targets. The average contribution to a lawmaker on these panels was
$1,866.
   House defense appropriations was all-but blanketed with PAC
money, with funds usually going to eight or more of the 11 members.
For the 18-member Senate counterpart, no PAC gave to more than
eight members in the same election cycle.
   A PAC can give a candidate up to $10,000 in each two-year
election cycle. The survey found three instances: Northrop's PAC to
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., in 1984 and United Technologies-Pratt &
Whitney's PAC to Warner and Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the same
year.
   Military committee members consistently getting
higher-than-average PAC contributions included Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif.; Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.; Murtha; Chappell; Rep. Roy
Dyson, D-Md.; and Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala.
   Two lawmakers on Armed Services committees _ Sen. Lawton Chiles,
D-Fla., and Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. _ took neither honoraria
nor PAC money from the defense contractors identified with the
investigation, the records showed.

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Ziad Abed got engaged,
he was looking forward to the music and dancing of a lavish
Palestinian wedding. But the Arab uprising changed that, and he
married in a simple ceremony last month.
   ``I didn't think it was the right time for dancing and music
when Palestinians are being killed and wounded,'' said Abed, a
26-year-old school bus driver from Bethlehem.
   The 6{-month-old uprising has radically changed the lives of all
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, not just
those directly involved in confrontations with Israel.
   ``The uprising has had a great impact on our social and economic
structures,'' said Saib Erakat, a political science professor at
the West Bank's An-Najah University. ``The old traditions are
fading away.''
   Palestinians say their communities, once dominated by religious
leaders and wealthy merchants, are now run by young activists, many
from poor backgrounds.
   ``Today you are not judged by how rich or famous you are, you
are judged by how active you are in the uprising,'' said Amjad
Sarawi, 26, an activist and unemployed laborer from the Dheishe
refugee camp near Bethlehem.
   The uprising also has affected daily routines.
   Fatima Musa, 47, of Dheishe, said she used to go shopping every
Saturday, but now she has to wait for PLO leaflets announcing
commercial strikes before she can make out her shopping list.
   ``The uprising created a new daily life,'' Mrs. Musa, a mother
of seven, said while peeling potatoes in her sparsely furnished
living room. ``We have a different strike day every week, and that
means I can't have a steady schedule.''
   Because of widespread strikes and curfews, many families have
organized car pools with their neighbors to do the shopping. Others
are stocking up on basic food items.
   Ata Moghrabi, 62, a retired laborer, keeps two bags each of
sugar, rice and flour in his garage. ``We don't know what is
awaiting us tomorrow,'' Moghrabi said.
   Since the start of the uprising, money has become tight and
Palestinians only buy essentials.
   Many young women no longer wear makeup, some as an expression of
mourning for the more than 200 Palestinians killed in the uprising.
   Others put away their lipstick after being threatened by young
militants. In Bethlehem last month, two masked youths approached
two teen-age girls in the city's central market and ordered them to
wipe off their makeup as a sign of respect for the uprising. The
terrified girls complied.
   The uprising has also put an end to most entertainment. Many
movie theaters and restaurants are closed, and the traditional
Saturday night parties have been canceled.
   Abed's wedding last month was a subdued affair in which the
newlyweds' closest relatives briefly stopped by for soft drinks and
cake after the ceremony.
   It was a far cry from traditional weddings, a cornerstone of
Palestinian social life, in which hundreds of relatives and friends
are served elaborate meals and are entertained by bands.
   Abed said a man identifying himself only as a Palestinian
nationalist called a few days before the ceremony and demanded that
it be kept simple, without music or dancing.
   ``I warn you, and if you don't follow these instructions, you'll
regret it,'' Abed quoted the caller as saying.
   Abed said he was not angered by the threat and that he had
already decided on a simple ceremony as a sign of respect for those
mourning relatives killed in the uprising.
   Another newlywed, Khalil Abu Akar, 27, welcomed the changes,
saying they had saved him a lot of money.
   Abu Akar said he spent $3,500 on his May wedding and his wife's
dowry, compared with the $15,000 his brother Muayed, a 25-year-old
mechanic, paid when he got married a year ago.
   ``Thanks to the glorious uprising, today you can get married
without having to buy your bride,'' said Abu Akar, a junior high
school teacher in Dheishe.
   The uprising has not only affected private lives but also has
overhauled the structure of Palestinian society, said Erakat.
   So-called popular committees run by young Palestinians have
replaced traditional community leaders, such as village elders,
Moslem preachers and wealthy businessmen.
   The committees have organized food distribution to the needy,
first aid to those hurt in clashes with soldiers and night patrols
alerting residents to possible army raids.
   Young organizers also enforce commercial strikes and summon
residents to participate in marches and demonstrations.
   ``The committees are replacing the old authority,'' said Sarawi,
who heads a committee organizing aid to families whose members have
been killed, wounded or imprisoned.
   Yusef Salah, 22, a popular committee member in the village of El
Khader near Bethlehem, said the changes were not temporary.
   ``We are a born-again people,'' he said. ``We think differently
and we behave differently.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Looks Good Now, But Support Is Soft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, enjoying an early lead over
George Bush in their presidential duel, owes much of his success
among mainstream voters to the liberal challenge posed during the
Democratic primaries by Jesse Jackson, according to an analysis of
primary-season polls.
   ABC News pollsters who have been tracking the 1988 race say it
would be a mistake for the Democrats to pop their champagne corks
since voters know little about the Massachusetts governor and their
opinions are still loosely held. In fact, voters say they also know
little about Bush.
   Four in 10 of those surveyed last month could not locate
Democrat Dukakis or Republican Bush on the ideological spectrum.
   ``Everything about this race would suggest a close one despite
Dukakis' current lead _ because his support is soft,'' said Jeff
Alderman, director of the network's polling unit. He notes the
percentage who say they don't know enough about Dukakis is nearly
twice that of Bush.
   Jackson has helped, rather than hurt, Dukakis by ``unwittingly
acting as a lightning rod for all of the liberal bogey men the GOP
customarily uses to scare the electorate about the Democrats,''
said John Brennan of ABC.
   Jackson beat Dukakis among all liberal primary voters, but his
outspoken brand of liberalism made Dukakis look all the more
moderate. The Massachusetts governor won overwhelmingly among
moderates and conservatives, ABC found.
   ABC's poll from May 19-25 gave Dukakis 53 percent support from
registered voters to Bush's 40 percent. The margin of error for the
survey's 1,172 registered voters was plus or minus 3.5 percentage
points.
   The Iran-Contra affair continues to dog Bush, with a majority of
the public still doubting that he is telling the truth in the
scandal, ABC said. The legal problems of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III and other administration woes are also taking their toll,
ABC found, and many Americans seem ready for a change.
   What is most puzzling to the pollsters, however, is the public's
negative perception of the economy, which could spell problems for
Bush in November. About 42 percent see the economy on a downward
trend, even though it has been performing better than anticipated
after last fall's stock market collapse.
   ``There's a direct correlation between who you're going to vote
for and your view of the economy,'' says Alderman. ``The
administration seems to have done everything it possibly could to
goose the economy along ... But we do not have a majority saying
the economy is in good shape.''
   ABC says Bush won his primary race by taking advantage of a
strong organization in the weeks before the multi-state Super
Tuesday primaries.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas matched Bush in fame and money, and
enjoyed a burst of momentum from his opening-day victory in Iowa.
But, says ABC polling analyst Kelly Hanley, Bush benefited from the
fact that Republicans still had positive feelings about Ronald
Reagan.
   ``Huge majorities of voters wanted to stick with the course
Reagan had set, and those people voted for Bush,'' Hanley said.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis outpaced his rivals with a
clever strategy of conceding some losses in the South while
concentrating on the more cosmopolitan Southern states, including
delegrate-rich Texas and Florida. He steamrolled through his
Northeastern home turf, weathered defeats in Illinois and Michigan
and rebounded to clinch the nomination.
   ABC polls showed that Dukakis drew strength from Hispanics, Jews
and whites in general. And while opponents criticized his lack of
foreign policy experience, ABC polls showed that primary voters
cared little about the issue.
   Dukakis now appears to be running strongly among Jackson's black
constituents. While Jackson captured 90 percent of the black
primary vote, registered blacks chose Dukakis over Bush by 80
percent to 12 percent in ABC's May poll. Only 6 percent said they
wouldn't vote if Dukakis were the nominee.
   In the May survey, Dukakis outpolled Bush on personal qualities
like whether he ``cares about people,'' is honest, gets things
done, has a vision for the future, can be trusted in a crisis and
is an able leader. But Bush was perceived as more experienced.
   The Massachusetts governor was seen as more able to help the
disenfranchised, keep the United States out of a war and reduce the
deficit. Bush was perceived as better at keeping a strong national
defense.
   Sixty-four percent of Americans had a favorable impression of
Dukakis, compared with 50 percent for Bush. Only 11 percent had an
unfavorable impression of Dukakis, compared with 35 percent for
Bush.
   ``Dukakis may be getting his biggest boost from disaffection wih
the Reagan administration in general and Bush in specific,'' said
Brennan.
   Bush is having trouble assembling the same coalition of
conservatives and disaffected Democrats who twice gave Reagan big
victories, ABC found.
   He is holding on to his core Republican supporters, but they
make up only a quarter of the likely electorate. He is losing the
independent vote and is weak among the Democrats who defected to
Reagan in 1984.
   Surprisingly, a third of those identifying themselves as
conservatives said they support Dukakis, as do 43 percent of white
born-again Christians. Dukakis gets two-thirds of the registered
women voters, a fact that alone explains his lead in the horserace.
   All this does not necessarily pre-ordain a Dukakis victory, says
Alderman, who believes that Dukakis' high May favorable rating is a
peak.
   ``Until the final couple of weeks, the public doesn't focus on
the race that intensely,'' he says. ``So there's plenty of room for
change.''

   Rescue workers aided by search dogs fanned
out over this rain-soaked village today, trying to unearth about
100 people buried by a landslide. Officials said there was little
chance of finding survivors.
   ``I am nearly sure that no one will come out alive,'' said
Wolfgang Krctschemer, head of a 32-member West German volunteer
team from the Rescue Dog Association.
   ``There's very little space for air pockets here, between the
soft earth and the rocks, where someone trapped could breathe. But
we have to go on looking,'' added Klaus Kolter, another member of
the German team.
   Rescue efforts resumed at sunrise today. The search had been
called off during the night after geologists and engineers spotted
cracks in the mountain that could trigger another devastating slide.
   Krctschemer said the rescue workers had located the spot where
the landslide had buried a coffeehouse crowded with breakfast-time
customers on Thursday.
   He said they were trying to reach the coffeehouse by digging
holes from two sides. He said rescuers should be able to unearth
some bodies from the site later in the day.
   Villagers said about 30 travelers were in the restaurant at the
time of the disaster and dozens more were at the roadside waiting
for bulldozers to clear the highway after an earlier rockfall.
   Three West German tourists and 41 Turks were listed as missing.
There were also unconfirmed reports by witnesses that two British
tourists had been in the coffeehouse, but it could not be
determined whether they had been buried in the landslide or had
left before the disaster.
   Trabzon Gov. Enver Hizlan said there probably would be delay in
listing other names because the people involved were in transit.
   Rescue efforts were hindered by new slides that swept clouds of
dust into the air and sent giant boulders hurtling down the wooded
mountainside. A Turkish truck driver and a villager were injured in
separate rockfalls on Friday.
   Another landslide hit an area about three miles away from Catak
today, closing the main highway. No injuries were reported.
   Grieving relatives watched the rescue works, occasionally
kneeling over a hole and looking down with empty eyes.
   ``Do you think anyone can come out alive from there?'' asked
Necati Himtas, whose 20-year-old son was missing.
   A woman wailing and weeping was taken to the mobile hospital
when she fainted.
   Catak, home to 1,000 people, is situated 19 miles from the Black
Sea port of Trabzon on a main highway leading to eastern Anatolia
and Iran.
   The two-lane highway was widened three years ago to handle
increasing truck and tourist traffic, but vilagers said it was not
buttressed properly.
   ``The retaining walls weren't big enough and we started having
landslides, not big ones but enough to block the road,'' said Riza
Yavuz, the village headman.
   Yavuz said the coffeehouse owner had told public works officials
earlier this month that the hillside needed more support or it
would collapse.
   Erkan Omarbeyoglou, Turkey's director of highways, warned that
new cracks had appeared on the same stretch of mountainside,
suggesting another section could be dislodged.
   ``There's a risk that an entire hilltop could come crashing down
in the same area,'' Omarbeyoglou said. He said rescue workers would
have enough warning to evacuate the area.
   The landslide Thursday also destroyed a restaurant, 20 homes and
a high school closed for summer vacation. A stream burst its banks
and flooded another part of the village, including several houses.
   ``I saw a telegraph pole slowly bending over,'' said Gaby
Engler, a 28-year-old West German nurse, who witnessed the slide.
``I heard a noise like an explosion and the whole hillside came
away in front of me.''

   A junior high school art teacher has been
ordered to publish an apology and his picture in a newspaper as
part of his sentence for sexually abusing a teen-age boy.
   Bruce Allen, 38, also was ordered to serve 30 days in jail and
60 days under house arrest after he was given a one-year suspended
jail sentence Friday. Malheur County Circuit Judge Frank J. Yraguen
placed Allen on probation for five years.
   ``The public in general has a right to be outraged,'' Yraguen
told Allen.
   Allen earlier pleaded guilty to first-degree sexual abuse
involving a 14-year-old male student at Ontario Junior High School.
   Mike Purcell, deputy district attorney, said there had been a
pattern of accusations against Allen during his 17 years in the
Ontario School District, but school officials generally just
transferred complaining students out of his class.
   Allen will not be allowed to teach during his probation,
according to his attorney, J. Burdett Pratt. The state teachers
licensing board also could decide to revoke Allen's teaching
certificate completely.
   The house arrest will be enforced through an electronic device
around Allen's wrist or ankle that will automatically alert
authorities if he leaves his house without permission.

   A waitress at a beachfront
restaurant today spotted a bomb and led scores of patrons to safety
moments before the device exploded, police said.
   The explosion occurred shortly after midnight at the Papagallo
restaurant on East London's seaside esplanade.
   The bomb, a Soviet-made limpet mine, was discovered by a
waitress who alerted the manager, police said. Police arrived,
evacuated about 90 diners and were in the process of evacuating
people from neighboring hotels when the bomb exploded, less than 20
minutes after it had been seen.
   ``It was a close shave,'' said Maj. Trevor Hayes, a police
spokesman.
   The interior of the restaurant was extensively damaged. No
injuries or arrests were reported.
   There have been more than 20 bombings in South Africa this year,
and police have blamed the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement.
   The group has neither claimed nor denied responsibility for
specific recent bombings but has said it seeks to intensify its
attacks.
   The guerrillas are fighting the South Africa government and its
system of apartheid, which does not permit the 26 million black
majority to vote and racially segregates schools, districts and
health services.

<HEAD>Economists: Summiteers Didn't Do Much To Prevent Market
Instability</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Reagan-Reversal Bjt</HEAD>

   Leaders at the Toronto summit congratulated
themselves on forging an economy able to withstand last year's
stock market crash, but economists agree they did little that could
prevent future instability.
   ``I think they announced in advance that they weren't going to
accomplish anything, and therefore they fulfilled all
expectations,'' said Robert Kleimann, an expert on economic summits
with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
   ``It was a summit of little consequence in terms of the overall
debt and budget problems that we face,'' said Jeff Bergner, a
fellow with the Hudson Institute, a moderate-to-conservative think
tank based in Indianapolis.
   President Reagan and other leaders at the seven-nation summit
painted a somewhat rosier picture.
   ``I know many people question the summit process,'' Reagan told
the Business Table of Chief Executive Officers Wednesday night
after his return from his 14th and last economic summit meeting.
``What do the summits do? Are they just so much sound and fury?''
   ``Well, not on your life,'' he answered himself. ``Today, all
year round, the summit countries are working more closely together
than ever before and the summits are a key reason why. One payoff
is that last October, when the world markets began to shake, the
international economy stayed steady. Working together, we guided
the world ship through the storm.''
   In their final communique, the leaders of the United States,
Canada, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Japan said that
since last year's meeting in Venice ``our economies have kept up
the momentum of growth'' and were still expanding.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said that ``the very
clear message that goes out from Toronto is one of confidence
coupled with a commitment to build on and reinforce our success.''
   Even the chairman of Reagan's own Council of Economic Advisers,
Beryl Sprinkel, however, gave only a modest assessment of the
summit gains in a post-summit interview.
   Asked if the summiteers had made any concrete progress toward
their objectives, Sprinkel said, ``If this were the only summit
that were ever held, or ever had been held, I'd say, `Yes, a lot.'
But it builds incrementally on prior summits.''
   ``We are not at the end of the process,'' Sprinkel added.
``There is a lot more to be done.''
   For instance, he said, marginal tax rate cuts being proposed by
West Germany ``seemed very small to me.''
   As for the United States, he said, ``We are happy that the
budget deficit seems to be on a downward trend and the trade
deficit is coming down. But you don't want to look only at trends;
you need to check levels, and they are still unsatisfactorily
high.''
   Robert Z. Lawrence, senior fellow in economic studies with the
liberal Brookings Institution, said, ``No attention has really been
focused on the financial markets and little on the potential
sources of underlying instability, which basically are related to
the U.S. budget deficit. And since they kind of all took it as
given that the president wasn't going to do anything on that one,
they really couldn't get an American commitment on that one, it
wasn't worth talking about.''
   ``It doesn't mean to say they won't be back about that
question,'' he said, when they meet again in France with a new U.S.
president in office in 1989.

<HEAD>Judge May Reconsider Refusal To Halt USAir Overtime Boycott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge who refused to order USAir
flight attendants to halt an apparent overtime boycott says he may
change his mind should the boycott continue.
   U.S. District Judge William L. Standish on Friday said he found
no clear proof that the Association of Flight Attendants encouraged
the boycott, which stranded 11,000 passengers during the Memorial
Day weekend. He denied the airline's request for a preliminary
injunction, for lack of firm evidence against the union.
   Still, Standish said, he has a ``strong suspicion'' of union
involvement. If the job action continues, he said, he would grant a
request for an immediate hearing to reconsider his decision.
   The airline said it lost an estimated $1.1 million as a result
of having to cancel 179 flights because of inadequate staffing
during the three-day holiday.
   ``We are pleased that the court put the Association of Flight
Attendants on notice,'' said airline spokesman David Shipley. ``As
a result, we expect no future scheduled disruptions.''
   Under their union contract, flight attendants can be ordered to
fly only 85 hours per month. Attendants can turn down assignments
after they have reached 85 hours in a month. USAir relies on
attendants to volunteer for overtime to keep planes in the air on
the waning days of each month.
   Dee Maki, chief union representative for the Pittsburgh-based
flight attendants group, said she has ``no idea'' if the protest
will end.
   But she said only some of the attendants who refused to work
during the Memorial Day holiday were protesting stalled labor
negotiations. Many simply wanted the holiday off, she said.
   Ms. Maki said flight attendants were elated at the judge's
decision. ``They can't believe USAir filed the lawsuit,'' she said.
   She noted that the Independence Day holiday weekend occurs at
the beginning of the month so flight attendants will not be working
on overtime and therefore cannot turn down assignments.
   USAir brought the suit last week amid stalled contract
negotiations with the 1,000 flight attendants of Pacific Southwest
Airlines, which merged with USAir in April.
   Federal law forbids airline workers to launch job actions or
strikes before mediation and arbitration procedures are exhausted.

<HEAD>Protesters Battle Police Over Land Near Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters hurled stones at West Berlin police
early today during a clash over a disputed piece of land near the
Berlin Wall, authorities said. Police used tear gas and water
canons to break up the demonstration.
   Police said one officer was injured when he was struck in the
head by a rock.
   The so-called ``Lenne Triangle'' _ about 10 acres of land
adjacent to the Berlin Wall _ has been the scene of frequent
skirmishes between police and environmental activists, who occupied
the area on May 26 to protest plans for construction of a road
through the area.
   The activists are against the road project because it would go
through a wooded area.
   The property, which 150 protesters continue to occupy, currently
belongs to East Berlin, but will be turned over to West Berlin in
July.
   West Berlin police, who cannot legally enter the property, have
fenced it in to keep more protesters from entering. The activists
tried to tear down the barrier, but police drove them back.
   Police said todays clash began after protesters attacked
officers with stones, bottles, Molotov cocktails and flares.
   East German border troops observed the incident from nearby
guard towers along the heavily-fortified wall that divides the
city, which is surrounded by East German territory.

   Police today arrested 14 soccer fans
during violent clashes in downtown Munich before the final of the
European soccer championships, which will pit The Netherlands
against the Soviet Union.
   A Munich police spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said
most of the fans arrested were Dutch. He said a Swiss man and
several West Germans were also in custody after incidents earlier
today.
   Police said those arrested face charges of assault, theft,
resisting arrest and destruction of property.
   Before the clashes, the fans had been drinking heavily in the
city's beer garden district, police said.
   A capacity crowd of 72,000, including 20,000 Dutch fans, is
expected for Saturday's championship game. More than 3,500 police
officers are on duty to try to prevent fan violence.
   A total of more than 800 fans have been arrested as a result of
violence that erupted in many West German cities since the
championship series began June 10.

<HEAD>Top Pentagon Fraud Prosecutor Made His Name Fighting Pornography</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Defense Probe Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney overseeing
the Pentagon fraud probe, made his name fighting pornography, not
corruption. He is known as ``an aggressive sort of guy'' who isn't
averse to publicity.
   At 41, Hudson is looking at perhaps his biggest case, the
investigation into allegations that defense contractors and
consultants bribed Pentagon officials for information to help win
billions of dollars in contracts.
   He prides himself on ``quality prosecutions, and being firm and
fair.'' Others say he is a dogged prosecutor, almost moralistic in
his zeal.
   Hudson is the top federal attorney in northern Virginia, where
the Pentagon is located and where many of the consultants and
contractors being investigated have offices.
   Although there is a special unit in the Justice Department that
tracks down fraud, it appears that the case went to Hudson because
it was too massive for the Justice unit to handle. Also, the unit's
offices were located in northern Virginia, within Hudson's
jurisdiction.
   Just across the Potomac River from the Capitol, the district
traditionally has been a high-profile one for a U.S. attorney
prosecuting federal cases. Hudson and his assistant, Joe Aronica,
will argue the cases for the government if any charges come to
trial.
   ``There's a certain amount of prestige that comes with the turf.
But Henry is an aggressive sort of guy,'' said Robert F. Horan, the
state attorney for Fairfax County in northern Virginia, in an
interview with the Fairfax Journal.
   Hudson took over the federal prosecutor's job in 1986 and
pledged to improve the office's reputed organization problems and
to put a greater emphasis on cases of national significance.
   As a Virginia state prosecutor, he'd earned the reputation of a
``policeman's prosecutor'' with his crackdowns on massage parlors
and adult bookstores, and his efforts to reduce plea bargains and
increase jail sentences.
   Hudson entered the national spotlight two years ago when
Attorney General Edwin Meese III made him chairman of his
pornography commission.
   The panel drew derision from civil liberties groups, as well as
rave reviews from anti-pornography crusaders, with its 1986 report
that asserted that sex crimes can be linked to hard-core
pornography. The panel's stance represented an about-face from the
conclusion of another government commission in 1970 that there was
no evidence of harm from pornography.
   Among other things, Hudson's panel recommended that Congress
force pornography traffickers to forfeit their profits, and that
video pornography producers be prosecuted for prostitution. A
second conviction under obscenity laws would become a felony
guaranteeing at least a year behind bars.
   Hudson argued at the time that the panel should have taken even
more drastic steps.
   ``I would have preferred that our condemnation of materials
directly affecting behavior be couched in more forceful language,
and that our recommendations for enhanced law enforcement,
particularly with respect to violent and degrading materials, be
likewise more pronounced,'' Hudson wrote.
   The American Civil Liberties Union lambasted the panel as
biased, unfair and its arguments ``intellectually indefensible.''
It accused Hudson of advocating ``extreme measures'' while paying
little attention to privacy and First Amendment rights.
   One member of the panel, Ellen Levine, said in an interview this
past week that even though she strongly disagreed with some of
Hudson's opinions, she thinks he'll ``do as as good a job as he can
possibly do'' with the Pentagon probe.
   ``He has a very dogged personality and a very strong sense of
right and wrong,'' said Ms. Levine, editor in chief of Woman's Day
magazine.
   She said that she did not put much stock in reports that the
attorney was a man who loved being in the headlines. ``He was a
very moral man, if not moralistic, and he'll do his duty,'' Ms.
Levine said.

<HEAD>Iraq Says Its Forces Capture Islands</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Recasts throughout to CORRECT spelling of islands to Majnoon,

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iraqi army said today it recaptured the
Majnoon islands in another offensive against Iranian positions
inside Iraq. Iran reported heavy fighting in the area.
   A war communique read over Baghdad Radio said the series of
islands located in the Hawayza marshes near the Iranian border was
completely liberated at noon (4 a.m. EDT).
   The report said the elite Presidential Guards took the islands
while troops from the 3rd army corps ``pushed forward to crush the
enemy and its defenses and guns on lands opposite the islands.''
   Iran has occupied the area, located northeast of Basra and about
270 miles southeast of the capital of Baghdad, since 1984.
   The area lies near the border with Iran, and it was unclear
whether Iraqi forces had pushed into Iranian territory. Iraq, in
seeking a cease-fire in the war, has said its troops would not
enter Iran.
   ``Our forces started their advance at 3:45 a.m. toward Majnoon
Island and its surroundings,'' the official Iraqi news agency said
earlier, quoting a communique from the general command of the Iraqi
armed forces.
   ``The resistance of the enemy deteriorated and collapsed due to
the Iraqi heavy fire,'' added the Iraqi report.
   Iran's Islamic Republic news agency accused Iraq of using
chemical weapons in the attack and said heavy fighting was going on
in the swampland.
   The IRNA report, also monitored in Nicosia, said ``substantial
losses and damage have been inflicted on the Iraqi forces and a
number of them have been captured. Heavy fighting reportedlly
continues in the region.''
   The INA dispatch called the operation, codenamed ``Trust in
God,'' the second phase of the Iraqi push to liberate areas
occupied by Iran along the southern border east of Basra.
   The dispatch compared the battle to the April 16 assault on the
Faw peninsula, which ended two years of Iranian occupation in that
area.
   The nearly 8-year-old war had reached a stalemate before the
Iraqis seized the initiative with their lightening assault on Faw.
   The Iraqi's sudden switch from years of static warfare from
behind their formidable defense lines to aggressive attacking
techniques caught the Iranians off guard.
   In May, the Iraqis struck again, driving the Iranians out of the
bridgehead around Salamchah, also east of Basra, in a 10-hour
battle.
   The latest battle was an assault on Mehran last week by the
National Liberation Army of Iran, a group of Iranian rebels backed
by the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Iran claimed the capture of the border city was the work of
regular Iraqi troops, but both Iraq and the Iranian insurgents
denied the claim. The rebel army, following its usual pattern of
inflicting as much damage on the forces of the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini and then withdrawing, said its forces pulled back across
the Iraqi border on Wednesday.
   The attack on Mehran, 90 miles east of Baghdad, might have been
a diversion to draw Iranian forces away from the southern front
around Majnoon island in preparation for the new Iraqi assault,
according to a Perisan Gulf war analyst who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

<HEAD>Ferreting Out The Truth A Capital Dilemma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's capital had plenty of
attention-grabbers last week _ a juicy Pentagon scandal, Ronald
Reagan's last summit, a new $16 million House of Representatives
phone system that went deaf _ but here's what Washington was really
talking about:
   A fugitive ferret named Fuji, its combative owner, and a
5-year-old boy.
   Not even Carl Rowan's uninvited, underwear swimmer _ the
18-year-old suburban lad shot after taking an unauthorized dip in
the columnist's pool _ could match the continuing drama.
   The ferret's owner, 19-year-old Jennifer Au, was on a weekend
furlough from jail where she spent the week charged with contempt
of court for not telling where Fuji is. The boy, Auston Jacob
Simpson, was nearing the end of a painful series of six rabies
shots.
   The story began June 3 when Auston's grandmother took him to the
Docktor Pet Center in Manassas, Va., a Washington suburb. He
stopped by a cage containing Fuji and two other ferrets. One bit
him. Authorities then sought to kill each of the ferrets and test
their innards for rabies.
   Two of the ferrets were sacrificed _ their heads cut off and
their brains examined by health officials, who found the animals to
have been healthy. But Fuji was spirited away by Miss Au, who
worked in the pet shop.
   In court, charged with concealing the animal, she said she left
the ferret at an abandoned house after making a deal over the
telephone with someone she didn't know to have it picked up. The
anonymous phone contact apparently was made after the biting
incident became known to a group of ferret lovers.
   Miss Au told Circuit Judge Percy Thornton that said she saw the
boy being bitten and that Fuji didn't do it. Moreover, she said,
the ferret had been isolated in a cage for more than a month, and
its continued good health proved it didn't have rabies.
   She said she had tried to comply with the judge's order to
produce the animal by contacting ferret groups, but the judge was
unsympathetic.
   ``You're putting this child at risk,'' Thornton said and found
her in contempt. When she shouted at him, the judge ordered her
jailed for three hours.
   ``I think your priorities are mixed up,'' said Thornton.
   A weekend went by and the ferret still had not been produced.
Thornton ordered Miss Au to jail. ``If it were in this court's
power,'' said the judge, ``I would put you through the same thing
this child is going through.''
   On Thursday, with the ferret still missing, Miss Au appeared
before the judge for a bond hearing and was turned down. On Friday,
Thornton issued the weekend leave and ordered the young woman back
behind bars on Monday.
   Meanwhile, a second person _ a 24-year-old man who was not
publicly identified _ was scheduled to begin the rabies shots after
he said he was bitten by a ferret in the same store.
   The ferret battle was fought not only in court, but in the pages
of the Washington Post.
   An editorial sided with the judge and his hard line. ``It is
truly contemptible that this woman and her confederates have chosen
to put a child through this torture rather than obey a court order
and the dictates of common decency,'' said the Post.
   But in the same issue, writer Henry Mitchell allied himself with
the ferret.
   ``There has to be some reasonable basis for thinking this
particular ferret, despite testimony to the contrary, bit the boy,
and from everything you could read of the case there was no reason
to doubt the woman when she swore it was not her ferret,'' he wrote.
   The ferret story was not the clear winner in the
talk-of-the-town competition. The Rowan-intruder story resurfaced
when authorities decided to charge the uninvited swimmer and the
young woman arrested with him in Rowan's back yard, but not to
charge the columnist for shooting the young man.
   The on-again, off-again phone system in the House was a one-day
sensation, causing impassioned denunciations from congressmen who
found their link to constituents interrupted. And the Pentagon
procurement scandal continued to bubble.
   The week's most telling quote came from Miss Au, when she was
jailed on Monday: ``This is extremely stupid and ridiculous,
needless,'' she said. ``This has gone too far.''

<HEAD>Minority Enrollment In Medical Schools Rose After Bakke, Study
Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bakke Anniversary Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the decade since a Supreme Court decision
in the Allan Bakke case ended the use of enrollment quotas, the
number of minority students admitted to medical school actually
increased in the United States, according to the Association of
American Medical Colleges.
   Robert G. Petersdorf, president of the association, said that in
1978 it was feared that the Bakke decision, which forbids the use
of special consideration in the admission of minorities, would
cause medical schools to enroll even fewer minorities than before.
   ``The opposite proved to be true,'' Petersdorf said.
   In the first enrollment period after the Bakke decision, 40.9
percent of the minority students who applied to medical schools
were admitted, and minority enrollees composed 8.7 percent of
first-year medical school classes.
   Ten years later, Petersdorf said, the medical schools are
admitting 51.7 percent of the minority applicants and they now
represent 10.2 percent of the entering classes.
   ``The Supreme Court decision actually encouraged affirmative
action goals by allowing the use of race and other determinants in
addition to academic achievement as acceptable admissions
criteria,'' Petersdorf said.
   He said that medical schools began affirmative action steps in
1970 and the Bakke decision ``reaffirmed'' them.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators give New York money centers
with troubled overseas loans more leeway than Texas banks hobbled
by declines in oil prices and a deflated real estate market, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat and chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said Saturday.
   ``The result is that domestic borrowers have greater difficulty
acquiring credit than borrowers like Poland,'' Bentsen said in a
letter urging the chiefs of the Federal Reserve Board, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., and the comptroller of the currency to
review their regulatory practices.
   Bentsen said recent data indicate banks must set aside greater
reserves against domestic troubled loans than against troubled
loans to Third World and Eastern Bloc nations.
   ``This favorable treatment by regulators of troubled foreign
loans over domestic loans will crimp credit to domestic
borrowers,'' Bentsen wrote Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, and Robert L. Clarke, comptroller
of the currency.
   ``This is particularly important to areas like Texas whose banks
hold a disproportionate share of troubled domestic loans,'' wrote
Bentsen. As the state attempts to rebuild its economy, it needs a
``robust and healthy banking system able to provide needed credit
to worthy borrowers ranking from small businesses to ranchers and
farmers.''
   FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said he and Seidman had not seen the
letter and could not comment on it. But he said regulators were not
being any more stringent on Texas banks than those elsewhere in the
country.
   Rates for reserves set aside for foreign loans depend on a
variety of factors, including the country, the loan and the bank,
Whitney said.
   Lee Cross, an aide to Clarke, said the comptroller shared
Bentsen's concerns about the problems in the Texas economy and
Texas banks, but he wanted to see the figures on which the
senator's letter was based before commenting further.
   Bentsen said FDIC data indicate that an amount comparable to 51
percent of non-performing domestic loans is being held as loan loss
reserves. But calculations by the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress suggest that ``considerably smaller reserves _ only 24
percent _ are being set aside against troubled loans by banks to
Third World and Eastern Bloc nations,'' he wrote.
   ``I think this is unfair and unequal treatment,'' said Bentsen.
``I would much rather have a loan collateralized by an empty
building in Texas than to depend on the commitments of a foreign
communist country like Poland.''
   Bentsen said he was drafting legislation to correct ``that kind
of slanted treatment, favoring the big money banks in New York,
compared to Texas banks.''
   ``It really hurts not just the banks in Texas, but the borrowers
too, because we don't have sufficient capital _ that means for
small businesses, medium-sized businesses,'' Bentsen said.

   Investigators in the Pentagon bribery probe
videotaped meetings in which Pentagon personnel allegedly took
payoffs from consultants, sources familiar with the two-year
investigation said today.
   The sources said that two key figures in the probe, Victor
Cohen, deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for tactical
systems, and James Gaines, a deputy assistant secretary of the
Navy, appear on some of the videotapes, although they declined to
characterize what those tapes showed.
   NBC News reported Friday night that Cohen would leave the
Pentagon whenever a defense consultant would call, that his
meetings with consultants were recorded and videotaped and that
money changed hands.
   The Washington Post, meanwhile, reported that Cohen, deputy
assistant secretary of the Air Force for tactical systems, is among
those cooperating in the investigation.
   Cohen's attorney, Seymour Glanzer, declined to comment today
about any aspect of the probe when asked about the videotapes of
alleged payoffs to his client and whether his client was
cooperating with the government.
   Gaines also was videotaped at meetings with consultants where
highly confidential documents relating to Pentagon contracts
allegedly changed hands, said the sources.
   Sources close to the case said this week that Gaines is
cooperating in the investigation, but other sources and The Post
said today that while Gaines gave a statement to investigators
earlier, he is not cooperating with prosecutors at this point.
   The consultants shown on the videotapes include Melvyn Paisley,
a former assistant secretary of the Navy whose office was searched
by federal authorities last week in the investigation.
   The secret information could have given the recipients an
advantage in competing for contracts worth billions of dollars.
Between 75 and 100 Pentagon contracts may have been tainted,
according to prosecutor Henry E. Hudson.
   Cohen and Gaines have been temporarily reassigned to other
duties since their offices were searched last week by investigators.
   Gaines' attorney, Michael Schatzow said Friday night he had no
comment on the videotapes, but added: ``I'll just wait and allow
everybody who's been reporting these stories to wait and be
embarrassed later.''
   Paisley's attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella, denounced the leaking
of information on videotaping.
   ``This is just a further example of the government trying their
case in the press rather than waiting for specific allegations to
try in court,'' Barcella said.
   The information on videotapes surfaced as members of Congress
are debating how the government should treat defense contractors
under scrutiny in a wide-ranging probe into whether they bought
information from consultants who got the information from Pentagon
officials they bribed.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee considered legislation
Friday that would have given the government the power to withhold
payments to companies that are under investigation in the Pentagon
probe.
   The proposal was withdrawn after a debate in which one side
argued that no payments should be made on fraudulently obtained
contracts, while the other side insisted that such action would be
premature.
   Meanwhile, a senator said in a television interview that if
corruption was detected in a substantial number of contracts, they
should be renegotiated.
   ``And that's a tough, tough problem, because those contracts are
producing essential goods to our national defense today,'' Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., said on a syndicated television interview show,
``John McLaughlin's One on One.'' Warner is a former Navy secretary.
   The amendment considered by the Appropriations Committee was
offered by Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. He said he was pressing it
to head off measures by Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., that would have affected specific contractors.
   Stevens said his amendment would give the government an option,
short of permanently terminating a contract, to halt payments
temporarily where ``these practices may have caused the government
to be not treated fairly.''
   But other lawmakers argued that the enactment of such a law
would prematurely interfere with the investigation of the scandal
and threaten the jobs of workers at defense contracting firms.
   ``You're going to hurt a lot of innocent people,'' said Sen.
Warren Rudman, R-N.H.
   Stevens withdrew his proposal, saying he might introduce it on
the Senate floor later, after the other lawmakers agreed not to
pursue their more specific provisions.
   He had introduced the language as an amendment to the $282.6
billion fiscal 1989 Department of Defense appropriations bill,
which the committee sent to the full Senate on a voice vote.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, asked about the probe's
status, said he did not know ``whether it will expand at all,''
adding: ``It's at the normal stage of an investigation ... where
you're collecting information, you're analyzing information and
then you're determining what the next steps might be.''
   Elsewhere, Brian C. Elmer, an attorney for United Technologies
Corp. said he has asked U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt to allow
the company to examine a government affidavit supporting a search
warrant that the judge had issued.
   The warrant enabled FBI agents to go through the downtown
Washington office of Eugene Tallia, a vice president for Washington
operations of the company's Pratt & Whitney engine manufacturing
unit. Company lawyers said they wanted to examine the affidavit to
determine whether the search was proper.
   The FBI asserted in the search warrant that Pratt & Whitney
possessed sensitive documents that rival General Electric Co. had
submitted to the Defense Department in competing for hundreds of
millions of dollars in contracts.

<HEAD>Tax Hike, Scandal Makes Tough Week For Usually Lucky Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NANTUCKET, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, who so far has seemed
blessed by that greatest of all political commodities, good luck,
is enjoying a brief island retreat after a week in which events
seemed to be moving against him.
   In the span of a few days last week, the Massachusetts governor
faced the unpleasant task of raising state taxes and saw two
potential scandals burst into view back at the Boston Statehouse.
   The Democratic presidential nominee-to-be came under fresh
attack from his Republican rival. And Jesse Jackson's shifting
comments provided a potentially divisive distraction as Dukakis
sought to focus on the task of selecting a running mate.
   ``It's not a worry,'' Dukakis said when asked about the
potential danger posed by Jackson to the ticket. ``I enjoy this.
It's one of the great jobs of being a chief executive, ... putting
a team together.''
   As Dukakis relaxed on this scenic island off Cape Cod,
Republican rival George Bush already was seizing on his reluctant
endorsement of state tax increases and stepping up his criticism of
the governor's program allowing prison inmates out on furlough.
   Dukakis' decision to sign the state legislature's bill imposing
a 5 percent increase on the tax on cigarettes, producing $40
million in revenues, was one of several moves to shore up a state
budget shortfall.
   ``Taxes are always a last resort,'' Dukakis said in his defense.
   With serious budget problems that already have prompting
spending cuts, Dukakis also is supporting another $75 million in
increases by bringing the Massachusetts tax code in line with
federal tax changes.
   Bush, the certain GOP nominee who lags behind Dukakis by double
digits in most polls, immediately pointed to Dukakis' support for
Massachusetts taxes as evidence he harbors a similar inclination as
a fix for the large federal deficits.
   ``I will not raise your taxes, period. He just has, in his home
state,'' Bush said.
   He was voicing a ``tax cuts versus tax hikes'' theme Democrats
expect to hear more of as Republicans try to appeal to what they
calculate is a national aversion to deal with the deficit by
increasing taxes.
   Dukakis has avoided saying he would support any federal tax
increase if elected president, but he clearly has left the door
open.
   He proposes increased efforts to enforce tax laws, including the
hiring of more federal revenue agents, coupled with spending cuts
and steps to increase revenues by spurring the economy.
   ``If you do all those things and still need additional revenues,
then you have to be willing to go to Congress and ask for it,''
Dukakis said.
   If Dukakis has seemed fortunate as major or potential rivals
dropped aside in his quest for the nomination, he might not have
felt that way Thursday, as he confronted a state deadline on the
tax question, felt Bush's barbs, and faced questions about
allegations of misdeeds in his administration.
   Dukakis and his aides put forward a picture of unconcern over
the disclosure that the FBI was conducting a preliminary
investigation into the state's planned purchase of land for a
prison in the rural town of New Braintree.
   Dukakis denied any wrongdoing, and administration officials
questioned whether political motivations lay behind disclosure.
   The FBI, commenting on a report about the preliminary probe in
The Washington Times, said Dukakis was not the subject of their
inquiry _ but added that it was not yet at a stage where anyone was
a target.
   Some residents of the town have accused Dukakis of cronyism in
his support for purchasing land there for the prison in a deal that
would result in a handsome profit for developers who purchased the
land. Whether Dukakis was acquainted with the developers was a
matter of dispute. One, however, was a contributor to his
presidential campaign.
   Dukakis cited ``executive privilege'' in refusing to release two
documents sought by opponents. They are memos between Dukakis and
his legal counsel just before transactions involving the property.
   An unrelated embarrassment came when the governor's former
education adviser Gerard T. Indelicato was accused of larceny and
forgery related to his state duties. Indelicato previously pleaded
guilty to separate federal charges of fraud and conspiracy.
   ``The criminal charges against Gerard Indelicato are very
serious, more so because they allege a violation of the public
trust,'' Dukakis said.
   Over this series of backyard problems, the specter of Jackson's
potentially devisive interest in the vice presidency loomed.
   Jackson has sent seemingly confusing, conflicting signals over
whether he wants the vice presidency, but it seemed certain he'd
like to be asked _ even though public polls suggest he would be a
drag on the Democratic ticket nationally.
   ``Everybody knows in the last analysis the nominee has to make
that decision, and people accept that ...'' Dukakis said.
``Including Jesse, by the way.''

<HEAD>Support Growing For European `Federal Reserve' Bank</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Creation of a West European central
bank, an idea that gained little currency in the past, is quietly
emerging as a long-range priority of the 12-nation European
Economic Community.
   The prospect of establishing a U.S. Federal Reserve-style
central bank for Western Europe is expected to be a major topic of
discussion at an EEC summit conference starting June 27 in Hanover,
West Germany.
   But decisions to take the first concrete steps toward a
``Eurobank'' to manage a common monetary policy are not likely in
Hanover, analysts say. Many other related questions, such as
harmonizing tax policies in the Common Market, probably will have
to be settled first.
   Norbert Walter, senior economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt,
says establishment of a central bank for Europe probably is still
``a long way off.''
   Some EEC members, such as Britain, don't like the idea. They
think it would force them to surrender too much national control.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has not even heeded her EEC
partners' urgings to include Britain in the European Monetary
System, which was created in 1979 to keep European currency values
stable.
   Yet talk of a European currency union is becoming more serious
than just a year ago, when the idea _ which has been discussed off
and on for more than two decades _ was generally dismissed as a
pipe dream.
   ``It is not just utopia, it is not nirvana. It is something that
can be accepted in the Europe of today,'' Walter said in a
telephone interview.
   Many European leaders have come to believe that the EEC's plan
for creating a true common market by 1992 _ one that allows goods,
people and money to freely cross national borders _ increases the
need for a European central bank to cope with less rigid capital
markets.
   This feeling has been reinforced by a June 13 agreement by
European finance ministers to remove national controls on capital
movements by July 1990 in the eight most advanced EEC countries.
The agreement excludes the four countries that have joined the EEC
since 1973 _ Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal.
   Spain and Ireland were given a deadline of 1992; Greece and
Portugal have until 1995.
   Gerhard Stoltenberg, the West German finance minister, hailed
the accord as ``a milestone of great importance'' on the path to
unifying the European market and increasing the EEC's global
competitiveness.
   At the Hanover summit, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is
expected to propose that a special panel of central bank officials
and other experts from EEC countries be set up to study the central
bank issue.
   ``This is a topic that is clearly gaining pace,'' said Richard
Reid, senior European economist at the London-based investment firm
Philips and Drew.
   The eventual structure of a European central bank is far from
clear, but one idea is to model it after the U.S. Federal Reserve,
with regional representatives and independently appointed governors.
   Kohl is a strong supporter of establishing a true European
monetary union, with a central bank as the linchpin, but the
independent Bundesbank, or German central bank, has been cool to
the idea.
   ``The vision of a European union is most certainly closely bound
with that of a European currency union,'' Kohl told a recent
Frankfurt conference.
   Even though one of the original aims of the EEC was to create an
economic and monetary union, all the member nations still have
their own currencies and set their own policies on interest rates
and money supply.
   An embryonic regional currency, known as the European currency
unit, or Ecu, has been in use since 1979, but mainly as an
accounting device. The Ecu does not exist as a hard currency in
bank notes or coins, except for a special issue of Ecu coins last
year by Belgium to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding
of the EEC.
   The Ecu is based on an average of Common Market currencies and
currently is worth about $1.20.
   A European central bank would, in the vision held by many
supporters of an EEC monetary union, be the manager of the Ecu _
much as the Federal Reserve manages the dollar _ by influencing
interest rate levels and controlling the supply of money in the
economy.
   One of the main questions to be settled is whether a European
monetary authority could co-exist with national central banks or
whether it would replace them.
   If this and other complex issues are resolved, European economic
integration will have advanced much further than even the most
ardent European unionists would have believed possible in the early
1980s.

<HEAD>Guild Walkout Affecting Everyone From Studio Moguls to Dry
Cleaners</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With no end in sight to the 4-month-old writers
strike, thousands of workers who depend on movie and TV production
for a living face a summer of dwindling savings accounts and
mounting bills.
   From Sunset Strip restaurants to dry cleaners in the San
Fernando Valley, the Hollywood community and the businesses that
profit from it are withering on the vine at a time when activity
should be at its peak in preparation for the fall harvest of new
television shows and Oscar-contending movies.
   ``I hope this strike ends soon,'' said Laura Gomez of the
family-owned La Boutique Dry Cleaners in suburban Sherman Oaks,
home to many film and TV performers and workers. ``They were coming
in with their silk shirts and wool gabardine suits. Now they come
in with their T-shirts and Levis.''
   Members of the Writers Guild of America voted Wednesday to
continue their walkout, rejecting by a 3-to-1 margin a ``final
offer'' from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers.
   The writers went on strike March 7 over the issues of payments
for reruns of one-hour shows and programs broadcast in foreign
markets, as well as creative control.
   Virtually all programming for the fall season has been idled.
The exceptions are some independently produced shows that have
signed their own guild contracts, including ``The Cosby Show'' and
``The Tonight Show.''
   In addition, work on the studios' major theatrical movies for
the fall and winter seasons _ traditionally a time when many
potential Academy Award nominees are released _ has been curtailed.
   ``It's devastating,'' said Dan Slusser, senior vice president
and general manager of Universal City Studios. ``We've already made
a number of cutbacks in the TV and studio operations group.''
   Even the famous Universal commissary is affected. On Friday it
was closed and its employees laid off until further notice.
   ``This city is designed for the entertainment industry, and this
is destroying it,'' said Newt Bellis, president of Unitel, a major
post-production facility on the lot of Paramount Studios. Bellis
said his business, which handles editing and sound-dubbing for TV
shows such as ``Family Ties,'' has been down 50 percent since the
strike.
   He has not laid off any of his 60 employees ``because I have not
had the heart to do it,'' he said. ``But my feeling is that if this
goes on, I'm going to have to cut my staff at least 60 percent. But
I won't as long as I can hold out and my bank will stay with me.''
   Many of those affected by the strike are studio workers
represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage
Employees, and Local 44 President Mac St. Johns said his members
are looking at dwindling bank accounts.
   ``I've had several calls looking for help in mortgages and car
payments,'' St. Johns said. ``These people don't work 52 weeks a
year normally. Now they're not working on the weeks they normally
have.''
   His union local, with 3,750 members, was 60 percent unemployed,
compared with 28 percent for the same time last year. The union
includes special effects technicians, decorators, prop makers,
upholsterers and drapers.
   At Art's Deli in Studio City, owner Art Ginsburg estimated
business was down 10 percent to 15 percent at one of the area's
favorite gathering spots for show business dealmaking.
   ``Not only are we missing the writers and producers, but the
agents meeting with their clients, the studio drivers and all the
people in the industry,'' Ginsburg said. ``It's a related thing all
down the line.''
   Recently at the historic Hollywood haunt Musso and Frank's, two
of the town's most important men sat unrecognized for hours at one
of the tables: Producers Alliance President Nicholas Counter III
and Writers Guild chief negotiator Brian Walton.
   The informal session failed to settle the dispute, but they were
never interrupted as they bargained inside the venerable show
business restaurant that their differences had helped to empty.

   A restaurant owner whose business is off 30
percent quit making doughnuts because nobody buys them. The same
news about dried up business is repeated at the liquor store, tire
shop, grocery and appliance store.
   The worst drought in 50 years is a double whammy for Tunica
County, one of the poorest counties in the nation. Farmers who grow
cotton, soybeans and wheat in the upper Mississippi Delta are
afraid their crops will burn up, and a lake that used to lure
tourist dollars is so low that few fishermen and boaters bother to
go out.
   ``Boy, it hurts. There's not a business in town that's not
affected,'' said Jim Fowler, sitting behind the counter of the
customerless Brown Bag Liquors. ``It's a real bad situation all the
way around.''
   Tunica County is 64 percent farmland. It ranks 78th among
Mississippi's 82 counties in per capita income, with a yearly
average of $6,800, according to the state economist's office. Other
than the recreation business from the lake, it has no industry. The
population is 9,652, down from 16,826 in 1960.
   Cotton is still king here, accounting for 40 percent of the crop
value. But there also are long, straight rows of soybeans, wheat,
rice and other crops in flat fields of sandy loam and buckshot
black clay.
   They're all struggling to grow. There hasn't been a decent rain
since April.
   `It hasn't got to the point where we're going to abandon the
crop and throw the towel in. But we're hurting,'' said county
agriculture agent Dwayne Wheeler.
   ``The drought affects everybody. When the farmer's not spending
money, there's not a whole lot of money being spent,'' Wheeler said.
   ``It's killing my business,'' said Wiley Chambers, owner of the
Blue and White Restaurant, where the glazed cake doughnuts are a
thing of the past. ``These farmers won't spend any money when it
looks bad, and it looks bad.''
   Jim Sturgill, owner of Delta Tire and Alignment, had nary a car
or tractor in his garage.
   ``Look in the shop, there's nothing. We haven't done any
business,'' Sturgill said.
   On a 100-plus degree day, the pavement seems to melt in the
distance under a blistering sun, and dogs nap in what shade they
can find. Tractors pulling discs kick up clouds of dust that hang
in the air and assault the throat.
   Owen Bibb, 55, has 4,000 acres of land, some of which hasn't
been planted while he waits for rain. On Friday, he laid off 15
farmhands.
   ``We're scared of what may be facing us,'' Bibb said. ``We're in
no position to stand a sorry crop. We can't survive a complete
bust. All we can do is put our faith in the good Lord. Worrying
don't help.''
   If it's too dry to plow, the fish surely aren't biting at the
Tunica Cut-off. The 20-mile-long lake was once part of the
Mississippi River, which made a meandering loop.
   In 1942, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers eliminated the loop by
plowing a new channel, leaving a lake fed by the river. With the
river at its lowest level since records were first kept in 1872,
the lake is emptying.
   The county is losing an estimated $20,000 each week on gas,
groceries, bait, hardware and other goods the fishermen aren't
buying, according to the Tunica Cut-off Lake Development
Association. The estimate is based on a Corps of Engineers study
last year on the lake's economic benefits.
   ``It's pitiful. It's killing us,'' said Tait Selden, 33, owner
of one of four fishing camps on the lake.
   Fishermen normally come from Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee and
Ohio for the lake's bounty of bass, brim, sauger, crappie and
catfish. But Selden said his business is off 80 percent. Parking
lots that hold 200 cars on a good weekend are barren.
   ``If this lake wasn't here, this town would have dried up and
blown away a long time ago,'' Selden said.
   Selden and his associates want the government to build a dam to
keep the lake at an acceptable level.
   For now, there's nothing but shrinking businesses that match the
shrinking lake. Marvin Daughtry, who raises bugs for bait, says his
business is off 40 percent overall and 70 percent on the lake.
   ``It absolutely scares me to death the future implications of
this,'' said the owner of Daughtry's Cricket Ranch. ``Nobody knows
how deep this is going to go.''

   A judge's decision to throw out a $24 million
lawsuit that mixed the CIA, Contras and the Medellin cocaine cartel
has left lingering questions, charges of politics, big bills and
little doubt that litigation will continue.
   Chief U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King ruled Thursday
that the two journalists who filed the suit failed to prove their
allegations that the 29 defendants conspired in a guns-for-drugs
scheme or a 1984 terrorist bombing in Nicaragua.
   The defendants included Iran-Contra figures Richard Secord and
Albert Hakim, Contra leader Adolfo Calero, former CIA deputy
director of operations Theodore Shackley, and retired major general
and anti-communist crusader John K. Singlaub.
   The suit was filed in May 1986, six months before the
Iran-Contra affair became public. Many of the people it brought to
light, such as Secord, Hakim, Calero and Singlaub, have been
indicted or forced to appear before congressional committees
investigating that case.
   The suit involved heroin smuggling from Laos, the ``Phoenix''
assassination program in Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs fiasco, cocaine
smuggling from Colombia, illegal Contra arms running, bombings,
threats, disappearances _ all to push what the plaintiffs believed
was a rabid right-wing ideology.
   On the side of the journalists, Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey,
was the liberal, Washington-based Christic Institute and their
attorney, Daniel Sheehan, a veteran of suits on behalf of radiation
victim Karen Silkwood and against the Ku Klux Klan.
   Both sides say politics was at the root of the case, which was
to go to trial Monday.
   ``I think it was 100 percent political,'' says Singlaub. ``I
think their real agenda is to discredit the intelligence service,
discredit the Reagan administration in general and to discredit
George Bush.''
   The vice president led the CIA at the time Shackley was
allegedly involved in the conspiracy, and later while vice
president, the Christics said, his office was aware of arms
smuggling to the Contras.
   The Christic Institute explanation is a mirror image of
Singlaub's. They say the politics involved was not theirs, but
rather that of the judge who favored the defendants and people in
the government who pressured him to protect Bush.
   ``I believe what has happened here is that this ruling is not a
legal ruling, it's a political ruling,'' said Sara Nelson, director
of the institute. ``The judge didn't want a political drama in his
courtroom before the election.''
   Both sides agree more litigation is in the wings.
   ``I have under active consideration plans to sue Sheehan for
libel,'' said Secord. ``This suit ... has been from the beginning
preposterous. Everyone thinks it's absurd and defaming and
malicious.''
   Sheehan is taking King's decision to an appeals court but says
he would be delighted to be the center of a libel trial. ``We'd be
right back in court with all our witnesses and all our documents,''
he said.
   One reason the defendants are threatening countersuits is to
recover the ruinously expensive costs of attending hearings,
responding to voluminous motions, reading thousands of documents
and taking depositions from hundreds of witnesses. The witness list
submitted for the trial had more than 2,000 names.
   Singlaub said he spent more than $250,000 on his own defense,
and his attorney, Thomas Spencer, said the defendants collectively
spent $1 million.
   It cost the Christic Institute even more, $3 million, according
Ms. Nelson.
   According to the suit, Shackley and others, using drug profits,
assassinated officials first in Vietnam, then Iran, Nicaragua and
other nations.
   The key event in the suit was the May 1984 bombing of a news
conference held by Contra commander Eden Pastora in La Penca,
Nicaragua.
   Three journalists and five Pastora supporters died in the
explosion. Avirgan was hurt and his camera damaged in the
explosion, allowing him to file a civil damage suit under federal
law.
   The suit charged the bombing was arranged by Shackley, Contra
leaders and others angered that Pastora refused to join
anti-Sandinista groups he considered too close to the CIA and
deposed Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle.

   The Reagan administration's top economist
predicts robust growth and low inflation will enhance George Bush's
campaign for the White House, but some private analysts say the
outlook isn't all that rosy.
   Conventional wisdom says most people vote their pocketbooks. And
according to Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of President Reagan's Council
of Economic Advisers, ``Prospects for continued prosperity have
seldom been better.''
   The administration is looking for the sixth straight year of
economic expansion, coupled with low inflation, to bolster
Republican chances at the polls this November.
   Sprinkel, who was criticized as too optimistic late last year
when he predicted strong, steady growth for 1988, issued new
projections in the past week that look even better.
   He boosted his prediction of overall economic growth as measured
by the gross national product from 2.9 percent _ the same as 1986
and 1987 _ to 3.5 percent.
   He cut his unemployment rate forecast from 5.8 percent to 5.5
percent and stuck to his estimate of consumer price inflation, 4.3
percent, the same as last year.
   ``This expansion, already in its precedent-breaking 67th month,
now gives every indication of continuing at least through the end
of this administration and on into next year,'' he said.
   Private economists, who six months ago accused Sprinkel of
looking at the world through rose-colored glasses, now concede that
his growth projections then were, if anything, too conservative.
   The lasting shock to consumer buying that economists thought
would come from the October stock market crash never really
materialized and some say even the administration's new and higher
growth estimate is on target, even as they are more concerned about
the inflation outlook.
   The Commerce Department's latest report on GNP said booming
exports and a sharp increase in modernization and expansion
spending by businesses pushed growth to 3.6 percent in the first
quarter of this year after even stronger growth of 4.8 percent in
the last quarter of 1987.
   Private analysts, however, part company with Sprinkel's
prediction that inflation will hold steady at about the same level
as last year.
   Michael K. Evans, head of an economic consulting firm in
Washington, called the inflation numbers: ``Pie in the sky stuff.''
   Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist of Merrill Lynch, said the
economy has ``really done better than anybody has a right to
expect'' in making the transition from consumer-led to
export-driven growth.
   But, he said the administration can't ignore the inflationary
effect of the drought scorching the nation's midsection. Coming
increases in the price of food, which accounts for one-fifth of all
consumer purchases, likely will boost inflation to at least 5
percent, he said.
   Sprinkel agreed the severity of the rise in food prices remains
uncertain, but said he has allowed for temporary increases. He said
that packaging and distribution account for far more of the retail
price of food than crop prices, and argued food prices were
unlikely to add significantly to the underlying inflation rate
because food represents only about 2 percent of GNP.
   However, David Jones, chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston &
Co., a government securities dealer, said a stiff jolt to food
prices runs the risk of triggering ``inflation psychology'' that
spills over into other sectors of the economy, just as the run up
in oil prices did in the 1970s.
   ``The shading of the administration's estimates on inflation may
involve at least some election-year politics in addition to
economic analysis,'' Jones said. ``What the administration is
trying to do is present a picture of strong economic growth and low
inflation as we come into an election.''

   A new Chinese fighter plane equipped with
advanced Italian electronics will make its first test flight next
month, an official report said Saturday.
   The A5-M fighter plane is the product of a 1986 agreement
between the Italian air carrier Aeritalia and the Nanchang Aircraft
Manufacture Corp., the official China Daily said.
   The Chinese produced the body of the plane, while Aeritalia
provided the navigation and firing control systems and other
electronic equipment, the report said.
   The plane's first test flight is scheduled for July, according
to Gao Huixian, a spokeman for the Ministry of Astronautics and
Aeronautics.
   Gao said other Chinese aircraft makers also are looking for
foreign partners to develop new planes for export.
   China sold about $2 billion worth of arms to foreign buyers last
year.

   The Royal Jordanian Airlines, Jordan's

short flights effective July 1.
   ``The decision was taken to limit the dangers of smoking and to
furnish a healthy atmosphere for our passengers,'' said the
airline's public relations officer, Haya Halasa.
   The ban will be imposed on the 15-minute flight to Aqaba, in
southern Jordan, and on the 40-minute flight to neighboring Syria.
   Ms. Halasa said the aircraft have been operating with 75 percent
of their seats already designated for non-smokers but that there is
an increasing demand for such seats.

   A local official who kidnapped a toll booth
attendant because he objected to the road toll was sentenced to one
year in prison, official reports said Saturday.
   ``I made a mistake but I'm not a criminal,'' a newspaper quoted
Zhou Zhiyuan, 51, as saying.
   Zhou, director of the Transport Bureau in Baoding in Heibei
province, about 50 miles south of Beijing, was arrested last month
on charges he kidnapped a toll booth attendant on a Beijing highway
May 2.
   Reports said Zhou objected to the toll fee and dragged the
worker into his van. Zhou released the woman after driving her half
a mile down the road and forcing her to return half the one dollar
toll she had collected.
   Zhou's lawyers are appealing the sentence on grounds that the
woman levied too high a toll and illegally confiscated Zhou's
driver's license, the China Daily said.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address, as delivered Saturday from the White House.
   My fellow Americans, this past week I traveled to Canada for my
eighth economic summit with leaders of the industrialized
democracies. The summit produced important results.
   We agreed on a plan to provide debt relief for some of the
poorest countries of the world, we moved important agricultural
reform negotiations forward, and we rededicated our nations to
combatting the modern-day evils of airplane hijackings, terrorism,
and illegal drugs.
   It's this last matter _ the fight against illegal drugs _ that
I'd like to take a moment to discuss with you this afternoon.
   This past week's meeting in Canada wasn't the first time the
drug problem had been discussed among my summit colleagues. At the
1985 summit in Bonn, we established an expert group to identify
areas for enhancing the effectiveness and cooperation in fighting
the scourge of illegal drugs. The expert group presented its report
at our 1986 summit in Tokyo, and the report proved useful in
setting our countries on a path of cooperation in combatting drug
abuse and illicit drug-trafficking.
   Now, the summit leaders have supported an initiative for a
special group launched by Vice President Bush and Canadian Prime
Minister Mulroney that would extend and promote the work done by
the Bonn summit. This group will propose methods to improve
international cooperation in combatting production, trafficking,
and financing of the drug trade.
   I'm hopeful this group can identify measures for a major
coordinated assault on drugs, but today the battle against drugs
extends far beyond the seven industrialized democracies represented
in Toronto. Just one year ago, 138 nations _ members of the United
Nations _ met in Vienna to participate in the historic
International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.
This conference proved a resounding success in bringing together
representatives from around the globe.
   Each of the participating governments declared its commitment to
vigorous action against drug abuse and illicit drug-trafficking.
Perhaps even more important, the 138 nations adopted a
comprehensive outline of activities all nations can undertake to
fight illegal drugs. These activities include the reduction of
demand for illegal drugs, the suppression of illicit drug
production and trafficking, and the treatment and rehabilitation of
drug-dependent people.
   One suggestion coming out of the UN conference was the
recommendation for a commemorative day, an international day
against drug abuse and illicit trafficking. The UN General Assembly
then set aside June 26th to serve as this day of observance. Around
the world, nations will join the United Nations commemorating the
international fight against drugs, and I'm pleased that the United
States will be among them.
   Attorney General Meese, who headed our delegation to the
conference in Vienna, will host a ceremony to draw attention to the
international day and to reaffirm the commitment of the United
States to a drug-free America, and yes, a drug-free world. Here at
home this past week, the White House Conference for a Drug-Free
America released its report.
   This document included more than 100 recommendations for
combatting drug-abuse and illicit drug-trafficking. We'll be giving
these recommendations careful consideration in the days ahead. And
there's another important anti-drug effort underway here at home _
it was on May 18th that I called on, to use my own words, ``both
Houses of the Congress, both sides of the aisle, to join with my
representatives in a special executive legislative task force to
advance America's unified response to the problem of illegal drug
use,'' end quote. My goal is to combine the expertise of the
executive and legislative branches to identify the next steps we
should take to stop the illegal use, distribution, and production
of drugs, and to begin taking these steps on a bipartisan basis.
   I'm sure you'll agree, the drug problem is a national problem
that demands national solutions and is too important for us to
permit partisan bickering. I was pleased that the House and Senate
minority leaders, Bob Dole and Bob Michel, appointed their
representatives to the task force, and I urge the speaker of the
House and the majority leader of the Senate to appoint their own
representatives quickly so we can get to work.
   Next week, my National Drug Policy Board will recommend specific
proposals that would be important to any new drug legislation.
Today, illegal drug use is down in our high schools, cocaine and
heroin seizures are up, and perhaps most important, attitudes about
illegal drugs have changed. But, we're working on, working to make
our beloved land what we know it ought to be and can be, a truly
drug-free America.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

   President Reagan urged Democratic
congressional leaders Saturday to appoint representatives to work
with the administration on the drug problem, saying it is ``too
important for us to permit partisan bickering.''
   Delivering his weekly radio talk from the Oval Office, the
president said his own National Drug Policy Board will recommend
specific proposals during the coming week ``that would be important
to any new drug legislation.''
   In a commencement speech at the Coast Guard Academy in New
London, Conn., on May 18, the president said, ``I'm calling on both
houses of the Congress, both sides of the aisle, to join with my
representatives in a special executive-legislative task force to
advance American's unified response to the problem of illegal drug
use.''
   Since then, he said, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas
and House GOP leader Robert Michel of Illinois have appointed their
representatives. He urged Speaker of the House Jim Wright, D-Texas,
and Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to follow suit
``so we can get to work.''
   ``I am sure you will agree the drug problem is a national
problem that demands a national solution, and it's too important
for us to permit partisan bickering,'' he said.
   Wright and Byrd were not in their Capitol offices Saturday, and
could not be reached immediately for comment.
   In his radio talk, the president said, ``My goal is to combine
the expertise of the executive and legislative branches to identify
the next steps we should take to stop the illegal use, distribution
and production of drugs and to begin taking these steps on a
bipartisan basis.''
   He also reviewed steps taken at the seven-nation economic summit
in Toronto June 19-21, including action to create a special group
to propose methods to improve international cooperation in
combatting the drug trade.

   A U.S. Marine Corps helicopter slammed into a
hillside and burned Saturday while flying in fog near a nuclear
power plant, and all seven Marines on board were killed, officials
said.
   The Sikorsky CH-53D Sea Stallion crashed about 30 minutes after
leaving the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station at Iwakuni, in
southwestern Japan, said Sgt. Nolan Wells of the station's public
affairs office.
   Names of the victims were withheld pending notification of their
families.
   Cloudy skies and dense fog were reported in the area at the time
of the crash on the southwest tip of Shikoko island, but it wasn't
immediately known if the weather contributed to the accident.
   Since 1980, at least 88 people have died in accidents involving
the Sea Stallion, or the later-model Super Stallion, the largest
and most expensive helicopter used by the U.S. military.
   Television footage showed Japanese and American rescue workers
carrying bodies in sacks over terraced rice paddies less than two
miles from a nuclear power station.
   Fog swirled around the hill where the aircraft crashed and
burned, and it appeared to be raining lightly. The wreckage was
scattered over a wide area, according to a local police official
who identified himself only as Sakamoto.
   Japanese aviation law prohibits aircraft from flying over
nuclear power stations and other nuclear-related facilities. There
are about 30 such facilities in Japan.
   The law also says that aircraft which must fly over such
facilities due to bad weather or to avoid a collision, must take
the least hazardous course or altitude.
   A Japanese Defense Agency official said in a telephone interview
that he saw ``little problem'' with the helicopter's flight path.
   ``We noticed the copter took a course several kilometers away
from the plant,'' despite the poor visibility in the area at the
time of the accident, said the official, who refused to be named.
   The Marines were flying to their base at Camp Futenma in
Okinawa, 580 miles away, where they were assigned to Marine Heavy
Helicopter Squadron 402 of the 1st Marine Air Wing, Wells said. The
United States has about 20,000 Marines stationed in Okinawa.
   The Sea Stallion left Iwakuni, about 700 miles southwest of
Tokyo, at 9:50 a.m. and crashed at about 10:20 a.m., Wells said.
   The CH-53D is capable of carrying up to 55 troops or a cargo of
32,000 pounds. The single-rotor, twin-engine aircraft is made by
the Stratford, Conn.-based Sikorsky Aircraft division of the United
Technologies Corp.
   The helicopter has had a series of operational problems and
fatal crashes.
   In November 1985, the military grounded the helicopters after
mechanics in a routine inspection discovered a defect in the
locknut that helps hold the rotor blade assembly to the aircraft.
   Sikorsky's former chief safety engineer alleged in a March 1987
court affidavit that metal mounts on the tail rotor gearbox of the
helicopter have failed or been suspected of failing an estimated 60
times since 1968. Sikorsky attorneys said the man was a disgruntled
former employee who was using internal company documents in
violation of his contract.
   Three Marines died in a Feb. 13, 1987 accident involving a Sea
Stallion helicopter in the Trabuco Canyon area near El Toro, Calif.
   In July 1985, a CH-53D crashed off Japan, killing four Marines.
In May 1985, 17 Marines were presumed killed when their Sea
Stallion crashed into the ocean off Japan's southern coast. And in
March 1984, a Sea Stallion slammed into a mountainside in Seoul,
and all 18 Americans and 11 South Koreans were killed. In 1983,
seven people died in two accidents.
   In addition, five were killed in 1982 in one crash, nine in 1981
in four accidents, and seven in 1980 in four accidents.

   Here is the text of the Democratic Party's
weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday by Rep. Barbara Boxer
of California:
   This is Congresswoman Barbara Boxer from California. I'd like to
talk to you about the Pentagon scandal, and why Congress is deeply
troubled by it.
   You've heard about scandals before. But this one is different.
   It strikes at the heart of our national security, and, I
believe, was fueled by a consistent message by the Reagan
administration that government is our enemy and big defense
business our friend.
   If the FBI is right, then secret information worth tens of
billions has been traded by military insiders and defense
contractors to line their pockets and undermine the competitive
system that Congress has mandated.
   Why has this happened? I don't agree with President Reagan that
it's ``understandable.'' Do you?
   Or with Defense Secretary Carlucci who says there's nothing
wrong with the system, it's just a few individuals.
   Where is the outrage? Where is the concern?
   The root cause of this scandal was alluded to more than 20 years
ago by a president from the military, Dwight Eisenhower. He warned
about the unwarranted influence of the military-industrial complex,
and the need for ``an alert citizenry'' to protect against it.
   I want you to be an alert citizenry. I want you to know what has
gone on since this administration came to power in 1980.
   First, the military budget increased 100 percent from $150
billion to $300 billion today. Money was literally stuffed into the
Pentagon with too little attention paid to cost or quality _ as if
money alone could buy us security.
   We need a strong defense, but we must control wasteful spending.
   I want you to know that Congress has passed reforms. Each time
we were told by the Pentagon to butt out. But we said it was the
people's business.
   In 1984 we showed them the $7,000 coffee pot and asked for
reform. The Pentagon said that was an isolated incident.
   So we showed them the $600 toilet seat, the $300 no-smoking
sign, the $9,000 Allen wrench. All isolated incidents, they said.
   But we passed legislation to force competition on the $18
billion spare parts budget.
   But we knew there was more _ lots more. We said the Pentagon and
defense contractors were too cozy. The Pentagon said no. But we
passed revolving door legislation, stopping military procurement
officers from retiring and going to to work on Friday for the very
same contractors they investigated on Thursday.
   Over Pentagon objections, Congress passed strong whistleblower
protection for those brave people who speak out about fraud and
waste. This whole scandal unfolded because a whistleblower had the
guts to speak out.
   In 1986, Congress mandated a procurement czar to straighten out
the mess. An honorable man took the job but quit, frustrated that
he was fighting _ and losing _ every time.
   We legislated some good old-fashioned competition, and we said
enough to buying from monopolies.
   But the Pentagon, the contractors, and the administration didn't
like it. They howled.
   They were unabashed in their contempt toward congressional
reforms. They continued to try to water them down, repeal them or
ignore them.
   Now, in this tterrible scandal there has apparently been the
ultimate contempt _ as many as 50 consultants buying secret
information to destroy competition and cheat all of us.
   It is difficult to see six years of bipartisan work foiled by
what one news magazine calls ``a conspiracy of greed.''
   But we will learn from this and you, alert citizens, can help.
   Let us send a message through our votes that we've had enough of
pouring billions into a bottomless money pit.
   Let us send a message through our votes that we want an ethical
and honorable independent procurement system.
   You know, the code name for this FBI investigation is ``Ill
Wind.'' Let's turn this ill wind into winds of change _ for all of
us.
   It's about time, don't you think?

<HEAD>Bar Owners Struggle With Rules For Last Day Of 19-, 20-Year-Old
Drinking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Wyoming on Friday becomes the last state
to raise its drinking age to 21, confronting bar owners with a
dilemma _ what to do about 19- and 20-year-olds who come in legally
Thursday night and suddenly become too young to drink.
   The Legislature earlier this year acceded to federal pressure to
raise the drinking age from 19 to 21. The increase takes effect at
12:01 a.m. Friday.
   But state law allows bars to remain open until 2 a.m., and
19-and 20-year-olds expected to turn out in force Thursday night
for their last chance for a legal drink.
   ``It takes effect at 12:01 a.m. July 1 and from that point on, a
bar operator cannot sell to or allow someone 19 and 20 to drink in
their establishment,'' said Attorney General Joe Meyer. ``So they
had better clear the tables.''
   Complicating the issue is that the law is written in such a way
that, unless city ordinances say otherwise, those ages 19 and 20
can still be inside a liquor establishment after the age limit
changes.
   ``It's going to create an unenforceable object,'' said Police
Chief Don Pierson. ``It will be totally impossible for us to
enforce a law that allows 19- and 20-year-olds in, but doesn't let
them drink. The biggest problem is for the bar owner himself,
because it is his responsibility to make sure they do not drink.''
   Bar owners can be fined $35 to $750 and receive up to six months
in jail for allowing underage drinking. Drinkers 18 and under are
handled as juvenile offenders; those 19 and 20 will face the same
punishment as bar owners, said police Sgt. Marty Luna.
   Many communities around the state are working to enact
ordinances to prohibit those under 21 from entering bars.
   Bars and taverns also have the option of not letting in anyone
under 21.
   ``Our option is right now to make it a day early here,'' said
Rick Kilgore, assistant food and beverage director for the Hitching
Post Inn in Cheyenne. ``We do have the option to refuse service to
anybody, so instead of going through the headaches of getting
19-and 20-year-olds out of here after they've been drinking all
night, our plan ... is we'll cut it off June 29.''
   Kilgore said another option is simply to close the bar at
midnight Thursday.
   Leo McCue, president of the Wyoming Liquor Dealers Association,
also said many bar owners might just close their establishements to
those under 21 to avoid problems.
   ``Most people prefer that we don't allow 19-year-olds in because
it is too hard to control,'' he said. ``We have to police our own
places ... we are the law enforcement.
   ``It is very difficult to keep someone from ordering a pitcher
of beer and not keep someone from pouring a glass for (an underage)
friend they are talking to. We are hoping the cities enact
ordinances that will take care of that situation.''
   Cheyenne Club manager John Lambousis, who plans to keep
entertaining people ages 19 and 20, said the two-hour gap should
not be much trouble.
   ``Normally we are not that busy on a Thursday, so we will
identify them with a stamp and let them drink and by midnight,
there should just be a handful of those people,'' he said.
``Instead of leaving at 1 or 2 (a.m.), they can cut the party short
a little bit.''

   Celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson
vowed to vigorously defend himself against state bar association
allegations that he mishandled clients' money.
   Mitchelson, who made legal history in the mid-1970s by pressing
the historic ``palimony'' case of actor Lee Marvin's former
girlfriend, could face sanctions ranging from a warning up to
disbarment if the complaints against him are upheld.
   The State Bar's trial counsel office filed documents Friday
contending there was reasonable cause to hold a disciplinary
hearing.
   Mitchelson, 60, divorce attorney for such luminaries as Joan
Collins, said the bar singled him out because ``I'm highly
visible.''
   ``Nevertheless I will vigorously defend myself against these
charges as I have defended every case I've ever had,'' Mitchelson
said by phone from Tokyo.
   He added that ``all these complaints are old complaints and at
least two of them have been previously rejected by the State Bar.''
   Among those who filed complaints were actress Julie Newmar and
Eleanor Revson, sister-in-law of the founder of Revlon Cosmetics.
   They complained that Mitchelson took retainers from them and
delayed or refused to return unearned portions of the fees after
they fired him for alleged deception, the Los Angeles Times
reported Saturday.
   The bar association also charged that Mitchelson failed to
deposit clients' funds in trust accounts, charged unconscionable
fees, failed to perform promised work and lied to a client.

   The first black principal in the
Philadelphia public school system is offering to pay for the
college education of 119 sixth-graders from two city schools in
poor neighborhoods.
   ``They have very high expectations,'' Ruth Wright Hayre said of
the students. ``And why shouldn't we share those high expectations?
I have a great deal of faith in these young people.''
   Ms. Hayre announced her endowment of the scholarship fund Friday
during sixth-grade graduation ceremonies at Richard Wright and
Kenderton Elementary Schools in north Philadelphia. She said she
initially intended to give the money anonymously, and refused to
say how much she donated.
   A former teacher in Philadelphia's public schools, Ms. Hayre
became the system's first black principal 1956 and rose to area
superintendent in 1963. After retiring from the school system in
1976, she taught at the Graduate School of Education at the
University of Pennsylvania.

   Singer and songwriter Nanci Griffith _
whose latest album is topping the charts in the United Kingdom _
says country legend Loretta Lynn was one of her early role models.
   ``Loretta was the first person that inspired in me that I didn't
have ot play other people's songs, that I could write my own dadgum
songs and play my own rhythm guitar,'' the country-folk artist said
in an interview last week.
   The Texas-born singer said her album ``Little Love Affairs'' has
been No. 1 in the United Kingdom for about 15 weeks.
   Griffith's songs get lots of radio airplay in Britain, in
contrast to American stations, which have not yet warmed up to her
style.
   ``My voice is very different. It's not something they can say,
`This is something everyone will like because it sounds like
something else,''' she said.

   Japan's top surviving World War II ace says
he fought in the same area as Vice President George Bush but
doesn't know if the two ever squared off in aerial combat.
   Bush was a Navy pilot flying bombers in the Bonin Islands area
of the Pacific Ocean about the same time that Saburo Sakai was
trying to shoot such planes down in 1944.
   Bush was shot down on Sept. 2, 1944. The identity of the
attacking pilot is not known, a White House spokeswoman said Friday.
   ``I was not familiar with him (Bush) at that time,'' Sakai, 72,
said through an interpreter Friday. ``He was not a well-known
flier.''
   The Japanese Zero pilot, who shot down 64 planes, arrived from
Toyko on Thursday to visit friends during the weekend's Yakima Air
Fair. His visit is a low-key affair, without an official connection
to the fair.
   Two years ago, Sakai's official appearance with a group of aces
from other countries sparked an uproar by some local residents, who
opposed honoring a former enemy.
   Sakai was Japan's top fighter pilot to survive World War II, but
he lost his right eye and suffered extensive wounds. He documented
his exploits in a 1957 book called ``Samurai.''

   The Rev. Leon Sullivan, who formulated the
Sullivan Principles for corporate conduct in South Africa, says
that though he's retiring, he will continue his battle against
apartheid and pursue new ways to help Africa's poor.
   ``I came to Philadelphia 38 years ago with my young wife, Grace,
to do a job for the church and for the community, and for God. And
the job that God wanted me to do here is over,'' the Rev. Leon H.
Sullivan told a crowd of about 1,300 on Friday at his retirement
dinner.
   Sullivan has preached at Philadelphia's Zion Baptist Church for
more than 30 years. He said he would dedicate the rest of his life
to helping others, including programs to bring better food and
housing to the poor in Africa and continuing anti-apartheid efforts.
   ``I believe that is what I'm called to do, and it's my life,''
Sullivan said. ``My church is on this corner, but my ministry is in
the world.''
   The Sullivan Principles encourage companies doing business in
South Africa to press for non-segregation of workers, fair
employment practices for all races and training and promotion of
blacks, Asians and people of mixed race.

<HEAD>Soviets Says Their Warning on Afghan Pullout Meant As Pressure
Tactic</HEAD>

   A Foreign Ministry official indicated Saturday
that the Kremlin never intended to halt its troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan, as it threatened, and was only trying to put pressure
on Afghan rebel supporters.
   The comments by Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov seemed
designed to put to rest speculation that the Soviet Union might
slow or stop withdrawing its troops from Afghanstan because of
alleged violations of the accord providing for the withdrawal.
   He indicated the warnings were directed more at putting pressure
on Pakistan, which supports the rebels, than signaling any Soviet
backtracking.
   ``We are appealing to the conscience of Pakistan's leaders,''
Vorontsov said at a news conference, speaking through an
interpreter. ``We believe that the leaders of Pakistan will realize
their responsibility and that the world's public will help them
take awareness of their responsibilty.''
   Vorontsov, who helped negotiate the Geneva accords, also called
on reporters to investigate alleged Pakistani violations of the
accord, signed April 14.
   The Soviet Union has been complaining almost daily that
Pakistan's arms shipments to guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's
government and that the location of rebel training bases in
Pakistan violate the Geneva accords.
   Vorontsov cited specific examples of alleged U.S. and Pakistani
support for the rebels. He said a Pakistani general, Sarfaz Ahmad,
is in charge of a camp near the village of Kalan, near Islamabad,
where 2,500 rebels are training. American advisers are also at the
camp, Vorontsov said.
   The first Soviet warning of retaliation came May 28, when the
Foreign Ministry said that if Pakistan did not halt ``interference
in the internal affairs of Afghanistan,'' the Soviet Union would
``draw pertinent conclusions with respect to the timetable of the
troop withdrawal and take concrete steps.''
   Under the accords, the Soviet Union began pulling out its more
than 100,000 troops from Afghanistan on May 15 and is supposed to
have half of them out by Aug. 15. The pullout is to be completed by
Feb. 15.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Afghan President Najib
warned after a Moscow meeting on June 13 that Pakistani violations
of the accord would bring ``resolute retaliatory steps.''
   Vadim I. Kuznetsov, deputy head of the U.S. desk in the Soviet
Foreign Ministry, said in an interview the next day that the
warning meant the withdrawing Soviet troops would strike back at
Afghan guerrillas who attack them.
   The United States has been supplying the Afghan rebels with an
estimated $500 million annually in arms and military supplies
channeled through Pakistan. It has vowed to continue the supplies
as long as the Soviet Union keeps up its military support of the
Afghan government.
   The Geneva accords prohibit Pakistani interference in
Afghanistan's affairs. But weapons supply from the Soviet Union is
not banned.
   A separate agreement signed by Moscow and Washington allows them
to continue supplying their respective allies.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979
following a communist coup there the previous year.

   Protesters disrupted a performance of a
play critical of the Vatican's role in dealing with the Nazis and
said the production was improper during the papal visit to Austria.
   ``This whole play is a just a lie!'' about 50 protesters shouted
late Friday during a performance of German author Rolf Hochhuth's
play, ``The Deputy.''
   Police took two protesters into custody. The incident occurred
on the second day of Pope John Paul II's visit to Austria.
   Hochhuth's play, first performed in 1963 in Berlin, alleges that
then-Pope Pius XII failed to do enough to prevent the Nazi
Holocaust.
   ``If I were writing the play again today, I would not present
the personage of Pope Pius XII so favorably,'' Hochhuth said later
during an informal discussion with the audience. The play already
is very critical of Pius XII.
   The play's assistant director, Hermann Beil, told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview that the demonstrators,
predominantly young people, shouted and used whistles to attract
attention during the performance at Vienna's Burgtheater.
   Beil said some in the audience shouted back at the protesters:
``Out with the Nazis!''
   The actors occasionally stopped to ask for silence.
   About 350 people were in the audience during the disruptions,
Beil said.
   The protesters called themselves ``The Young Friends of the
Burgtheater'' and distributed leaflets calling for the ouster of
theater director Claus Peymann.
   ``Out with Peymann,'' some chanted.
   Peymann himself told the audience later, ``I think it`s great
that a public forum can arise in this theater. Perhaps the theater
today has the function of presenting those questions that politics
no longer deal with.''
   Although critics reacted coolly to the play, it became a hit and
sparked impassioned debate over the Vatican's role before and
during World War II.
   In addition to Hochhuth, many Jewish leaders allege the Roman
Catholic Church failed to do enough to prevent the mass murder of
European Jews. But the current pope has strongly defended the
church's role during the Nazi era.
   John Paul even brought up the subject on the current trip.
   ``The incomprehensible pain, suffering and tears still are
before my eyes and etched deep in my soul,'' the pontiff said
Friday in reference to the Nazi murder of 6 million Jews.
   But he continued: ``It would be clearly unjust and untrue to
charge Christianity with these unspeakable crimes.''
   The theater's production of the play sparked controversy last
March, when it was performed at the time the Austrians were marking
the 50th anniversary of the country's annexation by Nazi Germany.

   Here are events in the investigation of
alleged procurement fraud and bribery involving government
officials, defense contractors and consultants:

<TEXT>
   TUESDAY, JUNE 14: Pursuing what FBI spokesman Gregory Jones
calls ``allegations of fraud and bribery,'' FBI and Naval
Investigative Service agents raid the offices of Pentagon
officials, defense contractors and consultants.
   More than 30 locations are searched in 12 states and the
District of Columbia. Law enforcement sources say the searches are
part of a two-year probe that has included wiretaps.
   Targets include Melvyn Paisley, a former assistant Navy
secretary who became a consultant to several aerospace contractors
immediately upon leaving the Pentagon. Also searched are the
Pentagon offices of Victor Cohen, a top Air Force acquisitions
official, and James Gaines, deputy assistant Navy secretary for
acquisitions, as well as offices and plants of some of the
country's largest defense contractors, including McDonnell Douglas
Corp. in St. Louis, United Technologies Corp. in Washington and
Unisys Corp. in Minneapolis and New York.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WEDNESDAY, JUNE 15: Government sources say that the office
telephones of Cohen and Gaines were tapped. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater says President Reagan did not learn of the massive
investigation until the previous day.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   THURSDAY, JUNE 16: A search warrant issued in the investigation
states that McDonnell Douglas improperly received large amounts of
confidential Pentagon information from Paisley. Law enforcement
officials say some 275 subpoenas have been served.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III says indictments may be handed
down in 30 to 90 days. Sources say Meese was not told of the probe
until late March because his name came up on a wiretap.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   FRIDAY, JUNE 17: Reps. Roy Dyson, D-Md., and Bill Chappell,
D-Fla., deny that they are involved amid reports that the office of
at least three House members were put under scrutiny.
   Two more defense contractors _ LTV Corp. and Martin Marietta
Corp. _ acknowledge that they have been served with subpoenas.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   SATURDAY, JUNE 18: A second search warrant reveals that the FBI
believes that Pratt & Whitney obtained confidential documents that
rival jet engine maker General Electric Co. had given to the
Defense Department in bidding for engine contracts worth hundreds
of millions of dollars.
   The warrant is used to search the offices of Eugene Tallia, vice
president of Pratt & Whitney and head of the company's Washington
office.
   Newspaper reports, quoting unidentified sources, say
investigators have uncovered evidence that for Navy Secretary John
F. Lehman Jr. Lehman learned of the probe and warned Paisley that
he was under investigation. The Los Angeles Times and The Baltimore
Sun report that also under investigation are activities of the late
Rep. Joseph Addabbo, D-N.Y., who was chairman of the House
Appropriations defense subcommittee.

<TEXT>
   SUNDAY, JUNE 19: Four members of Congress who oversee
procurement policies say management problems _ and a ``good old boy
network'' in the Reagan administration _ were at fault.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he knew ``we did not have the kind of people in the
Pentagon at high levels that really had background in management.
We had people being selected for their ideological beliefs, for
their salesmanship, but not for good sound management.''

<TEXT>
   MONDAY, JUNE 20: Grassley says the Justice Department was
``asleep at the switch'' three years ago when a Pentagon
investigator discovered that defense contractors and consultants
were illegally obtaining Pentagon secrets.
   Three other congressmen _ Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., Andrew
Ireland, R-Fla., and Sam Stratton, D-N.Y. _ are reported on the
list of those under scrutiny, but not targets, in the case.
Chappell says no one in Congress is involved in the investigation,
but declines to give the basis for his statement.
   The U.S. attorney coordinating the probe, Henry Hudson of
Virginia, says 270 subpoenas have been issued.
   Three more defense contractors: Hercules Inc., Gould Inc. and
the Electronic Data Systems Corp., say they have been served with
subpoenas.

<TEXT>
   TUESDAY, JUNE 21: Sources familiar with the case say the
government has won the cooperation of someone whose voice turned up
frequently on court-ordered wiretaps, and a second target of the
probe appears on the verge of cooperating. One wiretap involves a
conversation between Lehman and Paisley.
   President Reagan, in a news conference in Toronto at the end of
the economic summit, said it was ``understandable how such things''
could happen in a government bureaucracy.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   WEDNESDAY, JUNE 22: House Speaker Jim Wright says ``no member of
the House is under investigation'' in the case.
   Prosecutor Henry Hudson meets with members of Congress. The
corruption case is focusing on 75 to 100 defense contracts worth
``tens of billions of dollars,'' says Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
   Gaines' daughter Joan, an aide to Ireland, is relieved of
handling military issues for the congressman.
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in an interview,
denies responsibilty for whatever corruption may be found. ``No
matter how careful you are, you're not going to be able to
eliminate dishonesty,'' he says.
   BDM International Inc. of McLean, Va., is reported to have been
served with a subpoena. Paisley's wife Vicki is an employee of the
company.
   Court files show that Walter R. Edgington, then a vice president
of GTE Government Systems Corp., told federal agents four years ago
that a private consultant routinely provided his company with
secret Pentagon documents.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   THURSDAY, JUNE 23: The Los Angeles Times reports that
investigators believe Gaines was a principal supplier of Pentagon
documents to Paisley. The newspaper said Paisley arranged an
elaborate scheme under which high-level Pentagon officials smuggled
classified documents out of the Pentagon and allowed him to copy
them with the aid of his wife. The newspaper says Paisley allegedly
passed the information to McDonnell Douglas, which paid him
``staggering fees.'' An attorney for the Paisleys denies the
allegations.
   A former Boeing Co. executive, James Durst, says he passed along
information to the government more than six years ago that Paisley
had bragged of committing a felony wiretapping operation and of
conducting bribery internationally on military projects.

   FRIDAY, JUNE 24: Federal and state records show that Mrs.
Paisley received $50,000 in payments from a defense consulting firm
set up by William Galvin, another figure in the investigation.

   SATURDAY, JUNE 25: Sources close to the investigation say
Pentagon officials were videotaped during the undercover phase of
the investigation, some as they allegedly took payoffs for giving
inside information to defense contractors. The sources said Cohen,
Gaines and Paisley were among those videotaped, but declined to say
whether the recordings of those men involved any payoffs.

   Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson agreed
Saturday to an overhaul of Democratic Party rules and avoided the
possibility of a contentious floor fight at next month's national
convention.
   Under the agreement, the number of ``super delegates'' to the
1992 convention will be cut nearly in half and all other delegates
would be awarded to presidential candidates in proportion to public
support.
   Jackson, meeting Saturday with local campaign officials in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, said the agreement represented ``a victory for
the people ... a victory for democracy.''
   Jackson had complained that party rules did not allow him to get
the delegates he said were warranted by his popular support. He had
said that he would carry his fight to the convention floor to get
the rules changed.
   ``I think that we've made a lot of steps forward in a lot of
areas that Rev. Jackson has been concerned about,'' said Harold
Ickes, who negotiated for Jackson on the rules changes.
   Of the 643 super delegates to the convention, Jackson, who won
29 percent of the vote in the primaries, had just 55. Dukakis, who
won 57 percent of the vote, had 362, according to The Associated
Press delegate count.
   The super delegates _ party leaders and politicians who
automatically hold seats as convention delegates _ are not bound to
support a presidential candidate based on results of the primaries
or caucuses.
   And while the Democratic Party has no ``winner-take-all''
states, it does have a few states in which direct election of
delegates or ``winner-take-more'' systems are used.
   Dukakis used both of those aspects of the party's rules to give
him the margin of delegates he needed to clinch the Democratic
presidential nomination. He also intensively sought support from
super delegates, often making telephone calls to them himself.
   Currently, Dukakis has 2,384 delegates overall while Jackson has
1,132.
   The Dukakis campaign supported the rules changes, but Tad
Devine, director of delegate selection for Dukakis, said it was not
being done to buy peace with Jackson.
   ``Hardly,'' Devine said. ``I think it represents a compromise on
the part of both campaigns. It reflects a spirit of cooperation and
good will.''
   The harmony between the two campaigns meant that the party's
Rules Committee meeting this weekend was being cut from two days to
one and probably would issue no dissenting reports when its
business was finished, Devine said.
   Both campaigns said the negotiations had been going on for
several days and stretched into the early hours of Saturday
morning. However, occasional snags were still being worked out on
some issued during the Rules Committee meeting, as a dozen or so
representatives of the campaigns talked in a tight huddle at the
back of the room.
   The 186-member committee approved the rules changes on Saturday
without dissent, but the proposals still need to be ratified by the
full convention next month in order to take effect for the 1992
presidential campaign.
   ``Though adoption of this proposal doesn't put us in the
promised land, it puts us further down the road,'' said Warren
Bracy, a committee member and Jackson supporter from Ann Arbor,
Mich., of reducing the strength of super delegates.
   Rep. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., kept the metaphor: ``This may not be
the promised land, but it does represent some milk and honey.''
   Devine said Dukakis did use the current system to his advantage
but still would have won the nomination even if the proposed rules
changes were in place.
   ``I don't deny that we took a look at the delegate selection
process in 1988 and developed strategies based on the way the
process is structured,'' Devine said.
   Under the proposed changes, the number of super delegates would
be reduced to 394 by denying automatic delegate status to most
members of the Democratic National Committee. Automatic delegate
status would be reserved for Democratic governors, most members of
Congress and top two party leaders in each state and the party's
national officers.
   The system would return to rules used in 1984, when DNC members
had priority for seats at the convention but had to compete for
them and had to declare a presidential preference.
   Super delegates currently represent about 15 percent of the
delegates to the convention. Under the proposed rules, that would
be cut to about 10 percent.
   In addition, states such as Illinois and New Jersey, which
picked their national convention delegates directly from the
primary ballot, would be compelled to adopt systems to award the
delegates proportionally. Another handful of states, including
Ohio, New York and Florida, award extra delegates to the candidate
receiving the most votes in their primaries, and those systems,
too, would have to be changed in four years.
   The agreement also called for nudging states toward picking new
DNC members based on whom they support for president and in
proportion to results of the primary or caucus in that state.
States adopting this rule would be allowed to name one extra member
apiece to the DNC.
   In other business Saturday, the committee voted to recognize the
District of Columbia as a state, giving Mayor Marion Barry an
automatic seat at the 1988 convention as a governor.
   The committee, without debate, named House Speaker Jim Wright as
permanent chairman of this year's national convention. No mention
was made of a House ethics committee investigation of some of
Wright's financial dealings.

<HEAD>Sakharov Speaks Out for Monument To Stalin's Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissident Andrei Sakharov joined former political
prisoners and intellectuals at a rally Saturday to demand a
monument to victims of Josef Stalin. It was Sakharov's first
appearance at a street rally in more than a decade.
   At another demonstration, about 200 people shouted ``Freedom!
Freedom!'' and ignored police orders to disperse. Police detained
at least three people.
   Sakharov, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who spent seven
years in exile for speaking out against the Soviet government, told
600 people in north Moscow that a monument to Stalin's victims was
essential to remembering the country's ``tragic history.''
   The rally joined intellectuals who had been jailed or banished
from Moscow during the rule of former Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev and those who are still trying to get their works past
conformist censors.
   Flanked by a sign showing Stalin on a big black boot and warning
``He is still dangerous,'' Sakharov told a silent crowd that ``if
we have a memorial, we have to think of everybody who died, in the
repression, of hunger ... everybody was a victim.''
   Later, at Pushkin Square in the center of the city, a jostling
crowd of 200 refused to allow police to break up a demonstration by
the alternative political party, Democratic Union.
   They applauded a man who held up a sign saying ``No to the
political police. Break up the KGB.''
   Sakharov, 67, said the Soviet Union's sad past was symbolized by
the December 1986 death in jail of Anatoly Marchenko, a fellow
member of a group monitoring human rights in the 1970s.
   Marchenko's death is thought by some to have hastened the
decision by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev two weeks later to
allow Sakharov and his wife, Yelena Bonner, to return to Moscow
from their exile in the closed city of Gorky.
   Others who spoke at the rally included former political
prisoners Sergei Kovalev and Lev Timofeyev, film director Elem
Klimov, historian Yuri Afanasyev and writers Ales Adamovich and
Yuri Karyakin.
   Karyakin told reporters that the rally ``was a beginning. It was
important that there were many young people there.''
   A group of Communist Party members and non-party intellectuals
have collected 30,000 signatures on a petition to a nationwide
party conference to approve a monument to the millions killed in
Stalin's purges. The conference begins Tuesday.
   Groups in the Baltic republic of Latvia and in the Siberian city
of Chita have campaigned for such a monument.
   Klimov and Afanasyev are delegates to the conference and
accepted the petition Saturday, promising to raise the issue of a
memorial if they are allowed to speak at the 5,000-delegate forum.
   Timofeyev called for greater openness about the extent of
Stalin's purges and proposed that Alexander Solzhenitsyn's
chronicle of Soviet prisons, ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' be
published in the Soviet Union.
   Sakharov's appearance at the rally marked the first time he has
taken part in a street protest since he and his wife campaigned for
freedom outside dissidents' trials in the 1970s.
   Sakharov was exiled to Gorky in January 1980 for speaking out
against the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   About an hour after the anti-Stalin rally, which was held with
official approval, the Democratic Union tried to hold a
demonstration on Pushkin Square.
   Police did not intervene at first but later detained Democratic
Union leader Yuri Mityunov and at least two other people, prompting
a shoving match with the crowd of Democratic Union supporters and
onlookers.
   A rally staged by another group, the National Front, was then
allowed to go ahead, apparently because they back official policies
and are not challenging the monopoly of the Communist party.
   Police tried to break up the demonstrations by throwing up a
cordon dividing them, shouting at citizens to move along and
waiting for the rest to disperse gradually.
   Mityunov said earlier the Democratic Union, which was set up in
May, held a sanctioned meeting for about four hours with 1,000
participants in Leningrad Friday.

<HEAD>Former Sen. Warren Magnuson Hospitalized with Heart Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Sen. Warren G. Magnuson, whose career in
Congress spanned 44 years, has been hospitalized after suffering a
slight heart attack, his wife said.
   Magnuson, 83, was taken to Swedish Hospital by ambulance after
being stricken Friday, said Jermaine Magnuson.
   Hospital spokeswoman Abbi Kaplan said the former senator was
responding to medication Saturday and his condition had stabilized.
   Magnuson suffers from diabetes, a condition which causes poor
circulation. In 1982, three toes on the senator's right foot were
amputated after becoming infected. In 1985, his right foot was
amputated because of circulation problems.
   Mrs. Magnuson said her husband began feeling sick Friday
afternoon and was diagnosed as having suffered a ``slight'' heart
attack Friday evening.
   He had been scheduled to receive the King County Man of the Year
Award from the King County Democrats that night, she said.
   ``His spirits are up,'' Mrs. Magnuson said. ``He always keeps
his sense of humor. He was telling the doctors, `Oh, here you guys
go poking on me again.'''
   Magnuson was first elected to Congress in 1936 and served four
terms, interrupted by eight months' service with the Navy in the
South Pacific during World War II. He won his Senate seat in 1944
and was re-elected five times before being defeated by Republican
Slade Gorton in 1980.
   Over his decades in the Senate, Magnuson rose to the
chairmanship of the Senate Commerce Committee and became the Senate
president pro tempore, third in line to the presidency behind the
vice president and speaker of the House.

<HEAD>Yeast Infection Remedy Nearly Burns Down House, Authorities Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST JORDAN, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman following a newspaper story's
advice to yeast infection sufferers tossed her underpants in the
microwave and sparked a fire, authorities say.
   Firefighters rushed to the woman's home in this south Salt Lake
County community of 27,000 on Friday morning and quickly
extinguished the flames, but not before her microwave oven was
destroyed and a nearby wall scorched, said County Fire Chief Don
Berry.
   Berry said when the embarassed woman explained how the fire
started, firefighters were hard-pressed not to laugh.
   ``It's one of those things that `Just when you think you've seen
everything ...,''' Berry said.
   However, Berry said the incident's humorous side was tempered by
its potential for developing into a serious fire if it had not
quickly been extinguished. There were no injuries.
   Berry said the woman, who was not identified, decided to
``cook'' her underpants after reading a news service article in a
local paper quoting University of Florida obstetrics and gynecology
researchers as saying the bacteria responsible for yeast infections
can be killed in a microwave oven in five minutes on the high-power
setting.
   The article emphasized the process only works on cotton
underpants, and also recommended the underwear be freshly laundered
and slightly damp.
   The woman was certain the underwear that caught on fire was 100
percent cotton, but fire officials believe they were probably of an
artificial material. If the underpants were indeed cotton, the
elastic material may have been to blame, they said.
   Berry said that after seeing what happened to the woman's
kitchen, he could not recommend the microwave process. ``I just
wouldn't do it,'' he said.
   The University of Florida article said yeast bacteria can also
be killed by soaking or boiling underwear in bleach, or by ironing.
Common detergents will not kill the bacteria.
   Antibiotics can fight the actual yeast infection, but women tend
to become reinfected, possibly from wearing contaminated underwear,
the article said.

<HEAD>Top Soviets Criticize Brezhnev Foreign Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top Soviet officials, including the military chief
of staff, said Saturday that serious mistakes were made in foreign
policy under the late Kremlin chief Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   The officials told reporters the Soviet Union allowed itself to
be provoked by the West, didn't consider political options before
resorting to force in conflicts and mishandled public relations.
   ``We were too carried away by polemics, scoring points, polemic
points, propaganda points. Indeed, the propaganda proponent very
often was in the way of real work,'' said Yuli M. Vorontsov, who
was a top official in the Foreign Ministry and ambassador to India
and France under Brezhnev. He became First Deputy Foreign Minister
in 1986.
   The unusual self-criticism came at a news conference to discuss
foreign policy issues on the agenda for Tuesday's 19th All-Union
Party Conference, a meeting of 5,000 Communist Party members who
will review Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's programs.
   A British reporter asked what foreign policy mistakes the Soviet
Union made during what Soviet officials refer to as ``the period of
stagnation'' _ the latter years of Brezhnev's 1964-1982 rule.
   During that period, the Soviet Union sent troops into
Czechoslovakia to quash reforms, responded to NATO's deployment of
medium-range missiles in Europe by deploying its own missiles, and
sent troops into Afghanistan.
   ``In the 70s and the early 80s, we used to be too forthright in
our reaction to the arms race pursued by the West,'' said Marshal
Sergei F. Akhromeyev, who held top military posts under Brezhnev
and was made chief of staff and deputy defense minister in 1984.
   But he said the West should share the blame for the arms race.
   ``It was the Reagan administration that started that in the
early 80s. I think we had to show more initiative in finding
political solutions, political ways of reacting to the dizzying
growth of the military budget in the United States,'' Akhromeyev
told reporters.
   Since coming to power in March 1985, Gorbachev has done an
about-face on several of Brezhnev's foreign policy moves. He signed
an accord with the United States to eliminate medium-range missiles
worldwide and started the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan. He has not directly criticized the invasion of
Czechoslovakia but has said each socialist country has the right to
develop independently.
   The Brezhnev Doctrine, the policy the Kremlin used to justify
the Czechoslovak invasion, holds that the Soviet Union has the
right to intervene in a threatened socialist country.
   Gorbachev, under his policy of ``glasnost,'' has encouraged a
reexamination of Soviet history to correct mistakes of the past.
   Andrei A. Gromyko, now the Soviet president, was in charge of
Soviet foreign policy as foreign minister for all of Brezhnev's
rule. Vorontsov was asked at Saturday's news conference if Gromyko
was to blame for foreign policy mistakes. Vorontsov refused to
criticize the 78-year-old diplomat.
   ``Mistakes, shortcomings, drawbacks in our foreign policy at the
time of stagnation certainly were related to people and the overall
spirit that reigned supreme at that time,'' Vorontsov said.
   ``All of us who worked at the foreign office at the time to
different, varying extents, depending on our responsibilities are
to blame for the mistakes and shortcomings of that time.''
   Yevgeny M. Primakov, head of the Institute of World Economy and
International Relations, said the ``major drawback'' in
Brezhnev-era Soviet foreign policy was not considering enough
options before a decision was taken.
   Alexander Bovin, a prominent political commentator, wrote June
15 in the government newspaper Izvestia that the Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan and the Soviet deployment of SS-20
missiles in Eastern Europe were examples of mistaken use of
excessive military force that damaged the Kremlin's international
prestige.

   Fire broke out on a subway train Saturday,
filling attached cars with smoke and causing panic among
passengers, police said. About 30 people were treated for smoke
inhalation.
   The conductor stopped the train after the fire broke out and
passengers were led on foot through the smoky tunnel, said a duty
officer at Milan's police office.
   The blaze was caused by a short circuit in the locomotive
engine, the duty officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
It was promptly put out.

<HEAD>Doctors To Debate Proposals On AIDS, Medicaid Reform At AMA
Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors will debate proposals for battling AIDS,
overhauling Medicaid and training a new type of bedside hospital
worker this week at the American Medical Association's annual
policymaking convention.
   Members of the AMA's House of Delegates, which convenes Sunday,
also plan to discuss a proposed ban on selling plastic handguns, a
move to put warning labels on alcoholic beverages and the
association's stand on mercy killing.
   The meeting, which runs through Thursday, is expected to attract
up to 2,000 doctors from across the country. The 420 delegates
represent the AMA's 295,000 members and act as a legislature,
setting policy for the nation's largest organization of physicians.
   The delegates will receive more than 75 reports on problems
ranging from child pornography to the health hazards of clove
cigarettes.
   They also will consider at least 155 resolutions on such issues
as the health risks of tanning parlors and ways to revamp the
nation's Medicare health insurance system for the elderly.
   ``AIDS, of course, is the biggest threatening health problem in
the United States,'' AMA president Dr. William Hotchkiss, a surgeon
from Chesapeake, Va., said last week. ``There is still considerable
debate that I think will take place over the issue of testing.''
   One resolution, proposed by a group of delegates from Ohio,
recommends requiring state and local health departments to contact
the sexual partners of anyone who tests positive for the AIDS virus.
   The proposal also recommends that all immigrants and inmates be
tested for the virus and calls for a national catastrophic health
insurance program for AIDS victims and legislation to protect them
from discrimination.
   The AMA Board of Trustees is proposing a major overhaul of
Medicaid, the nation's program for helping the poor pay for medical
care.
   An AMA report says the program, administered by state
governments, is fraught with ``severe inequities.'' Its calls for
expanding Medicaid to cover an additional 27 million people at or
below the poverty level now excluded because eligibility varies
from state to state.
   A battle may erupt over the AMA trustees' proposal to help
offset the nationwide shortage of nurses by creating a new class of
hospital workers to provide some bedside care to patients.
   Several nurses associations oppose the plan to create licensed
``registered care technologists.'' Under the plan, high school
graduates could begin caring for patients as assistant
technologists with two months' training. They could become basic
technologists with an additional seven months' training and
advanced technologists after nine more months of study.
   Their duties would include bathing patients, giving out
medication and changing bandages.
   ``This is in no way a substitute for nurses,'' Hotchkiss said.
``It is in addition to nurses.''
   Also up for debate are resolutions calling on the AMA to oppose
so-called mercy killing or euthanasia by doctors and ``refrain from
publishing articles which involve the taking of human life''
without stating the group's position.
   The Journal of the American Medical Association was criticized
earlier this year when it published an article by an unidentified
doctor describing how he ended the life of a terminally ill cancer
patient.

   A bomb destroyed a hotel in the center
of this northwestern frontier city Saturday and killed 13 people,
police said. Officials blamed government agents from neighboring
Afghanistan.
   Devout Moslems had just finished morning prayers shortly after
sunrise when the bomb exploded, tearing through the three-story
hotel and tearoom in the old section of the city, said Abdul Ahmed
Khan, assistant inspector of crimes.
   ``It collapsed just like a sandwich,'' said khan.
   Rescuers pulled out the bodies from the ruins of the hotel. Two
people survived nine hours under the rubble but died on the way to
the hospital, police said.
   Those killed included an Afghan woman and her 3-year-old child,
said Omar Amer, a Pakistani journalist who visited the scene. The
woman had come to Peshawar for medical treatment, he said.
   The blast injured four people. Three were treated and released
from the hospital. There was no word on the condition of the fourth.
   The seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance, which is fighting to
overthrow the Afghan government, has its headquarters in Peshawar,
30 miles from the Afghan border.
   The deputy inspector general of police, Kamal Shah, said
officers in the city regularly search of people, parcels and
vehicles and that terrorists target places such as hotels, where
baggage is seldom checked.
   Police said they suspected that agents of Afghanistan's
Communist government were responsible for the blast.
   ``Previously they have committed all these things,'' Khan said,
referring to dozens of terrorist bombings over the past two years
in Pakistan. Hundreds of Pakistanis and Afghan refugees have died
in the blasts.
   The chief minister of Peshawar province, Fazle Haq, told a press
conference that Pakistan's support for more than 3 million Afghan
refugees and Afghan guerrillas has made the area a target for
terrorists.
   But he promised Pakistan won't end its support for the
guerrillas, who also have received support from China and the
United States.
   On Friday, small explosive devices went off outside the
headquarters of two Afghan resistance parties but there were no
serious injuries, said Khan.
   Until Friday, Khan said Peshawar had been enjoying a respite
from terrorist bombings, which had become almost a weekly occurance
prior to the signing of the April 14 Geneva accord on the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.
   Under the Geneva accord, the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw its
troops over a nine-month period, beginning May 15 and ending Feb.
15, 1989. The withdrawal began on schedule.
   The Soviet-backed Kabul government said only Soviet troops, not
Soviet military advisers, will leave.

   Authorities confiscated more
than 500 pounds of cocaine after a light plane believed to be from
Colombia made a forced landing during a storm, police said Saturday.
   National Police press officer Vicente Ortiz said the seizure,
made Tuesday, was the biggest in Salvadoran history. He said
several people were under arrest, but he refused to provide their
names.
   The daily El Diario de Hoy, citing police sources, said six
Salvadorans and one Colombian were arrested.
   It said the plane's Colombian pilot landed the single-enging
Cessna during a storm Tuesday on a strip on a farm 40 miles west of
San Salvador.
   Police said the pilot, hampered by poor visibility, knocked down
electrical wires as he came in for a landing.
   Seventeen boxes, each with 30 pounds of cocaine, were
transferred from the plane to a panel truck with a double wall
designed to conceal cargo, they said.
   Authorities said the pilot told them where to find the truck.
They said they believe the cocaine was destined for the United
States.

<HEAD>Texas Treasurer Said To Be Choice For Democratic Keynote Speaker</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: CORRECTS dateline to Austin, restores dropped portion of
Kirk's name.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Treasurer Ann Richards, said to be
the Democratic Party's choice as keynote speaker for next month's
convention, confirmed Saturday she had talked with the party's
chairman about the job.
   Ms. Richards said in an interview with The Associated Press she
understood after talking Friday with Democratic Party Chairman Paul
Kirk that she was on a short list for consideration as keynote
speaker.
   ``I think that the purpose of Paul's call was to get a biography
and to make sure I would be available,'' Ms. Richards said, adding
that she told him she would be.
   Ms. Richards, 54, is known as a fiery populist with a quick wit.
She said she does not know why she would be considered for keynote
speaker, although she added, ``I'm sure the fact that I have been a
Democrat all my life and active in the party, and the fact that I
am the first female in Texas to hold public office statewide in 50
years'' played a part.
   Official announcement of the keynote speaker is expected to be
made early next week.
   The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, in their
combined Saturday editions, reported that two sources _ both
requesting anonymity _ said the party and likely nominee Michael
Dukakis have agreed on Ms. Richards. The New York Times reported in
Saturday's editions that Ms. Richards was the leading candidate for
the job.
   Kirk on Friday refused to confirm Ms. Richards' selection. But
Michael McCurry, the Democratic National Committee's press
secretary, said Kirk would not deny that Ms. Richards is on a short
list that he will discuss with party leaders this weekend.
   Ms. Richards' selection is designed to solidify the party's
support among women and to send political signals to the South and
to Texas, a critical state in the November presidential election,
the Atlanta newspaper said.
   It is a ``very positive thing'' for women to be allowed ``roles
of prominence and responsibility'' within a national party, Ms.
Richards said.
   ``Women are playing an increasingly important role in politics
in this country. They are, most of them, Democrats,'' she said.
   Ms. Richards said she could not speculate how being the
convention's keynote speaker would affect her decision to run for
governor in 1990.
   ``I'm always pleased to be recognized and to have an opportunity
for some visibility,'' she said.
   Other politicians who had been mentioned as potential keynote
speakers, such as Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, Sen. Dale Bumpers of
Arkansas and Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, also have been
considered leading choices for Dukakis' running mate.
   The keynote speech is to be the main event of the convention's
first night in Atlanta, July 18.
   Ms. Richards was elected to the first of two terms in 1982,
becoming the first woman to win statewide office in Texas in 50
years. As treasurer, she is the state's banker, responsible for
handling more than $150 billion in transactions each year.
   She served last year on Kirk's Democratic Policy Commission,
which conducted a lengthy study of major issues, and she seconded
Walter Mondale's presidential nomination at the 1984 convention in
San Francisco.
   A Waco native and former county commissioner, Ms. Richards holds
a bachelor's degree from Baylor University and attended graduate
school at the University of Texas at Austin.

   A public prosecutor will investigate a
crew of Polish and Hungarian film makers who burned alive about 30
sheep while making a movie, the state-run PAP news agency said
Saturday.
   The ``barbaric act'' was committed May 23 in the Krzystowka
Meadows near the Tatra National Park in southern Poland near the
Czechoslovak border, PAP said.
   Movie extras from the nearby tourist resort of Zakopane, local
highlanders and firefighters hired by the crew witnessed the
burning of the sheep during the shooting of a scene, PAP said.
   ``The wave of indignation and protests ... is growing,'' PAP
said. A department of the Krakow Agricultural Academy has written
the minister of culture demanding an inquiry to decide ``who should
be punished for this unprecendented act of barbarism,'' it said.
   Newspapers in the Krakow area have been deluged with similar
letters and the Krakow regional prosecutor has launched an
investigation, PAP said.
   The PAP account did not give the name or any other details about
the film being made.

<TEXT>
   South Korea observed the 38th
anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War on Saturday with
nationwide rallies denouncing Communist North Korea.
   Officials said hundreds of thousands of people, led by veterans
and anti-communist organizations, attended rallies and memorial
services across the country. No overall tally was available.
   Korea was divided in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops came to
facilitate the surrender of Japan, which had colonized the
peninsula for 36 years.
   The Korean War began June 25, 1950, when North Korean troops
poured across the dividing line. Three days later, they occupied
the capital of Seoul.
   U.N. forces, led by U.S. troops, supported South Korea, while
Chinese troops later sided with North Korea.
   Fighting raged until an armistice was signed on July 27, 1953.
At least 2 million military personnel and civilians were killed or
wounded.
   Bitter disputes have continued between the North and South since
then, with no peace accord and massive military forces in position
on both sides of a truce line that has been broken by sporadic
clashes.
   South Korean radical students, a small but vocal political
force, have pressed to reunify the two Koreas and demand the
removal of 42,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact.
   On Friday, Culture-Information Minister Chung Han-mo said the
government ``will deal harshly with ideological radicals
sympathetic with the principles and cause of the North Korean
Communists.''
   The radicals also are demanding that North Korea serve as a
co-host of the Olympic Games scheduled Sept. 17-Oct. 2 in Seoul.
   In recent years, anti-U.S. sentiment has been growing among
South Koreans, partly because of a steady campaign by radical
students and U.S. demands to open the South Korean market.
   Despite repeated denials by the U.S. government, radical
students have charged the United States with condoning repression
and supporting dictatorship in South Korea.

   Here are highlights of the drought and the heat wave Saturday:
   _Heat has been blamed for five deaths, three in Missouri and one
each in Georgia and Illinois.
   _Showers and thunderstorms were widespread during the night from
eastern Texas across southern Arkansas into the central Gulf coast.
More than 5.75 inches fell at Leakey, Texas, and Childersburg,
Ala., had torrential rain that flattened cornstalks and caused
street flooding.
   _Saturday was Chicago's third 100 degree-plus day this month,
the most in June since record-keeping began there in 1873. All 24
weather stations reporting Friday in Nebraska had highs of 100 or
more, including 110 at Valentine.
   _Milwaukee County, Wis., officials will decide by Monday whether
to eliminate fireworks for the Fourth of July because of the fire
danger. Some Wisconsin towns already have done so.
   _A forest fire was 65 percent contained after burning more than
27,000 acres in southeastern Montana and a small part of western
South Dakota. Another fire was contained in Wyoming after burning
more than 6,000 acres.
   _Southbound barges stuck on the Mississippi River since Tuesday
near Memphis, Tenn., were cleared through a newly dredged channel
and northbound barges began moving through. Traffic was limited on
the lower Ohio River, which also has required dredging.

<HEAD>Aquino Reported Ready to Let Marcos Return For Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino has agreed
to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the Philippines so that the
government can try him on charges of stealing billions of dollars,
newspapers said Saturday.
   The Manila Bulletin and The Manila Chronicle quoted Mrs.
Aquino's press secretary, Teodoro Benigno, as saying that Mrs.
Aquino made the assurance to two Swiss lawyers before she visited
Switzerland earlier this month.
   The reports did not say when criminal charges against Marcos,
Aquino's ousted predecessor, will be filed or when Mrs. Aquino will
allow him to return.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos into the Philippines,
citing security reasons. Marcos lives in exile in Hawaii.
   Mrs. Aquino's government has said it will file criminal charges
against Marcos, whom it has accused of stealing up to $10 billion
in government funds. But the government has not done so because of
Mrs. Aquino's refusal to let Marcos enter the country.
   Philippine law does not allow trial in absentia.
   Swiss lawyers are helping the Philippine government trace money
that Marcos and his family allegedly placed in Swiss bank accounts.
   Marcos has been living in Hawaii since he was toppled by the
civilian-military revolt that swept Mrs. Aquino to power in
February 1986.
   The Swiss government has frozen the assets of Marcos and his
associates and has not released information on them to the
Philippine government because of legal challenges posed by Marcos'
lawyers and Swiss banks.
   The unidentified Swiss lawyers said the information will not be
turned over ``unless and until there is an assurance that formal
charges will be filed against him,'' Benigno was quoted as saying.
   Swiss law allows the lifting of banking secrecy laws only in
case of criminal prosecution.
   Mrs. Aquino has said she would allow Marcos to return now only
if he and his family swore allegiance to her government and
returned the money he allegedly stole during his 20-year rule.
   She said later she would abide by any court decision if Marcos'
lawyers in the Philippines raised the matter of his return to the
courts.
   Benigno was quoted as saying that Mrs. Aquino ``has to accept
the possibility of Marcos returning home.''

   Police arrested 25 smugglers and seized
drugs worth an estimated $600,000 in the past two weeks, the
official Jordan news agency reported Saturday.
   It said police have seized 840 pounds of hashish and a half
pound of heroin in recent raids.
   The operation ``involved two gangs who were believed to be the
most dangerous in the region,'' said Jordan's anti-narcotics chief,
Col. Ghaleb Zou'bi.
   Zou'bi said the smugglers came from several countries and
included ``a number of Jordanians.'' He did not elaborate.
   Zou'bi has said previously that 90 percent of drug trafficking
cases in Jordan stemmed from the kingdom being used a transit point
for drugs shipped from Turkey to Arab countries.
   He said only a tiny proportion of the drugs were smuggled in for
sale in Jordan.

<TEXT>
   The bodies of four young Tamil men who
had been shot through the head and had their hands tied behind
their backs were found in the Jaffna Peninsula, military officials
said Saturday.
   The killings may have stemmed from rivalries among a half-dozen
Tamil militant groups, according to the officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The bodies were found Friday in Urumpirai, a village five miles
north of Jaffna and about 185 miles north of Colombo.
   The Jaffna Peninsula has been the chief stronghold of Tamil
rebels seeking independence or greater autonomy for their ethnic
minority. Tamils comprise about 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people.
   Indian peacekeeping troops have been trying to disarm the rebels
for nearly 11 months.
   Many Tamils say they are discriminated against by island
nation's Sinhalese majority, which dominates the government and
military. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population.
   The two ethnic groups speak different languages and also are
divided by religion. Most Sinhalese are Buddhists and most Tamils
are Hindus.
   India, Sri Lanka's northern neighbor, has a large Tamil
population of its own. It mediated an accord signed last July that
was aimed at ending the Tamil war in Sri Lanka. However, the main
rebel group has opposed the pact and refused to lay down its arms.

<HEAD>GOP Says Its Catching Up To Democrats, Former Candidates Praise
Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in 50 years, the Republican
Party is close to matching the Democrats in numbers, a party
adviser said Saturday, as former GOP presidential contenders
gathered to rally behind George Bush.
   Bush, meanwhile, urged Iowa Republicans by telephone from
Washington to help him and underscore the ``enormous differences''
he had with Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   ``The point is, I believe, if we can do that and do it with
integrity, the American people are going to see the clearest-cut
choice in an election since the McGovern-Nixon race in 1972,'' Bush
said. ``I think we need this fall to spell it out without tearing
him down personally.''
   Bush spoke to the Iowa Republican State Convention in Des Moines
through a telephone hookup from the nation's capital.
   He dismissed recent polls showing him trailing Dukakis, blaming
his poor showing on getting an early hold on the GOP nomination.
Since then ``the Republican message disappeared from the political
radar screen,'' Bush said.
   ``It just makes me realize just how ridiculous polls are in
early June,'' Bush said. ``The message is, don't worry about polls
in early June.''
   Robert Teeter, a Detroit-based pollster for the Bush campaign,
spoke to a Republican ``Unity'' planning session in Cincinnati,
which attracted Republican delegates from 24 states.
   He said that while polls still indicate the GOP is running
slightly behind the Democratic Party in popularity, ``the fact is,
we are doing a better job attracting the younger people.''
   Former GOP presidential hopefuls Pat Robertson, Senate Minority
Leader Robert Dole and Alexander M. Haig Jr., also addressed the
session, saying they would be surrogate speakers for Bush, the
certain Republican nominee.
   Teeter credited the baby boom _ people born during the
post-World War II expansion period _ for the increased party
membership. Since the 1984 election, 52 to 54 percent of the
Republican party members have been under age 40, Teeter said.
   ``For the first time in 50 years, we are going to compare really
close with the Democrats, going into this election,'' Teeter said.
   To win, however, Republicans must attract independents and some
Democrats as President Ronald Reagan did in the past two elections,
he said.
   ``The tax issue is the best issue we have,'' said Lee Atwater,
Bush's campaign manager, of the GOP attack on Dukakis, who has
endorsed a $115 million tax hike for his home state of
Massachusetts.
   Atwater, branding Dukakis as ``Tax Hike Mike,'' said ``I've
never met a voter yet who wanted his taxes raised.''
   Frank Donatelli, assistant to President Reagan for political and
inter-governmental affairs, criticized Dukakis, saying he wanted to
return to the ``weak-kneed foreign policy of the past,'' as opposed
to Reagan's success with ``foreign policy from strength.''
   The former candidates all pledged to work for Bush.
   ``This election may determine the destiny of the nation. This
party is destined to govern for the rest of the century,''
Robertson said.
   Dole said that the party needed unity to defeat Democrats.
   ``We make the speeches, you're going to have to do the work,''
Dole said. ``Think what it would be like if we lost. You probably
wouldn't want to get out of bed in the morning.''
   Haig branded Dukakis as a candidate of dangerous change.
   ``George Bush is the only candidate who can address the deficit.
He is the candidate of safe change. There is no other solution, and
God help us if Michael Dukakis wins. He is the candidate of radical
and dangerous change,'' Haig said.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Puerto Ricans Should Decide Commonwealth's Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said Saturday it
should be up to the people of Puerto Rico to settle the debate over
whether their commonwealth should retain its current status or opt
to become a state or for independence.
   Jackson said the Democratic Party platform should support
increased autonomy for Puerto Ricans, but that he wasn't taking
sides in the debate over whether it should no longer be a
commonwealth.
   Jackson, on the third day of his visit to Puerto Rico, met with
religious and political leaders on the island-municipality of
Vieques, where fishermen and activists have complained for years
about U.S. Navy shelling practices.
   He didn't call for the Navy to withdraw from the island or from
giant Roosevelt Roads Naval Station on Puerto Rico's east coast,
but said Puerto Ricans should have the right to make such a
decision. The Navy owns two-thirds of Vieques.
   ``When you are empowered you have the right to make such a
decision,'' Jackson said. ``It's up to the judgment of the people.''
   He said he looks ``forward to the day when Vieques is an island
of peace, when there will be peace exercises and not war
exercises.''
   ``Stop the shelling in Vieques,'' Jackson said at an ecumenical
peace service. ``We must not destroy the fish. We must not
shell-shock the children.''
   U.S. policy throughout the Caribbean should focus on economic
development, respect for self-determination and thwarting the drug
trade, he said.
   ``The Reagan-Bush policy has been one of invasion (referring to
the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada) and radical disregard for
self-determination and for human rights,'' he said.
   In the late 1970s and early 1980s there were frequents protests
in Vieques against Navy maneuvers that fishermen said ruined their
fishing and hurt tourism and economic development. The Navy four
years ago agreed to reduce the amount of bombing and maneuvers and
to spur economic development on Vieques.
   ``All the protests are in the past,'' said William Tapia, who
runs the Hotel Carmen.
   However, local officials said unemployment remains high,
reaching 40 percent or 50 percent at times.

<HEAD>Three Army Renegades Seized as Coup Plotters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops arrested three renegade
soldiers loyal to deposed President Ferdinand Marcos in a raid at
dawn on Saturday and found a plan to attack the capital's
international airport, police said.
   Police Lt. Col. Romeo Maganto said the men apprehended in an
apartment in Manila's Tondo slum district belonged to a group led
by former Lt. Col. Reynaldo Cabauatan, who was involved in coup
attempts against President Corazon Aquino's government.
   Mrs. Aquino was swept into the presidency by a popular
military-civilian uprising which drove Marcos into exile in
February 1986.
   Maganto said the three men seized _ John Sultan, Eric Reyes, and
Roberto Martinez _ were former army trainees who were absent
without leave. He said military authorities were trying to find out
if they were part of a group which raided the constabulary
headquarters armory in suburban Manila two weeks ago.
   Police said a 30-year-old woman, Tessie Liu, was found in the
same apartment and was taken in for questioning.
   Maganto said that besides documents, including the airport
attack plan, soldiers' uniforms, flag patches, miniature Philippine
flags and pamphlets of right-wing groups were found. Troops found
ammunition but no firearms, the officer said.
   Seven renegade soldiers were captured in a raid Monday on the
capital's outskirts. Armed forces chief of staf Gen. Renato de
Villa said the seven belonged to the ``Black Force Commando'' which
raided the constabulary camp.
   A military official said meanwhile on Saturday that five
guerillas were killed and an undetermined number were wounded when
military helicopters fired rockets on a communist rebel camp in
southern Surigao del Sur province.
   Army Lt. Col. Rodolfo Lorayes said in Cagayan de Oro that
Friday's air strike in Lianga town was the second in the province
this week. On Wednesday, two T-28 planes bombed the mountain
village of Diatagon, 12 miles from Lianga.
   Lorayes said the rockets hit five houses used as rebel sleeping
quarters. Troops recovered five bodies at the camp and civilians
living nearby said they saw retreating rebels carrying away wounded
comrades, he said.
   The military reported Saturday in Manila that immigration
authorities released a 22-year-old Dutch woman who was arrested
near a rebel zone after finding out she had proper identification
papers.
   Troops arrested the woman at a checkpoint in southern Agusan del
Norte province Wednesday on suspicion that she had links with
communist New People's Army guerrillas.
   The woman was the third foreigner arrested near a rebel zone
this month.

<HEAD>Diplomats Barred, Soviets Out of Embassy</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union on Saturday ordered Canada's
military attache to leave and barred seven former Canadian
diplomats from returning to the country in retaliation for Canada's
expulsion of Soviet diplomats.
   The Soviets also pulled 25 Soviet workers from Canada's Moscow
embassy.
   The official Tass news agency accused the Canadian military
attache, Larry Bowen, of ``engaging in activity that does not
correspond to his official status,'' diplomatic jargon for spying.
   Tass said a Soviet deputy foreign minister, Alexander
Bessmertynkh, told Canadian Ambassador Vernon Turner that the
Ottawa government had ``resorted to a new hostile action'' by
expelling the senior Soviet military attache and barring other
Soviet diplomats from returning.
   ``Unfortunately, they didn't heed ... our warning that if the
Canadian side moved on to further aggravate the situation, it could
expect immediate further retaliatory measures,'' Tass said.
   In Ottawa, Canada, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Joe Clark
called the latest Soviet move ``totally unwarranted.''
   ``This is viewed as a serious escalation in the matter and we
can't ignore it,'' said the spokesman, Paul Frazer.
   Clark announced Wednesday that eight Soviets had been expelled
and nine others previously assigned to Canada were barred from
returning. Canadian intelligence sources said the expulsions of
Soviets came after the Canadians discovered a Soviet spy ring.
   The Soviets retaliated the next day, expelling two Canadian
diplomats and barring three others from returning.
   Clark then kicked out the senior military attache at the Soviet
Embassy in Ottawa and barred a former second secretary from
returning.
   The Kremlin's withdrawal of 25 of its 39 Soviet workers at the
Canadian Embassy will affect daily business in Moscow, Frazer said.
   American diplomats did the cooking, cleaning, driving,
translating and errands at the U.S. Embassy and at the consulate in
Leningrad after Soviet authorities pulled out all 260 Soviet
employees in Moscow on Oct. 22, 1986 to retaliate for U.S.
expulsions of Soviet diplomats.
   Tass did not say whether Canada could replace the 25 Soviet
workers.
   Tass said the Soviet Union rejects spying charges leveled
against Soviets in Canada as ``ungrounded.''
   A Soviet deputy foreign minister, Yuri Vorontsov, told a news
conference Saturday that the Soviet retaliation was not a deviation
from Kremlin chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``new thinking'' in
foreign affairs.
   ``I think it's the Canadian leaders who sin by `old thinking'
when they undertake measures which cause surprise,'' Vorontsov
said. ``It looks like a soap opera to me.''
   ``The Soviet Union is a great power that cannot allow anybody to
insult it in this way with impunity. That was a totally unprovoked
insult and there should be a reaction,'' he said.
   Canadian intelligence sources said the alleged Soviet spy ring
was trying to infiltrate an electronics plant in Montreal where
naval weapons systems are built.

   A new campaign to get the Equal Rights
Amendment passed won't be limited to lobbying Congress and state
legislatures, leaders of the National Organization for Women said
Saturday.
   The ERA battle also will be fought at Social Security offices,
on college campuses and other places where women are treated
unfairly, NOW President Molly Yard said during the opening session
of the group's national conference.
   ``We need to invent new tactics to protest inequality,'' Yard
told about 500 NOW members.
   NOW has called on its local chapters to stage sit-ins at Social
Security offices to protest unequal distribution of benefits and at
college campuses, where women professors have a hard time getting
tenure and where predominantly male administrators are insensitive
to campus violence against women, she said.
   ``Our only guarantee against these things is to be included in
the Constitution,'' she said.
   ``We must keep the fire burning and keep those who perpetuate
inequality uncomfortable,'' said former NOW president Eleanor
Smeal. ``The way we are going to pass this amendment is not to
worry about what people think of us.''
   The ERA was approved by only 35 of the necessary 38 states
before a 10-year time limit expired in 1982.
   NOW's new campaign for ERA passage officially begins Thursday
with a rally in Washington. The group hopes to give Congress a
petition with 100,000 signatures.
   The group's leaders say the Reagan administration has been
hostile to their cause, so the end of President Reagan's term makes
the time right for passage of the amendment. Recent national polls
indicate as much as 75 percent of American voters support ERA, they
said.
   In addition to more active protesting, NOW will expand its
efforts to get women elected to local political offices.
   Alice Cohan, NOW's political director, said ERA supporters have
learned that they need to put ERA sympathizers in power, ``so them
is us.''
   Fewer than 5 percent of the nation's congressional
representatives and only 15 percent of state legislators are women,
she noted.
   Pat Frank, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from
Florida, told NOW members that supporting female candidates is
effective even if they don't win. Frank said their campaigns focus
attention on issues such as pay equity, day care and social
services.
   Former congresswoman and presidential candidate Shirley Chisholm
is scheduled to address the conference Sunday.

   The Air Force's offer of $50,000 to the
parents of a woman killed when one of its jets slammed into a hotel
is an outrage, says a lawyer who is an expert on wrongful death,
but the Air Force says its offer is consistent with state law.
   Indiana law provides little in the way of damage payments when a
single person dies, which the woman's family criticized as
discriminatory.
   Robert and Harriet Goldberg of Indianapolis already have
rejected the Air Force's offer, which doubled the original $25,000
sum, and say they may take the matter to court.
   They had been seeking $6.5 million in damages for the death of
their daughter, Beth L. Goldberg, 30.
   She was among 10 people killed Oct. 20 when the Air Force A-7
fighter jet crashed into the lobby of the Ramada Inn Airport, where
she worked. The pilot, who was from Nellis Air Force Base in
Nevada, ejected from the craft before it crashed and was not
seriously injured.
   Stanley M. Chesley, a Cincinnati-based lawyer who specializes in
multiple death cases, is not involved in the Goldbergs' case but
said the $50,000 offer was ridiculous.
   ``Just because someone isn't married doesn't mean their life
isn't worth anything,'' he said in a telephone interview Friday.
``There's only one way to get a full settlement: Take it to the
courthouse.''
   Under Indiana's wrongful death law, a court can award damage
payments to parents if a minor child dies, and to the spouse or
other financial dependents of an adult who dies. However, only
medical, funeral and estate administration costs can be collected
when an adult dies who had no financial dependents.
   Many of the jet crash victims had dependent families, but Ms.
Goldberg was single.
   ``Based on Indiana law, that's an amount that's consistent in
this type of situation,'' said Maj. Derence V. Fivehouse of the Air
Force aviation litigation section. ``If we did somebody harm, we
pay them what we owe them by state law. That's my mandate.''
   As of Friday, the Air Force had settled 98 of the 108 claims
filed, said Fivehouse. He refused to say what size settlements were
being offered to families of other victims.
   ``Only people with dependents are entitled to love and
affection? She was such a vital part of our family,'' Goldberg said
of his daughter, the oldest of the couple's three daughters.
   ``Indiana law needs to be changed because our wrongful death law
is so archaic,'' Goldberg said. ``I feel we have a moral obligation
to pursue it. Nothing in the way of a settlement is going to bring
our daughter back.''
   Fivehouse said the Goldbergs were given a July 1 deadline to
consider the settlement offer so that the proceedings would not
stall. After Friday, the family will be sent a letter acknowledging
their rejection of the $50,000 offer.
   The Goldbergs then will have six months to continue negotiations
or file suit, Fivehouse said. ``It appears that's what they want,''
he added.
   Goldberg said the family would be willing to lower the claim,
but plans to file a lawsuit if an agreement isn't reached in the
next month.
   The Goldbergs' $6.5 million claim figure was based on the amount
of money their daughter would have made during her career, the
family's emotional devastation and the cost of psychiatric
counseling for Ms. Goldberg's survivors. Ms. Goldberg was a sales
representative at the hotel.
   Chesley has represented families of victims in the 1980 MGM
hotel fire in Las Vegas, Nev., that killed 84 people, and the 1977
Beverly Hills Supper Club fire in northern Kentucky that killed 164.
   Settlements for the claims in the MGM fire ranged from $1
million to $2 million for single individuals and $7 million to $9
million for people with dependents, Chesley said.

<HEAD>Iran Admits Retreat from Majnoon, Claims Iraq Used Chemical
Weapons</HEAD>

   Iraq said Saturday its forces recaptured
two islands in its southern Howeizah marshes, held by Iran since
1984, and inflicted the third defeat in nine weeks on its foe in
the Persian Gulf war.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, claimed the Iraqis used
chemical weapons to push enemy troops off the islands, one of
Iran's only footholds on Iraqi soil. The islands are mud and sand
mounds linked by causeways and floating bridges.
   A communique read over Baghdad Radio said the Majnoon islands,
about 270 miles southeast of Baghdad near the Iranian border, were
under Iraqi control by noon after a few hours of fighting.
   Iran admitted that its troops withdrew to ``new defensive
positions'' in the face of an assault by ``massive Iraqi forces.''
The Iranians stopped short of conceding the loss of the islands.
   The wording of the reports was similar to when the Iraqis
recaptured the southern Faw Peninsula on April 18 and drove the
Iranians out of their hard-won bridgehead at Salamcheh, near the
southern city of Basra, on May 25.
   If the Iranians were pushed out of Majnoon, their only hold in
Iraq would be in Iraq's northern Kurdistan mountains. But by all
accounts, the Iraqis have been active in attacking that area in
recent days.
   Iran occupied the Manjoon area, part of the 1,000-square-mile
Howeizah marshes, in 1984. The Iraqis have about 50 oil wells
there, but these were capped early in the nearly 8-year-old war.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said Iraqi
warplanes and helicopter gunships flew hundreds of combat missions
on Saturday in support of the attack on Majnoon. The agency said
the offensive was launched before dawn.
   It said the air strikes inflicted heavy troop and armor losses
while destroying Iranian field headquarters and two anti-aircraft
missile batteries.
   The report quoted military communiques as saying fighter-bombers
also hit the Hamid military base east of the battle zone and
knocked out a bridge in the same area to prevent the Iranians from
sending in reinforcements.
   Iraqi infantry units, supported by tanks, cut an embankment
linking the islands with the Iranians reinforcements, which were
advancing, the agency reported.
   The report said Iraqi troops attacked the islands from the north
and south. It said hundreds of Iranian corpses were floating in the
marshes as the Iranians retreated.
   Tehran Radio said the islands were defended mainly by the Badr
Division, a unit of dissident Iraqi Shiite Moslem rebels opposed to
the Baghdad regime and armed by Iran.
   But reliable Western military sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Iraqis had 2,000 tanks and 600 artillery pieces
for Saturday's offensive. The Iranians, they said, only had about
60 tanks and a handful of artillery guns.
   Baghdad Radio said jubilant Iraqis marked the victory by firing
a 21-gun salute in the capital and with nationwide celebrations.
   The Iraqis' aggressive offensives have marked a dramatic switch
in strategy _ until April, they have fought the war only from
behind their formidable Soviet-style defense lines.
   An Iraqi diplomatic source in London told The Associated Press
by telephone last week that an assault on Majnoon was imminent.
   ``When we take Majnoon we'll have more or less recaptured all
the land taken by the Iranians. Then we'll be able to negotiate
with them as equals,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The Iraqis have said for two years they were prepared to
negotiate an end to the war that neither side appeared capable of
winning outright. But Tehran has vowed to fight until Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, whose army invaded Iran in September 1980
after border skirmishes, is toppled.

<HEAD>Ex-U.S. Envoy Warns Of Heightened Tensions if Syria Deploys
Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Samuel Lewis
on Saturday warned of a dangerous step-up in Middle East tensions
if Syria deploys new surface-to-surface missiles it reportedly is
buying from China.
   ``I think one of the most worrisome things about the Middle East
for the next three or four years is this rising technology level
and particularly missile technology,'' said Lewis, the ambassador
to Israel from 1977-1985, on Israel radio.
   ``It raises the stakes a great deal and the next time tensions
rise _ unless we can get a peace process relaunched _ I think this
is a period of some danger in the region.''
   Newsweek magazine quoted an unidentified Reagan administration
official last week as saying China planned to sell Syria its newest
M-9 missiles, which have a range of 372 miles.
   Syria can already hit most of Israel's territory with its
Soviet-made Frog-7, SS-1 and SS-21 surface-to-surface missiles that
have a range of 37, 160 and 62 miles respectively.
   But Israeli reports said the M-9 missiles could be placed deeper
inside Syrian territory, making retaliation more difficult.
   ``I can certainly understand why the prospect of a sale of a new
missile to Syria would cause great worries here,'' Lewis said.
   ``I'm sure that it will be, if it is not already, a matter of
serious discussion between the United States and China ... but how
much real effect we would have on Chinese decisions I'm very
skeptical.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's top aide, Yossi Ben-Aharon, said
on Israel radio he had no confirmation that Syria purchased the
M-9s. But he said Israel was deeply concerned about any missiles
Syria possesses.
   ``Now you know the Syrians have missiles of their own from the
Russians ... and they have developed a chemical warfare
capability,'' Ben-Aharon said.
   ``In other words, there is a source of threat, very formidable .
.. We are concerned to a very large extent over these
developments.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin is visiting the United States and
is expected to raise the Chinese missile sale issue with U.S.
officials.
   Ben-Aharon said Israel's response to the reported sale should be
``military and political and diplomatic.''
   ``With regard to the military, we have to exercise, to invest
maximum effort in order to develop the kind of countermeasures that
would neutralize this threat,'' he said.
   Ben-Aharon did not elaborate. However, army chief of staff Lt.
Gen. Dan Shomron warned last week that Israel would respond to the
deployment of Syrian missiles in various ways, including attacks on
missile sites.

<HEAD>State Of Arkansas Apparently Owns Old Boats, Lawyer Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Arkansas apparently has a
claim to five old wooden boats discovered on the bed of the
drought-shrunken Mississippi River, a lawyer who represents the
vessels' four discoverers said Saturday.
   But if the state doesn't claim the boats, which were found last
weekend about 100 yards from the river's Arkansas side, the four
West Memphis men ``would probably have a superior claim over
anybody else,'' said attorney Davis Lofton.
   State Attorney General Steve Clark said Saturday that the state
would likely pursue clarification of ownership of the boats, which
one of the discoverers said may date to the 1840s. ``But it depends
on what the value is. It's not their dollar value that's so
important, but the historical value,'' Clark said, adding that he
was not familiar with the find.
   Don Spears said Saturday that he and three friends found the
boats while walking along river bottom that has become exposed and
cracked because of the drought that has lowered the river 20 feet.
The boats were about a half-mile from the bridge connecting West
Memphis to Memphis, Tenn, Spears said.
   ``It was a total surprise,'' said Spears, 42, adding that he has
long heard tales of the Mississippi concealing sunken boats. ``I
think this needs to be preserved. It's history.''
   The age of the boats hasn't been determined, he said.
   Lofton said his clients also wouldn't mind ``the possibility of
making some money off of it.''
   However, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987, which President
Reagan signed on April 28, puts boats submerged in navigable waters
in possession of the federal government, in trust for the state in
which the vessels are found, Lofton said.
   A state archaeologist who examined the vessels last week didn't
seem to think Arkansas would be interested in preserving them,
Lofton said.
   ``That's why I want to read this law,'' Lofton said. If the
state decides it doesn't want the boats, his clients ``are
investigating the possibility of dealing with some sort of salvage
company that has the capability of doing this.''
   Spears said he and his friends _ Dick Suiter, Larry Samples and
Chuck King _ were willing ``to just leave this matter up to time
right now,'' to see if the state lays claim to the boats.
   ``This is very valuable,'' Suiter said. ``We're not out to get
somebody to grease our palms. This is something that Arkansas
should be proud of. It could make an archaeological museum that
could bring in millions of dollars in tourist traffic.''
   The Commercial Appeal at Memphis offered a theory Saturday about
how the boats sank, quoting two local amateur river historians,
Kenneth Marquis and Mike Butler, as saying they may have gone down
in a 1918 ice storm.
   The best-preserved of the five vessels may be a coal barge that
dates to the 1880s, the pair said.
   Columnist William Thomas also reported that ``veteran
river-watchers say the wrecks have been exposed before _ last year,
a salvage worker used a torch to cut the metal cleats off one of
the boats.''
   Suiter discounted the ice storm theory. ``If they had been in
this storm, the boats would have been crushed, and they're not,''
he said in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>Watch Tells Moslems When To Pray</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. company has designed a
wristwatch that alerts Moslems when it's time to pray and even
shows them the direction of the holy city of Mecca from 120 cities
around the world, a newspaper said Saturday.
   An alarm sounds 10 minutes before each day's five prayer
periods, the English-language Saudi Gazette said.
   The actual time is dictated by the position of the sun,
according to the Koran, Islam's holy book, which also decrees that
the faithful should face Mecca while praying.
   Traditionally, the five daily prayer calls are made by muezzins,
or priests, who summon the faithful from minarets attached to
mosques.
   Nowadays, prayer periods are published by newspapers and
broadcast by radio and television stations in Moslem countries.
   The watch has been developed by Sysorex International, a
computer systems company based in Mountain View, Calif., the
newspaper said.
   The Gazette quoted Abdullah Saadan, the Sysorex agent in the
Middle East, as saying the watch communicates in both Arabic and
English and gives both Gregorian and Hijra, or Islamic calendar,
dates.
   To overcome differences between Moslem scholars over how prayer
times should be determined, Saadan said the times programmed into
the watch have been approved by several Islamic bodies.
   The watch comes in various models ranging in price from $85 to
$115, the newspaper said.

   One day after facing severe criticism from
Jewish leaders, Pope John Paul II on Saturday cited Jews and
Christians killed by the Nazis and called the victims' suffering
``a gift to the world.''
   The Jewish leaders said they objected to the omission of any
specific reference to Jewish suffering in the pontiff's speech
during his visit Friday to the former Mauthausen death camp.
   Roman Catholic relations with the Jews have dominated the
pontiff's second visit to this Alpine nation, which is observing
the 50th anniversary of its annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938.
   In Vienna, 50 protesters disrupted a theater performance of
``The Deputy,'' a play highly critical of the role of Pope Pius XII
in dealing with the Nazis. The protesters said it was improper to
stage the play during the pontiff's visit to Austria.
   John Paul traveled Saturday to the town of Lorch, 25 miles from
the Czechoslovak border.
   ``Not far from here is Mauthausen, where Christians, Jews and
others were persecuted for many reasons, including their
religion,'' he told 80,000 people at a prayer service. ``Their
suffering was a gift to the world.''
   The pontiff on Friday visited Mauthausen, Austria's most
notorious Nazi death camp, where thousands of Jews were among the
110,000 inmates who perished.
   Late Saturday, the pope said Mass before 60,000 faithful in the
town of Gork, about 35 miles from the Yugoslav border, before going
to Salzburg to spend the night.
   ``Unfortunately today in Europe, even in your regions, the
ancient roots of faith are threatened in various ways,'' the
pontiff said, turning briefly from German to Italian in his homily.
   He continued: ``Christians must, however, react as a community
to this challenge. They must unite even more and stay even closer
together.''
   As he was leaving the Mass and waving to the crowd, the
gold-robed pontiff caught his foot on a walkway and stumbled
slightly. An aide rushed up and kept the pope from falling.
   John Paul's speech at Mauthausen prompted immediate criticism.
   ``The failure of Pope John Paul to make any specific reference
to the suffering of the Jews while visiting the site of the
infamous Mauthausen concentration camp is a matter of deep shock to
the Jewish community,'' said Elan Steinberg, executive director of
the World Jewish Congress.
   The president of the Austrian Jewish Community, Paul Grosz,
added: ``We had hoped that the pope would evoke in a clear manner
the particularly tragic character of the Jewish situation in the
context of the Holocaust.''
   An estimated 6 million Jews died during Nazi rule.
   The pontiff cited four concentration camp victims by name, all
of them Roman Catholics.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro told reporters Saturday that
the pontiff had no intention of slighting Jews. Navarro said the
pontiff mentioned the Jews who died at Mauthausen during a brief
stop at a memorial plaque set up in their memory.
   On Thursday, the pontiff met with President Kurt Waldheim
despite protests from some Jewish leaders. The Austrian president
has faced allegations of complicity in Nazi war crimes but denied
wrongdoing.
   The pope spent Friday night in Salzburg, a scenic city in
northwestern Austria. He has been delivering his speeches in German
throughout the trip.
   In Lorch, John Paul cited concerns of workers and farmers in the
area. Many of the farmers in the far northern region are having
trouble staying in business, often forced to take second jobs to
make ends meet.
   ``The church stands by you when you have social and economic
problems,'' the white-robed pontiff said during the outdoor prayer
service.
   The Polish-born pope frequently has called for respect for
workers' rights and warned about the potential dangers of
unbridled, profit-motivated capitalism.
   ``These are times when the hour of darkness seems to have
descended upon us,'' John Paul said. ``We hear daily of wars and
suppression, deprivation of rights and catastrophes.''
   Before he spoke, several local farmers and workers had stood
before the pontiff to tell him of the economic difficulties they
have been facing.
   About 85 percent of Austria's population of 7.5 million people
is Roman Catholic.
   During the play late Friday night, about 50 protesters stood up
during the performance. ``This whole play is a just a lie,'' they
shouted.
   Police intervened and took two of the protesters into custody.
   Rolf Hochhuth's play alleges that then-Pope Pius XII failed to
do enough to prevent the Holocaust.

   The strawberry shortcake was anything but
short Saturday as cooking school students put together a 216-foot
version of the summertime goodie.
   ``Rush! Speed! Speed!'' shouted Tammy Wood, a second-year
student at the New England Culinary Institute, as teams began
building what they hope will be officially recognized as the
world's largest strawberry shortcake.
   First down on the tables were the 31 sheet pans of shortcake cut
into 4-inch-wide strips. Next went about 7,200 strawberries, and
finally, 18 gallons of whipped cream.
   ``Step back, I need a picture of this,'' roared Richard Wobby,
the event's organizer, before the whipped cream went on. He also
brought the world its longest dish of maple sugar on snow in Barre
two years ago, a quarter-mile-long affair.
   As the students put the finishing touches on their cake, the
rain picked up, and the crowd lining the sidewalks rushed to the
center of State Street for one, or maybe more, of the 2,400 pieces.
   The largest strawberry shortcake, according to Wobby's research,
was 6 feet in diameter. By square footage, Saturday's
long-and-narrow version was considerably larger, Wobby said.
   There is currently no separate entry in the Guinness Book of
World Records for largest strawberry shortcake, but the students
are hoping to get recognition.
   ``It's a good gag,'' Wobby said. ``It's something we'll think
start thinking about and say, `That's impossible.' Then, all of a
sudden, the blood just turns on, and we find we have the motivation
to do it, and we do it.''

   A pet monkey named Bubba who escaped from a
basement window and eluded police for three hours finally made a
monkey out of everyone when he went home on his own, police said.
   The 2-foot-long spider monkey apparently escaped Thursday
afternoon by tearing through a screen window, said Albert
Droscoski, a Suffolk County police spokesman.
   The mischievous primate proceeded to shred the screens on
neighbors' windows, and chased some of the neighborhood children,
Droscoski said.
   When police arrived, Bubba mocked their efforts to capture him
by jumping on top of the police car. A police emergency services
unit tried to lasso him, but managed only to tree him in his own
back yard.
   After about three hours, Droscoski said, ``he made a monkey out
of everybody else. He decided to get back into the house through
the same basement window.''
   The monkey's owner was not at home at the time.

   A thousand smiling folks said good
morning to the nation and posed for a ``family portrait'' on Main
Street as a gesture of community spirit aimed at getting a new
prison to boost the town's economy.
   ``It shows they had pride in Canon City,'' said Don Packard,
mayor of the town of some 12,000 people. ``It was hot but I didn't
hear a complaint about the heat.''
   Packard and the portrait's organizers said they were pleased
with the turnout for the event, which was aimed at creating a sense
of community pride.
   The crowd waved and shouted ``Good Morning, America!'' for
photographers, and the high school band played.To wind things up, a
banner was unfurled carrying a message to the Federal Bureau of
Prisons, asking officials to consider Fremont County as a prison
site.
   ``Communities are out of the habit of doing things like this,''
Packard said. ``We are trying to build up the habit of going down
and participating in community events.''
   Organizers' next scheme to drum up enthusiasm about downtown
Canon City? An ``ugly pickup truck contest.''

   Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar
Velayati, says talks are under way with Canada to normalize
diplomatic relations, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Saturday.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Velayati gave no details of the
negotiations with Ottawa but stressed that Tehran wants no
relations with countries that oppose its policies.
   He did not elaborate, IRNA said, but he noted that Iran restored
links with France this month after an 11-month rupture and said
relations with Britain, strained for years, have ``relatively
improved.''
   A British parliamentary delegation visited Tehran last week to
discuss ways of improving ties.
   IRNA said Velayati spoke Friday in an interview.
   Canada closed its embassy in Tehran in 1980 after Canadian
diplomats sheltered several Americans who had escaped from the U.S.
Embassy when it was stormed by Iranian militants in November 1979.
   The Canadians helped smuggle the Americans out of Iran.
   Ottawa has retained diplomatic relations with Iran, with the
Danish Embassy in Tehran handling its interests.
   Philip Engs, a Canadian engineer arrested on spying charges in
Iran, was released in February last year after two months in jail.
   Iran, isolated diplomatically and put on the defensive after a
string of military defeats in its war with Iraq, is making clear
efforts to improve its links with Western states.

   A cold front brought lower temperatures to the northern Plains
on Saturday after days of record heat, but more than 30 record
highs were posted as the hot air moved across the Ohio Valley.
   Temperatures across the northern Plains were 15 to 25 degrees
cooler than Friday, but there was no relief from the drought across
the region.
   Temperatures across the lower Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley
were 15 to 25 degrees warmer than on Friday. The hottest official
temperature across the lower 48 states was 106 at Elkhart, Ind.
   Relief was in sight as the cold front was moving southeastward
across the Great Lakes and Sunday temperatures were expected to be
in the upper 70s and low 80s.
   High wind toppled trees and power lines in southeastern
Michigan. Nearly 10,000 Detroit Edison Co. customers, including
about 7,000 in Oakland County, were without electrical service
Saturday afternoon, spokeswoman Lorie Kessler said.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across central and
southern parts of Texas into parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas and
Louisiana.
   Thunderstorms also developed over much of the eastern half of
Alabama and northeastern Florida.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered from the central
California coast into much of Oregon and eastern Washington. Some
of the thunderstorms were capable of producing brief heavy rain,
gusty wind and hail over eastern Oregon.
   Showers and thunderstorms moved across parts of eastern New York
state and northern Vermont, dumping more than 1.75 inches of rain
at Peru, N.Y., and more than an inch at Burlington, Vt.
   Thunderstorms developed across parts of northeastern and central
Colorado. A tornado touched down briefly near Watkins during the
afternoon but did not cause any damage.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., and Santa Fe, N.M., to 106 at
Elkart, Ind. The low for the day was 40 at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from New England through the middle Atlantic states and the central
Gulf Coast into Florida. Scattered showers and thunderstorms also
were forecast across the Pacific Northwest to the northern Rockies.
   Highs in the 60s were predicted over northwestern Washington
state; in the 70s along the Pacific Coast into parts of the rest of
the Pacific Northwest, and from the upper Great Lakes through
northern parts of the Ohio Valley into New England; in the mid to
upper 90s from the central Rockies through the central and southern
Plains into much of the Southeast states; between 100 and 110
across the desert Southwest; and in the 80s or 90s across much of
the rest of the nation.

   Police on Saturday arrested 30
soccer fans in connection with violent clashes and other offenses
surrounding the finale of the European Championships between the
Netherlands and the Soviet Union.
   A Munich police spokesman said most of the fans arrested were
Dutch. He said a Swiss man and several West Germans were also in
custody after incidents early Saturday.
   Police said those arrested faced charges of assault, theft,
resisting arrest and destruction of property.
   Many arrests followed clashes in downtown Munich, police said.
   Police said 60 drunk fans were turned away from Munich's soccer
stadium before the game.
   The Netherlands won the match 2-0. No major clashes were
reported after the game.
   ``In general, we're satisfied with the situation,'' said a
police official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Most of the
fans are peaceful.''
   The rowdies involved in Saturday's early clashes had been
drinking heavily in the city's beer garden district, police said.
   More than 3,500 police officers were on duty in Munich to
prevent massive outbreaks of violence.
   A capacity crowd of 72,000 was on hand for Saturday's
championship game. About 35,000 Dutch fans attended the match.
   Police said they charged eight people with ticket scalping
outside the stadium. The men were offering single tickets at prices
up to $880, police said.
   More than 800 fans have been arrested as a result of violence
that erupted in many West German cities since the championship
series began June 10.

Gulf island to be loaded aboard a specially built cargo vessel that
will take it back to the United States.
   The 3,600-ton frigate was severely damaged when it hit a
submerged Iranian mine April 14. It underwent preliminary repairs
at a Dubai shipyard and will be rebuilt in the United States, U.S.
officials say.
   The Mighty Servant 2, a 25,743-ton Dutch cargo ship chartered by
the Navy to carry the Roberts, was anchored off Abu Nu'ayr island,
60 miles west of Dubai.
   It was to be partially submerged to allow the frigate to be
floated onto its deck.
   The tricky loading operation was in danger of being delayed by
rough seas, gulf-based shipping sources reported, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
   Three-foot swells were reported off Abu Nu'ayr, they said.
   Associated Press photographer Greg English said the Samuel B.
Roberts, which nearly sank after the mine ripped a 25-foot gash in
its hull, ``looked normal'' as it was towed from Dubai's busy port
by the tugboat Tornado.
   He said the frigate was about 12 miles from its rendezvous with
the Mighty Servant 2 when the towline was lost, and the frigate
continued under its own auxiliary power.
   Most of the frigate's 225 crewmen have returned to the United
States, but 30 stayed behind to go home with the ship.
   The blast, which wounded 10 crewmen, occurred as the ship tried
to back out of what U.S. officials said was a newly laid minefield
in a main shipping channel 50 miles northeast of Qatar.
   The United States retaliated four days later with attacks on two
Iranian oil platforms, triggering daylong naval clashes in which
six Iranian vessels were sunk or damaged.
   Although Abu Ny'ayr is in an area where Iranian gunboats have
attacked commercial shipping, the sources said a 5-mile ``exclusion
zone'' was in effect around the island.
   Another U.S. frigate, the Elmer Montgomery, was on guard duty in
the area, they reported. English said the Italian frigate Espero
was also in the area.
   The U.S. Navy says the Roberts will go first to its home port at
Newport, R.I., and then to the Bath, Maine, shipyard where it was
launched two years ago.
   U.S. officials denied reports the ship was judged a ``writeoff''
and will be scrapped.
   ``The USS Samuel B. Roberts is going to Bath Iron Works to be
repaired, period,'' said Cmdr. Mark Baker, a Navy spokesman at the
Pentagon.
   His comment followed a report in Britain's Guardian daily
quoting ``foreign naval sources'' in the United Arab Emirates as
saying the ship ``has a broken back,'' with only its electronics
gear salvageable.
   The Guardian said the ship was kept in drydock to ``prevent the
full extent of damage from being revealed,'' possibly leading to
Congress conducting a new inquiry into the U.S. role in the gulf.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, quoted the newwspaper as saying the ship's return home was
a cover-up to conceal the loss of the $300 million vessel.
   U.S. officials said the day the frigate was mined that its back
was broken by the blast, which wrecked the engine room, triggering
fires and flooding.
   They later said the ship was saved only by the crew's actions
and by its having been at general quarters, with watertight doors
closed, when it hit the mine.
   U.S. officials also said the Samuel B. Roberts was taken to
Dubai because it had a shipyard facility capable of handling the
preliminary repair work.
   Iran has not acknowledged laying the mine.
   But U.S. officials said several other mines found and destroyed
in the area were identical with Iranian mines found earlier in the
gulf. They said the latest ones bore no marine growth, indicating
they had been in the water only a few days.

   A Puerto Rican separatist wanted in the
United States has been granted political asylum in Mexico and
paroled after serving five years of an eight-year murder sentence,
news reports said Saturday.
   William Morales, 37, was released from prison at 9 a.m. Friday,
but authorities did not confirm it until late afternoon, the
reports in the leftist newspapers La Jornada and Uno mas Uno said.
   The United States wanted him extradited to serve out a prison
sentence on weapons and explosives charges. But Mexico decided this
month that his was a political case not covered by the extradition
treaty between the two countries.
   U.S. officials say Morales is a bomb maker for the Puerto Rican
separatist group, Armed Forces of National Liberation, or FALN. He
was convicted in 1979 after an explosion at a clandestine bomb
factory New York. The explosion shattered his arms and left him
badly disfigured.
   Morales escaped from the prison ward of Bellevue Hospital in New
York a month after he was sentenced to a 29- to 89-year prison term
on on state charges and up to 10 years on federal charges.
   He made his way to Mexico, where he was taken into custody in
1983. He was sentenced for his role in the death of one policeman
and the wounding of another on May 26, 1983, near the central city
of Puebla, and for entering Mexico illegally.
   La Jornada, which has been following Morales' case closely,
reported that federal Interior Department immigration agents took
charge of the prisoner after his release.
   All government offices were closed Saturday and it was not
possible to learn Morales' whereabouts.
   The competing Uno mas Uno newspaper quoted a city government
statement as saying that the parole was granted after 5 years and
27 days, in agreement with policies that allow release for
prisoners who have served two-thirds of their sentence.
   La Jornada's original report on the Mexican government decision
quoted a resolution signed by Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda
as saying that Morales was granted asylum on grounds he was a
``political fighter.''
   It said the resolution concludes that Morales ``did not arrive
at producing harm to society or any individuals in particular,
except those he inflicted upon himself.''
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed the report on the
resolution.
   In a phone interview with The Associated Press after the Foreign
Ministry's decision was announced, Morales said it was ``a
political recognition of our fight'' for independence.
   The U.S. Embassy said it was ``disturbed that Mexico would
consider a convicted felon worthy of the status of a political
refugee.''

   The Canadian-managed cargo ship
Irving Forest collided with the gas drilling rig Glomar Labrador
off Yorkshire, northeast England, and 45 men were evacuated from
the platform, the coast guard said Saturday.
   No injuries were reported in the incident early Thursday, the
coast guard said, and although both the platform and the ship were
damaged, the 6,000-ton coaster Irving Forest was able to continue
on its way to Rotterdam.
   One leg of the drilling platform, under charter to Amoco Oil,
was damaged, but the Daily Telegraph quoted a company spokesman as
saying the rig should be operational again soon.
   The Irving Forest had left Hartlepool, at the mouth of the River
Tees, with a cargo of wood pulp when it struck the Glomar Labrador
at 2:45 a.m. 20 miles off Bridlington, said an unidentified
spokesman for the coast guard marine coordination center in
Bridlington.
   The center summoned a standby boat, the Blue Flame 1, from the
adjacent Rough Gas Field, which took 39 men off the rig while
Humber life boats stood by.
   Six more rig workers were removed later, leaving eight still on
board, the coast guard said.
   The cargo vessel, with 18 crew aboard, was damaged above the
waterline, the spokesman said, and was able to continue to its
destination.
   The Irving Forest, registered in Bermuda, is managed by the
Canadian Kent Line Ltd.

   About 200 abortion opponents were arrested
Saturday after staging a sit-in at two clinics, police said.
   Members of Operation Rescue were hauled away from a building
where they said they were trying to prevent women from entering
Allegheny Reproductive Health Services and Allegheny Women's Center.
   ``Each participant signed a pledge to remain peaceful and
non-violent, but we aren't going to get up and walk away'' group

<TEXT>
   The U.S.-backed rebels on Saturday
refused to return to Managua for peace talks with the leftist
Sandinista government.
   A spokesman for the rebels, known as Contras, said the capital
doesn't have a ``favorable atomosphere'' for negotiations because
the government wants to put too many restrictions on rebel
negotiators.
   The Sandinistas had proposed a four-day round of peace talks
beginning Sunday in Managua.
   As an alternative to another formal round of talks, they offered
to meet with the rebels in Miami to discusss extending the
cease-fire. Contra spokesman Roberto Ferrey said resistance leaders
would reply to that offer on Monday.
   Ferrey said in a telephone interview from Miami that Nicaraguan
Resistance leaders complain the government will not let them meet
with opposition parties in Managua and also wants to restrict
Contra negotiators to their hotel.
   The Sandinistas put similar restrictions on the rebel
negotiators during the previous round of talks, which fell apart on
June 9.
   Despite the breakdown, the Sandinistas said they would maintain
a unilateral cease-fire. The Contras agreed to go along. Since
then, both sides accused the others of violating the fragile truce.
   The cease-fire is to expire at the end of the month.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras began direct, top-level talks on
how to end their nearly 7-year-old war in March. The two sides have
been unable to agree on key points such as democratic reforms in
Nicaragua and Contra disarmament.

<TEXT>
   Delegates to U.S.-mediated peace talks
trying to settle southern Africa conflicts agreed Saturday to
sponsor another round next month in the United States.
   A communique at the end of two days of talks said the July 11
meeting will be at the ``experts level'' at an undisclosed place in
the United States. It said foreign ministers will not attend.
   ``Further progress was made, and a plan of work was developed
for continuing exchanges at the level of experts to expand on the
progress made in Cairo,'' the communique said.
   It stated the aim of the negotiations as working ``toward a
regional settlement of the conflict in southwestern Africa.''
   The delegates from South Africa, Angola, Cuba and the United
States met Friday and Saturday, seeking a formula to end a 13-year
war in Angola and usher in independence for South-West Africa,
commonly known as Namibia.
   Earlier talks in London and Brazzaville, Congo, last month
failed to achieve settlement.
   In sessions Saturday morning and afternoon, the delegates dealt
with widely divergent proposals presented Friday on how to resolve
the war in Angola and end South African rule in Namibia, conference
sources said.
   About a dozen leaders of the four delegations worked out
communique details in a poolside meeting after full negotiations
apparently bogged down in the hotel conference room.
   The venue for the next talks was apparently the main point at
issue. The Angola-Cuba side was said to be opposed to holding the
next round in an African country like Egypt. They felt South Africa
gained too much politically from having its officials appear where
they normally are barred because of opposition to apartheid.
   South Africa's foreign minister, R.F. Botha, described the
morning's talks as ``good, excellent.'' In keeping with a news
blackout imposed Friday, all delegates declined to discuss
substance.
   Botha told reporters Friday his government was insisting on
Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola as a prerequisite for Namibian
independence.
   At Friday negotiations, Botha demanded Cuba set a date for
pulling out its more than 50,000 troops from Angola, conference
sources said.
   Angola is demanding an end to South African military and
logistical support for Angolan rebels of UNITA, the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola. UNITA, which has been
fighting the Marxist central government in Luanda, also obtains
arms from the United States.
   In 1978, the United Nations revoked South Africa's League of
Nations mandate in Namibia and called on the Pretoria government to
relinquish the territory. The resolution also provided that Namibia
be put under U.N. trusteeship pending independence.

   Four Arabs stabbed and wounded an Israeli
reserve soldier near Tel Aviv on Saturday and a bomb exploded near
an Israeli passenger bus as it drove through the occupied West
Bank, the military said.
   No one on the bus was hurt, but the vehicle was damaged, and
Jewish settlers threatened to retaliate.
   Earlier Saturday, troops shot and wounded a Palestinian in the
West Bank.
   The army said the soldier was attacked after the Arabs tried to
wrest away his weapon as he was hitchhiking near Tel Aviv at the
major Mesubim junction. It said he was slightly wounded and was
taken to Tel Hashomer Hospital.
   The national news agency Itim said the soldier, Chaim Yosef, 38,
managed to reach a police station after being stabbed and told
police of the attack.
   Itim quoted Yosef as saying the Arabs stopped their car, got out
and demanded his weapon. When he refused, they stabbed him and sped
away, Itim said.
   It said police put up roadblocks and detained suspects.
   In the West Bank, the driver of an Israeli bus headed toward the
cooperative settlement of Homesh heard a loud explosion and an
initial investigation showed it was either a roadside bomb or an
explosive device thrown at the bus, the army said.
   The army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, didn't
know how many people were in the bus at the time.
   Israel Television quoted residents of Homesh, 37 miles north of
Jerusalem, as saying they planned to block the road linking the
West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus and hold a demonstration
protesting attacks on Israeli vehicles.
   On Friday, a Homesh man and his wife were slightly injured when
Moslem worshipers stoned their car in Nablus. The man opened fire
with an Uzi submachine gun and wounded seven Arabs, including two
8-year-old boys.
   A top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel could
not ``see the light at the end of the tunnel'' and predicted the
Arab uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip would continue over an extended period.
   A Palestinian was slightly wounded in the leg in the West Bank
town of Nablus when soldiers opened fire to disperse protesters in
the city's casbah, or Arab bazaar, the army said.
   Officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital identified him as
20-year-old Nahel Mohammed El-Arbudi and said four other Arabs were
treated for tear gas inhalation.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, police detained 10 Arabs after scattered
stone-throwing incidents, Israel radio reported.
   Police in riot gear patrolled the streets and stood guard at the
entrances to the walled Old City.
   Police also were seen stopping Arab vehicles and checking
papers. Police closed some streets to traffic.
   In one incident, youths hurled stones and bottles at a police
van from a schoolyard, but there were no injuries. Police searched
the school, letting out the students one by one.
   Police closed three Arab private schools, according to Jerusalem
police spokesman Rafi Levy. He said the closures followed
stone-throwing attacks.
   Police have linked the renewed tension in Jerusalem to the
latest leaflet put out by Palestinian leaders. It called on the
Arabs to intensify protests in Jerusalem and challenge Israeli rule
over the city.
   The leaflet designated Sunday as a day of attacks on Arabs
working for Israel's military administration in the occupied lands.
   In Gaza City, Israeli troops demolished the second floor of a
house, welded shut the doors of eight stores and sealed three side
streets in retaliation for a firebomb attack Monday that injured
two soldiers, the army said.
   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, a protest erupted in the
central Manara square after about 200 Moslem fundamentalists met at
the nearby mosque, Israeli witnesses said. They said troops fired
tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters. No injuries
were reported.
   Also Saturday, a fire broke out in a forest on the slopes of Mt.
Tabor in northern Israel, and about 5,000 trees were destroyed,
Itim reported. Israel radio quoted police as saying it was arson.
Israeli officials have blamed Palestinian nationalists for more
than 100 cases of arson since January.
   Shamir's aide, Yossi Ben-Aharon, who spoke on Israel radio on
Saturday, predicted the Arab uprising, in which 211 Palestinians
and four Israelis have died, would continue.
   ``We are more than ready to put an end to this entire problem
through negotiations and peace,'' he said. ``But for peace, just
like dancing, you have to have a partner.''

   Friends and literary contemporaries of Jack
Kerouac reunited Saturday to remember the man who defined the
``beat generation'' of the 1950s.
   A replay of Kerouac's reading of the final paragraph of his
classic novel ``On the Road'' from a 1959 television show
culminated the dedication of a one-acre park commemorating the
Lowell-born author.
   The 90-minute ceremony, attended by about 1,000 people including
two of Kerouac's three wives and poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence
Ferlinghetti, officially opened the first public memorial to
Kerouac in Lowell and sought to settle past controversy over the
project.
   ``Ultimately, the quality of the work overshadows all the other
issues,'' said Lowell Mayor Richard Howe. ``One of the fundamental
principals of the park is to encourage the free exchange of ideas.''
   Some residents had opposed the memorial because of Kerouac's
heavy drinking and itinerant, unconventional lifestyle.
   The $100,000 memorial is an arrangement of 3-by-8-foot granite
panels bearing 15 passages from most of Kerouac's 20 books and
essays, including the so-called Lowell novels ``Doctor Sax'' and
``The Town and the City.'' Previously, the only reference to
Kerouac was his small grave marker on the other side of the city.
   ``I feel very good about this memorial,'' said Ginsberg, who met
Kerouac when both were students at New York's Columbia University
in the early 1940s. ``It's so that any kid in the next century can
wander in here and be inspired to language and imagination.''
   The inscribed panels fit into the park ``as smoothly as the
Merrimack flows through the city he loved so dearly,'' said Stella
Sampas Kerouac, who married Kerouac several years before he died of
a hemorrhage as a near recluse in St. Petersburg, Fla.
   The dedication was the first meeting between Stella Kerouac and
Edith Parker, his first wife, since Kerouac's funeral.
   ``To me, I see Jack as a friend, lover and a husband,'' said
Parker, 66, of Detroit. ``I don't think of him as any different.''
   Friday night, Parker said she and Ginsberg placed a bottle of
cheap wine on Kerouac's grave.
   Kerouac's only child, Janet Michelle Kerouac, daughter of his
second wife Joan Haverty, also attended the opening.
   ``I have such mixed feelings about him and about the park,''
said Janet Kerouac, 36, who met her father only twice. ``I probably
see Jack Kerouac different than most.''
   Several dozen people from Quebec, the native home of Kerouac's
parents, spoke in French to priests and friends from Kerouac's
boyhood neighborhood, across the Merrimack River from the park,
while fans wearing Kerouac T-shirts and carrying copies of his
books wandered the memorial.
   Watching the ceremony from a quiet corner was Henri Cru, one of
Kerouac's best friends and the model for the character Remi
Boncoeur in ``On the Road.''
   ``When Jack and I were sitting around New York talking of going
to sea, we dreamed of a lot of things,'' he said. ``But there was
nothing like this.''

<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army on
Saturday said it used high-powered anti-aircraft guns never before
seen in the province to shoot a British army helicopter.
   An IRA statement in Crossmaglen said a 12-man unit used two
12.7mm anti-aircraft guns, three 7.62mm general purpose
machine-guns and rifles Thursday in what it called the IRA's first
successful helicopter downing.
   The outlawed IRA said the British army Lynx helicopter was hit
by armor- piercing and incendiary rounds.
   The Lynx made an emergency landing at Silverbridge in South
Armagh near the border with the Irish Republic and the army said
several rounds had hit the aircraft. One soldier was reported
injured slightly in the rough landing.
   The unit attacked from a hill close to a flight path regularly
used by army helicopters. The IRA men ran with machine guns and a
rocket launcher to finish off their target but could find no trace
of it, the statement said.
   The IRA is believed to have a wide collection of weapons
supplied by Libya for the IRA fight to drive the British out of the
predominantly Protestant province and unite it with the Roman
Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<HEAD>Cardenas Closes Campaign with Giant Downtown Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 200,000 supporters of opposition
presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas filled the downtown
Zocalo plaza for a massive closing campaign rally Saturday.
   Some polls indicate that Cardenas, candidate of the leftist
coalition Democratic National Front, could finish second to
governing party candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the July 6
election.
   Usually the conservative National Action Party finishes
runner-up to the virtually omnipotent Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
   Cardenas, son of the late President Lazaro Cardenas and a
onetime governor of central Michoacan state, broke with the PRI
last year after his Democratic Current campaign for reform from
within was rebuffed.
   He insists he will win, although the PRI never has lost a
presidential election or gubernatorial race in any of Mexico's 31
states since its founding in 1929.
   ``Our victory will be clear and without a shadow of doubt,''
Cardenas told the packed Zocalo.
   ``It can't be hidden. The possibility of an electoral fraud is
in the minds of all Mexicans. We know the evidence of how it is
being prepared,'' he said.
   ``We are struggling for a government of liberties, where we all
might be equal before the law and that no limitation whatsoever
might be imposed on the exercise of the rights of ideas, writing
and publishing, of seeking redress, of transit, of professing
religious belief,'' Cardenas said.
   ``Ours is a clear, defined plan. It is progressive, democratic,
nationalist.''
   Salinas de Gortari and his four opponents are traveling
throughout Mexico in the campaign's closing days. Closing rallies
are set as late as July 2.
   Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, candidate of the tiny Revolutionary
Workers Party called her supporters to the Zocalo on Sunday.
   Manuel J. Clouthier of National Action, known as PAN, attracted
an estimated 30,000 supporters to a closing rally Friday in
Hermosillo, capital of northwestern Sonora state. He plans to hold
his closing Zocalo rally on July 2.
   The fifth candidate is conservative Gumersindo Magana, of the
smallest party competing, the Mexican Democratic Party.
   Cardenas' strong showing prompted an endorsement by Heberto
Castillo of the Mexican Socialist Party. Ballots still will have
both candidates, but votes for Castillo will be counted as votes
for Cardenas.
   Castillo was a featured speaker at Cardenas' Zocalo rally.
   The leftist daily La Jornada estimated on Saturday that the
Zocalo filled to capacity could accommodate 292,297 people. But,
according to the survey done by architects and civil engineers,
none of them would be able to move.
   Most estimates of the Zocalo have been that at capacity it could
hold as many as 1 million people.
   Spectators at Saturday's rally said the plaza, bordered by such
landmarks as the National Palace and the Metropolitan Cathedral,
clearly was filled to capacity and many were standing in
surrounding streets.
   La Jornada's study found that a realistic estimate of a filled
to capacity rally would be 194,865 people.

rape case as a hoax.
   Samuel McClease, 26, was ordered held without bail after federal
officials charged him with one count each of obstruction of justice
and perjury.
   McClease had publicly claimed Monday that the Rev. Al Sharpton,
one of the advisers of the black 16-year-old Wappingers Falls girl
who said she was raped by six white men last November, had hired
him to bug conversations involving her two lawyers, activists C.
Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr.
   McClease said two of the eight hours he taped showed that the
three men, who have advised the girl not to cooperate with a grand
jury or investigators, knew Miss Brawley's story was groundless.
   Although hospital tests found no sign of rape after Miss Brawley
was found last November in a plastic bag, smeared with dog
excrement and racial epithets, the case has become a civil rights
cause. Mason, Maddox and Sharpton say Miss Brawley is the victim of
a racist cover-up.
   ``This is, of course, another unexplained development in a case
that has been full of many surprising twists and turns,'' said
Scott Greathead, first assistant state attorney general, at a news
conference following McClease's detention hearing.
   U.S. Magistrate Kathleen Roberts continued the hearing until
Monday afternoon after Assistant U.S. Attorney Federico Virella
asked for time to gather witnesses.
   Virella charged that McClease, 26, of Jersey City, N.J., had
``played games with the government'' and was a ``very, very serious
risk to flee.''
   In a complaint signed by FBI special agent Judith K. Lewis, the
government charged that McClease turned over two reels of
reel-to-reel tape and eight cassette tapes, all of which were
blank. The two reels appeared never to have been used, Ms. Lewis
said.
   On Saturday, Sharpton said he wasn't surprised that the tapes
were blank.
   ``I think what this does is confirm what we've been saying all
along,'' Sharpton said. ``There's a concerted effort to discredit
black leadership in general, me in particular, for the last few
months. This man being exposed as a liar shows that.''
   According to the government complaint, McClease first appeared
before the federal grand jury on Wednesday and refused to produce
the tape recordings. U.S. District Court Judge Shirley Wohl Kram
then ordered him to do so, and gave him a highly limited form of
immunity solely for the act of producing the tapes for the grand
jury.
   The complaint said McClease, a former Navy technician, appeared
again on Thursday and turned over what he said were original tapes
of conversations among the Brawley advisers.
   The tapes were turned over to the FBI for duplication, the
complaint said. ``During the course of duplication, FBI audio
technicians determined by observing the audio level that all of the
original tapes produced by McClease were blank and that in their
opinion the two reels looked fresh and never ... used.''
   Mason and Sharpton have disavowed knowing McClease and suggested
he is a government agent.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said the investigation into
McClease's allegations would continue, but he refused to say
whether the government believes any recordings exist from
wire-tapping of Mason and Maddox.
   ``I think it's appropriate at this point to say that any
suggestion that the Rev. Sharpton was involved would be unfair,''
Giuliani said.
   Sharpton is under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service
for failure to file income taxes and reportedly by a state grand
jury for alleged personal use of charitable donations.

   Three more workers died Saturday from
burns suffered in a fiery explosion at a gasoline supply depot,
bringing to seven the number of confirmed dead in the fire,
hospital officials said.
   The government petroleum monopoly Pemex, which owns the tank
farm, confirmed that seven men died and said five were injured. It
said the blaze may have started when gasoline ``spilled into an
area where soldering work was being done.''
   Neighborhoods surrounding the San Rafael sales agency in
Guadalupe filled up once again as thousands of twice-evacuated
residents returned home.
   Firefighters thought they put out the blazes early Friday and
most residents went home, only to flee again in panic a short time
later when a tank reignited.
   The Constructora Quiroga y Villarreal company was doing
maintenance work on a fire prevention system Thursday when a 2.2
million-gallon gasoline tank exploded and ignited two other tanks.
   It was the second major fire at a Pemex gasoline storage depot
in a month.
   Two men died Saturday of burns at the Hospital 21 in Monterrey,
said Sergio Cardenas, a shift assistant.
   A third man died Saturday at the city's Uiversity Hospital, said
Jose Angel Medellin, an official at the hospital's morgue.
   Company clerk Pedro Salas said 13 workers were accounted for
after having been reported missing after the blast.
   A Pemex news release Saturday said the fire was extinguished at
3 a.m. and ``the security of the area has been totally
re-established.''
   Across from the explosion site, life began returning to normal.
Young boys rode bicycles outside the depot's cement walls. Others
peeked through gaps in the wall to see the charred remains of the
tanks.
   ``It's good to be home,'' said 28-year-old Angel Reymundo
Delgado. He said he spent two nights at one of the emergency
shelters set up after the disaster.
   ``The first night I stayed in a cattle stall so I didn't get
much sleep. But last night was better,'' he said.
   One shelter was at the Guadalupe Exposition Ground, which houses
an annual cattle show and fair.
   Silvia Diaz Martinez, 30, who lives across the street from the
tanks, said she came home to find milk was sour and meat was
spoiled in the refrigerator.
   ``The electricity was off the whole time and didn't come back on
until just after we got home,'' she said.
   Ms. Diaz said she was trapped in her house with her mother,
sister and nephews for several minutes after the explosion as smoke
and fire billowed toward her house.
   No damage to homes was reported.
   Pemex said it set up a special blast investigation team. The
tank farm was temporarily closed for the investigation. Its 23
tanks supplied gasoline and diesel fuel to area gas stations and
other users.
   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they saw
the top of one tank rupture outward and then collapse. They said
gasoline gushed down the side of the tank and across the ground.
   The witnesses said they suspected the tank may have ruptured
because it was filled far beyond capacity. Pemex has said only
there was a gas leak in a tank. Guadalupe Mayor Adan Lopez said in
an interview that it was his ``obligation'' to ask the state
government to relocate the tank farm because it posed a constant
hazard.
   Pemex closed down a similar tank farm in Chihuahua, capital of
the northern state of the same name, a month ago following an
explosion and daylong fire. No one died in that accident.

   A high school valedictorian was
charged with beating his mother to death with a baseball bat in the
early morning hours before his scheduled graduation Saturday.
   William Shrubsall, 17, was charged with murder after he
confessed to killing his mother, Marge Shrubsall, 56, said police
Detective John Donner.
   The teen-ager was to deliver the valedictory speech to
classmates at Niagara Falls LaSalle High School later Saturday but
instead was in city jail awaiting arraignment Monday.
   Shrubsall called police to the house where he and his mother
lived shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday, telling them someone had
broken in and injured his mother, Donner said.
   Shrubsall confessed to the murder during questioning at the
police department, Donner said.
   ``There were family problems for a length of time,'' said
Donner. ``They had a fight ... He just lost it, I guess.''
   A high school classmate expressed shock at the news.
   ``We can't believe this,'' said Larry Lang. ``He was really
close to his mother.''

<TEXT>
   The Metropolitan Club, the last major men-only
club for Washington's elite, has followed in the tracks of the
Cosmos Club and voted to accept women as members, its president
said Saturday.
   John D.H. Kane said the vote by the club's 15-member governing
board was taken Wednesday and members were notified by letters that
arrived in the District of Columbia on Saturday.
   ``We thought it was an idea whose time had come,'' Kane said.
``The board made a policy change to accept ladies in membership for
all categories.''
   The vote was taken just four days after Washington's private
Cosmos Club voted to accept woman and two days after the Supreme
Court upheld a New York City law aimed at requiring the admission
of women to big, private clubs where important business dealings
often occur.
   Kane refused to discuss any specifics of the vote or the
procedures for acceptance into the exclusive 2,200-member club. He
said the club's decision to admit women was not based on the Cosmos
Club precedent or other pressures.
   John F. Banzhaf III, a professor at George Washington
University's National Law Center and an opponent of sex
discrimination at private clubs, disagreed.
   ``Once the Cosmos Club made its decision, it was almost
preordained that the Metropolitan Club would have to go the same
way,'' Banzhaf said.
   Banzhaf, who filed a complaint against the Cosmos Club's
men-only membership policy last year, had taken similar action
against the Metropolitan Club on Tuesday based on a District of
Columbia ordinance stating that any club with a liquor license may
not discriminate in its membership.
   Banzhaf said his next targets under the anti-discrimination law
will be three local clubs that admit only women to full membership.

<HEAD>Magazine: U.S. Attorney Merkle To Quit, Run For U.S. Senate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who won praise
for recent convictions he obtained against a top Colombian drug
czar, plans to resign and run for the U.S. Senate, a magazine
reported.
   A brief item in the Washington Whispers section of the July 4
issue of U.S. News & World Report says Merkle will challenge fellow
Republican U.S. Rep. Connie Mack in Florida's September primary.
   Mack, of Cape Coral, is the lone Republican in the race for the
Senate seat being vacated by three-term Democrat Lawton Chiles.
Four Democrats also are seeking the post.
   Merkle, 44, could not be reached for comment at his home or
Tampa office on Saturday and did not return telephone calls from
The Associated Press. His secretary, Dot Bunger, said she knew
nothing about any political plans her boss might have.
   But she announced that Merkle, nicknamed ``Mad Dog'' while at
Notre Dame for his aggressiveness on the gridiron, is planning a
series of news conferences around Florida on Monday.
   Florida Republican leaders could not confirm Merkle's reported
political debut, but expressed dismay at that prospect.
   ``He got headlines out of the drug case and he thinks he's
really riding high right now _ but that's not going to do it,''
said former state GOP Chairman Tommy Thomas of Panama City. ``He's
making a tragic mistake getting in there because Mack has the
backing of the Republican party in this state.''
   Florida's current GOP chair, Jeanne Austin, said candidates
normally would check with the party before launching campaigns. But
she said she has never met or spoken to Merkle, and she noted that
Mack's well-organized campaign has tied up most Republican donors.
   Mack ``has all the big name givers. It would be hard to get in
this late,'' Ms. Austin said of the federal prosecutor.
   Mack's communications director, Mark Mills, said he couldn't
believe that Merkle would run. He also shrugged off the magazine's
report that the White House is unlikely to endorse Mack over Merkle.
   ``President Reagan's coming to Florida for us to campaign in
Miami on Wednesday,'' Mills said.
   Merkle was named U.S. Attorney for Florida's Middle District in
1982. Since then, he has obtained indictments against three sitting
Florida representatives, two judges, three prosecutors and dozens
of bankers, attorneys and postal workers.
   He has threatened to resign several time recently when the White
House reportedly offered to drop an indictment against Panamanian
leader Gen. Manuel Noriega in return for the military dictator's
departure. Merkle prepared one of the drug indictments against
Noriega.
   Merkle is best known for the trial of Colombian Carlos Lehder
Rivas, who faces more than a century in prison for his May 19 drug
convictions.

   Byra L. ``Puck'' Hemingway,
daughter-in-law of author Ernest Hemingway and mother of actresses
Mariel and Margaux Hemingway, died Friday at her home after an
extended illness. She was 66.
   Mrs. Hemingway, the wife of author, businessman and outdoorsman
Jack Hemingway of Ketchum, was born in Pocatello. She worked as a

Alcon Highway Project and later worked as a purchasing agent for
Sun Valley Co. and United Airlines.
   She married Jack Hemingway, son of the Nobel Prize-winning
author, on June 25, 1949, in Paris. The couple settled in Ketchum,
where Ernest Hemingway committed suicide in 1961.
   Mrs. Hemingway is survived by her husband; three daughters, Joan
Hemingway and Mariel Chrisman, both of Sun Valley, and Margaux
Hemingway of New York; a sister, Bee Pierce of Boise; and a
granddaughter.
   A memorial service is scheduled for Tuesday at the Hemingway
home for family members and close friends.

<HEAD>Group Acquires Braniff in Buyout; Appoints Former Piedmont
Executives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group led by the investment bank Paine Webber
Group Inc. said Saturday it agreed to acquire Braniff Inc. in a
leveraged buyout that valued the money-losing airline at $111
million.
   The investor group, BIA Acquisitions, also appointed five top
executives who resigned from Piedmont Airlines Friday to manage
Braniff.
   ``We intend for Braniff to become a strong competitive force in
our nation's air travel and hospitality industries,'' Jeffrey R.
Chodorow, a BIA official, said in a statement.
   BIA did not elaborate on its plans for Braniff and officials in
the investor group could not be reached for comment. But in recent
weeks, the group has pledged to expand the Dallas-based airline and
protect the jobs of its employees.
   Braniff _ once the country's eighth-largest carrier before it
declared bankruptcy in 1982 and laid off thousands of workers _
employs 1,300 people in Dallas and 2,600 total.
   BIA agreed to buy Braniff from Dalfort Aviation Inc., which is
owned by the Pritzker family of Chicago. BIA is paying $7 a share
in cash and a pro rata share of 20 percent of the restructured
airline for each share of Braniff common stock.
   The agreement capped two weeks of negotiations between Dalfort
and BIA. Dalfort turned down a previous offer from the investor
group about four months ago.
   William G. McGee will take over as chairman, chief executive and
president of Braniff. McGee was chairman and chief executive of
Piedmont and helped build that airline into the nation's
ninth-largest carrier, and one of the most profitable airlines,
before it was acquired by USAir last year.
   Braniff's departing vice chairman and chief executive officer J.
Patrick Foley was quoted as saying that the company's new board of
directors and management would be in Dallas Monday.
   ``I believe those who are coming in know the business,'' Foley
was quoted as saying in early Sunday editions of the Dallas Times
Herald. ``If you analyze what Braniff is today and what Piedmont
was 10 years ago, you can see very similar airlines.''
   The newspaper quoted Foley as saying part of the financing for
the buyout would come from the sale of some of the company's assets.
   Braniff posted a net loss of $8.1 million in the first quarter
of this year.
   Reports earlier said Fort Worth-based American Airlines was
considering the purchase of $40 million of Braniff's assets,
including terminal gates at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
   Braniff primarily serves the Southwest, but analysts have
speculated that it may try to reduce its operations at Dallas-Fort
Worth, where there is strong competition between Fort Worth-based
American Airlines and Atlanta-based Delta Airlines, and expand
operations at its second hub at Kansas City International airport,
where competition is less severe.
   Foley was quoted as saying he believes the group will keep
Braniff's headquarters in Dallas but expand its Kansas City, Mo.,
hub.
   Braniff's new board includes Chodorow, a real estate investor
who is a principal in the Philadelphia-based investment firm
CoreGroup Inc.
   Other new board members include CoreGroup principals Gerald
Broker and Larry D. Yogel, New York real estate investor Arthur G.
Cohen and one of his associates, Steven M. Terk, attorney Marvin
Tepper and Joseph Steuert, managing director of Paine Webber's
investment banking division.
   Paine Webber will control a majority of the airline, the BIA
statement said.
   Dalfort owned 64 percent of the airline's common stock and all
of its Series A preferred stock, which gave it more than 90 percent
of the stock voting rights.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intellectuals and Communist officials in the
Baltic republic of Lithuania have followed two other republics in
demanding more autonomy from Moscow as this week's party conference
approaches, the official news agency Tass indicated Saturday.
   The Communist head of the republic of Latvia, meanwhile,
criticized intellectuals who made radical demands for sovereignty
at a stormy meeting of hundreds of writers, artists and scientists
this month.
   A brief report by Tass said a rally of about 10,000 people
called by a group of intellectuals, The Movement To Support
Perestroika, was held in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius Friday
night.
   Perestroika refers to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of economic
and political reforms.
   Several intellectuals and delegates to the party conference
addressed the crowd, paying ``great attention to the questions of
national culture, language, history and ecology,'' and instructing
delegates what to say in Moscow, Tass said.
   The 19th All-Union Conference of the Communist Party, scheduled
to open Tuesday, will be the first since 1941. Five thousand
delegates will attend.
   A similar meeting in the Estonian capital of Tallinn June 17 is
reported to have attracted 150,000 people, who cheered speeches
demanding the Soviet Union turn into a federation of sovereign
republics.
   Tass did not say if similar demands were raised at the Vilnius
meeting.
   But the Lithuanian Information Center, an emigre group in New
York, said it had learned that a Communist official in Lithuania,
Algirdas Brazauskas, addressed the meeting, calling for a sovereign
Lithuania and for Lithuanian to be made the official language of
the republic.
   The issue of preserving indigenous language and culture in the
Baltic republics has evoked strong emotions as a large number of
ethnic Russians and other ethnic groups migrate into the area.
   The Lithuanian Writers' Union demanded April 4 that
dual-language schools be abolished in the republic and that
Lithuanians outside the republic's borders be taught in Lithuanian.
   Ethnic Estonians are now in a minority in their own republic, a
fact that is fueling concern about the economic, ecological and
other consequences of more than 40 years of Soviet rule.
   The presence of leading Communist party officials at the rally
in Lithuania, as in that in Estonia, indicates that demands in both
republics for more genuine autonomy from Moscow have the official
backing of the party hierarchy.
   However, the head of Latvia's Communist Party, Boris Pugo,
condemned some unofficial groups he accused of taking their cue
from the West.
   In an interview published Saturday in the daily
Sotsialiticheskaya Industriya (Socialist Industry), Pugo said: ``We
cannot close our eyes to the fact that on the background of
perestroika and democratization, recidivists of nationalism and
chauvinism are appearing.''
   ``Some of the so-called `informal groups' are trying to draw
citizens into various actions under speculative, provocative
actions written with the help of Western radio stations,'' Pugo
said.
   He said such groups had been a topic of discussion at a recent
plenum of the Latvian Central Committee that followed the June 1
and 2 meeting of intellectuals in Riga.
   Few details of that meeting have been published in the state-run
media. A report in the weekly Moscow News made clear that debates
had been stormy.
   Pugo said that much of the criticism at the intellectuals'
meeting ``went ahead without the necessary political analysis.''
   A resolution adopted by the intellectuals and published in
Latvia's state-run media June 11 contained a demand to publish the
secret protocol of the Soviet-Nazi pact of 1939. The pact ceded the
three Baltic republics to Moscow, which sent in troops in 1940.

   Precautions taken by health care workers to
protect themselves from the AIDS virus have led to a shortage of
the latex and vinyl gloves used in the medical profession.
   It is difficult to pinpoint the degree of the shortage because
manufacturers are reluctant to release production figures and such
numbers are not available from industry groups or the government.
   But there is general agreement that availability has sharply
declined in the past year since federal health officials urged
health care professionals to take increased care to protect
themselves from disease organisms that can be transmitted through
body fluids.
   ``There does seem to be a shortage of gloves in the United
States,'' said Dr. J. Thomas Lowe, spokesman for the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration in Washington, which regulates the medical
glove industry. ``The glove industry is continuing to gear up the
production and marketing of gloves to meet the increased demand.''
   The sharp and relatively sudden increase in glove use put a
pinch on manufacturers' capacity, said Les Jacobson, a spokesman
for Baxter International in Deerfield, Ill., a major producer of
medical gloves.
   ``The immediate cause was probably the encouragement of the CDC
(Centers for Disease Control) and the American Dental Association,
urging doctors and dentists to glove up whenever they come in
contact with a patient's body fluids,'' Jacobson said. ``For many
health care workers, that was all the motivation they needed to
glove up.
   ``Our demand has doubled in the last two years.''
   Jeff Leebaw, spokesman for Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick,
N.J., said his company's glove manufacturing plant in Arlington,
Texas, has been operating 24 hours a day for more than a year and
is planning to add more production equipment.
   Also, he said, the company has canceled glove orders from
non-medical customers.
   ``The demand has increased quite a bit in connection with the
AIDS problem and the concern in general with disease
transmission,'' Leebaw said.
   Jacobson said the shortage is mainly a matter of production
capacity, rather than a shortage of the materials needed to make
the gloves. Latex, the glove of choice for surgeons, is made from
rubber, while vinyl gloves are totally synthetic.
   Baxter last year constructed a new glove plant in Malaysia and
is planning another facility there, Jacobson said. The company also
has four U.S. plants and three in Europe.
   Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for Emory University Hospital in
Atlanta, said the hospital has felt the shortage, though it has not
reached the point where medical service would be threatened.
   Instead, she said, it has more often been a problem of
convenience, with Emory personnel sometimes not able to get the
type or size of glove they want.
   ``But we have not had any problems that would have resulted in a
slowdown or shutdown in service,'' she said.
   Because Emory is an established hospital, its list of vendors is
long and thus the facility has several sources of gloves, Ms. Smith
said. But its purchasers have had to work hard to make sure the
hospital is adequately stocked.
   The CDC said gloves should be used whenever an individual might
come in contact with a patient's blood, which poses the greatest
threat for transmission of the virus that causes AIDS and the
hepatitis B virus. Gloves also were advised for protection from
numerous other body fluids.
   Jacobson said he expects demand for gloves to remain high,
though it probably will level off at some point.
   ``I don't think we'll get the sudden, sharp increase again,''
Jacobson said. ``Everyone who needs to know about gloving up knows
now.''

   Marta Abba, a leading Italian stage
performer of the 1920s and `30s and the favorite actress of
Sicilian playwright Luigi Pirandello, died on her 88th birthday
Friday, her family announced.
   The family said Saturday that she died at a Milan rest home
after suffering a stroke.
   Abba entered Milan's drama school when she was 15 and began her
career in 1923 with the stage company of director Ettore Paladini.
She drew acclaim the following year in Virgilio Talli's production
of Chekhov's ``Gabbiano.''
   In 1925, she became the lead actress for Pirandello, who won the
1934 Nobel Prize in literature and is considered a top figure in
20th-century European theater. She also became his lifetime
companion.
   After spending years in Rome performing such plays as ``Six
Characters in Search of An Author,'' Pirandello and Abba went on
tour in Italy and abroad, including the United States, France,
England and Germany.
   Pirandello wrote several plays specifically for Abba, including
``Come Tu Mi Vuoi'' (As You Desire Me) in 1930.
   In 1928-29, Abba formed her own company of young actors, mostly
performing plays of her mentor. In the 1930s, she expanded her
repertoire to include Shakespeare, George Bernard Shaw and others.
   Pirandello died in 1936. Two years later, Abba married an
American, S.A. Millikin, grandson of a Cleveland steel baron;
retired and settled in the United States.
   After the marriage broke up, she moved back to Milan in 1953,
returning briefly to the stage with a company in her own name. She
had been on the board of the Institute of Pirandello Studies and
Contemporary Italian Theater since 1962.
   Two years ago, Abba donated to Princeton University the 560
letters that Pirandello had written her.
   Funeral services were set for Monday in Milan.

<HEAD>Scientists Predict Effects Of Magnetic Storm Will Be Less Intense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magnetic storm expected to affect global
communications and electric power transmission on Monday may be
less intense than originally thought, scientists said Saturday.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space
Environment Laboratory warned Friday about the storm after the
largest solar flare in four years exploded from the sun.
   But NOAA duty forecaster Kent Doggett said Saturday he had
amended his forecast.
   ``We had expected the arrival of energetic protons from the
flare and they did not arrive yet, which makes me suspect that the
amount of energy put out by the flare was not as great as
previously expected,'' he said.
   ``Based on that, I'm not expecting as large of a geomagnetic
disturbance.''
   Mild proton radiation associated with the solar flare had been
expected to reach orbiting spacecraft Saturday.
   Doggett said the level of flare activity was expected to remain
high, but its effects on Earth probably would be felt less strongly
than initially predicted.
   For instance, the magnetic storm had been expected to push
Earth's auroras away from the poles, making the northern lights
visible as far south as the Great Lakes, Boston and England in the
Northern Hemisphere.
   Doggett said Saturday, however, that ``the likelihood of seeing
aurora displays won't be very high, in the continental United
States at least.''
   He said disturbances to electrical power transmission also
probably will be less than expected.
   Officials can't forecast the magnetic storm with certainty,
Doggett said, and the possibility for a strong storm remains as hot
gases and electrically charged particles emitted by the solar flare
hit Earth's magnetic field.
   The phenomenon does not directly threaten life on Earth.
However, it can disrupt shortwave and other communications,
including contact between airliners and ground controllers and
long-distance phone calls.
   The magnetic storm also could cause errors in the orbits of some
satellites.

   Mubarak Awad, the American-Palestinian deported
from Israel two weeks ago, urged Democrats on Saturday to call in
their platform for ``a two-state'' solution in the Middle East.
   That would be ``a great victory,'' Awad said at a luncheon
hosted by Margot Kidder, the actress and Jesse Jackson activist, at
the hotel where the Democratic Platform Committee was meeting.
   Awad, an advocate of civil disobedience, urged the Democrats to
address the Palestinian plight in the party platform. Israel
deported Awad on June 13 after 40 days in custody and accused him
of fomenting unrest on the West Bank.
   Awad, a Christian, said he was thinking of converting to Judiasm
if that is the only way for him to get back into Israel and his
native Jerusalem.
   Jesse Jackson has sought to have the Democrats support a
Palestinian homeland in their platform, but Michael Dukakis, the
likely nominee, has resisted.
   The draft platform speaks of ``maintaining the special
relationship with Israel'' while exerting ``new leadership to
deliver the promise of peace and security through negotiations that
has been held out to Israel and its neighbors by the Camp David
Accords.''
   Platform committee member James Zogby, a Jackson adviser and
executive director of the Arab American Institute, offered an
amendment calling for ``peace based on mutual recognition,
territorial compromise and self-determination for Israelis and
Palestinians.''
   However, the proposal was rejected on a voice vote after Sen.
Bob Graham of Florida, speaking for the Dukakis side, said the
party should ``not succumb to the temptation ... of wishing to
impose on other parties what we think the solution should be'' in
the Middle East.
   Awad, 44, who took out American citizenship while a student here
because of visa problems, said he was not discouraged by Dukakis'
refusal to accept the Jackson position.
   Awad said it was ``kind of a political game'' and involves risks
that a President Dukakis could not be expected to take in his first
or second year in office.
   ``I think if at least the platform would say `two-state
solution,' that will be a great victory,'' Awad said.
   Zogby said nine state Democratic parties adopted platforms
endorsing Palestinian self-determination or a homeland. He said
they were: Washington, Vermont, Texas, Oregon, Minnesota, Maine,
Illinois, Iowa and California.
   Zogby noted before the vote that in 1984 a Jackson amendment on
the Middle East drew just 17 votes of support in the platform
committee. Saturday's action was by voice vote, but there were
clearly far more than 17 in favor of the Jackson amendment.
   The luncheon drew Reps. Bill Richardson, D-N.M. and Mary Rose
Oakar, D-Ohio, as well as Richard G. Hatcher, former mayor of Gary,
Ind., and Tony Anaya, former governor of New Mexico.

   U.S. and Japanese officials announced an
agreement Saturday aimed at expanding sales of a range of
American-made consumer products in Japan, a market that U.S.
companies hve found difficult to penetrate.
   The agreement would affect American sporting goods and leisure
products, furniture, jewelry, processed foods and pet foods, which
together accounted for nearly $1.6 billion in exports to Japan last
year.
   Of the United States' $170 billion trade deficit in 1987, $60
billion of the shortfall was with Japan. American government and
business officials have long complained that U.S. products are not
allowed to compete fairly in Japan.
   ``This is a first attempt to really penetrate the Japanese
consumer market by getting access to consumers,'' Commerce
Secretary C. William Verity said.
   Verity and Japan's minister of international trade and industry,
Hajime Tamura, announced the pact at a news conference and said
they hoped that additional industries would soon be added to the
initiative. Verity said that officials from the two countries had
discussed the eventual inclusion of about 20 products, including
medical and computer equipment.
   Under the agreement, trade officials from both countries will
help American companies locate potential customers in Japan. Verity
said he would soon meet with executives of the U.S. industries
involved to discuss the program.
   Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry will help
remove obstacles that have hindered U.S. sales in Japan, the
officials said.
   ``MITI will work with them in opening opportunities to get the
products on the shelves,'' Verity said. ``In department stores, all
products are Japanese.''
   Japanese banks and trading companies will also try to spur sales
of U.S. goods.
   Verity and Tamura declined to estimate what effect the agreement
would have on sales of the American products in Japan. They
acknowledged, however, that the initial results would not be
dramatic.
   ``We don't have flowers immediately when we try to sow the
seeds,'' Tamura said through a translator. ``We have to sow the
seeds first.''
   Tamura said that Japan's international trade surplus, which
peaked in 1986, has been dropping in recent months while domestic
demand has been growing sharply. He said that in the first five
months of this year, U.S. imports to Japan increased 43 percent
over the same period in 1987.
   ``Now is the best possible opportunity for market entries,'' he
said.
   ``The Japanese consumer is finally coming into his own,'' Verity
said. ``For our part, we want the Japanese consumer to be able to
buy America's best.''
   United States exports to Japan last year totaled $204 million in
sporting goods and leisure products, $34 million in furniture, $217
million in jewelry, and $1.1 billion in processed foods and pet
food.
   This is the second trade agreement between the United States and
Japan in a week. Last Monday, the two countries reached a trade
pact that would result in large increases in U.S. imports of beef
and citrus fruits to Japan by phasing out or reducing quotas and
tariffs.

   State Republican leaders Saturday named
conservative foreign policy expert Alan L. Keyes as the party's
candidate for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Paul Sarbanes,
who is seeking a third term.
   Keyes replaces businessman Thomas Blair, who won the GOP
nomination in the March primary but surprised party officials
earlier this month when he announced he would withdraw from the
race because of unspecified personal and business pressures.
   The special convention of the GOP Central Committee selected
Keyes over Gene Zarwell by a vote of 106-4. Zarwell had finished
well back in a crowded Republican primary this spring.
   In an acceptance speech, Keyes, 37, pledged a vigorous campaign
that would carry a message that ``freedom works.'' In earlier
remarks to the convention, Keyes outlined a philosophy that
government programs are only effective when they empower individual
citizens to solve their own problems.
   Keyes decried what he said was the emergence in the 1960s of a
new liberal philosophy that encourages ``the lie that freedom is a
choice with no responsibility.''
   Keyes' remarks were well received by the party faithful and
seemed, at least for a time, to heal a bitter split in the party.
   ``Keyes' inspiring vision for Maryland's future, plus his
rousing pledge to campaign hard to capture the Senate seat, really
fired up the convention,'' said GOP state Chairman Daniel Fleming.
``With Keyes on the Republican ballot this fall, the Democrats
better not take any voters for granted.''
   Fleming was an earlier backer of Keyes in the days following
Blair's sudden withdrawal announcement. However, other party
leaders mounted a last-minute drive to recruit a better known
candidate. The effort ended late last week when U.S. Rep. Helen
Bentley and a ``mystery'' potential candidate decided not to get in
the race.
   Keyes, a former assistant secretary of state, said he would take
an immediate leave of absence from the American Enterprise
Institute, where he is a resident scholar. Keyes, who has a
doctorate in government from Harvard University, left the foreign
service to serve as an adviser to the presidential campaign of Rep.
Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   Most political observers say Keyes faces a long-odds race to
unseat the popular Sarbanes.
   Following his nomination, Keyes held a news conference in which
he supported further aid to the rebels opposing the leftist
government of Nicaragua and funding for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the ``Star Wars'' space shield proposed by the Reagan
administration.
   Keyes, who is black, said he opposed sanctions against the
white-ruled government of South Africa and the administration's
policy of constructive engagement, policies that he said were a
choice between ``doing the wrong thing or doing nothing at all.''
   Instead, Keyes argued for ``democratic empowerment.'' He
proposed spending $100 million to support black institutions in
South Africa, such as trade unions and professional associations,
to increase the power base of blacks.
   He criticized the U.S. Supreme Court's decision that legalized
abortion, saying that issue should be left to the public to decide.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Public indifference to the recent
military coup in Haiti will soon wear off and be replaced by
renewed agitation for democracy, according to prominent Haitians
and diplomatic observers.
   ``We are living in the shadow of a volcano,'' said one Western
diplomat. ``Volcanos sometimes erupt and sometimes they stay
dormant for a long time. Haiti has been volatile and probably will
continue to be volatile.''
   Also commenting was the Rev. Hugo Trieste, director of the Roman
Catholic station Radio Soleil, which mobilized opposition to
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in the months preceding Duvalier's
flight to exile in February 1986.
   ``I have to think we still are on the path to democracy, but
that path has taken a strange twist,'' Trieste said.
   Last Sunday evening, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy broke out of house
arrest, forced his way into the National Palace and expelled
President Leslie Manigat. He proclaimed himself president,
dissolved the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, appointed a military
Cabinet and announced he would rule by decree.
   Haitians went about their business as if nothing happened.
   These same Haitians took to the streets by the thousands to
demonstrate against Namphy when he led the junta that ruled after
Duvalier left, and registered by the hundreds of thousands to vote
in last November's aborted elections.
   An opposition leader, trying to explain the indifference, said
most residents of this impoverished, overcrowded Caribbean nation
of 6 million did not feel the change of government directly
affected their daily struggles for food and shelter.
   Also, many Haitians felt Manigat's presidency was tainted by his
acceptance of elections last January that were flawed by low voter
turnout, a boycott by more popular candidates and alleged
manipulation of the tally by the Namphy junta.
   The political opponent spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Roman Catholic Church, Haiti's most influential institution,
issued no statement on the coup. Most political and labor leaders
who did issue statements chose not to put themselves in open
confrontation with the army.
   But the stage is set for renewed conflict.
   The 7,000-man army may not be so united as it seemed when
leaders from all major units stood behind Namphy during a short
speech he delivered last Monday on state-run television.
   Namphy, the 55-year-old former commander-in-chief, is in poor
health and may be a figurehead, said one high-ranking government
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of
retribution.
   ``They (officers) are gorillas,'' the official said. ``They
can't run a government. They proved that and will prove it again.''
   Haitians are not expected to stand by idly while the army
restricts freedom of the press, rules by decree rather than by law,
and tolerates corruption and human rights abuses as it did during
the two years Namphy led the junta.
   Already last week, aides and followers of Manigat were arrested
and held without charge, and the 1987 constitution was repeatedly
violated.
   Manigat provoked his own downfall by siding with Col.
Jean-Claude Paul, commander of the army's second-biggest unit, in a
dispute with Namphy. He then retired Namphy and put him under house
arrest.
   Manigat felt the army was his biggest obstacle to reform. He
attempted to seize the opportunity of an apparent rift in the ranks
to exert civilian control and consolidate his own political power.
   He almost carried it off. The army appeared to accept Namphy's
ouster, and also Manigat's reorganization of the army in which
about three dozen officers _ many of them Namphy allies _ were
ordered transferred to lesser posts and assignments.
   Ironically, Manigat may have been thwarted by a handful of
privates and sergeants of the presidential guard. These men, acting
out of apparent loyalty to Namphy, appeared at the military
leader's walled-in compound on the outskirts of the capital with an
armored personnel carrier and carried him back to the National
Palace.

   Amid flashing sabers and swirling dust,
about 380 men on horseback staged a Civil War cavalry skirmish
Saturday as part of a three-day reenactment of the Battle of
Gettysburg on its 125th anniversary.
   It was the largest Civil War cavalry reenactment ever staged,
said Kim Holien, a historian with the U.S. Army Center of Military
History. Previously, no more than 100 horses took part in a mock
engagement, he said.
   ``Cavalry outfits don't get a chance to show their stuff very
often,'' said Nancy Niero, vice president for Napoleonic Tactics
Inc., which organized the event on 700 acres of farmland five miles
south of the actual battlefield.
   ``All you see is soldiers and dust and sabres,'' said Steve
Hopkins, a 27-year-old copy machine technician from Arthur, Ill.,
who took part in the action.
   Hopkins rode with the 1st Platoon of the 7th Illinois Cavalry, a
unit he said played Afghani freedom fighters in Sylvester
Stallone's ``Rambo III.''
   Close to 9,000 men in uniform and more than 75,000 spectators
were expected for the three days of reenactments ending Sunday with
a restaging of Pickett's charge.
   Cannons boomed, bugles sounded and pistols crackled as horses
charged and withdrew several times in Saturday's portrayal of a
cavalry skirmish on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg.
   At one point, a Confederate soldier grabbed the Union flag and
headed back toward his line. He was chased by several ``blue
coats,'' who retrieved the standard.
   ``When you go up and grab somebody else's flag, you're asking
for trouble. Some of the people get their adrenaline going a little
too high and are a little too eager to get into hand-to-hand
combat,'' said Holien, who announced the action for a local radio
station.
   One Confederate ``soldier'' who didn't give his name said men in
Union uniforms were a little rough with their sabers.
   At least two riders required hospitalization after falling from
their mounts during the fray, authorities said.
   One suffered a fractured skull and another had a leg injury,
said Roseann McGlade, nursing supervisor at Gettysburg Hospital.
   She said the hospital treated about 24 other reenactors Saturday
morning with problems ranging from heat stroke to eye injuries from
the dust to stomach pains from eating genuine Civil War food.
   Tom McCutcheon of Kennesaw, Ga., said the danger of riding a
horse in a battle reenactment is worth the enjoyment.
   McCutcheon, another member of the 7th Illinois, said he has
served in the infantry and as an artillery unit. Neither compared
to the cavalry, he said.
   ``The exhilaration of the charge. They're the biggest crowd
pleasers. We can ride the wrong way and the crowd will applaud,''
said McCutcheon, a 42-year-old saddle maker and antique dealer.
   The Battle of Gettysburg took place from July 1-3, 1863, and
cost a total of close to 50,000 dead and wounded.
   On July 3, 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee ordered Major
Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry to try to break through the Union's
line.
   Stuart came up against several Union cavalry units including one
led by Brig. Gen. George A. Custer, three miles east of Gettysburg.
   A total of 11,000 cavalry soldiers took part in the actual
engagement, Holien said.

   Three gunmen in a car killed a man on a
motorcycle in Naples Saturday in what appeared to be a mob
vendetta, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   Ciro di Giacomo, 35, died at the scene and a companion,
Bartolomeo Cimmino, 30, was wounded and managed to flee, ANSA said.
It said the killers escaped.
   Di Giacomo had a criminal record and was believed to have ties
to the Camorra, the Neopolitan version of the Mafia, ANSA said.
   The motorcycle on which he and Cimmino were riding was stopped
when the car approached, ANSA said. One gunman fired from the car
window and two others leaped out and shot the men on the
motorcycle, the agency reported.
   Cimmino was hospitalized and was charged with failure to
cooperate with authorities after he balked at answering police
questions, ANSA said.

<HEAD>Cuban Production Fell in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domestic commercial production in Cuba fell
by 3.2 percent in 1987 because of depreciation of the U.S. dollar,
reduced imports and a poor sugar crop, the Cuban government news
agency Prensa Latina reported Saturday.
   In monetary terms, mercantile production was $491.8 million less
than in 1986, the National Bank of Cuba said in a report cited by
the news agency.
   The dispatch, monitored in Mexico City, cited the depreciation
of the dollar against other currencies and government restrictions
against imports from free-market economies for the decline in the
mercantile sector.
   It also blamed a drought that for the third straight year
reduced the sugar harvest, severely affected other crops and
lowered cattle production.
   Sugar production, which Prensa Latina called ``the basis of the
life of the country,'' fell 3.9 percent last year. The sector's
poor performance accounted for 13 percent of the drop in economic
production, it said.
   Non-sugar production suffered a 3.1 percent drop in 1987 because
of a shortage of foreign reserves needed to purchase supplies from
abroad, the bank report said. Imports dropped 20 percent from 1986,
it said.
   Cuba's total foreign trade in 1987 was unchanged from the
previous year. The Prensa Latina dispatch did not provide a figure.
The country's foreign trade deficit shrank by 1.5 percent, it said.
   A severe dollar shortage forced the government to ask Western
creditor nations this year to reschedule its foreign debt over 15
years and ask for a 5-year grace period, according to a National
Bank document made public in March.
   The document, released by Freedom House, a conservative human
rights group, listed Cuba's debt to Western creditors at $5.5
billion.
   World oil sales are conducted in U.S. dollars. The Soviet Union
has been sending proceeds of Soviet oil export sales to Cuba, and
so the dollar's decline in value has hit Cuba's foreign reserves.
   The decline in mercantile production ``did not affect the
quality of life of the population,'' the National bank report said.
Life expectancy for men on the island nation was 72.66 years, and
76.1 years for women in 1987, Prensa Latina said.

<DATELINE>OAXACA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers from seven leading
Latin American nations opened a weekend meeting Saturday aimed at
increasing regional economic and trade ties.
   The Group of Eight _ including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,
Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela _ also will draw up an agenda
for a summit meeting of their presidents in the fall at the beach
resort of Punta del Este, in Uruguay.
   Only Panama is absent. Its role will be discussed Monday at a
continuation of the meeting in Mexico City, 300 miles north of
Oaxaca.
   Panama was suspended from the group at its last meeting in
February, shortly after military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
was indicted in the United States on drug trafficking charges.
Noriega engineered the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle
after Delvalle tried to fire him.
   A Mexican Foreign Ministry statement confirmed that Foreign
Minister Jorge Ritter of Panama will be present at the Mexico City
session, which also will include a review of the Central American
situation.
   The meeting in Oaxaca, a picturesque colonial city in southern
Mexico, is intended mostly to explore ways of trying to build a
Latin American common market, a project which has been discussed
for more than two decades.
   Recent efforts by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay indicate a
renewed interest in a common market or free trade zone. The three
countries last year signed accords breaking down trade barriers and
increasing trade among them.
   Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Peru have shown signs of
interest in the idea of reviving Latin American trade partnership,
spurred mostly by their huge foreign debts which are making dollars
increasingly scarce.
   Mexico is building a huge pipeline for the Argentine government.
   ``Integration is one of the issues we will discuss with great
confidence and a great sense of realism,'' Carlos Perez del
Castillo, secretary of the Latin American Economic System, told
reporters upon his arrival in Oaxaca on Friday night. ``We are
convinced that the solution to our problems will not come from
outside, we have to seek it ourselves.''
   His multigovernment regional organization has been doing studies
on the project.
   Julio Londono, a representative from Colombia, called the
meeting ``very important, because for the first time the directors
of the organizations of Latin American integration (studies) will

   Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama formed the Contradora
group in 1983 in a so-far unsuccessful effort to find negotiated
solutions to the Central American conflicts in Nicaragua, Guatemala
and El Salvador.
   Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay joined the Contadora group
three years ago. They since have become known as the Group of Eight
and met in the most extensive presidential summit in Latin America
in more than 20 years last November in the Pacific coastal resort
of Acapulco.

   Kristen Logan of Mississippi was named
America's Junior Miss on Saturday night, triumphing over 49 other
high school seniors by singing ``Somewhere Out There'' and winning
the physical fitness category.
   ``I feel fantastic,'' said the 17-year-old Hattiesburg native.
   Indiana's Jody Hilger was the first runner-up, and Delphine Lee
of Oklahoma was second. The third runner-up was Idaho's Lucretia
Murphy. California's Megan Murray was fourth.
   Miss Logan said she plans to use the $30,000 scholarship she won
to attend Baylor University next fall, where she plans to major in
broadcasting. ``I want to talk to Jane Pauley,'' she said,
referring to the NBC ``Today'' show personality.
   Final competition Saturday followed preliminaries in several
categories Thursday and Friday.
   Contestants from the 50 states vied for $67,000 in scholarships.
The District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, which have sent entries
in the past, did not send competitors this year.
   The mistress of ceremonies was actress, model and television
personality Julie Bryan Moran of Los Angeles, who won the national
title in 1980 while representing Georgia.

   Tens of thousands of Roman Catholics
from many lands converged on Medjugorje on Saturday to celebrate
the seventh anniversary of a reported apparition of the Virgin
Mary, Tanjug news agency said.
   Medjugorje, a village in central Yugoslavia, has become a
religious shrine since 1981, when six children _ four boys and two
irls _ said they saw the Madonna while they were tending sheep on
nearby hills.
   Although the Vatican never formally accepted the Medjugorje
shrine, the pilgrims, including sick and disabled people, have been
gathering each day in the village to watch for the Madonna to
reappear. They also want to listen to the six Yugoslavs, now
adults, communicate with the Virgin Mary.
   About 10 million people from Yugoslavia and abroad have visited
the site.
   ``A large number of today's visitors came from the United States
and Australia,'' said the state-operated Tanjug agency.
   Communist Yugoslavia has a reputation for relative liberalism,
but the idea of thousands of Christians turning the village into a
religious shrine initially caused great apprehension among
authorities.
   After six years of hesitation, however, state-run companies
decided to try to capitalize on the influx of foreign visitors.
   A modern hotel complex, along with hundreds of private inns,
were built to accommodate an unprecedented tourist boom in the
region.

   Alabama's governor asked people Saturday to pray for rain to end
the drought, Milwaukee officials considered whether to forgo Fourth
of July fireworks because of fire danger and barges moved again on
the Mississippi.
   Temperatures hissed to record highs, but not in the same places
as over the past week. Thanks to a cold front, temperatures across
the northern Plains were 15 to 25 degrees cooler than Friday, and
most of the records were in the Ohio Valley, with relief there
expected Sunday.
   The depleted lower Mississippi River was blocked to shipping
again Saturday by barges running aground.
   Showers and thunderstorms were widespread Friday night and early
Saturday across eastern Texas and southern Arkansas into the
central Gulf coast.
   ``I ask that God-fearing people across our state put aside time
next Wednesday to pray that God will send life-giving rain to our
state and our nation,'' Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt, a Primitive Baptist
lay preacher, said Saturday in his weekly radio address.
   A few locations in the middle Mississippi Valley never left the
80s overnight, including Ottumwa, Iowa, at 80 and St. Louis, Mo.,
at 82.
   High temperature records started falling early. It wasn't even
noon when the temperature at Milwaukee passed the previous record
of 95 and kept on rising to a high of 100. Flint, Mich., tied its
record of 94 at 10:45 a.m. and continued on to 101. The mercury hit
100 by noon at Chicago, and reached a record 103, making this June
the first there with three 100-plus days since records began in
1873.
   Peoria, Ill., hit a high of 105 and Fort Wayne, Ind., hit 106,
the second highest reading in the country behind 110 at Phoenix,
Ariz.
   The heat wave has been blamed for six deaths.
   Chicago public health officials said people could use
air-conditioned public libraries and centers for the aging as
cooling shelters Saturday. ``We are monitoring the situation and
will open more shelters if needed,'' said Dr. David Marder, a
health department official.
   Fires fanned by hot, dry winds burned at least 1,200 acres in
south-central Wisconsin, destroying rural homes, chasing campers
from state parks and forcing the temporary closure of a 20-mile
stretch of Interstate 90-94.
   Several Wisconsin communities already have decided to do without
fireworks this year because of the fire threat, and Milwaukee
County officials planned to decide by Monday whether to cancel the
aerial displays, said parks director M. Brigid Sullivan. One show
will go on because the rockets will be shot over Lake Michigan.
   ``This is the first time they have been canceled,'' James Myers,
city clerk in Monroe, Wis., said of the fireworks. ``It's sad. But
it would be kind of sad to see your house burn up too.''
   A forest fire exacerbated by the heat and lack of rain burned at
least 34,000 acres of grass and forest in southeastern Montana and
a small area of western South Dakota. The blaze burned out of
control on its northwest perimeter despite the efforts of 650
firefighters, and Bureau of Land Management officials dropped
earlier forecasts that the fire might be contained by Sunday night.
   A grass and forest fire in northeastern Wyoming was contained
Saturday after burning more than 6,000 acres. Shoshone National
Forest officials in northwest Wyoming said a fire in prime
timberland had burned about 550 acres.
   At Memphis, Tenn., a 30-mile-long towboat and barge traffic jam
on the dwindling Mississippi River was clearing up Saturday. The
river was closed there from Tuesday until a dredge finished
clearing a channel on Friday. Southbound barges were cleared during
the night before northbound traffic was allowed to start through.
   However, the increasingly shallow lower Mississippi was blocked
again when barges ran aground near Greenville, Miss., and Helena,
Ark., and about 20 miles north of Osceola, Ark., Coast Guard Chief
Petty Officer Dean Jones said Saturday.
   On Sunday, Assistant Army Secretary for Civil Works Robert W.
Page is to make an aerial inspection of the river ``because we have
continued groundings that have blocked traffic,'' said David Rich,
a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers in Memphis.
   Some shippers are switching to the relatively new
Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway that runs from Mobile, Ala., to the
Tennessee River which connects to the Ohio River. Barge traffic on
the waterway has increased by 50 percent during the past few days
because of low water on the Mississippi, the Army Corps of
Engineers said.
   Sam Green, a spokesman with the Corps in Mobile, said the
Tenn-Tom is ``pretty well drought-proof,'' and has been unaffected
by the lack of rain. However, it adds distance and is too narrow to
accept the large tows of barges common on the Mississippi and has
never met original predictions of how much it would be used.
   More than 5.75 inches of rain was reported overnight at Leakey,
Texas, and a flash flood warning was issued in Texas for southern
Real and northern Uvalde counties.
   Some parts of Louisiana got more than an inch of rain. ``We need
an inch of rain every week for the next three or four weeks, just
to put the moisture back into the subsoil where it should be,''
said cotton grower Jim Harper of Cheneyville, La.
   Birmingham, Ala., got its first measurable rain in 30 days and
nearby Childersburg had torrential rain that beat down cornstalks,
covered streets and lawns and overflowed from ditches.
   A line of intense thunderstorms blew into Colorado, sent
temperatures plummeting and spawned four tornadoes, including one
that took the roof off a farm building near Loveland. Heavy rain
flooded some intersections in Denver. The heat has been blamed for
four deaths in St. Louis, Mo.; one in Thomas County, Ga.; and one
in East St. Louis, Ill.

   Some days, Laura Steinberg works for the Boston
Bar Association's Committee for Civil Rights. Other days, she
opposes it.
   Steinberg and other attorneys at Boston's big law firms have
been moving back and forth across that fence for two decades. On
one side, they butter their bread. On the other, they soothe their
souls.
   The committee, which celebrated its 20th anniversary Saturday,
assigns lawyers to represent black, Asian and Hispanic clients in
discrimination cases. The lawyers volunteer their time, and 26
Boston law firms donate most of the committee's $400,000 annual
budget.
   Those same firms, however, also represent many of the powerful
organizations and individuals that the committee sues. To be sure,
the lawyers follow ethical guidelines intended to prevent conflicts
of interest, and no firm represents both sides in a single case.
   But the irony of Boston's top lawyers and law firms donating
time and money to take on their establishment clients is obvious _
and the committee's staff isn't shy about discussing it.
   ``We've been successful by being part of the establishment, but
at the same time being an organization that continually challenges
the establishment,'' said Barbara R. Arnwine, the committee's
executive director.
   ``It has its awkward and also its amusing moments,'' said
Steinberg, who is simultaneously suing the Boston Housing Authority
on behalf of the committee and defending the city's Water and Sewer
Commission against a suit filed for the committee by another lawyer.
   A Harvard Law School graduate and partner in the firm of
Sullivan & Worcester, Steinberg said she likes taking cases for the
committee because they are often class-action suits involving
``meaty'' constitutional issues.
   ``Twenty-five years ago, there was no Civil Rights Act, no
Voting Rights Act, no Fair Housing Act, and precious little civil
rights,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., told the group at its
anniversary dinner Saturday night. ``The Lawyers' Committee can
point with pride to your indispensable role in the writing of these
laws _ and your equally indispensible role in securing their strong
enforcement.''
   The committee's best-known suit was probably the Boston school
desegregation case of 1972, which resulted in the court order for
racial integration of the city's schools.
   But the group also has challenged hiring practices in the police
and fire departments. It brought a 1976 federal case that
established the obligation of employers to maintain a work
environment free of racial or sexual harassment. It has represented
victims of racially motivated violence. And it has been
particularly active in the fair housing arena.
   John Taylor Williams, a partner in the firm of Palmer & Dodge,
said there are some self-interested reasons why old-line firms may
support the committee _ particularly recruiting.
   ``Whatever people may say about pin-striped lawyers, there are
still a lot of people who go to law school motivated in part by a
desire to bring about social change,'' he said. ``You can often
recruit better lawyers to your firm because they know they'll have
the opportunity to get involved in civil rights cases.''
   But, Williams said, most of the city's big law firms also
recognize that it is ``in everyone's interest'' to keep Boston
``the most civilized city in America,'' and that ``part of being
civilized is not discriminating on the basis of race.''
   Formally named the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under the
Law, the group was formed by the Boston Bar Association in the wake
of the riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther
King in 1968.
   It is one of several regional chapters of the national Lawyers'
Committee for Civil Rights, which had been established in 1963 at
the instigation of President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General
Robert Kennedy.
   ``At a time in which there's been a loss of momentum on civil
rights issues in the public sector _ under the Reagan
administration in particular _ the lawyers' committee has
maintained the momentum of the '60s and '70s,'' said Superior Court
Judge J. Harold Flannery, who worked for the committee before going
on the bench in 1984.
   ``Its commitment is more than lip service, more than just
rhetorical,'' he added. ``They have jumped in and done the actual,
nitty-gritty legal work, at considerable risk of unpopularity.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Probe Finds Elderly Are Victims of Prescription Blunders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two million elderly Americans become ill
or die each year because of reactions to drugs often prescribed
unnecessarily and sometimes taken in potentially deadly doses, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Arizona Republic said it found through a five-month
investigation in 13 states that many institutionalized elderly are
given mind-altering drugs, that thousands have died after getting
wrong dosages and that others were used as guinea pigs in drug
experiments.
   The newspaper said in the first installment of a seven-day
series it had found that about one in every seven doses of medicine
the elderly receive are in error.
   Of the $9 billion people over 65 spend annually on prescription
drugs, about $2 billion is considered unnecessary, the Republic
said, citing federal records.
   Officials have estimated the total health-care bill for wrongly
medicating the elderly at $21 billion a year, the newspaper said.
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., chairman of the House Committee on
Aging, called the problem ``a national outrage.''
   `Those figures are staggering,'' Pepper said. ``It shows how
callous some people are regarding the elderly. All they want to do
is placate them until they pass away.''
   In Arizona, some nursing homes have made medication errors more
than half the time they give drugs, the Republic said. The national
Health Care Finance Administration considers a 5 percent error rate
acceptable.
   The newspaper said it also found that:
   _ Some doctors and drug companies around the country used
elderly patients as test subjects for experiments, sometimes
involving new, unlicensed drugs, without obtaining the patients'
informed consent.
   _ Numerous medical studies conducted since the mid-1970s show
the aged have been improperly given tranquilizers, hypnotic drugs
and potent antipsychotic drugs that left thousands severely ill,
hospitalized or dead.
   _ Many thousands of elderly who are overmedicated fall,
suffering debilitating, sometimes fatal injuries.
   _ Most medical schools have inadequately trained doctors,
particularly in geriatric pharmacology and geriatrics.
   _ Many doctors do not want to treat the elderly, nor do they
find it financially desirable to care for them in nursing homes
because of strict federal limitations on Medicare reimbursements.
   _ Despite congressional orders five years ago to do so, many
drug manufacturers still have not tested most of their drugs on the
elderly to determine effects and have failed to recognize the need
for a category specifying geriatric doses in labeling and package
inserts.
   The Republic also said doctors are ignorant of the extent of
medication-related deaths partly because autopsies are rarely
performed on the elderly, leaving physicians often to guess the
cause.
   Don Goddard of Sun City, who founded the senior citizens segment
of the St. Luke's Medical Center chemical-dependency unit in
Phoenix in 1974, estimated that 30 percent of the patients he met
in 10 years directing the program were addicted to prescription
medications. Most were women.
   ``That is the drug problem with older people,'' said Goddard,
84. ``We don't take heroin or cocaine. It would be a news story if
we did.''

   The Democratic Platform Committee rebuffed the
Jesse Jackson campaign on taxes, defense and the Middle East as it
approved a succinct, middle-of-the-road platform Saturday tailored
to the stands of Michael Dukakis.
   The panel turned aside repeated efforts to amend the platform
with Jackson campaign planks as it approved a document of barely
4,000 words _ one-tenth the size of its 1980 and 1984 platforms.
   The decisive vote came on the first amendment, when the Jackson
forces sought to append their basic budget plan to the Democratic
blueprint. The Jackson budget plank was rejected by a 108-44 margin
and turned out to be the only issue decided by a standing tally.
   Later, on voice votes, the Democrats rebuffed the Jackson forces
on attempts to put a call for no-first-use of nuclear weapons in
the platform, and on a call for ``self-determination for Israelis
and Palestinians.''
   The committee did make some changes on issues ranging from child
care to the environment, but only when the Dukakis and Jackson
campaigns were in accord.
   Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, who chairs the platform
committee, praised the final draft as ``a truly unique document.
... I believe we're going to have a victorious year for all
Democrats.''
   The meeting ended on a note of unity, with the delegates
unanimously adding even tougher language to their plank labeling
South Africa a terrorist state. The final amendment says the next
administration will ``determine a date certain by which U.S.
corporations leave South Africa.''
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's representative on the platform
committee, said, ``We feel we have achieved our goal to get
Jackson's views into the platform.'' She said she did not know
whether Jackson would press any floor fights on the platform in
Atlanta.
   The meeting lasted 11 hours and, despite the rebuff to the
Jackson forces on key issues, remained harmonious throughout.
   Mike Barnes, Dukakis' platform chief, said, ``It's a great sign
of unity. ... What was demonstrated here is that the Democratic
party really has matured and is ready to take the reins of
government.''
   Richard Hatcher, former mayor of Gary, Ind., offered the Jackson
amendment to freeze the military budget and ``return taxes on the
very richest Americans to their 1977 levels and restore corporate
taxes to their pre-Reagan levels.''
   Hatcher said raising taxes on those making more than $200,000 a
year would raise $20 billion ``for investment in education, job
training and housing for homeless (and) other critical domestic
needs.''
   But Rep. Robert Matsui of California, a Dukakis backer, replied,
``I have never believed that the Democratic party's principle and
goals and values is to tax Americans. We have never said that was
part of our heritage.''
   Matsui defended Dukakis's insistence that the government should
step up collection of taxes from scofflaws before looking to higher
taxes to reduce the deficit.
   On the Middle East, James Zogby, executive director of the Arab
American Institute, urged the party to seek ``peace based on mutual
recognition, territorial compromise and self-determination for
Israelis and Palestinians.''
   Zogby said that while Democrats have a commitment to Israel,
``Palestinians, too, need security. Palestinians want what any
other people want: the right to live in peace in their own land,
free of occupation.''
   But Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, speaking for the Dukakis side,
said, ``We should not succumb to the temptation ... of wishing to
impose on other parties what we think the solution should be.''
   On the no-first-use of nuclear weapons amendment, Claire
Greensfelder, a Jackson delegate and anti-nuclear activist from
Berkeley, Calif., was near tears as she argued, ``Let us remember
we are the only people who have ever dropped a nuclear weapon on
other people in the world.''
   But the delegates rejected the amendment after hearing Rep. Tom
Bevill of Alabama say, ``Certainly this would be weakening a strong
defense.''
   The Platform Committee also rejected, by voice vote, an attempt
to include in the platform the Jackson campaign's promise to double
the federal education budget. The platform does promise to give
education ``our highest priority'' and to expand pre-school
programs and create a National Teacher Corps to recruit teachers
through scholarships.
   The 44 Jackson votes on the budget plank were nearly a quarter
of the Platform Committee's full membership of 186, ensuring
Jackson's right to force a fight on the issue on the convention
floor in Atlanta next month if he wishes.
   Norton said Jackson told her by telephone from Puerto Rico
Friday night that she should press the issues on which they were
unable to reach consensus ``in a spirit of collegiality and respect
for his opponent, Gov. Dukakis.''
   She said Jackson wanted his delegates to remember ``that what
counts is the final victory we shall achieve in November.''
   Blanchard told the 153 members at the meeting, ``It's my hope
that our work will help elect Democrats from court houses to state
houses to the White House.''
   Earlier, the governor told reporters, the document was short
enough to be put on posters and mailed out, ``read at the
convention and posted on the walls of government classes.''
   The document, titled ``The Restoration of Competence and Hope,''
pledges that Democrats will ``restore competence, caring and
incorruptibility to the federal executive branch and get it working
again fairly for all Americans.''
   As Jackson wanted, it terms South Africa ``a terrorist state.''
   Although it does not mention President Reagan or Vice President
George Bush by name, it derides ``voodoo economics.''
   It says Democrats will ``promote peace and prevent war'' but
``not by trading weapons for hostages, not by sending brave
Americans to undefined missions in Lebanon and Honduras ... (and)
not by toasting a tyrant like (former Philippine President
Ferdinand) Marcos as a disciple of democracy.''
   It promises the Democrats will seek ``significant reductions''
in nuclear weapons. It urges ``more stable defense budgets'' and
``maintaining the special relationship with Israel'' while pursuing
peace in the Middle East along lines of the Camp David accords.

   Incumbent Vigdis Finnbogadottir gained
an overwhelming victory over another woman candidate in Saturday's
presidential election in her bid for a third four-year term.
   Poll officials said early Sunday that with 47.3 percent of the
ballot counted, Mrs. Finnbogadottir won about 95 percent of the
vote and her rival, Sigrun Thorsteinsdottir, had the remaining 5
percent.
   The officials said about 75 percent of Iceland's 173,800
eligible voters cast ballots.
   In conceding defeat in a television interview, Mrs.
Thorsteinsdottir said the election had been a great victory for all
``democratic and freedom-loving people in Iceland'' as opposed to
the ``autocratic and monarchist'' supporters of the establishment.
   She did not congratulate the 58-year-old president on her
victory but offered herself as a presidential aide, saying it was
``obvious that (the present) aides are unfit for the job.''
   Sources close to the president, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they could hardly envisage a situation where Mrs.
Thorsteinsdottir's advice would be sought.
   President Finnbogadottir said in a TV interview she was
delighted b the results and that any incumbent president would be
satisfied with such overwhelming support.
   Final results were expected later Sunday.
   Vigdis, as the president is popularly known among the 250,000
Icelanders, was the world's first democratically elected woman
state president, when she defeated three men in 1980.
   She was re-elected unopposed in 1984 and was host at the
Reykjavik superpower summit in October 1986.
   Mrs. Thorsteinsdottir has been active within the Humanist Party,
which so far has failed to get a representative elected to the
Althing, the world's oldest parliament.
   Mrs. Thorsteinsdottir, 46, ran on a platform of giving the
presidential office a more active role.
   Mrs. Finnbogadottir maintained that the presidency was created
as a ceremonial post and should remain so.
   The president refused to run an active campaign and repeatedly
refused an invitation from her rival to a public debate.
   Real power in Iceland rests with the prime minister, Thorsteinn
Palsson.
   Saturday was the first time an incumbent president has faced a
re-election challenge since Iceland, formerly under Danish rule,
became a republic in 1944.
   Icelandic women recently won greater political power. The
left-wing Women's Alliance _ which made history in 1983 when it
became the first feminist movement in the world to win
parliamentary seats _ doubled its representation to six seats in
last year's general election.
   The Independence Party is Iceland's largest political party and
a dominant force in the three-party coalition government.
   Mrs. Finnbogadottir, a divorcee, was formerly director of the
Reykjavik Theater Company.
   She had no formal involvement in politics when she was first
elected, but was generally regarded as being the preferred
candidate of the Icelandic left, notably because of her opposition
to the United States' military presence in Iceland at the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization base at Keflavik.
   The president is traditionally a non-political figure.

<HEAD>Protesters Meet Angolan Leader On Arrival In Mississippi</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi
received an award named for a slain black civil rights leader
Saturday but was criticized by anti-apartheid protesters and the
civil rights leader's widow.
   Savimbi, 53, the president of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), accepted the Medgar Evers
Humanitarian Award from Fayette Mayor Charles Evers, brother of the
civil rights leader.
   The award ceremony had to be moved inside city hall from the
steps outside to avoid heckling by people protesting Savimbi's ties
with white-ruled South Africa, which supports UNITA's struggle
against Angola's Marxist government and has a policy of racial
segregation known as apartheid.
   ``The Angolan people are not asking for pity, they are asking
for understanding because they have proven themselves good
fighters. We want freedom in South Africa,'' Savimbi said. ``We are
going to do it. We need your support. Give us that support.''
   ``On behalf of all of us freedom loving people in Mississippi
and Fayette, whether they like it or not, we feel that you are our
hero,'' Evers said in presenting the award.
   Myrlie Evers, Medgar's widow, who is remarried and living in Los
Angeles, said Thursday that the choice of Savimbi was politically
motivated and that her late husband would not have approved.
   Medgar Evers was field director of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People when he was gunned down in front
of his Jackson home in 1963.
   Earlier Saturday, about 40 protesters shouting anti-apartheid
and anti-Savimbi epithets gathered outside a Jackson motel where
Savimbi had scheduled a news conference. They were met by a
Bible-toting, pro-Savimbi group shouting, ``We are against
communism.''
   Evers failed to calm the protest and eight uniformed Jackson
police officers forced both groups out of the hotel without
incident.
   ``I hate apartheid because apartheid is the black people being
oppressed,'' Savimbi said during the news conference. He added,
however, that he believed ``progress in Namibia and South Africa
depends on peace in Angola.''
   South Africa has refused to withdraw from neighboring Namibia,
in defiance of a United Nations resolution, because of the presence
of Cuban troops in Angola that support the government there.
   ``I am not fighting a South African struggle. I am fighting the
struggle for freedom, for dignity of the black people in Angola,''
Savimbi said.
   Charles Evers compared Savimbi's struggle with that of American
blacks in the 1960s and said his brother would have approved of the
award.
   ``Dr. Savimbi is a man who has fought for freedom,'' Evers said.
``He fought the Russians, the communists and the Cubans. I've been
there. I've seen the work he's done.''
   Savimbi will go to Washington next week and meet with President
Reagan on Thursday.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who
finished third in Iowa's precinct caucuses more than four months
ago, picked up 13 of 18 delegates elected Saturday at the Iowa
Democratic Convention.
   With the 13 new delegates in his camp, Dukakis had 49 members of
the state's 61-member delegation, while Jesse Jackson had 12.
   After launching the Democratic presidential nominating process
with the state caucuses in February, Iowa on Saturday became the
last state in the nation to complete its slate of delegates to the
Democratic National Convention in August.
   Iowa Democratic Party Chairwoman Bonnie Campbell told delegates
at the party's state convention that the state has ``a process that
all of us should be proud of, and those who might like to see Iowa
quietly slip by the political wayside will not be so lucky.''
   Ms. Campbell has promised to lead the fight against any move to
push Iowa from its first-in-the-nation status.
   Jesse Jackson, who finished second to Dukakis in the nationwide
delegate count, has said he will push for a new system to give
larger states a greater voice in the early nominating process.
   Some Democrats in other states have grumbled that Iowa does not
deserve to kick off the party's nominating process because the
state has not been carried by a Democratic presidential candidate
since 1964.
   ``While our caucuses have had more than their fair share of
criticisms, we have shown the world that Iowa is a place where
candidates can come to talk with real, live people about building a
better world, rather than spending big money on television campaign
commercials,'' Ms. Campbell said.

<TEXT>
   About 30 women removed their shirts in a
city park and bared their breasts for several hours to protest a
state law allowing men, but not women, to remove their shirts in
public.
   It was the third year in a row for the protest, which is
becoming an annual rite of summer.
   ``We intend to continue this until the law is changed,'' said
Ramona Santorelli, a protest organizer. ``This is a day to
celebrate the acceptance of women going shirtless.''
   Bare-chested women played softball and volleyball, and lounged
in the sun at Genesee Valley Park.
   Santorelli launched the effort three years ago after a security
guard ordered her to put a shirt on while she was sunbathing in an
uncrowded city park.
   The first protest in 1986 attracted a large crowd of gawkers and
hecklers who taunted the seven women who removed their shirts and
were arrested.
   The women were acquitted of misdemeanor charges, but their
victory was a partial one. Judge Herman Walz ruled it was
permissible for the women to remove their shirts in public as a
form of protest, but said it would be illegal for any other reason.
   Last year, about 25 women bared their breasts and enjoyed their
picnic without interruption from onlookers or the police. Saturday
was a repeat of that experience.
   The event was a bit befuddling for Patrick Massaquoi, a native
of Liberia attending a family reunion in a picnic shelter near the
topless women.
   ``Looks to me what you have over there is Western society
degenerating,'' Massaquoi said. ``In Africa, this is the custom and
native way and you can understand it. But what's good for Africa is
not necessarily good for Rochester.''

<TEXT>
   Marta Abba, a leading Italian stage
performer of the 1920s and `30s and the favorite actress of
Sicilian playwright Luigi Pirandello, died on her 88th birthday
Friday after suffering a stroke.
   Abba entered Milan's drama school when she was 15 and began her
career in 1923 with the stage company of director Ettore Paladini.
She drew acclaim the following year in Virgilio Talli's production
of Chekhov's ``Gabbiano.''
   In 1925, she became the lead actress for Pirandello, who won the
1934 Nobel Prize in literature and is considered a top figure in
20th-century European theater.
   She became his lifetime companion and Pirandello wrote several
plays specifically for her, including ``Come Tu Mi Vuoi'' (As You
Desire Me) in 1930.
   Pirandello died in 1936. Two years later, Abba married an
American, S.A. Millikin, grandson of a Cleveland steel baron,
retired and settled in the United States.
   After the marriage broke up, she moved back to Milan in 1953,
returning briefly to the stage. She had been on the board of the
Institute of Pirandello Studies and Contemporary Italian Theater
since 1962.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Jackson Reach Compromise on Rules Changes</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>

   Michael Dukakis gave in to Jesse Jackson Saturday on changing
Democratic rules for 1992, but the Massachusetts governor stood
firm on keeping the party's platform short and non-specific.
   Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush savored a victory in Iowa,
where his campaign had been sent into a spin by his third-place
finish in the caucuses back in February.
   Jackson, campaigning in Puerto Rico on Saturday, hailed the
proposed rules changes as ``a victory for the people ... a victory
for democracy.''
   If the rules changes, approved Saturday in Washington by the
party's Rules Committee, are adopted by the national convention
next month, the number of ``super delegates'' to the 1992
convention would be cut nearly in half. In addition, all states
would be compelled to award delegates to presidential candidates in
proportion to their support in the primaries and caucuses.
   Jackson had complained that current provisions for super
delegates and the rules in a few state primaries and caucuses
unfairly kept him from getting as many delegates as he should have.
   The rules being changed were the very ones that Dukakis had used
to his advantage in clinching the Democratic presidential
nomination. But Tad Devine, the campaign's director of delegate
selection who led the Dukakis negotiating team, said the
Massachusetts governor would have won the nomination even if the
rules had been changed.
   The Democrats' Platform Committee, meeting in Denver, was
winding up work on a statement of party principles that Michigan
Gov. James Blanchard, the committee chairman, said would be short
enough to print on a poster and mailed out. A 4,000-word draft of
the document is one-tenth the size of the 1984 platform.
   But unlike the Rules Committee, which convened to rubber-stamp
the deals worked out in private negotiations between the Jackson
and Dukakis campaigns, proposals from the Jackson camp on taxes,
defense, the Middle East and other issues were roundly rejected by
the Platform Committee.
   The panel turned aside repeated efforts to amend the platform
with Jackson campaign planks as it approved a document of barely
4,000 words _ one-tenth the size of its 1980 and 1984 platforms.
   Nevertheless, the mood throughout the 11-hour meeting was
harmonious.
   The first Jackson amendment, calling for higher taxes and a
freeze on Pentagon spending, was defeated 108-44.
   Later, on voice votes, the Democrats rejected Jackson campaign
proposals opposing first use of nuclear weapons by the United
States, calling for ``self-determination for Israelis and
Palestinians,'' and urging a doubling of the federal education
budget.
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, who heads Jackson's platform effort, said
he told her by telephone that she should press the issues on which
they were unable to agree ``in a spirit of collegiality and respect
for his opponent, Gov. Dukakis.''
   One other issue the Democrats need to settle before the
convention is the selection of a keynote speaker, and Texas
Treasurer Ann Richards said she is on the short list of candidates
being considered by Dukakis and party Chairman Paul Kirk.
   ``I'm sure the fact that I have been a Democrat all my life and
active in the party, and the fact that I am the first female in
Texas to hold public office statewide in 50 years'' played a part,
she said.
   An announcement of who will deliver the convention's keynote
address is expected this week.
   Jackson spent Saturday in Puerto Rico, where he tried to pry
loose some Dukakis delegates that he said should be his. Jackson
won the state's non-binding primary, but Dukakis came away with
almost all the delegates, who were picked separately.
   Dukakis was taking a breather in his schedule with a weekend on
Nantucket Island in Massachusetts. No public events were planned.
   Bush spoke by telephone to state GOP convention delegates in
Iowa Saturday, saying ``the American people are going to see the
clearest-cut choice in an election since the McGovern-Nixon race in
1972.''
   In the February caucuses, Bush finished behind Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and television evangelist Pat Robertson.
Bush recovered from the defeat with a victory in the New Hampshire
primary eight days later.
   The vice president no longer has any opponents for the GOP
presidential nomination, and on Saturday he collected all 37 of
Iowa's delegates to the national convention.

   Turkish officials on Saturday ordered
rescue workers to stop digging for survivors of a landslide because
of the danger of a new slide.
   The decision came as West German volunteers said they were
``within a few meters'' (yards) of reaching the debris from a
crowded coffeehouse engulfed in Thursday's landslide.
   Up to 100 people were buried in the slide, which also swallowed
up a restaurant and an empty high school.
   ``We are angry. We should have been permitted to go on ... there
is a slight chance that people are alive in the coffeehouse
basement,'' said Hans Ruhl, a deputy director of the German Rescue
Dog Association.
   Rescue efforts were halted while a new causeway was built to
carry off excavated earth.
   ``There is constant danger of new landslide and of a cave-in and
flooding if the West Germans continue. We are engineers, we know
the dangers,'' said Erkan Omarbeyoglu, Trabzon regional highway
director.
   Three West Germans who were in the coffeehouse were among the
missing, along with 43 Turks, according to regional officials.
   There were reports that two British tourists also were in the
coffeehouse, but some witnesses said the two had left before the
disaster.
   ``It is my opinion there's little chance now for finding anyone
alive and it lessens every hour,'' said Ruhl.
   Officials said it could take a month to clear 500,000 tons of
earth, rock and uprooted trees blocking the road from the Black Sea
port of Trabzon to eastern Anatolia and Iran.
   Geologists were surveying the hillside that collapsed but it was
not clear whether they would blast away another chunk that might be
dislodged.
   ``This is a great calamity for our village. We had 10 buses and
300 trucks coming through every day,'' said Riza Yavuz, the village
headman.
   Catak lies 19 miles from Trabzon among hazelnut and cherry
orchards in the shadow of spectacular mountains.
   Trabzon was famous as Trebizond in medieval times as the capital
of a breakaway Byzantine state and later birthplace of the Ottoman
Sultan Suleiman Magnificent.
   Villagers blamed the landslide on what they said was shoddy
construction when the highway was widened three years ago to handle
increasing truck and tourist traffic.
   The construction workers blasted the hillside and then failed to
shore up a 139-foot-high escarpment, the villagers said.
   ``I knew it would eventually collapse,'' Yavuz said.
   He said the villagers appeal to the Public Works Ministry in
Ankara just brought ``promises they would deal with the problem
eventually.''
   The landslide hit the coffeehouse when it was full of bus
passengers and truck drivers who had waited all night for
bulldozers to clear an earlier rock fall blocking the road.
   ``It was standing room only in the coffeehouse and people had
been watching television there through the night,'' said Nizamettin
Ozturk.
   Ozturk said his house was flooded when a fast flowing stream
running through the village jammed with rocks and soil and changed
course.

   Investigators in the Pentagon bribery probe
videotaped meetings in which Defense Department officials allegedly
took payoffs from consultants, sources close to the two-year
investigation said Saturday.
   The sources said that two key figures in the investigation,
Victor Cohen, deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for
tactical systems, and James Gaines, a deputy assistant secretary of
the Navy, appear on some of the videotapes. However, the sources
declined to say whether alleged bribes turned up on the recordings
of those two Pentagon officials.
   The consultants shown on the videotapes also include Melvyn
Paisley, the former procurement chief for the Navy whose office was
searched on June 7 by federal authorities in the investigation, the
sources said.
   NBC News reported Friday night that Cohen would leave the
Pentagon whenever a defense consultant would call, that his
meetings with consultants were recorded and videotaped and that
money changed hands.
   The sources, meanwhile, said that Gaines also was videotaped at
meetings with consultants in which highly confidential documents
relating to Pentagon contracts allegedly changed hands.
   The Washington Post reported that Cohen, deputy assistant
secretary of the Air Force for tactical systems, is among those
cooperating in the investigation.
   Sources close to the case said this past week that Gaines is
cooperating in the investigation. Those sources continued to make
that assertion Saturday, while other sources and the Post said that
while Gaines gave a statement to investigators earlier, he is not
cooperating with prosecutors at this point.
   Meanwhile, Defense News reported in its June 27 editions that
Paisley, when he was the Navy's procurement chief under Navy
Secretary John Lehman, initiated a change that effectively
eliminated all but one company from a key procurement program in
1986.
   The change was to drop plans for separate competitions on all
six components of the Aegis weapon system and instead go with a
winner-take-all scheme. The system protects ships from airborne,
surface and underwater missiles.
   The result of the change, Defense News quoted several
unidentified industry officials as saying, was that hundreds of
millions of dollars in Navy contracts for the Aegis system went to
Sperry Corp., now Unisys Corp., one of the firms involved in the
Pentagon bribery investigation.
   Defense News quoted sources as attributing the shift that
favored Unisys to Paisley's close association with William Galvin,
a consultant to the company. The publication quoted several sources
as saying that Galvin had boasted about having ``wired'' the Aegis
competition in Sperry's favor.
   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported in Sunday's editions that
investigators probing Northrop Corp.'s involvement in the alleged
fraud appeared to be concentrating on the company's contract to
build a Navy target drone, known as the BQM-74C.
   The drone is one of two major projects at Northrop's Ventura
division, whose offices in Newbury Park, Calif., were searched
earlier this month by FBI agents as part of the procurement
investigation. The Times, citing unidentified sources, said the
other Ventura project, a missile known as Tacit Rainbow, was not
the object of the FBI search as had previously been reported.
   In related news, Rep. Barbara Boxer said Saturday that the
Pentagon, defense contractors and the Reagan administration
``howled'' about congressional attempts to reform the procurement
process, such as a ban on military procurement officials quitting
and immediately going to work for the defense industry.
   The Pentagon, defense contractors and the administration ``were
unabashed in their contempt toward congressional reforms,'' Boxer
of California said in the Democratic response to President Reagan's
weekly radio address.
   ``Now, in this terrible scandal, there has apparently been the
ultimate contempt _ as many as 50 consultants buying secret
information to destroy competition and cheat all of us.''
   Inside information allegedly obtained by consultants, including
Paisley, was in some cases classified and was in other cases
proprietary information about specific companies, the government
has said in a search warrant for one company involved in the probe,
McDonnell-Douglas Corp. The information was sold to various defense
contractors to give the recipients an advantage in competing for
contracts worth billions of dollars. About 75 to 100 Pentagon
contracts may have been tainted, according to prosecutor Henry E.
Hudson.
   Cohen's attorney, Seymour Glanzer, declined to comment Saturday
about any aspect of the investigation when asked about the
videotapes of alleged payoffs to his client and whether his client
was cooperating with the government.
   Gaines' attorney, Michael Schatzow said Friday night that he had
no comment on the videotapes, but added: ``I'll just wait and allow
everybody who's been reporting these stories to wait and be
embarrassed later.''
   Paisley's attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella, denounced the leaking
of information on videotaping.
   ``This is just a further example of the government trying their
case in the press rather than waiting for specific allegations to
try in court,'' Barcella said.
   Cohen and Gaines have been temporarily reassigned to
non-procurement duties because of the investigation, along with
four other Pentagon employees. The others include George Stone, a
Navy official in the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command;
Stuart Berlin, an executive with the Naval Air Systems Command; and
Marine Corps official Jack Sherman, who works in the equipment and
service acquisition section of the contracts division, installation
and logistics department.

   Bess Myerson signed a confession admitting she
stole more than $40 worth of merchandise from a Pennsylvania
department store, according to a published report.
   The former Miss America and television personality has pleaded
innocent to the May 27 shoplifting charge filed after she allegedly
left the Hills department store in South Williamsport with nail
polish, earrings, shoes and batteries.
   South Williamsport Police Chief Charles Smith said Myerson had
signed a confession on a department store form, the Daily News
reported in its Sunday editions.
   The newspaper said investigative reports indicate Myerson, 63,
was caught in the store parking lot with goods stashed in her
pocketbook and a shopping bag.
   The newspaper said Myerson, a former New York City cultural
affairs commissioner, begged store guards to let her off, saying,
``Can't I please just pay for the stuff?''
   ``You don't understand. I'm already in so much trouble, and I
have to go to federal court,'' she reportedly said.
   Myerson has been charged with trying to influence the judge in
the divorce case of her boyfriend, contractor Carl ``Andy''
Capasso, who is serving four years in prison on a tax evasion
conviction.
   The newspaper said the confession was witnessed by two people.
   The confession also noted that she was carrying $160 at the
times of the arrest and that she is worth an estimated $16 million,
the Daily News said.
   Myerson's attorney, Scott Gardner, who said he expects his
client to be exonerated in the case, did not return several calls
to his office, the newspaper said.

   The Egyptian military on Saturday refused
comment on allegations that two Egyptian army colonels were

It characterized the suspects as innocent victims swept up in an
attempt to damage relations between the United States and Egypt.
   U.S. Ambassador Frank G. Wisner said U.S.-Egyptian ties were too
vital to be damaged by the affair.
   ``I think there is a very important relationship between the
United States and Egypt and problems can be managed,'' Wisner said.
   The state-run Middle East News Agency did not report the story
for 15 hours after it broke.
   Its eventual dispatch from Washington quoted the Washington Post
for its information, but didn't mention the army colonels or a
military transport plane the U.S. Justice Department charged was
being used to smuggle contraband out of the country.
   The official Cairo Radio ignored the story all day Saturday, as
did Egyptian Television in its evening English, French and Arabic
newscasts.
   U.S. Attorney David Levi told a news conference in Sacramento,
Calif., Friday night that the two Egyptian officers and three
Americans illegally routed sensitive military material to Europe
and the Middle East without required export licenses.
   One of the Americans cited is an Egyptian-born rocket expert who
allegedly received $1 million ``from Egyptian sources'' for his
role, a fact also omitted from Egyptian press reports.
   Neither of the military men were arrested. Levi said Col. Hussam
Yossef was in Austria, and Col. Mohamed Abdella Mohamed was
detained but released after claiming diplomatic immunity.
   Egyptian press reports did not name the men but said one worked
in the purchasing office of the Egyptian Embassy in Washington.
   In its front-page commentary, Al-Ahram said the Justice
Department announcement of charges was unclear, imprecise and
incomplete. ``There is a serious attempt aimed at harming the
Egyptian-American relations in the first place,'' Al-Ahram said.
   ``We all know that the American market is open, where people buy
and export all strategic items and other things ... Some people may
not think of getting prior exporting permission, since the goods
could be bought freely.''
   The smuggling ring was charged Friday with illegal export and
money laundering, and conspiring to ship hundreds of pounds of a
substance called carbon-carbon, or carbon composite, to Europe and
Egypt.
   The special carbon material, developed in the United States, is
used extensively in high-speed aircraft, missiles and rockets
because it has a low visibility level to radar and is heat
resistant.
   The carbon is on the federal restricted list, and requires
special licenses to be exported.
   ``It is not the manner of Egyptian institutions to violate the
rules, carry out espionage operations or steal secret military
documents from the Pentagon or anywhere else,'' Al-Ahram said.
   Al-Ahram denied a plane was flown to the United States to bring
back contraband. ``Many Egyptian planes arrive in the United States
to carry military equipment that Egypt gets from America,'' the
newspaper said.
   Egypt receives about $1.3 billion a year in military aid from
the United States.

   Five prisoners at the Maryland House of
Correction, including a convicted murderer, overpowered a guard in
the recreation yard to escape Saturday, prison officials said.
   One inmate was shot as he ran by a guard tower outside the fence
and was recaptured immediately, but four others were still at large
late Saturday, said Beverly Marable, a prison spokeswoman.
   Ms. Marable said the men briefly held a guard hostage about 2:30
p.m. and then cut through a chain-link fence, scaled another fence
and a large air conditioning unit before fleeing into nearby woods.
   The fifth escapee, Ronald Robinson, 42, was recaptured when a
guard in a tower shot him in the hand during the escape, Ms.
Marable said.
   Ms. Marable said those at large Saturday were: Douglas Edgerton,
21, serving a 20-year sentence for second-degree murder; Henry
Goins, 26, serving 12 years for rape, kidnapping and robbery with a
deadly weapon; Irvin Griffin, 28, serving 45 years for two counts
of assault with intent to murder; and Clarence Jones, 33, serving
25 years for robbery with a deadly weapon and attempted robbery.
   Robinson was serving 15 years and 9 months on robbery charges.
   ``Shots were fired by two guards as soon as the officers saw
them,'' said Ms. Marable. ``We're still not sure if the inmates
were all in this together'' or whether they took advantage of a
spontaneous opportunity.
   At least one of the inmates who overpowered the guard was armed
with a homemade knife. It was not known Saturday night how they cut
the hole through the wire fence.
   The escape is the largest from the 1,600-inmate medium-security
institution since 1979 when 30 men escaped, Ms. Marable said.

<HEAD>Report: Boeing Warned Aloha Of Corrosion Problems Prior To Breakup
Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aloha Airlines was warned five months before
the in-flight breakup of one of its jets that the airline had 10
planes with significant corrosion problems and needed a new
maintenance program, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post reported in its Sunday editions that the
Seattle-based Boeing Co. urged Aloha to replace corroded fuselage
panels on its four most heavily flown jets, including the Boeing
737 involved in the April 28 accident.
   Boeing also urged the airline to take the planes out of service
in the spring for permanent repairs, inspections and to complete
all deferred maintenance, the Post said, citing documents that it
said are part of the government investigation into the incident in
which a section of the plane's roof ripped off during flight.
   In a Nov. 13 letter, Boeing advised the airline: ``Aloha has a
high-frequency flight schedule and operates in a highly corrosive
environment. These factors certainly contribute to the corrosion
and fatigue damage observed on the two airplanes surveyed.
   ``This as well as the practice of repainting the airplane before
and during inspections, deferring repairs and@or making temporary
instead of terminating (permanent) repairs, contributes to our
mutual concerns,'' wrote Boeing.
   The manufacturer also urged Aloha to develop a new maintenance
program that would assure thorough and frequent inspections as well
as preventive maintenance on Aloha's aging planes, the Post said.
   The recommendations were made after a team of Boeing engineers
visited Aloha last fall to collect data for its aging fleet
research program, the newspaper said, quoting from a 150-page
document.
   The document consists of Boeing's November maintenance
evaluation and dozens of recommendations, as well as listings of
the highlights of September, October and January inspections of
three older Aloha jets. The report also includes material
describing Boeing's findings in the aging fleet survey program.
   Aloha President Maurice Myers said of the documents, ``By their
very nature, these documents would be expected to be critical and
to recommend changes.''
   He told the newspaper that Boeing's engineers had overlooked
many aspects of Aloha's operations, which led them to draw
erroneous conclusions.
   The document has become part of the National Transportation
Safety Board's investigation of the accident. The agency's hearing
into the cause of the accident will focus not only on Aloha's
maintenance program, but also on Boeing's responsibility.
   Boeing did not share the information with the government until
after the accident even though the Federal Aviation Administration
had asked to be apprised of progress on the research at Aloha, said
the Post.
   According to the Boeing report, the newspaper said, seven of
Aloha's 10 jets were more than 15 years old and three of Aloha's
jets had flown beyond the 75,000 flights originally envisioned as
the lifespan of the 737.

   An armored car's crew left the keys in the
ignition while servicing an automatic teller machine, and returned
to find both the van and its cargo of about $750,000 missing, the
FBI said Saturday.
   Although the van was recovered Friday, about 11 hours after it
disappeared, the cash was not, said an FBI spokesman who spoke on
the condition he not be identified.
   No arrests had been made Saturday, the FBI said.
   The theft occurred just after 9 a.m. Friday in front of the
University of Maryland Student Union Building in downtown Baltimore
and the van was recovered about 8 p.m. in front of a supermarket in
neighboring Anne Arundel County, police said.
   The driver, Charles Taylor, 29, told police he left the keys in
the ignition, according to company policy, and closed his door.
With the keys in the ignition, the doors of the van are supposed to
lock automatically.
   When Taylor and his co-worker, Jose Chavarria, 40, returned from
servicing an automatic teller machine, at 9:28 a.m., the van was
gone, they told police. The men said they had been in the building
about 10 minutes.
   Mark Feighery, a spokesman for NCR Corp., said the theft is the
first since its Columbia-based subsidiary, Automatic Teller Machine
Services Inc., was formed four years ago to handle automatic teller
machines for financial institutions.
   He said the company carried insurance to cover such a loss.

   Ruth Frances Schumm, a retired newswoman,
government spokeswoman and congressional press aide to former
President Lyndon B. Johnson, died of cancer Saturday at George
Washington University Hospital. She was 66.
   Miss Schumm, who had operated her own real estate investment
business since the mid-1960s, was a press aide to Johnson from
January 1959 to February 1963. During that time, Johnson was a
Texas senator, Senate majority leader and vice president.
   She had joined his staff as an assistant press secretary and
worked out of Johnson's Capitol Hill offices and with the Senate
Democratic Policy Committee.
   She subsequently spent three years with the Peace Corps, where
she was an information specialist, before retiring from the
government in 1966. Since that time, she had managed her real
estate investments.
   A native of Dallas, Miss Schumm moved to Washington in 1944 and
spent three years with the National Institute of Public Affairs and
Co-op magazine. She also worked for the Washington bureau of the
Philadelphia Record for a short time.
   From 1947 to 1959, she was a reporter with the Washington bureau
of the Dallas Morning News. She covered the Texas delegation on
Capitol Hill and hearings before the Supreme Court and various
regulatory bodies.
   Survivors include a sister, Emily Jane Overton of Hemet, Calif.

<TEXT>
   A security guard accused of shooting up
the warehouse where he worked mumbled complaints about his job as
he fired on co-workers, killing two and wounding four, police and
witnesses said.
   Sebron Flenaugh Jr., 45, was arrested without incident at his
home by Oakland police Friday night about three hours after the
rampage at the Micropure Inc. warehouse. The company distributes
household water purifying kits.
   Witnesses told police that a man dressed in a guard's uniform
and brandishing a handgun had followed an employee through a door
and into the warehouse, where he started shooting on the shipping
dock. There were 21 telemarketing people working in the building at
the time.
   The gunman used .357-caliber revolver carrying six rounds,
Concord police said.
   ``I was sitting at the break table,'' said Lisa Patton, 19,
``and he just walked in and started shooting my friends. I ran and
called police.''
   `Everybody was screaming and running,'' said 17-year-old
Germaine Reyes, who was in the shipping room when the shooting
started. ``I hit the ground and went under the table.''
   Throughout the shootings, workers said the gunman uttered barely
audible curses, several times complaining of either a ``lousy job''
or a ``crummy job.''
   After the shootings the guard went out the back door, got into
his car and drove away, witnesses told police.
   Seventeen-year-old Jennifer Hollis of Martinez, who was hit in
the chest and abdomen, died Friday night on the operating table at
John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek, hospital spokeswoman
Sandra Ryan said. Jim Disney, 19, of Concord died about five hours
later at the hospital after surgery on stomach wounds.
   Flenaugh, who was not authorized to carry a weapon on the job,
was an employee of Wells Security Systems in Danville, which had
assigned him to the Micropure warehouse, said Concord Police Lt.
Jim Jennings.
   Micropure worker Joseph Hall said Flenaugh ``always carried a
gun'' while he was working. Hall said the guard did not conceal the
weapon.
   Micropure employees said Flenaugh had worked at the company
about 18 months and was a loner.
   Police Lt. Jim Webster on Saturday said Flenaugh had a ``casual
but congenial'' relationship with the victims.
   Webster added that ``indications at this point are that he aimed
at these specific people. Why? ... I don't know.''
   Flenaugh hadn't provided police with any motive, Jennings said.
``Possibly he was depressed, but we're not sure what set him off,''
he said.
   He said Flenaugh would be booked for investigation of murder and
five counts of assault with a deadly weapon.
   Micropure workers described Flenaugh as ``friendly'' in the
past, and said they liked him enough to ask him to join them for
beer and pizza. He always declined, however, they said.
   One of the injured was taken to Muir with a superficial back
wound. The other three victims were taken to Mount Diablo Hospital
in Concord, where all were reported in stable condition Saturday.
   Micropure employs about 45 people in the one-story building
where the shootings occurred.

<HEAD>Veterans Waiting Days For Tickets Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet soldiers returning from Afghanistan are
forced to wait days and pay black market prices to get home as the
summer vacation rush pushes the country's transport system to its
limits, it was reported Friday.
   Two reporters of the official news agency Tass recounted trips
around railway stations in Moscow and airports in different regions
where Afghan veterans were standing in long lines to get home.
   One group waited three days at a Moscow station trying to get to
Simferopol, the main town in the Crimea, one of the Soviet Union's
prime vacation regions, TASS said.
   The reporters quoted the group as saying cashiers in the Uzbek
capital of Tashkent, where many soldiers land on their way home
from Afghanistan, were asking for the equivalent of $170 or
demanding foreign currency coupons to sell airplane tickets to
Moscow.
   Some veterans then have to wait in the capital penniless,
leaving only once they are sent money from home, Tass said.
   A soldier identified only as Sergei Pavlov told the reporters he
was lucky enough to have a commander who made return reservations
in advance for his unit. But he complained bitterly about a
three-hour wait in 113-degree heat at the Tashkent airport to clear
customs.
   ``I'll admit, we expected some other kind of welcome,'' Pavlov
was quoted as saying.
   The Tass report quoted a senior Defense Ministry official as
saying the situation had improved in recent days. The official said
the army was doing everything it could to clear the backlog at
railway stations and airports.
   The jam is worsened by regular soldiers returning home on summer
leave and conscripts finishing their two-year compulsory military
service, the official was quoted as saying.
   Domestic flights on the state-run Soviet airline, Aeroflot, are
almost always sold out, even in winter. In summer, trains to the
south where many of the country's 284 million people take vacation
are jammed full.
   The Soviet Union is estimated to have had about 115,000 troops
in Afghanistan. Under an accord negotiated in Geneva, Soviet troops
began pulling out of Afghanistan May 15. Half the force is
scheduled to be back home by the end of August, with the withdrawal
completed by next Feb. 15.

   An aerobatics pilot made a spectacular escape
Friday by activating his ejector seat a second before his jet
caught fire while accelerating for takeoff.
   Squadron Leader Peter Collins, deputy leader of the Royal Air
Force's Red Arrows flying team, fell a few hundred feet to the
ground on his parachute. He suffered only minor back injuries.
   His Hawk aircraft was one of a formation of four taking off in
an aerobatics display at Scampton air force base in Lincolnshire,
northeast England.
   Collins, 34, ejected as smoke began pouring from the jet,
soaring to safety above a fireball that enveloped the aircraft.
   The RAF said it was investigating the cause of the accident.
   The Red Arrows only recently renewed their displays following
several accidents since last October in which one pilot died and
four jets were lost.

<HEAD>Joint European Gulf Minesweeping Task Force Formed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British, Dutch and Belgian ships will form a joint
minesweeping task force to keep the Persian Gulf clear for merchant
vessels, the British government announced Friday.
   The flotilla is the first joint European task force in the
region since the Iran-Iraq war began in September 1980. It will not
increase the number of mine sweepers the three nations already have
in the gulf.
   Ian Stewart, armed forces minister of state, notified Parliament
in a written message Friday that five minesweepers already in the
gulf _ three British, one Dutch, one Belgian _ will begin joint
operations July 1.
   Their movements will be controlled by a separate British vessel
under command of a Royal Navy officer, a Ministry of Defense
spokesman said. The commander will be assisted by a Belgian or
Dutch staff officer.
   ``The arrangements for cooperation between the Royal Navy and
other Western navies in the gulf remain unchanged,'' Stewart said.
   Naval units from the United States, Soviet Union, France and
Italy also patrol the region, offering protection to their own flag
merchant vessels. The United States recently broadened its role to
allow its warships to intervene in attacks on neutral shipping.
   Iran attacks neutral vessels in retaliation for Iraqi raids on
its own shipping lanes. The Iranians have also been accused of
sowing mines.
   The Western navies have co-ordinated their efforts in recent
years to keep the strategic waterway open, but have retained
separate commands.
   Last month, Stewart said Soviet proposals to form a single
U.N.-sponsored task force in the gulf ``would be very difficult to
put together ... in practical terms.''
   The British, Dutch and Belgian governments have been engaged in
discussions ``for some time'' about bringing their minesweepers
under joint control, the Ministry of Defense spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice.
   The planned withdrawal of a Belgian command vessel from the area
July 1 ``strengthened the case for full co-operation,'' the
spokesman said.
   The new task force will patrol the area north of Bahrain, the
spokesman said, under the protection of a destroyer and two
frigates from the Royal Navy's Armilla patrol.
   The operation is code-named ``Calendar'' after the successful
mine clearance of the Netherlands' Scheldt estuary after World War
II.
   A spokesman for Jane's Publishing Co., which produces the
authoritative ``Jane's Fighting Ships,'' said vessels from the
Western navies in the region currently number 52.
   There are 27 American vessels in the gulf and north Arabian Sea,
a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense said in Washington.

   Jonas Savimbi, the U.S.-backed leader of a
guerrilla war against Angola's Cuban-supported government, on
Friday defended taking help from South Africa.
   ``When you are fighting for your country, you must get help from
even the devil himself,'' said Savimbi, head of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, also known as UNITA.
   Savimbi spoke here before a group of anti-communist Cuban exiles
as peace talks continued to end the 13-year civil war.
   Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis and American
black leaders have denounced Savimbi for taking arms from South
Africa, but he says he is misunderstood.
   ``I condemn apartheid, but I support freedom,'' Savimbi told a
news conference. ``I'm not here to discuss the policies of South
Africa, which I condemn. I'm fighting for freedom and you must do
it any way you can.''
   Savimbi said the current buildup of 57,000 Cuban troops in
Angola clouds the peace talks that began this week in Cairo, Egypt,
the third round of discussions in two months.
   The United States, which also helps arm the Angolan guerrillas,
is mediating between South Africa and a joint Angolan-Cuban
delegation to resolve the war and end South African rule over
neighboring Namibia.
   Angola's Marxist government is demanding an end to South African
military aid to the UNITA rebels, while South Africa is is
demanding that Cuba withdraw its troops from Angola as a
precondition for Namibia's independence.
   ``There were 45,000 Cuban troops in March, and now there are
57,000,'' Savimbi said. ``They're not withdrawing, they're
increasing tremendously.
   ``We don't want to be recolonized by Castro,'' said Savimbi, who
once fought to help free Angola from colonization by Portugal.
   Savimbi's one-day visit to Miami was sponsored by the
Cuban-American National Foundation.
   Foundation head Jorge Mas Canosa said a private dinner was
planned in Savimbi's honor Friday night to show support for his
cause but not to raise money.
   ``He knows he has our support,'' Mas Canosa said. ``We've
provided hospital beds, food and medicine to his troops in the past
and we are ready to do it again.''

   Three peace groups planned an
all-night prayer vigil as about 250 Roman Catholic bishops gathered
Friday for a national conference to consider AIDS, women's issues
and the morality of nuclear war.
   On Saturday the bishops are to debate and vote on a report about
the morality of U.S. nuclear policy.
   Pax Christi of Minnesota, Benedictines for Peace from St. Joseph
and Collegeville, and Franciscans for Peace of Little Falls planned
the vigil to coincide with discussions on the morality of U.S.
nuclear policy.
   The report on nuclear policy is the result of two years of work
by a bishops' committee commissioned as a follow-up to their 1983
peace pastoral.
   The committee is recommending that its ``conditional
acceptance'' of nuclear deterrence be retained, according to a
pre-conference news release.
   The bishops received a letter Friday from Gen. James Abrahamson,
director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, who
wrote of his fears that some of conference's recommendations might
be based on inaccurate information.
   ``Specifically, I wish to challenge some of the arguments which
attempt to substantiate the final recommendations ... which, if
left unchallenged, will certainly perpetuate the cloud of
misunderstanding that surrounds SDI and its promise of a moral
deterrence to nuclear war,'' he said.
   The session at St. John's University in south-central Minnesota
is the fourth meeting in six years of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops.
   About 280 of the bishops also discussed Friday the first draft
of a pastoral letter on the concerns of women in church and society.
   ``It is one thing to read a report on the reactions of women to
the first draft of this pastoral,'' the Most Rev. Joseph Imesch
told the conference. ``It is quite another thing to hear women
voice their concerns personally.
   ``The mere fact that men were writing a pastoral letter about
women caused considerable skepticism for a number of people,'' said
Imesch, bishop of the Joliet, Ill., diocese. ``We dared not presume
what women thought or felt.''
   The 100-page document is the result of three years work by a
committee of six bishops and seven women. The committee met with 25
national Catholic women's oganizations and heard from 75,000 women
who participated in forums in 100 dioceses, and at 60 colleges and
45 military bases across the country.
   The document also explores Catholic tradition and proposes ways
of addressing the concerns within the framework of the teachings of
the church.
   A majority of women love the church, the report said. Many are
comfortable with their treatment in the church, but many others
want more participation. Some saw their exclusion from the
priesthood as unjust.
   The document doesn't address the issue of the ordination of
women to the priestood, but it calls for a study of allowing women
to become deacons.
   The majority praised the church's stance on abortion, but many
questioned its teaching on contraception.
   The document, which calls sexism a sin, also insists that men
take their responsibility in the areas of sexuality, procreation
and parenthood seriously.
   After hearing the concerns of other bishops, Imesch said the
document might need a major revision but he still hoped the bishops
could act upon it as scheduled for their November 1989 meeting.

   Hundreds of barges began creeping along the Mississippi and Ohio
rivers through newly dredged channels, while farmers, clergymen and
politicians prayed for relief from the hot, dry weather that has

   A major magnetic storm is expected to envelop
the Earth on Monday as particles spewed by giant explosions on the
sun disrupt global communications, alter satellite orbits and
impair electric power systems.
   The warning issued Friday by the federal Space Environment
Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., was spurred by a series of solar
flares _ huge sunspot-related explosions that hurl X-ray,
electrically charged particles and hot gases toward Earth.
   One of the blasts was the largest flare since April 1984, said
Dale Gary, a solar astronomer at the California Institute Of
Technology in Pasadena.
   The laboratory issued a major magnetic storm warning for Monday
and a minor magnetic storm warning for Tuesday, forecaster Chris
Balch said by telephone from the lab.

   Investigators in the Pentagon bribery probe
videotaped meetings in which Defense Department officials allegedly
took payoffs from consultants, sources close to the two-year
investigation said Saturday.
   The sources said that two key figures in the investigation,
Victor Cohen, deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for
tactical systems, and James Gaines, a deputy assistant secretary of
the Navy, appear on some of the videotapes. However, the sources
declined to say whether alleged bribes turned up on the recordings
of those two Pentagon officials.
   The consultants shown on the videotapes also include Melvyn
Paisley, the former procurement chief for the Navy whose office was
searched on June 7 by federal authorities in the investigation, the

   ABC News pollsters who have been tracking the 1988 race say it

<HEAD>Parched Farmland and Withering Crops Spawn Search For `Drought
Stocks'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After viewing the drought as a reason to shun
stocks, some strategists see it as a chance to buy into companies
that could profit by selling products ranging from hybrid seeds to
well-drilling rigs.
   Food processors, fertilizer makers, seed distributors, farm
equipment manufacturers and irrigation companies are getting
increased scrutiny as possible investment opportunities because of
the drought, which has withered much of this year's crops and sent
corn, wheat and soybean prices soaring.
   The thinking is that farmers will have to invest heavily for the
1989 harvest and that food companies will enjoy better profits from
higher prices.
   For example, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, one of the largest
hybrid seed-corn producers, has attracted some attention as a
possible beneficiary, partly because of its advanced research into
drought-resistant strains.
   ``These people have been through this before, and are
exceedingly familiar with drought conditions,'' said Laurence C.
Day, a stock strategist at the Clayton, Mo., office of the
investment firm Newhard Cook & Co. ``They are by far the superior
company in this business.''
   Freight-hauling companies, especially railroads and truckers,
also appear well-positioned to exploit the barge backups on the
Mississippi River, which have drastically reduced the amount of
grain shipped to food processors.
   ``Certainly the transportation aspect of the agriculture market
is going to be a winner here, because most farmers are going to be
very quick to get their product to market,'' said Jack Barbanel, a
futures expert at Gruntal & Co. in New York. ``If somebody has a
better system for transporting grains, it's certainly a moneymaking
situation.''
   A projected shortage of soybeans also has some Wall Street
analysts puzzling out the profitable opportunities. Soybeans are
getting heavy attention because they are used in a wide range of
products unrelated to food, from unleaded gasoline to cosmetics.
   A few strategists are even recommending poultry companies. Their
argument goes like this: Cattle farmers will be forced to slaughter
their herds this year because they can't afford to feed them. This
will create a short-term beef and pork glut, but by next year acute
shortages are certain. With meat prices soaring then, more
consumers may switch to cheaper chicken.
   Others are focusing on large fast-food chains that will likely
benefit from higher food prices. McDonald's, for example, has been
touted by some brokers recently, because it is expected to get
increased royalties linked to higher sales revenue from its
franchised restaurants.
   Wall Street initially seized on the drought as a sell signal
because it implies sharply higher inflation, which theoretically
raises pressure on the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates and
thus erodes the comparative value of stocks.
   But as other evidence has emerged that inflation remains tame,
the drought theme has been transformed into an obscure form of good
news in the stock market. Some investment strategists see it as the
vehicle for companies to lock in greater profit margins by raising
prices now.
   ``In classic supply-demand fashion, commodity prices could fall
next year,'' said John Bierbusse, an analyst who follows cereal
companies for the investment firm of A.G. Edwards & Sons in St.
Louis, Mo. ``But you and I both know that cereal prices don't go
down.''
   Others, however, haven't flocked to the drought theme. They say
the drought could hurt food companies, especially those lacking
long-term commitments to buy grain at pre-drought prices. They also
say the disaster could ruin fragile rural economies and will
clearly spill into other areas.
   ``There's going to be some impact,'' said William Tiritilli,
vice president and director of research at Rodman & Renshaw Inc. in
Chicago. ``Retailers and banks could get hurt. A farmer who doesn't
have crops can't pay loans back.''
   Whatever the ultimate outcome of the drought on Wall Street's
collective thinking, some believe it will be short-lived, soon to
be displaced by another significant economic event.
   ``The attention span on Wall Street is about 30 minutes,'' said
Robert Sobel, a market historian and author. ``If it rains
tomorrow, they'll forget about it completely.''

<HEAD>Child Labor Again a Problem in China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Child labor, widespread in old China, is on the
rise again and is worrying Communist authorities.
   The official media report the problem is most severe in the
countryside, where the government's new economic reforms encourage
private farming and small rural factories. Young children, mostly
girls, often are taken out of school to work on farms or factories
to add to family incomes.
   Another reason cited is a lack of funds for rural education.
   When they took over China in 1949, the Communists sought to
eliminate child labor and raise literacy rates.
   They claim to have lowered illiteracy rates from 80 percent when
they took over to 20 percent now.
   The seriousness with which child labor now is viewed is
indicated in a series of recent articles in the official press.
   The weekly Liaowang (Outlook), for example, recently published a
pictorial essay featuring a 12-year-old girl from the countryside,
Chen Zhangrong, who dropped out of school to work 12 hours a day in
a privately run paper-dye factory.
   She was shown in photographs carrying a bucket of what was
described as noxious, smelly dye on her first day of work.
   Liaowang and other Chinese reports have expressed alarm at the
trend.
   ``An increasing number of children from rural China are missing
out on the opportunity to go to school, and the situation is
getting worse,'' the official newspaper China Daily said.
   Chinese laws state that children under 16 should not work at
all. A 1986 law calls for nine years of education, but the
government acknowledges this won't be possible until the year 2000
because of a lack of facilities.
   Ironically, the education laws are being ignored in part because
of China's much-praised economic reforms.
   ``The development of the commodity economy has left a deep mark
on the hearts of children,'' Liaowang said. ``It is a popular
slogan in coastal areas that primary school pupils make big money
while college students make little money.''
   A State Statistical Bureau survey recently found that only 71
percent of school-age children were attending classes in southern
China's Guangdong province, the nation's most advanced in adapting
a market-based economy.
   The People's Daily, which is the Communist Party newspaper,
reported the inland province of Hubei had 1.5 million dropouts last
year. The province had about 9 million primary and middle school
students in 1985.
   The State Education Commission says 96 percent of Chinese
children complete the six grades of primary school, but only about
two-thirds go on to three-year junior middle school, which is
theoretically compulsory.
   A heavy proportion of the dropouts are girls, who traditionally
have received little education in rural China and are now in demand
to work in the thousands of small textile and light industry plants
springing up in the countryside.
   The official Guangming Daily, blaming ``wrong parental
attitudes'' for the dropout problem, said an investigation of four
construction teams in Jiangxi province, southern China, found that
nearly a quarter of the workers were children.
   In Hebei province to the north, it added, a third of the
peddlers in one village market were junior middle school dropouts.
   ``My mother told me to quit,'' one 12-year-old candy seller was
quoted as saying. It quoted the mother as saying she thought school
fees were a waste of money since the boy had little chance of
getting a higher education.
   China has only about 2 million university students, compared to
180 million primary and middle school students out of a population
of 1 billion.
   Although China spends a respectable 3 percent of gross national
product on education, 20 percent of that goes to higher education.
Primary schools, particularly in rural areas, face financial
problems that have discouraged school attendance.
   One report from coastal Fujian province said 148 rural schools
in one region had been closed and 2,800 pupils had no place to go
to school because so many teachers, among the lowest-paid workers
in China, had resigned to take other jobs.
   The Fujian Daily quoted Chen Quanbao as saying he quit his
teaching job, which paid 33.5 yuan ($9) a month, to make as much in
three days selling tea leaves as he did in a semester of teaching.
   Although schooling is supposed to be free, financially strapped
schools have slapped on various maintenance fees. Some poor
families say these have forced them to withdraw their children.

<HEAD>Heat Wave Coping</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stifling heat baking much of America
threatens more than crops, weather experts warn. Heat kills people
too.
   The 1980 heat wave claimed the lives of an estimated 1,265
Americans, according to an analysis prepared for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Many of the victims were
elderly and poor, living in homes or apartments that lacked air
conditioning.
   Hot weather places greater stress on the heart and blood
vessels, warns the Department of Health and Human Services. Thus,
when temperatures rise, so do the number of heart attacks and
strokes.
   And high humidity just makes it worse, by interfering with the
body's ability to cool itself.
   The human body is cooled by evaporation of sweat and by
circulating blood closer to the skin to allow the heat to dissipate.
   The problem is that when the air temperature gets close to the
body's 98.6 degree Fahrenheit normal, heat doesn't dissipate
outward as readily.
   Sweating does nothing to cool the body unless the moisture is
removed by evaporation into the air, and humid air isn't as willing
to accept that liquid as is dry air.
   As the body tries to cope with increasing heat it begins pumping
a torrent of blood through the dilated circulatory system, while
the sweat glands pour out liquid, including dissolved chemicals
that the body may need.
   What follows can be a heat-related illness when the body can no
longer shed enough heat to keep its temperature near normal levels,
or when it can not cope with loss of liquid and chemicals. These
illnesses include heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke.
   Heat cramps are painful spasms, often occurring in the muscles
of the legs and abdomen. NOAA experts in weather and health
recommend firm pressure on the cramping muscle followed by gentle
massage. Give the victim water to drink.
   Heat exhaustion, they point out, is more serious. Symptoms
include heavy sweating, weakness; cold, pale, clammy skin. The
victim may faint or vomit.
   Treatment includes getting the victim out of the sun to a place
where they can lie down and loosen their clothing. Get them to a
fan or air conditioned area if possible, and apply cool, wet
cloths. Give water to drink. If vomiting continues, seek medical
attention.
   The most dangerous condition is heat stroke, also known as
sunstroke. In this case the body temperature can rise to dangerous
levels, skin is hot and dry, pulse rapid and the victim may become
unconscious.
   Heat stroke is a severe emergency; summon medical assistance or
get the victim to a hospital, NOAA warns. Delay can be fatal.
   While waiting for help, get the victim to a cooler environment,
use fans or air conditioner and cool sponging, but do not give
fluids, the agency says.
   Here is a list of summertime suggestions from NOAA aimed at
preventing heat-related illnesses:
   _Slow down. Strenuous activities should be reduced, eliminated
or rescheduled to the coolest time of the day.
   _Dress for summer. Lightweight, light-colored clothing reflects
heat and sunlight and helps maintain normal body temperature.
   _Eat less. Foods like proteins increase metabolic heat
production and also induce more water loss.
   _Drink plenty of water. Your body needs water to keep cool, so
drink plenty of fluids even if you don't feel thirsty, but avoid or
reduce use of alcoholic beverages. Persons with fluid restrictions
or with epilepsy, heart, kidney or liver disease should consult
their doctor.
   _Do not take salt tablets unless directed by a physician.
   _Do not get too much sun. Sunburn reduces the skin's efficiency
at cooling the body.
   _Spend time in air conditioned places. If you cannot afford home
air conditioning, spend some time in another air conditioned
environment such as a shopping center or other commercial building.

   Dyana Ortelli is perfectly comfortable as the
center of attention, which, as it turns out, she usually is.
   All eyes turn when Ortelli, who stars in the syndicated comedy
``Marblehead Manor,'' enters a room. She's as hard to miss as a
cockatoo in a flock of sparrows.
   Her dark hair is teased into punk spikes. She is dressed all in
black: bolero jacket, bra, miniskirt, boots and gloves. The bra is
festooned with multi-hued bows. The gloves are covered with buttons
of every size and color. Her fingernails are painted a vivid
orange. Her earrings are tiny, multi-colored abacuses.
   Ortelli laughed. ``I play Lupe on the show, and Lupe is just an
extension of myself,'' she said. ``She's the cook, but she's a
little weird. Her regular uniform is accessorized by the most
colorful things you ever saw. I describe her as a cross between
Carmen Miranda and Cyndi Lauper. Once, she even wore a hat with
bananas in it.''
   Ortelli's 8-year-old son, Humberto Ortiz, also appeared on the
comedy as Lupe's son, Elvis. ``After they signed him, they wanted
to change his name to Jesus,'' she said. ``I said every other
Hispanic on television was named Jesus. Elvis was really the kind
of name Lupe would give her son.''
   They also played mother and son in the movies ``Born in East
L.A.'' and ``Three Amigos'' and in a Pepto-Bismol commercial.
Ortelli also appeared in ``La Bamba.''
   ``Marblehead Manner,'' a farce set in a millionaire's mansion
near Boston, was part of a five-night package of syndicated
comedies NBC ran on its owned-and-operated stations in the
half-hour before prime time. The NBC stations did not renew most of
the comedies, including ``Marblehead Manor,'' because of
disappointing ratings. The show is syndicated elsewhere and
currently in reruns.
   It also stars Paxton Whitehead as the butler, Phil Morris as the
chauffeur, Rodney Hudson as the handyman, Michael Richard as the
gardener, and Linda Thorsen and Bob Frazier as the millionaire
couple.
   ``Most of the characters were pretty normal, but Michael was the
weirdest,'' she said. ``We were always misinterpreting people and
situations. We'd turn things around and create new situations. We
were always solving problems that didn't need solving.''
   She said the thing she loved about playing Lupe was the freedom
she had to make her different from the Hispanic stereotypes. ``She
dressed in her own way and she acted in her own way,'' she said.
   Ortelli was born in Mexico and grew up in Texas. Her father is
an anesthesiologist at a Laredo hospital. She attended private
schools and as a child was cast in a bilingual children's series in
Austin, Texas. Her oldest brother danced with the Berlin Ballet and
is currently makeup man for the Berlin Opera.
   ``When I was in school my first cousin, Paulina, and I made a
pact to become actresses, and whoever was successful first would
help the other out,'' she said. ``She's doing well in Mexico City
as a singer and on a soap opera. She wants to come to the United
States. I wish I had a variety show so I could have her as a
guest.''
   Ortelli lived in London and Scotland for two years while her
husband studied abroad. They have since divorced.
   She moved to Los Angeles after returning to this country and was
almost immediately cast in the stage play ``Zoot Suit.'' Her maiden
name was Elizondo and her married name was Ortiz. She combined them
to make Ortelli.
   ``When I came to Los Angeles I found out for the first time that
I was a member of the Hispanic minority,'' she said. ``My agent
said I could play only Hispanic roles and that I had to change my
looks to look Hispanic. She said my hair had to be black, straight
and parted in the middle. She's no longer my agent.
   ``My first audition was for the girlfriend of a gang member. My
first speaking role on television was as a non-Hispanic nurse on
`Cagney & Lacey.' I thought sure after they cast me they'd change
her name to something Hispanic, but they didn't.''
   Her complaint is that Hispanic roles are usually downscale. ``I
say get us out of the barrios and into the condos,'' she said.
``I'm not in a position to choose my work. I wish I could. If I'm
offered a week's work as a cocaine dealer I'll take it. I just ask
for a balance. You can't expect every Hispanic to be a
professional, but you can have a balance.''

<HEAD>Pointer Sisters And Lollipops Enliven Computer Biz</HEAD>

   Computer companies face an awful dilemma each
time they introduce a new product _ to bore the audience with bits
and bytes, or gag it with glitz.
   This past week, just when cool and dry seemed to be the trend, a
pair of multimillion-dollar events showed that computer companies
still love show biz.
   On Monday, Compaq Computer Corp. unveiled two personal computers
by filling a New York stage with electronic music and athletic
ballet dancers in shiny, multi-colored body suits.
   A day later, International Business Machines Corp. announced new
mid-sized computers with an Academy Awards-style show beamed by
satellite to 100,000 people across the United States _ the biggest
such broadcast ever by a private company.
   Larry Ford, an IBM executive, gamely followed a script that had
him receiving a lollipop, a loan approval and a toy soldier's hat
from actors portraying grateful IBM customers.
   At first it seems incongruous for computer makers _ the vanguard
of the rational age of high technology _ to be falling back on
pyrotechnics and emotional appeals.
   But then again, people are people, and no one gets a big charge
out of hearing someone in a suit drone on about 48-bit
addressability or 82385 cache memory controllers.
   ``We punctuate the straight business message with a little
glitter, like the machines rising out of the floor, to make it a
little more warm and a little less formal,'' said Bert Reisman,
IBM's assistant group executive for the Marketing and Services
Group.
   Glitter is second nature to Compaq, which in 1985 hired the
Pointer Sisters to dance on a huge model of its Portable 286
singing, ``I'm So Excited.''
   Still, the Houston-based computer maker wants to be taken
seriously.
   ``It's not just that we're interested in throwing a party,''
said James D'Arezzo, Compaq's vice president for corporate
marketing. ``The bottom line is, you're trying to capture mind
space: of the press, the analyst community and most of all your
authorized dealers.''
   Yes, but how much glitter is too much glitter?
   ``We've got event-inflation, I think,'' complained Esther Dyson,
editor and publisher of Release 1.0 newsletter and a veteran of
uncounted product introductions.
   ``I really hate the ones where they give you 10 minutes of rock
music in the dark,'' she said. ``My basic feeling is, if I want to
see dancing I'll buy a ticket and go with a date.''
   IBM, with more than $50 billion in annual revenue, must be doing
something right. But some people who attend its shows say they have
gone from dull to slightly embarrassing.
   Bill Machrone, editor-in-chief and publisher of PC Magazine,
cringes in memory of an event last year at which IBM executives
fumbled through a supposedly impromptu and humorous interchange
with Jamie Farr and Bill Christopher, the former ``M-A-S-H''
characters.
   ``It's painful to watch, but IBM, I think they think they're
really rocking and rolling when they do this,'' Machrone said.
``People are afraid to tell them otherwise.''
   That's a slightly harsh assessment, said Nora F. Gildea,
director of marketing for Ideassociates Inc. of Billerica, Mass., a
company that does business with IBM.
   ``It was OK. Everybody sort of laughed wryly in our group.
You're talking about seasoned customers who've been to a lot of
these things.''
   Commodore International Ltd. introduced its Amiga three years
ago by having Andy Warhol take a digitized image of Blondie's
Deborah Harry and use the computer to ``paint'' her picture live on
stage at New York's Lincoln Center.
   Compaq once made its chief executive Rod Canion appear from
nowhere on stage in a blaze of light. It was especially
entertaining because Canion is the ultimate straight man.
   ``I think he sleeps in his suit and tie. So that was a magical
moment,'' Ms. Dyson said.
   Apple Computer Inc. has gotten quiet after a run of
announcements that included lowering its Apple IIgs from the
ceiling into a blaze of lasers and dry ice.
   Once Apple revved up a sales or dealer meeting with a version of
``Ghostbusters'' featuring dancers in radiation suits, Macintoshes
strapped to their backs, singing ``Blue Busters.''
   Apple spokeswoman Marlene Williamson said Apple has been
concentrating lately on networking and communications products that
aren't suited to media blitzes. She vows Apple will be back with a
splash when the time is right.

   Splashy product introductions are intended less for reporters
than for customers, dealers, distributors and a company's own
employees.
   For Compaq, which relies heavily on authorized dealers who
aren't on the Compaq payroll, an inspirational announcement is
critical.
   ``We're trying to create an impression with the people that have
to understand and believe in the product before they can sell it,''
said Rob Rappaport, president and chief executive of MultiMedia
Group Inc. of Culver City, Calif., which staged Monday's Compaq
show.
   It seems to be working. ``Sales people generally, we need a lot
of stimulus. That's what we get from Compaq,'' said Coe Young, a
senior sales representative for Entre Computer Center in Manhattan.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The government said after-tax profits at the nation's
businesses declined 1 percent over the first three months of the
year. Other reports showed inflation slowed for the second month in
a row to an annual rate of 4.2 percent in May, while durable goods
orders fell 2.2 percent and personal income rose a modest 0.3
percent during the month.
   _A revised report showed the U.S. economy grew at a 3.6 percent
rate in the first three months of 1988, prompting the Reagan
administration to boost its growth forecast for the remainder of
the year to 3.5 percent.
   _Sales of domestic-made cars and light trucks rose 12.8 percent
in mid-June from a year ago, resuming a robust pace after a brief
slowdown earlier in the month.
   _A government report showed the health of the nation's worst
savings and loan institutions worsened during the first three
months of the year, overwhelming modest gains made by solvent
thrifts. Also during the week, two ailing Texas thrifts were taken
over by an Arizona savings bank as part of a federal rescue.
   _Leaders of the seven richest nations concluded their annual
summit with a debt-relief plan for the world's poorest countries
and optimism about the global economy. The good feelings prompted a
rally in the dollar on foreign-exchange markets.
   _The United States and Japan reached a trade agreement that
could double U.S. exports of beef and oranges to more than $1
billion a year.
   _Carl C. Icahn conceded he lost the battle for five seats on
Texaco Inc.'s board after a New York investment firm revealed it
voted its key stake in favor of the oil giant's management.
   _USX Corp. said it plans to sell its transportation businesses
for more than $500 million to a joint venture it is forming with
Blackstone Capital Partners and managers of the rail and water
subsidiaries.
   _Volvo North America Corp. said it will buy 20 percent of Hertz
Corp., the world's largest car rental company, for $100 million.
   _A Delaware partnership said it acquired a 7.1 percent stake in
Zenith Electronics Corp. and may seek to acquire the computer and
television maker.
   _Rowntree PLC agreed to a sweetened, $4.5 billion buyout offer
from Swiss foods giant Nestle SA, ending the months-long ``candy
bar war'' for the British confectioner.
   _Farmers Insurance Group Inc., battling a hostile $4.5 billion
takeover bid by Batus Inc., announced it had adopted a ``poison
pill'' defense.
   _Pepsico Inc. agreed to buy the soft drink bottling operations
of Grand Metropolitan Inc. for $705 million in cash.
   _Western Tele-Communications Inc. agreed to buy Taft Cable
Partners, which owns 17 cable television systems in Michigan and
New England, for about $420 million.
   _A jury cleared former Attorney General Griffin B. Bell in a
civil suit alleging he libeled a former E.F. Hutton & Co. brokerage
manager in a 1985 report about the company's check-kiting practices.
   _Pillsbury Co. announced the resignation of J. Jeffrey Campbell,
who headed its restaurant business for more than a year.
   _Union Carbide Corp. said it will negotiate with private lawyers
for victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster. About 523,000 people
have filed claims.
   _A federal judge ruled that the government cannot force ailing
LTV Corp. to take back more than $2 billion in pension obligations
simply because a new labor contract restored previously cut
benefits.
   _The nation's biggest dealers of Suzuki Samurais said their
sales slowly are beginning to recover from the damage done by
allegations that the sporty vehicles roll over too easily.
   _Scriptwriters voted overwhelmingly to continue their
4-month-old strike, threatening the fall TV schedule and prompting
layoffs in the movie and television industry.

<HEAD>Is Dollar's Big Rise the Magic Bullet for Wall Street?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar's stunning rise this past week may
have provided the psychological lift that some traders say the
stock market needed to restart its widely touted summer rally, but
others aren't so sure.
   It was on Wednesday, the first full day of summer, that the
dollar leaped in value against key foreign currencies, inciting a
strong rise in stock prices and propelling the Dow Jones industrial
average to the highest point since the October crash.
   ``It's taking down some of the psychological and fiscal
barricades,'' Eugene Peroni, a technical strategist for the
Philadelphia investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., said of
the dollar's surge. ``I think the market is better poised now to
respond to good news and glad tidings.''
   Asked if the market's behavior Wednesday may have marked a
turning point, Peroni said: ``I think it could very well play that
way, yes.''
   Two weeks ago, many Wall Street brokers were talking about a
pre-season summer rally that they say began at the end of May. Many
predicted a further revival of enthusiasm for stocks despite any
big change in the economic news.
   The following week, the Dow industrials hit two post-crash highs
but tumbled on fear of rising interest rates. The summer-rally
promoters said maybe the season hadn't begun after all.
   But this past week, the rising dollar restored market confidence
by doing two good things, optimists argue. First, it eased fears of
rapidly rising inflation caused by a cheap currency, which makes
imports more expensive. Secondly, it encouraged a return to the
stock market by foreigners, whose post-crash absence had been
sorely missed by Wall Street.
   Foreign buying was widely evident Wednesday. The most obvious
sign was a surge in stocks such as IBM, Du Pont, Westinghouse and
Boeing, which historically attract overseas interest because
they're so well-known.
   Skeptics argue the dollar's surge wasn't a long-term trend and
should not be the sole basis for buying stocks. Many attribute the
market's rise to other transient causes, such as the end-of-quarter
``window dressing'' period when money managers buy stocks to make
their client portfolios look better.
   As evidence for their argument, they say a fundamental market
rally lasts for several days and is marked by heavy trading volume.
It hasn't happened. Stock prices weakened Thursday and Friday and
the volume was moderate.
   ``I think it's a bear market, this is what happens in bear
markets,'' said Paul Campbell, a technical strategist and vice
president at Nikko Securities Co. International. ``I don't think
this thing is the beginning of something long and sustainable.''
   For the week, the Dow industrials finished at 2,142.96, a gain
of 38.94 points or 1.9 percent. Volume on the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange averaged 170.99 million shares a day, compared with
201.64 million a day the previous week.
   Among the broader market barometers, the NYSE composite index
ended the week 1.72 points higher at 154.56; the NASDAQ composite
index for the over-the-counter market rose 4.70 points to 391.62;
and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.79 to
308.49.
   By the end of the week, summer-rally skeptics offered another
argument against putting too much faith in the power of the
dollar's advance. They said talk had resurfaced that the dollar
might get too expensive and hurt the nation's gradually narrowing
trade deficit.
   ``The psychology in this market is crazy,'' said Philip C.
Puccio, senior vice president and manager of institutional trading
at Dillon Read & Co. in New York. ``Before they liked the dollar
where it was. Now the dollar is going up so they're starting to get
worried. People are getting so analytical they're losing sight of
the long-term. It's really putting the skids on this market.''

   The Agriculture Department has designated
emergency drought aid for farmers in more than half the United
States.
   More help may come, but Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng says
it is too soon to tell what additional measures may be required.
Here are steps already taken:
   _In 1,390 counties in 30 states, livestock grazing and hay
cutting are now permitted on land set aside from production under
regular crop programs. Additionally, farmers in those counties also
can cut hay from land covered by a separate program, the long-term
Conservation Reserve Program. No livestock grazing has yet been
permitted on CRP land, however.
   _Emergency livestock feed assistance has been approved for 169
counties in 13 states.
   _A Presidential Interagency Drought Policy Committee has set up
a toll-free hot line to answer questions about federal services in
the stricken areas. The number is 1-800-541-3375 on weekdays, 8
a.m. to 6 p.m. EDT, and from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Follow Rising Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices danced to the dollar's tune this
past week, and the results gave bondholders reason to smile. But
what is going to happen when the upbeat music ends?
   ``The dollar is on a temporary run, and if you want to join the
party, you had better belly up to the bar quickly before they quit
serving free drinks,'' said Robert Brusca, economist for Nikko
Securities International in New York.
   When the dollar stops rising, Brusca said chances increase that
bond prices are going to slip and interest rates will edge higher.
   The dollar climbed sharply this week after the major industrial
nations meeting in Toronto reaffirmed their support for stability
of the dollar in foreign-exchange markets.
   As the dollar rose, foreign investors decided dollar-denominated
securities looked even more attractive, and their buying ignited a
powerful rally in Treasury notes and bonds.
   On Wednesday, prices of the bellwether 30-year Treasury issue
climbed $18 for every $1,000 in face value while its yield skidded
to 8.91 percent from 9.08 percent the previous evening.
   By midday Friday, prices were up another $5 for every $1,000 in
face value for the week and yields fell to 8.86 percent compared
with 9.09 percent at the end of the previous week.
   But one question facing bond investors at the end of the week
was what will happen if the dollar's climb runs out of steam? The
analysts say it may force the market to focus again on economic
fundamentals. And there is wide disagreement on what the
fundamentals show.
   Harold Nathan, chief economist for Wells Fargo & Co. in San
Francisco, said he finds evidence of solid growth in the United
States and abroad that will generate gains in inflation to the
detriment of bond prices.
   ``It's my belief that this rally is going to be short-lived and
it's not a trend,'' he said. ``Rates will head generally higher
with sporadic rallies like this last one creating volatility along
the line.''
   By the end of the year, Nathan expects the 30-year Treasury will
yield about 9.9 percent, or a full percentage point higher than its
current level.
   Nikko's Brusca said he sees some negative signs for the bond
market _ industrial production remains strong, factories are
operating near full capacity and industrial commodity prices such
as aluminum, zinc and nickel are rising. That could push inflation
higher, possibly prompting the Federal Reserve to encourage higher
interest rates.
   He expects the long Treasury's yield will rise to 9.75 percent
before settling down to about 9.5 percent at the end of the year.
   But Mickey Levy, chief economist for First Fidelity
Bancorporation in Philadelphia, said he finds mixed evidence on the
strength of the economy in the latest economic reports, and expects
a slowdown is imminent.
   This past week, for instance, the government reported a 2.2
percent decline in durable goods orders for May and said the
economy grew at a 3.6 percent rate in the first quarter after
adjustment for inflation, down from its 3.9 percent growth estimate
a month earlier.
   Levy said he expects long-term rates to fall to 8.75 percent by
the end of the year and 8 percent by the middle of 1989 as a
reduction in capital spending leads to a broader economic slowdown.
   Elliott Platt, research director for the investment firm
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., is even more
optimistic about chances for lower rates.
   He said he thinks a moderation in economic growth over the next
few months will send long-term rates to the 8 percent to 8.25
percent range by fall.
   Platt worries about the impact that the drought may have on the
economy, but it isn't the concern you might expect. While he
expects the drought to push food prices higher, he doesn't think
the increase will add much to overall inflation.
   Platt is more concerned about the psychological damage that
higher food prices may have on consumers' willingness to spend, a
key factor in keeping the economy growing. ``Once they see food
prices increase, we may have a break in consumer confidence,'' he
said.

   Profit-taking has ended a three-day rally in
gasoline prices, while oversupply worries brought oil futures lower.
   July unleaded gasoline contracts fell 0.15 cent Friday to close
at 50.91 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Gasoline prices fell back after having crossed the
51-cents-a-gallon level on Thursday. Traders, believing thatprice
was too high, moved in to take profits, said Madison Galbraith,
senior energy specialist with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Gasoline supplies remained tight in the Northeast, but that was
not enough to extend the rally in the gasoline pit to a fourth day,
said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc.
   Meanwhile, futures prices for crude oil and home heating oil
fell because of overabundant supplies, the analysts said.
   ``Any day that this market goes down, you can be sure someone
somewhere is thinking, `oversupply,''' Beutel said.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, fell 36 cents to close at $16.01 per 42-gallon barrel.
The July contract for home heating oil dropped 0.80 cent to close
at 43.14 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Personal Income, Spending Up Modestly in May</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The consumer spending boom could slow this summer, some
economists said after the government reported a modest increase in
personal spending and personal income for the month of May.
   A rise in the dollar on Friday helped the bond market, but
stocks slipped. Most grain prices retreated in response to
scattered showers, while energy futures prices dropped.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 5.33 points
to 2,142.96, finishing the week with a gain of nearly 2 percent.
   The dollar's rise carried it past key psychological resistance
points to levels against many major currencies not seen in eight
months.
   In New York the dollar rose to 130.53 Japanese yen from 128.62
yen on Thursday. The dollar rose to 1.8155 West German marks from
1.7850 late Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that personal income rose
0.3 percent last month following a 0.1 percent gain in April.
   Meanwhile, personal consumption expenditures, which include
virtually everything except interest on debt, rose a moderate 0.5
percent in May following a 0.4 percent increase in April.
   John Hagens, an economist with the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., consulting firm, said, ``I think basically our biggest concern
is how weak consumer spending is. ... The income growth is simply
not there to support much growth, particularly given higher food
prices expected because of the drought,'' he said.
   Through the first five years of the six-year economic expansion,
consumer buying has fueled the growth. Now, analysts are looking
for exports and sale of equipment to businesses to drive the
economy.
   Americans' disposable income _ what they have left after paying
taxes _ shot up 1.5 percent in May, after a 1.0 percent drop in
April that was the largest decline in a year.
   The drought-driven rally in most grain and soybean futures
markets stalled as scattered showers forced skittish traders to
pause for a look at reality, analysts said.
   Prices yo-yoed on the Chicago Board of Trade but finished mixed
with only oat futures continuing the sharply higher trend
established earlier in the week.
   On other exchanges, precious metals futures fell sharply;
livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures slipped; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   ``This thing has more lives than a cat. It kept coming back and
coming back,'' Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said of the grain market's erratic performance.
