<HEAD>ADL Reports Upswing in Israel-Related Anti-Semitism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There has been a sharp rise in anti-Semitic
incidents that stem from opposition to Israel, the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith reported Tuesday.
   So far this year, 88 out of 443 anti-Semitic incidents reported
in the United States have had an element of anti-Israeli sentiment,
according to a report by the ADL, which monitors outbreaks of
racism and anti-Semitism.
   By contrast, there were only three such incidents out of 1,018
anti-Semitic episodes reported for all of last year.
   This year's anti-Israeli incidents appeared to be prompted by
Palestinian unrest in the occupied territories, the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the ADL report said.
   Abraham Foxman, the group's national director, said the
incidents represented ``the first time since the founding of the
state of Israel 40 years ago that there has been a significant
outbreak of Middle East-related anti-Semitic incidents in this
country.''
   The incidents included vandalism and arson attacks on
synagogues, telephone threats to Jewish organizations and other
forms of verbal harassment.
   California led all states in reports of politically motivated
anti-Semitism with 12 vandalism cases and 13 harassment incidents,
followed by Illinois, Florida, Minnesota, Massachusetts and
Pennsylvania, the ADL said.
   The figures are based on reports gathered by the ADL's 31
regional offices.

   A luckless man has been charged with a string of
robberies in which he took 1,500 lottery tickets in hopes of
winning the jackpot, police said.
   Johnnie Cooper, 20, didn't get the $1 million winner. He did get
booked on charges of armed robbery and grand theft in connection
with three separate robberies of 7-Eleven stores last week, police
said Monday.
   ``He didn't take cash, he didn't take food, he didn't take
anything but the lottery tickets,'' said Metro-Dade detective Tommy
Robson.
   The robberies occurred Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings
at two different 7-Elevens, police said. In each case, the robber,
who brandished a gun in the first robbery, fled in a black
Cadillac, they said.
   Cooper, unarmed, was arrested Friday night after an officer
spotted a black Cadillac at the first 7-Eleven that had been
robbed, police said.

then lowered two rescue climbers who helped the two climb the
remaining 600 feet to safety.

<TEXT>
   Political disorders, ethnic tensions,
poverty and international disputes are churning up the South Seas
in an arc curving sharply northward from New Zealand and back down
to Australia.
   Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tahiti, Papua New Guinea, Tonga,
Western Samoa, even New Zealand and Australia themselves, have had
a taste of trouble in the past year.
   Most recently it was rioting in Vanuatu over land claims, and in
the French territory of New Caledonia 19 native Kanaks were killed
in a shootout with French troops in ethnic and political disorders.
   Fiji has seen two coups in the past year, and the former British
island remains unstable in the aftermath.
   Australia is concerned about what it sees as the speading
influence of Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi in the area and the
inroads made by the Soviet Union in what long has been seen as an
``American lake.''
   A commentator in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said the
image of a South Seas paradise may have been permanently tarnished.
   The past year also has seen riots in Tahiti and political
upheaval in Papua New Guinea over the alleged corruption of Cabinet
ministers.
   New Zealand faces racial unrest as indigenous Maoris press the
Labor Party government of Prime Minister David Lange with a battery
of land and fisheries claims.
   In Australia, aborigines are using this year's bicentennial
celebrations to highlight grievances they say grew out of European
settlement 200 years ago.
   In early May, bloody violence erupted over territorial and
French presidential elections in New Caledonia, culminating in the
rescue of French hostages held in caves by Melanesian separatists;
21 people were killed.
   On May 16, a drunken mob ran riot through Vanuatu's capital,
Port Vila, looting shops and smashing office windows. One man died,
nine others were injured and police arrested 30 people in the
rioting over land claims.
   Australia and New Zealand responded to the crisis by airlifting
riot-control gear to Vanuatu at Prime Minister Walter Lini's
request.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia linked Libya to the
rioting and said Australia could not stand by as a friendly
country's government is undermined by what he called a
non-democratic process.
   ``There is no doubt about a Libyan connection in Vanuatu,''
Hawke said. ``In a city with a population of less than 20,000 it is
clear that these disturbances have been on a very serious scale.''
   Vanuatu, formerly the British-French New Hebrides, shocked the
generally pro-Western South Pacific with its decision in 1986 to
establish diplomatic relations with Libya and the Soviet Union.
   Since then, the Soviet Union has sought fishing agreements with
Papua New Guinea and impoverished Kiribati, creating concern in
Australia as well as Washington about Soviet inroads in the region.
   More recently, the Soviet Union has approached Australia for
fishing access to Australian ports for refueling purposes and to
Australian airports for fishing crews in transit. Hawke said he
would treat the request with caution.
   Elsewhere in the South Pacific, such nations as Tonga and
Western Samoa face poverty, overcrowding and unemployment. Many of
the islanders have migrated to Australia and New Zealand in search
of jobs.
   ``All these are turning the once tranquil South Pacific into an
increasingly complex set of real and potential troublespots,'' the
Sydney Morning Herald said.
   The Sydney Daily Telegraph echoed that concern, calling the
situation a powderkeg.
   ``The multiple problems of these islands has led to a rising
discontent,'' the Telegraph said. ``Moscow has been making big
efforts to gain a stronger foothold in every island group through
fishery deals and aid.''
   Racial and ethnic divisions remain a major underlying problem of
many Pacific islands, where populations are mainly Melanesian. Fiji
and New Caledonia are examples.
   Australia is the major power in the region and its largest aid
donor.
   Foreign Minister Bill Hayden has expressed concern about Libyan
activities, going as far as to close down Libya's diplomatic
mission in Canberra last year after an incident involving the
aboriginal activist Michael Mansell.
   Mansell had returned from Libya saying Gadhafi was prepared to
bankroll a black revolution in Australia.
   The scattered violence in the South Seas has no single
connective thread, although in New Caledonia and French Polynesia
the crises erupted after France refused to follow the regional
pattern of decolonization and independence.
   France already suffers a major image problem in the South Seas
with the bombing of the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior in New
Zealand in 1985 and its continued underground nuclear testing on
the Mururoa atoll over the objections of almost every island state
in the region.
   The island states, supported by Australia and New Zealand, have
declared the South Pacific a nuclear-free zone.
   In a major turnaround, the United States in 1986 designated the
South Pacific an area of concern because of a buildup of the Soviet
Pacific fleet.
   U.S. officials believe the Soviet fleet consists of 755 ships
and patrol craft, including 141 submarines.

<HEAD>Welfare Recipients Become Entrepreneurs in Pilot Projects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A program targeted at low-income women in
Minnesota is helping welfare recipients create their own jobs and
build successful businesses, and promoters hope its success will
spread to the rest of the country.
   ``A lot of people told me this was going to fail miserably,''
said Kathryn S. Keeley, president of the 5-year-old Women's
Economic Development Corp., which was graduating its first class of
18 fledgling entrepreneurs today.
   Under the plan, welfare recipients receive training and then
continue receiving public assistance while receiving subsidized
loans to help them start businesses ranging from cleaning companies
to hair-styling salons.
   ``The first hurdle we had to cross in this area was skepticism.
Can poor women do it?'' said Robert Friedman, president of the
Corporation for Enterprise Development.
   The organization began its first class for welfare entrepreneurs
in March under the federal Self Employment Investment
Demonstration. Keeley said she hopes 90 people will graduate by the
end of the year.
   Minnesota is the first of five states to launch the program,
which is coordinated by the private, nonprofit Corporation for
Enterprise Development in Washington, Friedman said. The other
states are Iowa, Michigan, Mississippi and New Jersey.
   The corporation persuaded federal officials to waive regulations
which reduce or eliminate benefits when recipients get jobs,
Friedman said. Participants continue receiving assistance even
after they start their own businesses so they can re-invest profits.
   At the Women's Economic Development Corp., recipients devise a
business plan, learn about marketing, financial management and
other skills and are encouraged to start thinking like
entrepreneurs.
   They can borrow up to $5,000, to be loaned in small increments
as their businesses progress at 1 percent above the prime lending
rate, said Joyce Yamamoto, who directs the organization's pilot
project known as the Self Employment Training Opportunities Program.
   Once a month for at least a year, recipients are required to
work with the organization's accountant to do bookkeeping.
   ``The whole point of that is to get them off on the right
foot,'' Ms. Yamamoto said.
   Women's Economic Development Corp. received nearly all its
current annual budget of $600,000 from foundations and other
private sources, Ms. Keeley said.
   Organizers hope to help other states begin similar projects, she
said.
   An aspiring filmmaker, one of the few men to complete the
program, said welfare recipients face challenges other
entrepreneurs don't.
   ``Most of us who have been down and out have had our self-esteem
shattered. They realized it was important to build that up,'' he
said of the program, asking not to be identified for fear it might
hurt his business.
   Promoters point out that the program isn't a cure-all for
welfare problems.
   ``People get poor for different reasons. They are going to
escape in different ways,'' Friedman reasoned.
   Only 10 percent to 15 percent of Minnesota's 57,000 AFDC
recipients are likely candidates for the program, said Stephen R.
Rhodes, planning director for the state Office of Jobs Policy.
Nationally, the percentage is 2 percent to 5 percent, he said.
   A forerunner to the current program was launched three years
ago. In that time, 22 women started businesses and three have
already repaid their loans, Ms. Keeley said.
   ``They don't hand the business to you. You have to work for
it,'' said Ellie Richardson, who has cleaned homes and businesses
most of her life and started a janitorial service in late 1986.
``They give you the right contacts. If you don't follow through,
it's your fault.''
   Ms. Richardson, who had been on and off assistance for 30 years,
is self-supporting now and employs about 10 people. ``I'm glad I'm
off. Welfare makes you feel depressed and down,'' she said.
   Before the pilot program ends in 1992, Friedman hopes to
persuade federal officials to waive permanently regulations that
bar welfare recipients who turn a business profit from keeping
their benefits while they get their companies off the ground.
   ``We need the federal government to let go a little to let it
succeed,'' Friedman said. ``I must say the Department of Health and
Human Services has been very cooperative, but right now the waiver
process is onerous.''

<HEAD>Home Of Confederacy May Produce Nation's First Black Governor</HEAD>

   When Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder was growing
up in this former Confederate capital, he waited on tables at
political dinners in the city's segregated clubs and hotels.
   Next year, Wilder could land a job in Virginia's Executive
Mansion as the host of such dinners _ and the nation's first
elected black governor.
   The 57-year-old Wilder, whose grandparents were slaves, already
is the highest-ranking black elected state official in the country.
Although he has not yet announced his candidacy, he would be the
favorite to win the Democratic nomination for governor next summer.
   Mark Rozell, a political scientist at Mary Washington College in
Fredericksburg, said Wilder has no strong opposition within the
party and, among potential Republican opponents next November, only
Sen. Paul S. Trible Jr. seems at this point to pose a major threat
to Wilder's election.
   Trible is not seeking re-election to the Senate this year and
has not said whether he will run for governor in 1989.
   Wilder, the youngest of eight children, grew up in Richmond. He
studied chemistry at Virginia Union University, then enlisted in
the Army and won a Bronze Star for bravery in Korea.
   He went to law school at Howard University and opened a law
practice here in 1959. Ten years later, he ran for a Virginia
Senate vacancy when other local black leaders showed no interest.
He became the first black to sit in the chamber since
Reconstruction.
   In the Senate, Wilder was recognized as a skilled debater who
quickly learned the rules of parliamentary procedure. Although his
early image was that of a firebrand, he was never considered a
militant.
   Wilder was instrumental in the state's adoption of a holiday
honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. He also
lobbied unsuccessfully to change lyrics that blacks found offensive
in the state song, ``Carry Me Back to Old Virginia.''
   Wilder combined the role of maverick with that of an insider. In
1982, he single-handedly scuttled the U.S. Senate ambition of
fellow Democrat Owen B. Pickett because Pickett dared to invoke the
name of Virginia's conservative leader, Harry F. Byrd Jr., a U.S.
senator who left the Democratic Party in 1970 to become an
independent. The Byrd organization had dominated the state for 50
years.
   Two years later, in July 1984, Wilder announced for the
Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor. No serious
opposition arose within the party during the next year, and he was
nominated in June 1985. When Virginia Democrats also nominated a
woman for attorney general, there were predictions that the party
was headed for disaster.
   But Wilder played down his race and offered the image of a
moderate native son in the tradition of then-Democratic Gov.
Charles S. Robb.
   A combination of Robb's popularity, mistakes by Wilder's GOP
opponent and a tour of the state by Wilder helped turn the
predicted disaster into the second straight Democratic sweep of the
state's top three offices.
   Wilder's performance in the administration of Gov. Gerald L.
Baliles, who cannot by law succeed himself, has been mostly low-key.
   However, Wilder engaged in a well-publicized feud with Robb
during his first year in office over how much credit Robb deserved
for the 1985 victory. Wilder also has criticized the
administration's tax increases for road construction and made a
show this year of pushing, over Baliles' objections, for a repeal
of the sales tax on over-the-counter drugs.
   The lieutenant governor's major prospective competitor for the
gubernatorial nomination stepped aside in March when Attorney
General Mary Sue Terry announced that she would seek another term
in office.
   Baliles acknowledged this month in a college commencement
address that Wilder could make history next year by becoming the
first black to lead the state's Democratic ticket.
   Baliles' office said no endorsement was intended, but observers
said the comment amounted to a warning to potential rivals to stay
out of Wilder's way.
   Wilder is expected to announce his political plans this summer.
   According to Rozell, Wilder's race may not prevent him from
becoming governor of the Old Dominion because of changes over the
past 20 years in the state's population and its attitudes. About 20
percent of Virginians are black, and the state also has a large,
progressive-minded population in the northern corridor adjoining
the nation's capital.
   No black has ever been elected governor in this country. In 1986
Los Angeles' Democratic Mayor Thomas Bradley and William Lucas, a
Republican county executive in Michigan, both were nominated by
their parties but lost the election. Bradley also had failed in his
first race for governor in 1982.
   The only black to serve as a U.S. governor was Pinckney B.S.
Pinchback, the lieutenant governor of Louisiana who became acting
governor for six weeks in 1872-1873 after the governor was
impeached.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lack of an alternative to military
rule, and a protest movement so well-mannered it apparently is no
threat, have stymied U.S. attempts to force Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega from power.
   For his part, the general uses the populist appeal that has
characterized 20 years of de facto military rule and deflects the
spotlight from himself. Noriega says the issue is not whether he
stays or goes, but Panama's dignity and self-determination.
   This plays well in a country that knows it was created in 1903
essentially for Washington's convenience and where a new
nationalism sparked by the Panama Canal treaties burns brightly.
   In mid-May, Noriega consolidated support in the military by
forming a Military Strategy Council of 20 loyal officers. The
council, most of whose members are from the middle ranks, appears
to be at least on par with the senior officers who serve as chiefs
of staff.
   Allegations of drug-running and of involvement in the
decapitation murder of opposition figure Hugo Spadafora, which
spurred the movement to oust Noriega a year ago, have all but
evaporated as issues among Panamanians.
   Washington engineered the departures of dictators during the
past decade in Nicaragua, Haiti, the Philippines and Iran by
convincing them that their positions were untenable and they could
not expect U.S. help against popular uprisings.
   Noriega clearly does not feel threatened by his opposition,
which comes from the genteel, educated middle and upper classes
rather than oppressed masses.
   It is an uprising with good manners, a rare phenomenon in
Central America. While dissidents in other countries form guerrilla
armies, Panamanians bang pots and pans, wave white handkerchiefs
and hold brief general strikes.
   ``If you want to see Panamanians dead in the streets of Panama,
you will not see it,'' deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle said
in a recent meeting with reporters. ``Panamanians have risked as
far as they are willing to risk.''
   Noriega has shut down opposition news media. His soldiers, who
can crack heads with the best of them when the occasion arises,
have blocked most street demonstrations with intimidation or force.
   Panamanian life is permeated by a ``them or us'' attitude that
pits workers against the wealthy opposition, a small and struggling
Panama against the Colossus of the North, and Panamanian
independence against U.S. meddling.
   Noriega popularized the term ``rabi-blancos,'' which translates
roughly to ``white butts,'' a reference to the lighter skin common
to Panama's upper classes.
   In a recent speech the general said ``the establishment,'' as he
has taken to calling the United States, will be responsible if
anything untoward happens to him.
   American economic sanctions have lowered the comparatively high
living standard of many Panamanians but made no visible dent in
Noriega's control. He has rejected the legitimacy of federal
indictments in Florida charging him with drug trafficking and money
laundering.
   Panama and the United States appeared to be negotiating on
different levels _ the Panamanians wanting to talk about economic
issues and American troop withdrawals, and Washington is willing to
discuss only dropping the indictments in exchange for Noriega's
departure.
   Noriega says he will not respond to ultimatums and will not deal
until sanctions are lifted and the additional American soldiers
troops sent to Panama in April are pulled out.
   The troops and sanctions remain in place. Noriega says that,
early in the talks, U.S. negotiators gave him 48 hours to be out of
his country.
   Although Secretary of State George P. Shultz said last week the
talks had broken off, the United States is trying again, this time
enlisting Latin American democracies. Panamanian opponents of
Noriega had been urging that approach for weeks.
   Military rule in Panama began when Col. Omar Torrijos seized
power in a 1968 coup. He banned partisan political activity for the
next 10 years, and some party leaders went into exile or became
inactive.
   The country has had eight civilian presidents and one civilian
junta since 1968, but power always has resided in the National
Guard, recently renamed the Panama Defense Forces. Noriega commands
the 15,000-member force, which includes the military and police.
   Only Nicolas Ardito Barletta, in 1984, was elected by popular
vote, and Noriega forced him out in 1985. Ardito Barletta had run
as a member of the military-dominated Revolutionary Democratic
Party in an election many contend was fraudulent.
   Civilian parties have not produced an alternative to military
rule around whom people will rally, and Panama is not noted for
presidential stability. Presidents sometimes hold office only a few
weeks.
   Roberto Chiari was president five times in 1960-1964 and earlier
served four days as second vice president.
   The military and its Revolutionary Democratic Party have proved
more durable.

   Itzik, an Israeli version of Archie Bunker,
can't get used to having Arabs next-door. His Arab neighbor can't
get used to Itzik.
   The hotheaded pair are the central characters in ``Neighbors,''
a comedy series produced by Israeli television about a subject most
people consider deadly serious: Jewish-Arab relations.
   The 70-minute pilot broadcast Friday night started off with
Itzik, a Jewish insurance salesman, moving into a new apartment.
   He's happy until he notices the nameplate across the hall has a
distinctly Arab ring: Medawar.
   A few minutes later, a middle-aged woman knocks on Itzik's door
to ask for help fixing a short circuit. Itzik asks her how she
feels about ``the issue.''
   ``Oh, I don't mind having Jewish neighbors,'' replies Muna
Medawar.
   But Itzik minds have Arabs next-door.
   When Mrs. Medawar's husband, Bassam, a garage owner, shows up in
Itzik's apartment with a tire, Itzik exclaims: ``Oh my God, a
burning tire in the house!''
   The Arab dubs Itzik ``Mr. Transfer.''
   The references are clear.
   Burning tires have become a symbol of the six-month Palestinian
uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. And right-wing Israelis want to transfer all Arabs out of
the occupied lands.
   Itzik's wife, Dorit, is more tolerant. Within minutes, she is
visiting Muna for coffee and setting off a chain of neighborly
interactions.
   ``The message is simple: we can live together,'' said Victor
Kamar, the Arab Israeli who directed the show. Producer Mika Ravid
is Jewish, and the actors are Jews and Arabs.
   It was not so simple to produce a show on personal relations
between Jewish and Arab Israeli citizens. ``Neighbors'' is Israel
Television's first entertainment show in 20 years to approach such
sensitive subjects as racism, prejudice, mutual suspicion and
political enmity.
   At least one previous attempt on Educational Television failed
because critics feared the program's encouragement of peaceful
coexistence might be interpreted as extending beyond friendly
relations _ to romantic ties and interfaith marriages.
   ``We may just tiptoe around that bombshell,'' Ravid said.
   ``Neighbors,'' produced on a budget of a little more than
$50,000, is considered the brainchild of Yosef Barel, manager of
the television's Arabic Department. Nearly two years ago, he
suggested a humorous show about ``the problem.''
   ``We invested a tremendous amount of time and work,'' Ravid
said. ``We sat down over every scene and every sensitive point so
that it could touch on current issues but not offend anyone on
either side.''
   One technique that makes the show understandable to all is that
the Israeli characters speak Hebrew, with Arabic subtitles, while
the Arabs speak their own language, with Hebrew subtitles.
   The show is not directly about relations between Israelis and
Palestinians from the occupied territories. Its message of
tolerance is built around Israel's Arab citizens _ a community of
750,000 people who have lived in the state since its independence
but who face discrimination despite their status as citizens.
   Bassam Zumot, a Palestinian from Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem,
said he thought long and hard before accepting the lead role,
because the theme did not touch on the issue of occupation.
   But the burly man, who portrays a character constantly battling
his waistline as well as his wife's diet food is a key factor in
making the program work. His range of facial expressions is one
reason viewers can laugh at the painful topic that few Israelis and
even fewer Palestinians feel free to joke about.
   When Muna warns him that the rich fried foods he loves will
drive up his blood pressure, he says, ``That guy across the hall
will give me high blood pressure.''
   ``He just needs time to get used to us,'' Muna says.
   ``Get used to us? What are we, asthma?'' Bassam retorts,
sneaking a plateful of cookies to eat in the bathroom.
   The actor hopes the series, which will be ready for next
winter's television season, will be ``a step on the road to peace.''
   ``I want people to think more than laugh,'' Zumot said. ``I
think of the apartment building as this region of the world. The
Jewish apartment is Israel, and the Arab apartment is Palestine.
And I want the Israelis to learn that when there will be a
Palestinian state, it will not be as dangerous as they think.''

<HEAD>Ousted Moscow Party Chief Calls On Communist Party's No. 2 Man To
Quit</HEAD>

   Boris N. Yeltsin, the ousted capital Communist
Party chief, took the unprecedented step of using Western news
media to insist that the party's No. 2 man, Yegor K. Ligachev,
resign because he is blocking reform.
   Never before has a fallen Soviet leader so sharply and publicly
criticized a high-level party official still in power.
   In interviews Monday with CBS News and the British Broadcasting
Corp., Yeltsin said it was a mistake to say Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
efforts to remake Soviet society are going according to plan.
   ``This is a dangerous thing to say,'' said Yeltsin, an outspoken
advocate of reform.
   He told the BBC that Ligachev should resign because he is the
main impediment to ``perestroika,'' the Russian word for
Gorbachev's restructuring.
   Yeltsin also said he was upset that Gorbachev did not rally to
his defense when he was shunted aside.
   The interviews shed light on Yeltsin's fall from power that
culminated in his removal Feb. 18 as a candidate, or non-voting,
member of the ruling Politburo. They also were the most extensive
he has granted the Western media since he was ousted as Moscow
party leader in November 1987.
   In addition, Yeltsin chose to speak out as Gorbachev seeks to
boost his standing at home through his five-day summit with
President Reagan.
   Yeltsin told the BBC that Ligachev should go ``because processes
in the party are too slow, because the party is still lagging
behind, because the process of democratization in the party is not
developing ... and Comrade Ligachev is the main person responsible
for this.''
   Ligachev, 67, formally oversees Communist Party ideology. In an
interview published in Paris last year, he said he presides over
the meetings of the Central Committee Secretariat, which runs this
vast country from day-to-day.
   Yeltsin, 57, told CBS the style of Ligachev's leadership
``contradicts the spirit of perestroika.''
   ``He's one of the opponents when it comes to questions of social
justice,'' Yeltsin told the BBC. Pressed by the interviewer, he
said he thought Ligachev should resign.
   Yeltsin said Gorbachev's reforms have met stiff resistance.
   ``In the first period of perestroika, there was an excessive
euphoria about how quickly change would come,'' he said. ``But
three years have passed and there have been no basic changes. If
there haven't been any changes in another three years, then
people's faith in perestroika will decline.''
   The stunning statements came as the Communist Party is embroiled
in fierce struggles between conservatives and reform advocates in
preparation for a party conference that opens June 28, the first
such session since 1941.
   It was not known whether Yeltsin's comments were sanctioned, or
even supported, by other high-ranking party members.
   CBS anchorman Dan Rather, who interviewed Yeltsin, told The
Associated Press: ``I can't believe he would do this ... unless he
feels, right or wrong, he has a green light from above.''
   However, Rather quoted Yeltsin as saying in portions of the
interview not broadcast by CBS that he received no prior approval
for his comments.
   As Moscow party boss, Yeltsin stood out for his brusque,
attacking manner and populist style.
   He was popular among Muscovites for criticizing consumer
shortages, sometimes striding into stores to take his complaints
straight to shopkeepers.
   This style apparently got him into trouble when he made a
still-unpublished speech to the Central Committee on Oct. 21, 1987.
Reports said he criticized what he saw as the slow pace of reform
and attacked Ligachev.
   Yeltsin confirmed to the BBC that he criticized Ligachev by name
at that meeting.
   Yeltsin was replaced as Moscow party chief by Lev N. Zaikov
following a meeting during which Gorbachev said Yeltsin put
``personal ambitions above the interests of the party'' and also
lacked self-discipline.
   Removed from the Politburo, he was named to the Cabinet-level
position of deputy head of the State Construction Committee. He was
removed from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's
nominal legislature, on May 4.
   Asked if he was upset Gorbachev did not defend him, Yeltsin told
the BBC: ``I'm upset. He feels this, and I told him I'm
dissatisfied with my present job.''
   He said that when relieved of his Moscow post, ``I was accused
of being an ultraleftist, which I'm not. I'm simply in favor of
energetic action for perestroika ... which would bring results. And
so far the results are very, very insignificant.''

<HEAD>Poll Finds Dissatisfaction With Presidential Nomination System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Americans favor major changes in the
selection of presidential nominees, with six in 10 saying they
would eliminate political conventions and let voters choose the
candidates directly, a Media General-Associated Press poll has
found.
   As the primary season winds down, with the final contests June
7, the survey found broad dissatisfaction with the selection
system. A majority of respondents said they did not follow the
campaigns regularly and only half believed the races provide a good
discussion of the issues.
   Sizable minorities said the best candidates generally lose their
bid for the nomination, particularly on the Democratic side.
   Fifty-two percent of the 1,204 adults in the national poll
favored major changes in the way the parties pick nominees, while
only 38 percent said the system works well enough now. Ten percent
didn't know.
   The dissatisfaction evenly spanned ideologies and political
affiliations. The most striking split was in age: The youngest
adults, ages 18-29, thought by a narrow margin that the system
works well enough, while the oldest, those older than 64, broadly
favored major changes, by 56-28 percent.
   The age split was mirrored in levels of attentiveness to the
races. Just 27 percent of the youngest group said they had been
following the primary campaigns regularly, compared with 54 percent
of the oldest group.
   There was majority agreement on another way to select
candidates. Fifty-nine percent said they would prefer to have
voters select the nominees, without any delegates to party
conventions.
   Only 31 percent favored the party convention system. Though
rules vary by state, generally voters select some delegates, the
party selects others and the delegates meet to choose the nominee
at conventions, where under some circumstances delegates can switch
their allegiance.
   Just 3 percent liked the idea of letting party leaders select
the nominee on their own.
   In another measure of unhappiness with the presidential
nomination process, sizable minorities of Americans said the
parties generally do not nominate their best candidate from among
those running.
   The Democrats fared worse, to the point that a plurality of the
men in the poll said the Democrats do not choose their best
candidate.
   Overall, 46 percent of respondents said the Democrats generally
do pick their best candidate from those who seek the nomination,
and 40 percent said not. But while women by a 51-33 margin said the
Democrats do take their best candidate, men by a 47-41 split said
not.
   More respondents overall, 52 percent, said the Republicans
nominate their best candidate from among those running, while 36
percent said not.
   Respondents who identified themselves as Republicans or
Democrats tended to favor their party's choices. But the Democratic
respondents said by 51-38 that the Republicans make their best
choice, while the Republicans and the independents were split on
whether the Democrats make their best pick.
   On the selection of vice presidential candidates, less than a
quarter of the respondents said the second-place finisher should be
the nominee, while a large majority favored leaving the choice to
the presidential candidate.
   Fifty-one percent said the nomination campaigns usually provide
a good discussion of the issues. But 40 percent disagreed, and
college graduates and higher-income Americans were split on the
question.
   Sixty-four percent of black respondents said the campaigns
provide a good discussion of the issues, possibly a reflection of
Jesse Jackson's efforts as a candidate for the Democratic
nomination.
   Despite criticisms of the Super Tuesday Southern regional
primaries as largely a superficial media event, 55 percent of
Southerners agreed that the campaigns provided a good discussion of
the issues.
   A plurality of respondents overall and a majority of Southerners
said Super Tuesday was a good idea, and 54 percent of all
respondents said regional primaries should be held again.
   On attentiveness to the races, 41 percent said they have been
following this year's primaries regularly, 50 percent said they
paid occasional attention, and 9 percent followed the campaigns
hardly at all or not at all.
   The Media General-Associated Press poll consisted of telephone
interviews April 29-May 8 with a randomly selected sample of
respondents. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
   Media General Inc., a communications company based in Richmond,
Va., publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News

<HEAD>Four Shopkeepers Sentenced to Death for Arson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four shopkeepers have been sentenced to death for
arson and 49 Communist Party members disciplined for helping the
merchants defraud insurance companies, an official report said
today.
   The China Daily said the four merchants, in two cities of the
northeastern Heilongjiang province, set fire to their shops after
taking out large insurance policies obtained through bribes to
local officials.
   Five people were killed in one of the fires.
   The newspaper said two brothers, Lu Guangcai and Lu Guangde,
falsified documents in Qitaihe City to insure their stationery
store and restaurant for $224,000. Two days later, they set fire to
a bag filled with gasoline, starting a blaze that killed five
people and caused $27,000 in damage, the paper said.
   The report said Wang Shuli of Yichun City took out insurance
worth $192,000 on a hardware store he managed after the store lost
$72,000 over a 10-month period as a result of waste and
mismanagement.
   And it said Yu Xibin rented a storehouse from Wang and insured
it for $84,000, although it had only two counters and a sofa.
   The two set fire to the stores five times in May and June of
last year, damaging six nearby stores and causing $24,000 in
losses, the report said.
   The four provided local officials with high-quality cigarettes,
wine, refrigerators, motorcycles and other goods to obtain
contracts for the stores and the expensive insurance policies, it
said.
   The report did not say if the death sentences had been carried
out.

<HEAD>For Gorbachev and His Countrymen, War Is an Ever-Present Memory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VOLGOGRAD, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev was 19 when he
saw this city, and it was in ruins. It was then called Stalingrad,
and it had been the scene of one of the bloodiest and most savage
battles of the Second World War.
   It left an impression that was still vivid in Gorbachev's mind
more than three and a half decades later.
   ``I went to study at Moscow State University, and I traveled
through Stalingrad, which had been destroyed, through Voronezh,
which had been destroyed,'' he told an interviewer in 1986.
``Nothing but ruins everywhere ... the whole country was in ruins.''
   World War II divided Gorbachev's family and devastated much of
his home region in southern Russia. By the time he saw Stalingrad,
in 1950, war for the budding law student was no vague or distant
concept, but a terrible reality that had hit close to home.
   Today, more than four decades after the Red Army struggled and
defeated the invading Nazi armies, the war continues to haunt the
collective Soviet soul, and perhaps Gorbachev himself.
   For Soviets, the conflict they call the ``Great Patriotic War''
is simultaneously a glorious chapter in their country's history,
proof of the superiority of socialism, a convenient alibi when
things go wrong, and a tragedy whose scars are felt even today.
   The wartime alliance between the United States and Soviet Union
against the Axis is also cited by Gorbachev, chief of the Communist
Party, as proof that the superpowers need not be adversaries, but
can be allies.
   ``When the time posed the question acutely, irrevocably and that
question had to be answered, the Soviet and American peoples
united,'' he told a group of American schoolchildren who visited
the Kremlin earlier this month. ``The present time ... also makes
vast demands, above all on our two great peoples.''
   Virtually every Soviet family, including Gorbachev's, was
touched by the four years of bitter fighting that ranged throughout
the western Soviet Union and claimed the lives of 20 million Soviet
soldiers and civilians.
   After the German armies drove across the Soviet border in June
1941, Gorbachev's father, Sergei, a tractor driver, was called to
the front, and served for four years. Mikhail was 10 years old when
the fighting broke out.
   His native Stavropol region, 300 miles southwest of Volgograd,
was overrun by the German 40th Panzer Corps for seven months
beginning in August 1942, just as the battle for Stalingrad was
raging.
   From just one collective farm in the Stavropol region, in the
village of Beshpagir, 417 young men and women went away to fight,
and were killed in battle.
   The grip of World War II on the Soviet mind, and the use made of
the memories by authorities, are nowhere more evident than in the
city once called Stalingrad. In the titanic battle that raged here,
as many as 1 million Soviets may have perished and 1.5 million
Germans were killed, wounded or taken prisoner.
   In this city situated on a bend in the Volga river 600 miles
south of Moscow, 90 percent of the buildings in the industrial and
residential center were devastated by artillery strikes, dive
bombing raids and months of dogged house-to-house fighting.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt said the eight-month battle that
ended in February 1943 with the surrender of encircled Nazi units
had marked ``the turning point in the war of the Allied Nations
against the forces of aggression.''
   At former Soviet battlefield sites like Volgograd, every day is
Memorial Day. About 3 million Soviets visit a gigantic memorial
complex here each year, many of them veterans returning to see the
place where many of their comrades were killed.
   ``You feel a great weight in your soul,'' said Amazas S.
Arutunyan, 63, an Armenian who served as a private in the 93rd
Artillery Regiment until he was badly wounded. ``So many men fell
in combat, some screaming, others just falling in silence, like
leaves.''
   The war medals worn by the wizened man thumped against his chest
as he slowly climbed a half-mile to the top of Mamayev Kurgan hill,
where a huge statue of Mother Russia, slightly larger than the
Statue of Liberty, brandishes a sword and calls on her children to
smite the invader.
   In a cavernous hall dominated by an enormous white stone hand
holding a blazing torch, 34 dipped red banners record the names of
more than 7,000 Soviet men and women who died defending Stalingrad.
A recording of solemn music plays over and over.
   The effect is overpowering.
   ``You cannot come here without tears,'' said Nadezhda Denisova,
61, a Volgograder, who was 19 when the Battle of Stalingrad began.
Her eyes welled. ``There were so many dead.''
   A visitor's book is filled with poignant messages left by those
who have come to the monument. One man wrote: ``Uncle Vasiya, I
have found you at last. Your name is on one of the banners.''
   The memorial complex on Mamayev Kurgan hill does not only stress
the heroism and patriotism of the Soviets who fought here, but also
the fact that they fought in the name of socialism and Soviet power.
   The name of Josef V. Stalin, wartime generalissimo and Soviet
dictator, was stripped from this city in 1961 when it was renamed
Volgograd, but now the party as a whole is lauded as the organizer
of World War II victory.
   Olga Sobelyova made that point as she slowly escorted a group of
24 orphans from the Central Russian city of Sasovo up the hill
toward the giant statue of Mother Russia.
   ``Children, you mustn't think that it was just our armies who
won here,'' said the 41-year-old guide from Volgograd. ``It was our
entire country, our socialist system, and our Communist Party.''

<HEAD>Organ Donation Down, Doctors And Consent Laws Blamed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With organ donations declining and more Americans
than ever awaiting transplants, specialists are begging doctors to
make better use of consent laws designed to persuade families to
consider donations.
   ``There is a large faction of the profession that has never
wanted to have anything to do with this (transplant) business,''
said Dr. Lawrence G. Hunsicker, president of the American Society
of Transplant Physicians, whose annual meeting begins today.
   ``Over and over again, we hear from a donor's family that they
are glad they gave and others say they wish they had had the
chance,'' he said. ``And yet the profession is not responding.''
   Federal law requires hospitals to have a protocol for
approaching the families of brain-dead patients about the
possibility of organ donation. Forty-four states also have versions
of the statute.
   The overall results are not impressive.
   Fewer kidney and heart-lung transplants were performed
nationwide in 1987 than in 1986, according to the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services. And although there were a record
number of heart, liver and pancreas transplants in 1987, the
increase did not keep pace with previous years.
   Figures for 1988 are not yet available, but organ donations
appear to be down by up to 10 percent, said Dr. John McDonald,
president of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons and the
United Network for Organ Sharing.
   ``The problem is that they (hospitals) often have the wrong
people asking in order to comply with the law,'' said Roger Evans,
senior research scientist at the Battelle Seattle Research Center.
   Doctors are big offenders, experts say.
   ``They've got to be the hardest group in the world to educate.
Once they're out of medical school, it's like they're on remote
control,'' said Faye Davis, executive director of the New York
Regional Transplant Program.
   ``You cannot make a doctor do something he doesn't want to do
... and there are lots of reasons why he doesn't think it's
appropriate to ask Mrs. Jones for her husband's organs,'' Hunsicker
said. ``They think it takes a lot of time, that it will be a
nuisance and they don't get anything out of it.''
   Some physicians tell patients' next of kin, ```I know you don't
want to do this, but the law says I have to ask you if you want to
be a donor,''' Ms. Davis said.
   Others approach distraught families too quickly. About 20
percent of the California Transplant Donor Network's calls about
potential donors, for instance, come from emergency rooms.
   ``That's awfully early to make a decision about a person being
brain-dead,'' a condition in which the brain no longer functions
but the body is sustained by machine, said Phyllis Weber, executive
director of the San Francisco-based network.
   Part of the problem, in general, is that ``dying and death are
taboo subjects'' among health-care professionals, said John
Kiernan, administrator of the organ recovery program for The
Presbyterian Hospital in New York City.
   ``It seems to me we might do a better job of requesting
donations if these requests are made within the context of an
effective bereavement program,'' he said.
   In addition to poorly implemented consent laws, experts say, the
supply of healthy organs has been reduced as recent safety measures
_ including seat belt and motorcycle helmet laws _ have cut down on
the number of premature deaths. The pool of potential organ donors
also has been reduced in places by the growing number of people
testing positive for the AIDS virus.
   Only about 4,000 of the estimated 22,000 to 25,000 potential
organ donors actually become donors each year, Evans said.
   A record 14,720 people, meanwhile, are awaiting transplants in
the United States, said William Vaughn, technical services director
for the United Network for Organ Sharing.
   ``It may well be that we will never meet the need,'' Kiernan
said, ``no matter what we do.''

<HEAD>Sources: Soviet Official Warned Reagan Party About Refusenik Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President and Mrs. Reagan agonized over whether to
visit a Jewish refusenik family after a top Soviet Foreign Ministry
official warned that it would ruin the family's chances to
emigrate, U.S. sources say.
   In the end, the visit never came off. And a 12-year-old girl who
calls herself ``a lifelong refusenik'' was disappointed.
   U.S. sources speaking on condition of anonymity said Monday that
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Bessmertnykh warned U.S.
Ambassador Jack F. Matlock during a summit planning meeting last
week that the Zieman family would never be permitted to leave the
Soviet Union if Reagan visited.
   ``It went back and forth several times'' as the Reagans and
White House aides considered the dilemma, one source said. ``They
didn't want to knuckle under to intimidation, but they didn't want
to hurt the Ziemans, either.''
   Instead of making the visit, the Reagans toured the Arbat mall
in downtown Moscow. The Ziemans waited patiently until it was clear
the president would not be coming.
   The Ziemans' 12-year-old daughter Vera had appealed to the
Reagans for help in getting her and her family out of the Soviet
Union.
   Americans who meet her unfailingly note Vera's uncanny
resemblance to Little Orphan Annie with her curly hair and cherub
cheeks. She speaks English with a British accent, as taught by her
mother. She calls herself a ``lifelong refusenik'' because the
family has been refused permission to emigrate virtually since her
birth.
   ``My name is Vera Zieman,'' she wrote the Reagans last month,
``but everybody calls me `Moscow's Orphan Annie.'''
   ``My elder sister, who lives in Boston now, tries desperately to
help us get permission to leave the USSR,'' Vera wrote the Reagans.
``I wish and wish I could do something too. So I made up my mind to
venture to ask you for help.''
   She told of her family's efforts to emigrate and of the
hardships her parents have suffered since becoming refuseniks. Her
father, who has worked as a plumber since losing his scientific
post, recently suffered a mysterious brain ailment that has
affected his vision and balance. During his hospitalization for
that condition, he contracted hepatitis and has been confined to
bed, although he got up to attend the Reagan reception on Monday.
   Matlock, a career diplomat who has dealt with the Soviets
throughout much of his professional career, refused to respond to
queries about the incident. But other sources who participated in
planning the Reagans' visit said the blunt warning came from
Bessmertnykh, one of Matlock's principal contacts in the Soviet
government.
   Several sources confirmed all or part of this account on
condition they not be identified by name.
   A White House spokesman, Roman Popadiuk, said the White House
would not comment on the report, and Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov responded only indirectly, saying
the Reagans were free to meet with whom they please.
   Yuri Zieman, Vera's father, was asked at a reception Reagan gave
for Soviet dissidents and refuseniks Monday whether he thought a
Reagan visit would have made it more difficult for them to
emigrate, a goal they have sought since 1977.
   ``How do we know?'' he told reporters.``That's a very
Soviet-like statement, like `Don't try to emigrate; don't believe
in God.'''
   A White House advance party made a discreet visit to the
Ziemans' home in a shabby apartment building in southwest Moscow to
let them know the Reagans might come to see them. They made no
commitment.
   It was not clear how the Soviets learned of the plan, although
the KGB keeps close watch on American diplomats, Soviet dissidents
and refuseniks, Soviet Jews who have been refused permission to
leave the country.
   Zieman, a former computer scientist who lost his job when he
applied for an exit visa 11 years ago, has been told he is not
allowed to leave for security reasons, although he contends he
never had access to state secrets and has no information that could
threaten Soviet security.

<HEAD>Origins of Summitry Recounted in Last Volume of Epic Churchill
Biography</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In 1953, they scoffed when Sir Winston Churchill
proposed a summit conference between East and West. Today, as
Britons buy the final volume of his biography, they're not scoffing.
   The last volume of Martin Gilbert's ``Winston S. Churchill,''
which goes on sale today, illustrates the foresight that often
placed the British statesman so far ahead of events that he invited
ridicule.
   The work recounts how Churchill tried to bring about a summit
meeting similar to the one this week in Moscow. Britain's wartime
prime minister even coined the term ``summit.''
   Yet he was rebuffed by his own Cabinet and President Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
   Churchill _ who also foresaw the Nazi threat, the end of British
global pre-eminence and the atomic bomb _ wrote to Eisenhower in
1953 pleading for a summit with the Soviet leadership that took
over after Joseph Stalin died.
   But it was the height of the Cold War, and Eisenhower replied
that a summit would serve only the Soviet ``propaganda mill.''
   In a speech to Parliament, Churchill envisioned a summit, held
in a secluded setting, in which ``there might be a general feeling
among those gathered together that they might do something better
than tear the human race, including themselves, to bits.''
   Anthony Eden, Churchill's foreign secretary, viewed the summit
offer as a signal of weakness to the Soviets and wrote in his
diary: ``It must be long in history since any one speech did so
much damage to its own side.''
   Churchill also asked Eisenhower to approve a message to
Vyacheslav Molotov, the Soviet foreign minister, offering to go to
Moscow for informal talks.
   The president rejected the idea, expressing ``a bit of
astonishment'' and the ``suspicion that anything the Kremlin could
misinterpret as weakness or over-eagerness on our part would
militate against success in negotiation.''
   Churchill left office in 1955 and died 10 years later, aged 91,
having failed to bring about a summit.
   Gilbert said in an intervew: ``Churchill had a belief which is
now, if you like, fulfilled in Moscow ... a belief that if only the
leaders could sit down together, progress could be made.
   ``This was belittled by all the politicians as absurd and
fanciful, and yet Reagan and Gorbachev are sitting down, new
agreements have been signed, a whole new atmosphere has been
created, and Churchill set it all out in 1953, 1954 and 1955 to
Eisenhower.''
   Critics have acclaimed ``Never Despair,'' the final volume, and
compared the biography to ``The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire.''
   It fills eight volumes and 8,664 pages and took 25 years to
write. Still to come are 13 companion volumes of documents.
   With the companion volumes, ``Winston S. Churchill'' was in the
Guinness Book of Records as the world's longest biography even
before the final 1,359-page installment was published in Britain.
Houghton Mifflin soon will issue it in the United States.
   Gilbert, 51, is an Oxford University historian. He began as an
assistant to Churchill's son Randolph, who wrote the first two
volumes, and took over when Randolph died in 1967.
   Shining through the final volume covering Churchill's last 20
years are his qualities of doggedness, eloquence, sense of history
and unflagging gallantry to his monarch, colleagues and even
political foes.
   He was a prodigious author but never one to ``kiss and tell.''
He sent the manuscript of his wartime memoirs to Eisenhower asking
if there was anything Ike did not want mentioned.
   The final lines of Gilbert's book, quoting a letter to Churchill
from his daughter Mary Soames, are a fitting commentary on his
leadership in the dark years of World War II:
   ``In addition to all the feelings a daughter has for a loving,
generous father, I owe you what every Englishman, woman and child
does _ Liberty itself.''

   You fly in on the state airline, Aeroflot, make
your way through KGB passport and customs control and catch a ride
downtown with a driver from the state travel monopoly, Intourist.
GUM, the huge state-owned department store, is packed _ but not
because there's a sale on. There are no sales, the prices are fixed
by ... that's right, the state.
   That's life in the USSR. This is, after all, a communist state.
   But less so, it seems, every day that perestroika survives.
   If the buzzword of the 1980s in America has been
entrepreneurship, the key word here is cooperatives.
   Under the banner of perestroika, the Gorbachev campaign to
restructure the nation's stagnant economy, authorities last week
acted on new laws that will encourage the expansion of
cooperatives, economic units akin in many ways to the small
business sector of the United States, except that all employees are
co-owners and thus share in the profits.
   Profits?
   Profits have come to the Soviet Union and thus profit motive.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov said last week that 14,000
cooperatives were formed in the first 18 months they were
permitted, with another 6,000 formed in the past three months. The
cooperative system, he said optimistically, ``in a short time can
solve the most severe problems of perestroika, the demand of the
population for goods and services.''
   Perestroika signals a dramatic evolution in the communist
economy that has built a huge military might and an ominous
bureaucracy, but little in the way of consumer services that people
in the West have come to take for granted.
   Foreigners who live here send out to Helsinki for the finer
things in life. When the train from Finland arrives at Leningrad
Station here, it is loaded down with the fruits of the capitalist
West, such as dishwashing detergent, modern ranges, fresh produce
and Big Macs.
   Soviet citizens have neither the income, nor the hard currency
nor the authority to order out. Instead, they shop in state-owned
shops where variety is rare and the stock is either overpriced or
depleted. As a rule, quality is nothing to brag about either.
   Perestroika is already in deep trouble, not the least because
economic restructuring has brought the uncertainties of layoffs and
future price increases, without any of the rewards of a true
consumer economy.
   Change has been a long time coming to the Soviet Union. The
local press has come to dismiss the Brezhnev-to-Chernenko era,
1964-1985, as the ``period of stagnation.'' That said, the Moscow
News _ a state-controlled paper that takes advantage of glasnost
(the democratic companion of perestroika) to push the economic
reforms on the front page _ has run reams about cooperatives.
   It's the hot topic in town, at least among the intellectuals and
the foreign community. In New York, you ask a cabbie to take you to
Elaine's maybe. In Moscow, you ask for a cooperative and if you're
lucky, you make your way to one of the new restaurants _ owned by
its employees, who pocket the profit and thus have an incentive to
create an attractive dinner or sew an attractive dress.
   For the past six months, the way to the Vavilova market has
become lined with wooden stalls and card tables, as vendors sell
whatever they can make or get their hands on. One young lady is
modeling a red-and-white striped apron and has a dozen on the table
starting at 30 rubles (about $50). A fellow across the way has got
his hands on some stylish Western blue jeans _ for sale, he says,
at 130 rubles ($200, a month's pay for many Muscovites).
   After dinner, walk through the Arbat shopping mall _ or even Red
Square _ and you see artists selling their portraits of St. Basil's
Cathedral or the Lenin Mausoleum. They implore. They barter. They
discount. They would be capitalists or eccentrics at the
Pontevecchio in Florence, or in Ghirardelli Square in San
Francisco, but in Moscow they call themselves cooperatives.
   One new co-op restaurant in the northern section of Moscow
displays the stickers of major credit cards familiar in the West
and tries to make foreigners pay with plastic, an open violation of
currency laws that forbid practically all private trade in hard
currency.
   Prices at the restaurant double at midnight, and one unwary
foursome found themselves stuck with a 98-ruble ($170) bill for
dinner, outrageous by Soviet standards but more and more common as
co-ops learn the demand is there at practically any price in this
supply-starved economy.
   This turn in the local economy is not without controversy or
opposition, and many are the residents who recall Khrushchev-era
reform efforts and expect this go-round to go-round, too. The
current edition of the Moscow News has a piece whose front-page
teaser says, ``Worker Demands A Revision of the Law on State
Enterprise.''
   The worker, identified as steelmaker Mikhail Koptev, complained
in an open letter to the Supreme Soviet that there are people
putting roadblocks before the cooperative economy. Last week, the
Supreme Soviet _ always your basic rubber stamp in this one-party
society _ rebelled against a proposal to encourage cooperatives and
insisted on a shift in the tax laws that would allow employees to
keep a greater percentage of the profits.
   That's right, they were considering tax breaks.
   Tax breaks?
   It seems like curious business for Soviet communists.

   Soviet media are highlighting cases the Kremlin
perceives as U.S. human rights abuses, in an apparent bid to
counterbalance President Reagan's meeting with dissidents and
refuseniks.
   The official news agency Tass carried a critical commentary in
advance of Reagan's meeting Monday at Spaso House, quoting Deputy
Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky as saying such an action ``is
hardly aimed at improving understanding between the Soviet Union
and the United States.''
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda told its readers that
although the United States is a land of scientific and
technological marvels, it is also a land of homelessness, hunger
and repression of minorities.
   On a day when news of the summit meeting dominated the pages of
the newspaper, it printed a photograph of blacks in shabby clothes
lining up for a free Thanksgiving Day meal at Lafayette Park in
Washington, D.C., noting it was across the street from the White
House.
   On the bottom of the same page, it printed a story about Leonard
Peltier, an American Indian convicted of killing two FBI agents in
1975 at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.
   Peltier's case has been cited by Soviet officials as an example
of U.S. human rights violations. Civil rights lawyer William
Kunstler said recently that the treatment of American Indians in
the United States should be raised as a human rights issue at the
summit.
   Radio Moscow in one of its newscasts Monday mentioned a May 23
report by a panel of 40 prominent Americans that said minorities in
the United States were failing to make progress in efforts to
achieve full participation ``in the life and prosperity of the
nation.''
   Tass also publicized a news conference Monday by four Americans
who came to Moscow to speak about alleged U.S. human rights abuses
involving minorities. The four ``wanted to make human rights part
of the agenda'' at the Moscow summit and provide ``a balanced
view,'' said one of the participants, lawyer Karen Parker, in an
interview with The Associated Press.
   The Tass commentary said the Soviet government is ``seriously
concerned'' about the human rights situation in the United States,
especially ``discrimination against national minorities,
persecution of people because of their political views and the
passing of death sentences on minors.''
   It also said that ideological disputes between the superpowers
are inevitable, but ``one cannot put up with the fact that the
subject of human rights is exploited for purposes of whipping up
hostility in inter-state relations, for impeding the processes of
disarmament and detente.''
   The Soviet Peace Committee was the setting for the news
conference by the four American human rights activists, but Parker
said they all paid their own way to Moscow.
   Parker and Indian rights activist Anthony Gonzales, both of San
Francisco, said that besides Peltier, the activists wanted to
publicize the human rights cases of racial minorities, the
homeless, the hungry, institutionalized disabled people, and those
refugees and asylum-seekers who have been forcibly returned to the
country from which they fled.

<HEAD>After Reagan Meets With Dissidents, Gorbachev Cautions Against
`Sermonizing'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the end of a day in which President Reagan
demonstrated his sympathy with Soviet dissidents, Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev cautioned against ``sermonizing'' that could
sour superpower relations.
   The general secretary's comments came at a state dinner, hours
after the president's meeting with dissidents and Jewish refuseniks
drew terse comments from other Soviet officials.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman,
said those who attended the emotion-laden session with the
president at the American ambassador's home were ``not the best of
the Soviet people.''
   He dismissed a question about whether the dissidents could face
reprisals as a result of the meeting: ``I met Mr. Reagan today, but
I don't think I am going to be harmed in any way by just meeting
him.''
   Gorbachev, in his toast at the dinner for the Reagans Monday
night, said, ``We want to build contacts among people in all forms,
to expand and improve the quality of information, and to develop
ties in the spheres of science, culture, education, sports, and any
other human endeavor.''
   ``But this should be done without interfering in domestic
affairs, without sermonizing, or imposing one's views and ways,
without turning family or personal problems into a pretext for
confrontation between states,'' the Soviet leader said.
   Reagan expressed hope that his push for improvements in human
rights in the Soviet Union would get results under Gorbachev's
leadership.
   ``I've come to Moscow with this human rights agenda because, as
I suggested, it is our belief that this is a moment of hope. The
new Soviet leaders appear to grasp the connection between certain
freedoms and economic growth,'' Reagan said at Spaso house during
the meeting with dissidents and refuseniks.
   Reagan also visited the 13th century Danilov Monastery where
monks practice the Russian Orthodox faith in the communist country.
   There, he told the monks, ``The faith of your people has been
tested and tempered in the crucible of hardship. We may hope that
perestroika will be accompanied by a deeper restructuring ... and
that glasnost, which means giving voice, will also let loose a new
chorus of belief.''
   ``Our people feel it keenly when religious freedom is denied to
anyone anywhere, and hope with you that soon all the many Soviet
religious communities ... including the Ukrainian Catholic and
Orthodox Churches, will soon be able to practice their religion
freely and openly,'' he said.
   At the meeting of prominent dissidents, Reagan sat next to Abe
Stollar, the 73-year-old American who came to the Soviet Union as a
child in the 1930s and has battled since 1975 to get himself and
his family out of the Soviet Union.
   Those at his table included Lev Timofeyev, an activist released
from prison last February; Tatyana Zieman, a Jewish refusenik; the
Rev. Modris Plate, a Lutheran minister from Latvia, and Pytras
Pakenas, a Lithuanian who is married to an American but cannot
leave the country.
   Both Gerasimov and Vladimir Petrovsky, the deputy foreign
minister, said Reagan was free to do what he wanted in the Soviet
Union, but Petrovsky implied Reagan had breached protocol by seeing
the 100 or so Soviets who are at odds with their country's policies.
   Gorbachev could have seen anyone at the U.S.-Soviet summit in
Washington last December, but ``took into account all nuances'' so
the summit would be a success, Petrovsky said in remarks quoted by
the news agency Tass.
   ``The American action of this kind is hardly aimed at improving
understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States,'' he
said.
   In Washington six months ago, Gorbachev reacted heatedly when he
was pressed by newspaper editors on his stand on human rights.
Soviet officials have long told Americans to mind their own
business on the issue.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, signed autographs during the session
at which a few children roamed around the large dining room.
   ``We are not so used to hearing such human words without any
political statement,'' said Yuri Zieman, a former computer
scientist who lost his job when he applied for an exit visa 11
years ago.
   Zieman said there was no telling whether the session with Reagan
would expedite emigration. ``How do we know?''

<HEAD>Priest Can't Get Mrs. Reagan Interested In `Just Say Nyet'
Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   J.W. Canty, an American Episcopal priest working
against alcoholism and drug abuse in the Soviet Union, could not
get Nancy Reagan interested in his ``Just Say Nyet'' campaign, so
he'll try her husband.
   Canty, 41, chairman of the Soviet-U.S. Joint Conference on
Alcoholism and Drug Addiction, wants to deliver a letter to
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev asking them
to issue a joint statement on the need to fight addictions.
   ``Alcoholism and drug addiction is an extremely serious problem
in both of our countries,'' Canty's letter says. ``May history
remember these days as a summit for sobriety.''
   One question Canty thinks Gorbachev and Reagan should address is
why the cultures in the two countries seem to spawn alcoholism, a
disease which robs both societies of their human resources.
   ``Why do these two countries share these drinking problems?''
Canty asked. In both countries, Canty thinks there is a certain
``macho'' image associated with drinking.
   Canty has spent two years working on and off in the Soviet Union
setting up the conference.
   Since 1986, Canty has established an Alcoholics Anonymous
chapter in Moscow, persuaded the Moscow city government to give him
a building for a fellowship house, taken Soviet physicians on a
tour of the United States to study alcoholism and arranged for
Americans to visit the Soviet Union.
   But the White House turned down Canty's invitation to have Mrs.
Reagan visit the site of his soon-to-be-opened fellowship house.
Since 1981, Mrs. Reagan has campaigned against drugs, adopting the
slogan ``Just Say No.''
   The fellowship house in downtown Moscow will be a place for
people to meet, read in the library and see videos. ``It will be a
club to celebrate sobriety.'' he said.
   Undeterred by the reaction of Mrs. Reagan's staff, Canty decided
to solicit help from the superpower leaders in writing.
   Canty has already eaten dinner with Gorbachev and received help
from the Soviet leaders' aides who are committed to the country's
anti-drinking policy. Since he took office, Gorbachev has raised
the drinking age from 18 to 21, reduced the number of liquor stores
and cut back on the production of alcohol.
   ``Gorbachev has challenged his people to do something but the
follow-through has been a joke,'' Canty said. The Soviets say there
are officially 4.3 million alcoholics in the country of about 284
million, but Canty thinks the figure is closer to about 10 million
_ the same as in the United States.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda reported on Nov. 15, 1987 that
there are more than 4.5 million registered alcoholics in the Soviet
Union and that about 1 million of them need compulsory care. There
has been no official estimate of the number of unregistered
alcoholics.
   Though a drug problem exists in the Soviet Union, it is far less
severe than in the United States, Canty said. Drugs like cocaine
and crack are not prevalent here, but Russian women often abuse
tranquilizers and teen-agers sniff Benzene, he said.
   Canty acknowledges that people in the United States and the
Soviet Union find his efforts to reach global peace through
sobriety somewhat off-beat. But he says he has been effective.
   ``I`ve been told we are the first non-profit joint venture,'' he
said.
   The low-budget conference is funded with money from foundations
and gifts. The Soviet government has provided in-kind help such as
donating a building and paying for its doctors to travel abroad.
Canty receives no money from the U.S. government and declines to
take a salary.
   Since 1986, Canty has made seven trips to the Soviet Union, and
he has been here since January, staying at the National Hotel, a
plush historic building overlooking the Kremlin. He operates out of
his hotel room.
   The Russians seem perplexed by his ``grassroots, Scotch-tape
operation,'' he said. ``The new party line is profit, and here we
are saying, `Do this for free,''' he said.

   Dutch police on Tuesday recovered
three paintings, including works by Vincent van Gogh and Paul
Cezanne, less than two weeks after they were stolen from this
city's Municipal Museum, police said.
   Three Dutchmen were arrested when they tried to sell the
19th-century paintings in an Amsterdam hotel, said police spokesman
Klaas Wilting.
   The works, whose combined worth has been estimated at up to $52
million, were recovered undamaged, he told The Associated Press.
   The art theft was the nation's biggest ever.
   Wilting refused to disclose any further details of the hotel
transaction.
   He would also not say whether the three suspects were thought to
include the burglars who smashed a museum window and stole the
three works on May 20.
   Stolen were ``Carnations,'' a 1888 work by the Dutch painter Van
Gogh, ``Bottle with Apples,'' a still life painted in 1894 by the
French master Cezanne; and ``The House of Maitre Billaud in
Nevers,'' an 1874 painting by Dutch artist Johan Jongkind.
   Museum director Wim Beeren said at the time that the theft was
thought to have been commissioned by a private art lover, since the
paintings are virtually unsellable on the open market.
   Beeren said the record loss figure was in part due to the
astronomical prices fetched recently by Van Gogh paintings at
auctions.
   Last November, an unidentified collector paid $53 million for
Van Gogh's ``Irises'' at a New York auction.
   Eight months earlier, the impressionist master's ``Sunflowers''
was auctioned in London for $29.8 million.
   However, experts of the Christie's auction firm in London said
soon after the Amsterdam burglary that the three paintings were
worth only $11 million.
   The theft also sparked a public debate on the security of the
Dutch artistic collections. Critics said too little was being done
to protect the nation's art treasures from often highly
professional thieves.
   The pre-dawn burglary on May 20 triggered only an electronic
alarm at the museum, which has 3,200 artworks, mostly modern, but
no night guard.
   It took 20 minutes for police to arrive on the scene of the
burglary reportedly because the museum's private security company
failed to immediately alert authorities.

   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's remarks
Monday to the Soviet dissidents and refuseniks who met with him at
Spaso House.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Thank you all and welcome to Spaso House.
   After the discussions we've just had, I thought it might be
appropriate for me to begin by letting you know why I so wanted
this meeting to take place. You see, I wanted to convey to you that
you have the prayers and support of the American people, indeed, of
people throughout the world. I wanted to convey this support to you
that, you might in turn, convey it to others so that all those
working for human rights throughout this vast land, from the Urals
to Kamchatka, from the Laptev Sea to the Caspian, might be
encouraged and take heart.
   Thank you. In one capacity, of course, I speak as a head of
government. The United States views human rights as fundamental,
absolutely fundamental to our relationship with the Soviet Union
and all nations. From the outset of our administration, we've
stressed that an essential element in improving relations between
the United States and the Soviet Union is human rights and Soviet
compliance with international covenants on human rights.
   There have been hopeful signs, indeed, I believe this a hopeful
time for your nation. Over the past three years, more than 300
political and religious prisoners have been released from labor
camps, fewer dissidents and believers have been put in prisons and
mental hospitals. And in recent months, more people have been
permitted to emigrate or reunite with their families.
   The United States applauds these changes, yet the basic
standards the Soviet Union agreed to almost 13 years ago in the
Helsinki Accords, or a generation ago in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, still need to be met. If I may, I'd like to share
with you the main aims of our human rights' agenda during this
summit meeting here in Moscow.
   Freedom of religion. In the words of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, everyone has the right to freedom of thought,
conscience, and religion. I'm hopeful the Soviet government will
permit all the peoples of the Soviet Union to worship their creator
as they, themselves, see fit in liberty.
   Freedom of speech. Again in the words of the Universal
Declaration of Human rights, everyone has the right to freedom of
opinion and expression. It is my fervent hope for you and your
country that there will soon come a day when no one need fear
prison for offenses that involve nothing more than the spoken or
written word.
   Freedom of travel. I've told the General Secretary how heartened
we are that during the past year the number of those permitted to
emigrate has risen. We're encouraged, as well, that the number of
those permitted to leave for short trips, often family visits, has
gone up.
   And yet, the words of the Universal Declaration go beyond these
steps. Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his
own, and to return to his own country. It is our hope that soon
there will be complete freedom of travel.
   In my particular _ in particular I've noted in my talks here the
many who have been denied the right to emigrate on the grounds that
they held secret knowledge, even though their secret work had ended
years before, and their so-called ``secrets'' had long since become
either public knowledge or obsolete. Such cases must be rationally
reviewed.
   And finally, institutional changes to make progress permanent.
   I've come to Moscow with this human rights agenda because, as I
suggested, it is our belief that this is a moment of hope. The new
Soviet leaders appear to grasp the connection between certain
freedoms and economic growth. The freedom to keep the fruits of
one's own labor, for example, is a freedom that the present reforms
seem to be enlarging.
   We hope that one freedom will lead to another and another; that
the Soviet government will understand that it is the individual who
is always the source of economic creativity, the inquiring mind
that produces a technical breakthrough, the imagination that
conceives of new products and markets, and that in order for the
individual to create we must have a sense _ he must have a sense of
just that _ his own individuality, his own self worth. He must
sense that others respect it; and yes, that his nation respects
him, respects him enough to grant him all his human rights.
   This _ ths, as I said, is our hope, that whatever the future may
bring, the commitment of the United States will nevertheless remain
unshakeable on human rights, on the fundamental dignity of the
human person. There can be no relenting, for now we must work for
more, always more.
   And here, I would like to speak to you, not as a head of
government, but as a man, a fellow human being. I came here hoping
to do what I could to give you strength, yet I already know it is
you who have strengthened me, you who have given me a message to
carry back.
   While we press for human rights through diplomatic channels, you
press with your very lives, day in and day out, year after year,
risking your jobs, your homes, your all.
   If I may, I want to give you one thought from my heart. Coming
here and being with you and looking into your faces, I have to
believe that the history of this troubled century will indeed be
redeemed in the eyes of God and man, and that freedom will truly
come to all, for what injustice can withstand your strength, and
what can conquer your prayers?
   And so, I say with Pushkin, ``it's time my friend, it's time.
The heart begs for peace, the days fly past, it's time, it's time.''
   Could I play a little trick on you and say something that isn't
written here. Sometimes, when I'm faced with an unbeliever, an
atheist, I am tempted to invite him to the greatest gourmet dinner
that one could ever serve. And when we've finished eating that
magnificent dinner, to ask him if he believes there's a cook.
   Thank you all and God bless you.
   Nancy and I have to leave you. We're going to have a little talk
with the General Secretary.

   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's speech
Monday at the Danilov Monastery:
   __
   It's a very great pleasure to visit this beautiful monastery and
to have a chance to meet some of the people who have helped make
its return to the Russian Orthodox Church a reality. I am also
addressing in spirit the 35 million believers whose personal
contributions made this magnificent restoration possible.
   It's been said that an icon is a window between heaven and earth
through which the believing eye can peer into the beyond. One
cannot look at the magnificent icons created and recreated here
under the direction of Father Zinon without experiencing the deep
faith that lives in the hearts of the people of this land. Like the
saints and martyrs depicted in these icons, the faith of your
people has been tested and tempered in the crucible of hardship,
but in that suffering it has grown strong, ready now to embrace
with new hope the beginnings of a second Christian millennium.
   We in our country share this hope for a new age of religious
freedom in the Soviet Union. We share the hope that this monastery
is not an end in itself, but the symbol of a new policy of
religious tolerance that will extend to all peoples of all faith.
We pray that the return of this monastery signals a willingness to
return to believers the thousands of other houses of worship which
are now closed, boarded up, or used for secular purposes.
   There are many ties of faith that bind your country and mine. We
have in America many churches, many creeds that feel a special
kinship with their fellow believers here -- Protestant, Catholic,
Jewish, Orthodox, and Islamic -- they are united with believers in
this country in many ways, especially in prayer.
   Our people feel it keenly when religious freedom is denied to
anyone anywhere, and hope with you that soon all the many Soviet
religious communities that are now prevented from registering will
band all together, including the Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox
churches, will soon be able to practice their religion freely and
openly and instruct their children in and outside the home in the
fundamentals of their faith. We don't know if this first thaw will
be followed by a resurgent spring of religious liberty, we don't
know, but we may hope.
   We may hope that perestroika will be accompanied by a deeper
restructuring, a deeper conversion, a ``metenota'' -- ``metenoya,''
I should say -- a change in heart and that glasnost, which means
giving voice, will also let loose a new chorus of belief, singing
praise to the God that gave us life.
   There's a beautiful passage that I'd just like to read if I may.
It's from one of this country's great writers and believers,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, about the faith that is as elemental to
this land as the dark and fertile soil. He wrote, ``When you travel
the byroads of Central Russia, you begin to understand the secrets
of the pacifying Russian countryside. It is in the churches. They
lift their belltowers, graceful, shapely, all different, high over
mundane timber and thatch, from villages that are cutoff and
invisible to each other, they soar to the same heaven. People were
always selfish and often unkind, but the evening chimes used to
ring out, floating over the villages, fields and woods, reminding
them that they must abandon trivial concerns of this world and give
time and thought to eternity.''
   In our prayers, we may keep that image in mind. The thought that
the bells may ring again, sounding throughout Moscow and across the
countryside, clamoring for joy in their newfound freedom. Well I've
talked long enough. I'm sure you have many questions and many
things on your mind and I'm anxious to hear what you have to say.

   Here is a transcript of General Secretary Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's toast at the state dinner Monday night for President
and Mrs. Reagan.
   Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed Mrs. Reagan, ladies and
gentlemen, comrades, I welcome you in the Moscow Kremlin. For five
centuries it has been the site of events that constituted
milestones in the life of our state. Decisions crucial to the fate
of our nation were made here. The very environment around us a call
for responsibility to our times and contemporaries, to the present
and to the future. It is here that we wish to emphasize the
importance of the newly discovered truth that it is no longer
possible to settle international disputes by force of arms. Our
awareness of the realities of the present day world has led us to
that conclusion.
   I like the notion of realism, and I also like the fact that you,
Mr. President, have lately been uttering it more and more often.
Normal, and indeed durable, Soviet-American relations, which so
powerfully affect the world's political climate, are only
conceivable within the framework of realism. Thanks to realism, for
all our differences we have succeeded in arriving at a joint
conclusion which, though very simple, is of historic importance: a
nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Other
conclusions followed with inexorable logic. One of them is whether
there is any need for weapons which cannot be used without
destroying ourselves and indeed all of mankind. I believe the
realization of this became Reykjavik's pivotal idea.
   Our Warsaw Treaty allies firmly adhere to this position: this is
our powerful support in all matters related to nuclear disarmament.
They have given the Soviet leadership a clear mandate to negotiate
radical nuclear arms limitations and reductions with the United
States. My talks with leaders of Socialist countries, and with
authoritative representatives of other nations, make it clear to me
that there is a common desire to overcome military confrontation
and to end the race in both nuclear and conventional arms.
   To this it should be added that a realistic approach is making a
way for itself in all directions and on all continents. And the
idea of resolving today's problems solely by political means is
gaining increasing authority. There is an ever-broadening desire of
the most diverse political and social forces for dialogue, for
exchanges, for a better knowledge of each other, and for mutual
understanding. If this is indeed so, if this is the will of the
peoples, an effort is needed to ensure that the stocks of the
ferment of realistic policies keep growing and never run out. For
that it is essential to understand each other better; to take into
account the specific features of life in various countries, the
historical conditions that shape them and the choice made by their
peoples. I recall the words you once spoke, Mr. President, and I
quote, ``the only way to resolve differences is to understand
them,'' unquote. How very true. Let me just add that seeking to
resolve differences should not mean an end to being different. The
diversity of the world is a powerful wellspring of mutual
enrichment, both spiritual and material.
   Ladies and gentlemen, comrades, the word ``perestroika'' does
not sound anachronistic even within these ancient walls, for
renewal of society, humanization of life, and elevated ideals are
at all times and everywhere in the interests of the people and of
each individual. And when this happens, especially in a great
country, it is important to understand the meaning of what it is
going through. It is this desire to understand the Soviet Union
that we are now seeing abroad. And we regard this as a good sign,
because we do want to be understood correctly. This is also
important for civilized international relations. Everyone who wants
to do business with us will find it useful to know how Soviet
people see themselves. We see ourselves even more convinced that
our socialist choice was correct, and we cannot conceive of our
country developing without socialism, based on any other
fundamental values. Our program is more democracy, more glasnost,
more social justice with full prosperity and high moral standards.
Our goal is maximum freedom for man, for the individual, and for
society.
   Internationally, we see ourselves as part of an integral
civilization where each has the right to a social and political
choice, to a worthy and equal place within the community of
nations. On issues of peace and progress, we believe in the primacy
of universal human values and regard the preservation of peace as
the top priority. And that is why we advocate the establishment of
a comprehensive system of international security as a condition for
the survival of mankind.
   Linked with this is also our desire to revive and enhance the
role of the United Nations on the basis of the original goals which
the Soviet Union and the United States, together with their allies,
enshrined in the charter of that organization. Its very name is
symbolic _ the United Nations _ united in their determination to
prevent new tragedies of war, to banish war from international
relations, and to affirm just principles securing a worthy life for
any nation, whether large or small, strong or weak, rich or poor.
We want to build contacts among people in all forms, to expand and
improve the quality of information, and to develop ties in the
spheres of science, culture, education, sports, and any other human
endeavor. But this should be done without interfering in domestic
affairs, without sermonizing, or imposing one's views and ways,
without turning family or personal problems into a pretext for
confrontation between states. In short, our time offers great scope
for action in the humanitarian field. Nations should understand
each other better, know the truth about each other, and free
themselves from bias and prejudice.

   As far as we know, most Americans, just like us, want to get rid
of the demon of nuclear war. But they, just like us, just like all
people on earth, are becoming increasingly concerned over the risk
of environmental disaster. Such a risk can only be averted if we
act together.
   Increasingly urgent is the truly global problem of the economic
state of the world -- in the North and South, in the West and East
of this planet. The economic foundation of civilization will be
destroyed unless a way is found to put an end to the squandering of
funds and resources for war and destruction, unless the problem of
debt is settled and world finances are stabilized, unless the world
market becomes truly worldwide by incorporating all states and
nations on an equal footing.
   It is across this spectrum of issues that we approach
international affairs and, of course, our relations with the United
States of America. We are motivated by an awareness of the
realities and imperatives of the nuclear and space age _ the age of
sweeping technological revolution, when the human race had turned
out to be both omnipotent and mortal. It was this awareness that
engendered the new thinking which has made possible a conceptual
and practical breakthrough in relations between us as well.
   Mr. President, this meeting, while taking stock of a
fundamentally important period in Soviet-American relations, has to
consolidate our achievements and give new impetus for the future.
Never before have nuclear missile been destroyed. Now we have an
unprecedented treaty, and our two countries will be performing for
the first time ever this overture of nuclear disarmament. The
performance had to be flawless. The Soviet Union and the United
States are acting as guarantors of the Afghan political settlement.
This too, is a precedent of tremendous importance. As guarantors,
our two countries face a very responsible period, and we hope they
both will go through it in a befitting manner. The whole world is
watching to see how we are going to act in this situation. Our main
task continues to be the working out of an agreement on 50-percent
reductions in strategic offensive arms while observing the ABM
Treaty. In our talks today, you and I devoted a lot of attention
and with good cause to discussing the entire range of these
problems.
   Mr. President, we are expected to ensure that the Moscow summit
open up new horizons in Soviet-American dialogue, in relations
between the USSR and the US, for the benefit of our two nations and
the entire world. This is worth any effort and any amount of good
will.
   To cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of
America, to their better mutual knowledge and mutual understanding.
I wish good health and happiness to you, Mr. President, to Mrs.
Nancy Reagan, and to all our distinguished guests.

<HEAD>Reagans Dine in Kremlin Splendor, Tour Gorbachevs' Guest Rooms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagans dined on champagne and caviar in the
citadel of communism. The Gorbachevs set aside their campaign
against drinking to serve the best of Russian wines. The evening
sun poured through floor-to-ceiling windows.
   All glittered when the Gorbachevs played host to the visiting
American president and his wife in the icon-lavished splendor of
the Kremlin's Hall of Facets, then led them on a tour toured the
fortress's private rooms where they could have stayed as guests if
they had wished.
   The Gorbachevs' state dinner Monday night under the vaulted,
frescoed ceilings of the opulent chamber drew the entire Communist
Party hierarchy and a select group of Moscow intellectuals,
scientists, a cosmonaut and Russian Orthodox clergy.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. and President Reagan lifted their
crystal glasses of Georgian wine to toast their success in
narrowing the gap between the superpowers and to wish for future
triumphs in learning to deal with and respect each other.
   The elegant dining hall was awash in light, from the windows
letting in the late spring evening sunshine and the fully
illuminated chandeliers that adorn the hall.
   Silver candlesticks raising tall white tapers and sprays of pink
roses decorated tables spread with salmon pink linen.
   The Kremlin pomp was more subtle than December's White House
state dinner for the visiting Gorbachevs, where the women wore
formal-length gowns and the American men sported black-tie attire.
   At that occasion, Gorbachev and his advisers showed up in
business suits, causing eyebrows to lift in social circles.
   On the occasion of the Reagans' visit, the hosts set aside their
anti-alcohol inclinations to treat their guests to domestic wines,
champagne and cognac from the southern republics of Georgia and
Armenia, to go with a dinner that began with caviar, turkey fillets
and puff pastry and progressed through soups and courses of veal
and perch.
   The president gave Gorbachev a video cassette of an American
film, ``Friendly Persuasion,'' regaling the mostly Soviet gathering
with a lengthy description of the Civil War story but promising not
to ``spoil its outcome.''
   Fourteen Americans were invited to the state dinner, including
Secretary of State George Shultz, U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock and
Reagan's senior advisers.
   Among the Soviet guests were all members of the ruling Politburo
except Vladimir Shcherbitsky, who is based in the Ukrainian capital
of Kiev. The guests included space scientist Roald Sagdeyev,
filmmaker Elem Klimov, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and a
host of party officials.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, in a sequined blouse and black skirt, listened
attentively at Reagan's side while her husband told his guests
their two nations had made history with the accord ridding the
world of an entire class of weapons.
   ``Now we have an unprecedented treaty. And our countries will
have to perform for the first time an overture of nuclear
disarmament,'' the Soviet leader said. ``The performance should be
faultless.''
   Gorbachev also pointed to the U.S. and Soviet role as guarantors
of the Afghan accords signed in Geneva on April 14, noting their
cooperation is of ``immense significance'' for their future.
   ``The entire world is watching how we both will act in this
situation,'' Gorbachev said.
   In his response, Reagan focused on the accomplishments he and
Gorbachev have been able to achieve in their four meetings since
1985.
   ``These are good first steps, Mr. General Secretary, and we can
both take pride in them,'' Reagan said, as the first lady, in a red
print dress and heavy gold necklace, listened from Gorbachev's
rose-strewn table.
   The Reagans stayed at the Kremlin for more than an hour after
the dinner for a tour by their hosts of the Grand Kremlin Palace's
private rooms, where former President Richard M. Nixon stayed
during his 1972 and 1974 summits here.
   ``They were quite lovely and the entire palace was really quite
magnificent,'' Mrs. Reagan said, according to her press secretary,
Elaine Crispen.
   U.S. industrialist Armand Hammer, whose ties with the Soviets
reach back to the days of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin's
leadership, described the state dinner as ``a very warm and happy
occasion.''

   A small boat carrying eight people
capsized Monday during a Memorial Day outing, killing six women
aboard and a man who tried to rescue them, authorities said.
   The operator of the boat was able to swim ashore and one person
on the craft was rescued, authorities said.
   The seven bodies were recovered from the 25-acre Lake Tillatoba
on Monday night, said authorities, who were unsure how the accident
occurred.
   Yalobusha County Coroner Stanley True identified the victims,
all of Coffeville, as Eddie Rounds, 41; Janice Martin, 20; her
cousins Anna Martin, 21, and Martin's sister, Marlee, 20; Sherry
Taylor, 21; Sandra Baker, 24; and Sherry Jenkins, 19.
   True said the women were passengers in a 16-foot, flat-bottom
aluminum boat piloted by Robert Armstrong, also of Coffeville.
Armstrong was able to swim ashore after the boat capsized, said
True. Rounds drowned when he attempted to help the women, True
said. Melvin Pernell, who also was on the boat, was rescued by a
fisherman, Armstrong said.
   The coroner said there were no life jackets on the craft.
   The boat was designed to hold up to five people, said Deputy
Sheriff Homer Melton.
   The Sheriff's Department said rescue workers, including divers,
were called to the lake shortly after 4 p.m.
   Officials said the victims' bodies were recovered by crews who
dragged the lake.
   The lake is located off Mississippi Highway 330 between the
towns of Tillatoba and Coffeeville in north-central Mississippi.

<HEAD>Brubeck to Test the Jazz Waters with the Gorbachevs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nikita Khrushchev used to say jazz gave him gas,
but no one seems to know what effect it has on Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Tonight, pianist Dave Brubeck plans to find out when he gives
the general secretary and his wife Raisa a taste of ``Take Five''
and other American jazz classics.
   One thing is for sure, says Brubeck: the Reagans like jazz. They
have chosen him to perform with his quintet at a state dinner for
the Gorbachevs at Spaso House, the U.S. ambassador's residence
where the Reagans are staying during the summit.
   ``The Reagans really seem to appreciate American music in
general. Nancy seems to know all the standards. You can see her
mouthing the words,'' the gray-haired 67-year-old Brubeck said in
an interview Monday.
   As for the president, a former Hollywood actor, Brubeck recalled
that at a Feb. 21 performance at the White House for governors,
``He told me how much he loved the big bands and how much they were
a part of American history.''
   Brubeck is no stranger to the halls of power. He was the first
jazz musician to play at the White House and has entertained every
president since John F. Kennedy.
   He met the Gorbachevs but didn't have a chance to talk to them
or play for them at the previous summit state dinner at the White
House last December. That dinner produced one of the most memorable
moments of the Washington summit _ the Gorbachevs singing along as
the American classical pianist Van Cliburn played the Russian
standard ``Moscow Nights.''
   Asked if he would follow in Van Cliburn's footsteps with the
dixieland jazz version of the song, renamed ``Midnight in Moscow,''
Brubeck said: ``We're prepared to play it if someone asks, but it's
been done so many times.''
   But in typical Brubeckian manner, if it's played, it'll be with
a twist, in five-four rhythm. ``It can be done,'' he assured a
doubting reporter.
   In honor of the occasion, Brubeck has dug up ``The Real
Ambassadors,'' a song he wrote in 1958 for a musical that featured
trumpeter Louis Armstrong running the world for a day.
   Although the Gorbachevs won't hear it because Brubeck plans to
play only an instrumental version of the song, one line speaks of
Armstrong using music to bring peace: ``The next time around, it's
a session where we jam the blues. Khrushchev pounding both his
shoes couldn't have the final say if I was king for a day.''
   Khrushchev, who pounded a shoe on a desk at the United Nations
in 1960, was no jazz lover. ``When I hear jazz, it's as if I had
gas on the stomach,'' he said in December 1963.
   At the other extreme, Yuri Andropov, the former KGB chief who
led the Soviet Union from November 1982 until his death in February
1984, was reputed to be a jazz fan.
   But although Mrs. Gorbachev has showed up at several classical
music concerts, little is known about the Kremlin couple's musical
tastes.
   ``I keep asking everyone if Gorbachev likes jazz, but no one
seems to know,'' says Brubeck's 36-year-old son Chris, who plays
bass guitar and trombone in the group. ``They all say Andropov
liked jazz and had a huge record collection.''
   The elder Brubeck, who says he's played in most countries of the
world, from ``the dance halls to all the joints'' during his
50-year career, believes jazz is a unique medium for espousing the
American ideal of freedom.
   ``To play jazz, you have to have tremendous discipline and you
are expected to use it in a free way. There's no art form that
represents America better than jazz,'' he said.
   And to many jazz lovers, there is no single jazz standard better
known than ``Take Five,'' Brubeck's 1958 tune that was the first
jazz single to go gold.
   The Wilton, Conn., resident gave Soviets who had heard him only
on Voice of America shortwave broadcasts and records a chance to
hear him in person in March and April of last year. He played 13
concerts in Moscow, Leningrad and Tallinn, the capital of Soviet
Estonia.
   The Soviet record label Melodiya plans to release a recording
from last year's tour. It has already come out in the United
States, under the title ``Moscow Night.''

   Paul Newman, awarded an honorary
doctorate by Yale University, had some advice for graduates about
the importance of uncertainty.
   ``Just try to keep yourself off balance. Never know what you're
doing the next day and you'll be all right,'' Newman said Monday
after Yale's 287th commencement.
   Newman, an actor, director and philanthropist, attended the Yale
School of Drama in 1951.
   ``In the midst of a demanding career you dedicate a large
portion of your great gifts to the service of others,'' Yale
President Benno C. Schmidt Jr. told Newman is bestowing doctorate
of humane letters on the actor.
   Newman said after the ceremony that he was ``honored, very
honored'' with the award.
   Newman will soon dedicate a summer camp for seriously ill
children that is being funded in large part by proceeds from his
food company, Newman's Own Inc. The Connecticut company gives all
its profits to charity. Yale is helping to support the camp by
providing medical services and advice.

<HEAD>In a Land Officially Atheistic, Religious Faith Arises Anew</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Religious faith in the Soviet Union is reviving
slowly in a land where state-imposed atheism has long held sway.
   But it is a slow emergence, and the church hierarchy is cautious.
   As evidence that the atmosphere is changing, church, state and
party officials cite the return to the church of the 13th century
Danilov Monastery, the promise of a new law relaxing Stalin-era
restrictions on worship and the release from prison and labor camps
of religious dissidents.
   The dissidents cautiously agree. Still they have asked President
Reagan to join them in prayer Wednesday for an estimated 200 people
they say still are prisoners because of the beliefs.
   Reagan, in a visit to Moscow's oldest monastery Monday, paid
tribute to the Orthodox faith that next week will mark its 1,000th
anniversary.
   ``Religious life still is strictly regulated by the Stalinist
legislation on cults, which deprives us of the possibility of
uniting in religious community without barriers, to own houses of
worship, study and distribute the Bible, and teach our children in
Sunday school,'' seven religious dissidents said in a statement to
Reagan.
   ``We ask you to give us the great honor of your presence at a
joint prayer for the freeing of prisoners of faith,'' they said.
   Dissidents, led by former political prisoners Father Gleb
Yakunin and layman Alexander Ogorodnikov and others, also seek
recognition for the underground Ukrainian Catholic Church and
return to the Orthodox Church of the Pechersky monastery in Kiev,
the country's oldest.
   Reagan told monks at the Danilov monastery that he hoped the
church bells silenced by repression might someday be ``clamoring
for joy in their newfound freedom.'' He did not say whether he
could accept their invitation.
   He expressed the hope that Ukrainian Catholic believers and
others might soon be able to openly practice their faith.
   Orthodoxy, for centuries the dominant faith of Russia, was
closely identified with the czarist government and suffered severe
repression after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
   Tens of thousands of churches were destroyed or converted to
government use, priests were exiled or killed, and in 1927 under
dictator Josef V. Stalin authorities passed strict laws prohibiting
charitable activities, religious education of the young and
requiring registration of all religious organizations with the
government.
   Those strictures remain in force today.
   In a meeting with Patriarch Pimen of Moscow and All Russia on
April 29, Soviet Communist Party leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
criticized the ``tragic developments'' of the Stalin years and
promised to ease restrictions on the church in the new legislation
that is being developed.
   Pimen pledged ``full support to ... the architect of perestroika
and the herald of new political thinking.'' The meeting between the
ailing church leader and Gorbachev, the son of a religious farm
woman, was the first of its kind since 1943.
   There is no official count of believers in the Soviet Union, but
the number is thought to be in the tens of millions, perhaps as
many as 90 million including Jews and Moslems.
   Besides the Orthodox church, Soviet Christians include Eastern
Rite and Roman Catholics, and Baptists, Pentacostalists and other
Protestants. Some members of those groups fear that the easing of
restrictions on the Orthodox church will not extend to them.
   The majority of churchgoers still are middle-age or older, but
young people are increasingly attending services. Orthodox priests
say they receive many requests to be baptized by young people who
know little about the faith, but are searching for something to
give meaning to their lives.
   In news conferences and interviews with the official press,
church officials recently have for the first time cautiously
criticized the existing laws and expressed confidence that the new
legislation will ease the restrictions.
   Some prominent Soviets, such as historian Dmitri Likhachev, have
come to the defense of the church, publicly praising its
contribution to the unification of the Russian state and the
development of art and culture.
   Yakunin earlier this year called for Pimen to step down as
patriarch, saying the Orthodox church needed a more active leader
to take advantage of Gorbachev's policies.
   But others, such as Ogorodnikov, are deeply suspicious of the
entire church hierarchy and believe that any official must be
thoroughly compromised to reach a prominent church position.

   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's toast
at Monday night's state dinner at the Kremlin.
   Mr. General Secretary, I want to thank you again for the
hospitality that we've encountered this evening, and at every turn
since our arrival in Moscow. We appreciate deeply the personal
effort that you and Mrs. Gorbachev and all of your associates have
expended on our behalf.
   Today has been a busy day. I want to thank you for the
opportunity to meet with so many divergent members of Soviet
society. As you know, I traveled to Danilov and met there with the
clergy of that ancient monastery, and later in the day had the most
interesting exchanges with other members of Soviet society as Spaso
House. These meetings only confirmed, Mr. General Secretary, the
feelings of admiration and warmth that Americans harbor for the
peoples of the Soviet Union.
   As wartime allies, we came to know you in a special way. But in
a broader sense, the American people, like the rest of the world,
admire the saga of the peoples of the Soviet Union, the clearing of
the forest, the struggle to build a society, the evolution into a
modern state, and the struggle against Hitler's armies.
   There are other ways too, that we know you. ``Happy or sad my
beloved, you are beautiful,'' says one of your folksongs, ``as
beautiful as a Russian song, as beautiful as a Russian soul.'' As
expressed in the great music, architecture, art, we need only look
about us this evening. And literature, that over many centuries,
you've given the world, we have beheld the beauty and majesty of
your peoples' national experience. And without belittling the
serious business before us or the fundamental issues that separate
our governments, I hope you'll permit me tonight, to say that in
the eyes of the American people, your people truly are as the song
_ the folksong suggests, a people of heart and mind, a people _ to
use our vernacular _ with soul. And that's why we believe there is
common ground between our two peoples and why it is our duty to
find common ground for our two governments.
   Over the next three days, General Secretary Gorbachev and I will
review what has been accomplished over the past three years and
what our two nations might accomplish together in the months to
come. We have a great deal to discuss on both accounts. What we
have achieved is a good beginning. We have taken the first step
toward deep reductions of our nuclear arsenals. We have taken the
first step toward dealing with the reality that much of the tension
and mistrust between our two countries arises from the very
different concepts of the fundamental rights and role of the
individual in society. We have taken the first step to build that
network of personal relationships and understanding between
societies, between people, that are crucial to dispelling dangerous
misconceptions and stereotypes.
   These are good first steps, Mr. General Secretary, and we can
both take pride in them. But, as I said, they are just a start.
Nuclear arsenals remain too large. The fighting continues
needlessly, tragically, in too many regions of the globe. The
vision of freedom and cooperation enshrined in the Helsinki Final
Act remains unrealized. The American and Soviet peoples are getting
to know each better, but not well enough.
   Mr. General Secretary, you and I are meeting now for the fourth
time in three years _ a good deal more often than our predecessors.
And this has allowed our relationship to differ from theirs in more
than a quantitative state or sense. We have established the kind of
working relationship I think we both had in mind when we first met
in Geneva. We've been candid about our differences, but sincere in
sharing a common objective and working hard together to draw closer
to it. It's easy to disagree, and much harder to find areas where
we can agree. We and our two governments have both gotten into the
habit of looking for those areas. We found more than we expected. I
intend to pursue the search for common ground during the months
left to me as president. When I pass the job on to my successor, I
intend to tell him it is a search that must be continued. Based on
the achievements of the last few years, I will also tell him it is
a search that can succeed.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says He'll Offer Jackson A Role In Likely Fall Campaign</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis
promised black supporters he would give Jesse Jackson a role in his
expected fall campaign against George Bush, and said he was
counting on Jackson's support.
   ``We're going to have as united a Democratic Party as we've ever
had,'' Dukakis said after a Memorial Day breakfast with about 90
black supporters from across the country.
   ``I do not see any deep divisions'' with Jackson, he said after
the session.
   ``Neither of us wants four more years of what we've had the past
eight,'' said the Massachusetts governor.
   The meeting was closed to the media but described by
participants as a frank and cordial discussion of what Dukakis
needs to do to win the support of Jackson's black constituency.
   Jackson himself, campaigning in New Jersey, said he didn't want
his support ``isolated by race.'' But he spoke kindly of Dukakis'
overtures to the black community.
   ``He has an obligation to reach out,'' said Jackson.
   Dukakis also attended a Memorial Day service and met at the
Statehouse with Argentine President Raul Alfonsin. The two met two
years ago when Alfonsin was in Massachusetts and they exchanged
warm greetings after the private meeting.
   Dukakis was to tend to state business today and attend
receptions in Baltimore tonight.
   He was to be back at the Statehouse Wednesday before heading to
California, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana in the week left
until the June 7 primaries in those states, which are expected to
give Dukakis a lock on the nomination.
   Although participants in the Monday gathering were unanimous in
predicting Jackson would support Dukakis in the fall, the session
was designed partly to plot strategy for seeking black support
regardless of Jackson's role.
   ``He showed his compassion and his understanding of the plight
of black Americans,'' former New Orleans Mayor Dutch Morial said.
And he said Dukakis' affirmative action record as governor and his
commitments to economic opportunity, health care and housing would
appeal to black voters.
   ``The record is an excellent one,'' said Thomasina Reed of Los
Angeles, a potential Dukakis delegate.
   Participants said Dukakis promised to offer some Jackson
campaign aides jobs in the fall campaign and also promised that
blacks and other minorities would have major roles in a Dukakis
administration.
   ``Very clearly the presence of black Americans in this campaign
is going to have to be expanded,'' said Charlene Drew Jarvis, a
member of the District of Columbia City Council. ``We got that
commitment from today from Mike Dukakis.''
   Dukakis was not specific about what role he believed Jackson
should have. He is not expected to offer Jackson the No. 2 spot on
the ticket.
   ``What kind of role would I play if I came in second and he came
in first?'' Dukakis asked rhetorically. ``I would be out there
working for a Democratic victory.''
   Jackson, too, said he expected to have ``a big role at the
convention and a big role this fall,'' but added: ``That role has
not been determined.''
   Longtime Dukakis supporter Joseph Warren, who organized the
meeting, said black Dukakis supporters with ties to Jackson aides
would hold frequent talks with them in the month leading into the
July convention.

   Once again, Mr. General Secretary, I want to extend my thanks
for your hospitality. I also hope you'll permit me to mention that,
as you have been a gracious host, we've tried to be gracious guests
by bringing along some small expressions of our gratitude. There's
one gift in particular that I wanted to mention, not only in view
of my own former profession, but because it has, I think, something
important to say to us about what is under way this week in Moscow.
It is a film _ not as well known as some, but an American classic.
It is a powerfully acted and directed story of family and romantic
love, of devotion to the land, and dedication to higher principle.
It is also fun. It has humor. There's a renegade goose, a
mischievous young boy, a noisy neighbor, a love-struck teen-ager in
love with a gallant soldier, an adolescent struggling for manhood,
a loving, highly principled wife, and a gentle but strong father.
It's about the good and sometimes difficult things that happen
between man and wife and parent and child. The film also has sweep
and majesty and power and pathos. For you see, it takes place
against the backdrop of our American epic, the civil war. And
because the family is of the Quaker religion and renounces
violence, each of its characters must, in his or her own way, face
this war and the moral dilemma it poses. The film shows not just
the tragedy of war, but the problems of pacifism, the nobility of
patriotism, as well as the love of peace. I promise not to spoil
its outcome for you. But I hope you'll permit me to describe one
scene. Just as the invading armies come into southern Indiana, one
of our states, the Quaker farmer is approached by two of his
neighbors. One is also a Quaker, who earlier in the story, when
times are peaceful, denounces violence and vows never to lift his
hand in anger. But now that the enemy has burned his barn, he's on
his way to battle and criticizes his fellow Quaker for not joining
him in renouncing his religious beliefs. The other visitor, also on
his way to battle, is the intruding but friendly neighbor. Yet it
is this neighbor, although a nonbeliever who says he's proud of the
Quaker farmers' decision not to fight, in the face of the tragedy
of war, he is grateful, as he says, that somebody's holding out for
a better way of settling things.
   It seems to me, Mr. General Secretary, that in pursing these
summit meetings, we too have been holding out for a better way of
settling things. And by the way, the film's title is more than a
little appropriate _ it's called ``Friendly Persuasion.''
   So, Mr. General Secretary, allow me to raise a glass to the work
that has been done, the work that remains to be done. And let us
also toast the art of friendly persuasion, the hope of peace with
freedom, the hope of holding out for a better way of settling
things.
   Thank you, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Study: Afghanistan Unable To Support Return Of Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The war-ravaged Afghan countryside
could not feed the country's millions of civil war refugees if they
were to return immediately, a new study on the state of Afghan
agriculture says.
   ``There was deliberate destruction of the agricultural system by
the Russians, particularly along the highways,'' Professor Azam
Gul, an Afghan citizen who directed the six-month study, told a
news conference Monday.
   ``If the refugees returned en masse now, the land would not
support them. That is the categorical conclusion of the survey,''
said Tom Morrison of the Britain-based Agrisystems, which trained
the researchers and collated the data.
   Gul said the devastation had occurred mainly since Soviet troops
intervened in 1979 to back the government in its war with
anti-communist guerrillas. Villages were systematically bombed and
trees destroyed around Soviet bases, he said.
   The Soviets are in the process of withdrawing their more than
100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan under a U.N.-sponsored accord
signed in April. The pullout is to be completed in February.
   The guerrillas, who launched their insurgency after a Communist
coup in 1978, have said they will keep up the war until the
government of President Najib is defeated.
   Gul said agricultural production in 1986 fell to 45 percent of
the level in 1978, the year before the Soviet intervention. Good
rains last spring brought production up to 53 percent of its 1978
level, he said.
   The survey said it will take at least three years and $4 billion
to restore cropland and livestock affected by 10 years of fighting
in Afghanistan. Other officials have said such reconstruction could
take 10 to 20 years.
   Farmers told the researchers that the Afghan army burned crops
and shot cattle and sheep, sometimes from helicopter gunships.
   Hundreds of farmers said more than five animals a year in their
herds were blown up by land mines, according to the report.
   Other farmers told researchers they sold livestock to pay for
food or transportation out of the country.
   The Swedish-financed survey was conducted by a team of Afghan
researchers who returned to their home areas to question 20,000
farmers. The results are designed to help aid projects and resettle
more than 5 million refugees after Soviet troops leave Afghanistan.
   The 68-page report says food production improved in 1986 after
the U.S.-supplied guerrillas received anti-aircraft missiles,
``providing a protective umbrella and allowing agricultural
operations to continue during daytime.''
   Gul said the survey was conducted only in guerrilla-held areas
but included all 29 provinces. At least two of the 68 researchers
escaped an ambush by government troops and another was captured and
imprisoned. Six who were sent to remote provinces still have not
reported back, Gul said.
   The researchers used questionnaires to collect details on war
damage, crop yields, irrigation and use of fertilizers.
   The results showed that among farmers who fled Afghanistan in
1987, 42 percent reported their cattle, sheep or goats had been
shot to death or killed by mines, and 65 percent of the farmers
said their crops were burned.
   The report recommended a phased return of the refugees timed to
the distribution of food aid and the rebuilding of the Afghan
farms. Most of the refugees have fled to Pakistan or Iran.
   Reconstruction will be slow, said Morrison. ``It's not only a
question of money. It's a matter of time just for oxen to
reproduce. You need three years to produce high quality seed,'' he
said.
   Political obstacles also will delay rehabilitation, said Anders
Fange of the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan, which paid for the
$870,000 project.
   ``No matter what kind of government there will be, it will be
very weak,'' said Fange, who is based in the refugee camps at
Peshawar, Pakistan.
   Fragmentation of authority between the government and local
guerrilla commanders will make the distribution of aid extremely
complicated, he said.

<HEAD>INS Gets Tough Wednesday on Employers Who Hire Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After today, there'll be no more automatic
warnings for businesses that hire illegal aliens. Instead, they
face stiff fines from a no-longer-forgiving Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   From the loftiest Fortune 500 company to the smallest corner
grocery store, companies tempted to look the other way when aliens
apply could find themselves hit where it hurts _ the company
coffers.
   Employers who violate the 1986 law barring the hiring of illegal
immigrants now automatically get warning citations for the first
offense. But on June 1, INS has the discretion to issue a citation
or a fine.
   It is a system that has worked in Europe, and many feel it
offers the best hope to curb illegal immigration and transfer jobs
from aliens to U.S. citizens.
   But others worry about possible exploitation of illegal workers,
discrimination against foreign-appearing workers, the impact on the
labor force and the dangers of turning employers into immigration
police.
   Employers face fines of up to $1,000 for improper documentation,
up to $2,000 per alien for a first offense of knowingly hiring an
illegal alien, up to $5,000 per alien for the second offense,
$10,000 for subsequent offenses, and $3,000 or six months in jail
for a ``pattern or practice'' of violation.
   Over the past year, INS fined 80 businesses $350,000 and issued
2,000 citations. The agency thus views the new phase not as a
dramatic crackdown, but as a nudge to employers.
   ``Our intent is not to indiscriminately run around fining
employers. The intent is to encourage employers to validate their
work force,'' says INS spokesman Duke Austin. ``It'll be a
deliberate implementation of the law.''
   Austin says the agency will use its resources ``judiciously,''
targeting the construction, garment and hotel and service
industries that have traditionally been repositories of illegal
workers.
   In Europe, where many countries adopted employer sanctions a
decade ago, the system did not trigger widespread job
discrimination against foreigners, according to a 1987 study by the
Center for Immigration Studies, a private think tank that
researches immigration trends.
   Virginia Lamp Thomas, labor attorney for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, says businesses are ``afraid that the law has significant
teeth in it.''
   The chamber is conducting a survey to determine how the law is
working. Some experts have made preliminary assessments.
   ``Employer sanctions will probably work best in the larger firms
and will work least effectively as you get down to the mom and pop
enterprises that don't pay much anyhow and need the cheap (illegal)
labor to survive,'' says David Simcox, director of the Center for
Immigration Studies.
   The amnesty phase of the 1986 law, in which illegal aliens who
came to the United States before 1982 could apply for temporary
residency, enlarged the pool of legal workers available for
low-paying jobs.
   Employers ``have got the windfall of having additional pools of
low-wage workers, which means they don't have to modernize or raise
wages in order to make jobs more attractive,'' says Vernon M.
Briggs Jr., a labor economist at Cornell University.
   The potential for worker exploitation concerns civil liberties
advocates.
   The law ``grandfathered'' in workers who had jobs on Nov. 6,
1986, the date it was passed. That means that employers did not
have to ask those workers for documents, although illegal workers
in that category remain subject to deportation if caught by INS.
Now, the worry is that those workers can be trapped in their jobs
with no redress against an unscrupulous employer.
   There is also the issue of job discrimination. The law bars
employers from refusing to hire someone because of their national
origin or, in the case of someone who has taken steps to become a
citizen, his citizenship status. It sets up a special Justice
Department counsel to prosecute complaints.
   But the law also allows employers to hire U.S. citizens over
non-citizens ``if the two individuals are equally qualified.''
   ``That's going to make it even more difficult to prove
discrimination. `Equally qualified' is to a certain degree
subjective,'' says Mario Moreno, of the Mexican-American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, which provides legal assistance to
Mexican-Americans and others involved in employment discrimination
suits or complaints.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative branch of
Congress, last fall found little evidence that employers were
discriminating against foreign-looking job applicants because of
the new law. But those findings are only preliminary.

<HEAD>Analyst Suggests Separate Bureau For Environmental Statistics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's environmental statistics are a
disgrace, with billion-dollar decisions turning on the readings of
a handful of monitoring instruments, says a veteran Washington
environmental analyst calling for a Bureau of Environmental
Statistics.
   Such a bureau could direct attention and spending to needed
areas, avoid costly unnecessary programs and keep bureaucrats
honest, writes Paul Portney, vice president of Resources for the
Future and director of the organization's Center for Risk
Management. The group studies environmental policy but does not
engage in lobbying.
   ``We currently do a disgraceful job of collecting, analyzing and
disseminating information about environmental conditions and
trends,'' Portney said in a paper written for his organization and
distributed last week.
   Linda Fisher, assistant administrator for policy and planning at
the Environmental Protection Agency, said Portney had a good idea.
EPA, she said, collects ``tons of statistics'' under its
regulations, but ``we are only beginning to think about'' how
data-gathering should be organized and who should do it.
   Environmental statistics are gathered by EPA, the U.S.
Geological Survey, the Forest Service, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
the Food and Drug Administration and several other parts of the
government.
   Government simply could not work without the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Census Bureau, the
Energy Information Administration and other respected, professional
statistics agencies, Portney said.
   An annual report of the president pulls together 100 different
economic data series dating back to 1929. For the environment, no
one puts it all together, even though the Council on Environmental
Quality, a White House agency severely downgraded by the Reagan
Administration, is charged by statute with collecting and
publishing environmental statistics.
   ``Even in its halcyon days, however, the CEQ was never able to
muster the resources to present truly comprehensive and consistent
environmental data on an annual basis,'' Portney said.
   Portney guessed that $200 million a year is spent on economic
statistics, ``very small in comparison to the $75 billion or more
that we spend to comply with EPA regulations alone.''
   He said he did not know what his proposed bureau should spend or
where it should be placed, but it should have statutory
independence like the Energy Information Administration in the
Energy Department.
   ``If the Bureau of Environmental Statistics were a separate line
in EPA's annual budget, appropriations for data collection and
analysis could not easily by siphoned off. This now happens
regularly when the program offices in whose budgets monitoring
funds are now included are given additional regulatory
responsibilities for which no funds are available,'' Portney wrote.
   EPA judges compliance with some clean air standards by peak
one-hour readings from the highest-reading monitor in an area.
Sanctions, rare so far, could cost an area hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   ``The temptation to shut monitors down at strategic times for
maintenance or to relocate them to more `convenient' sites could be
considerable,'' Portney wrote.
   ``While there is no evidence to suggest that our national air
quality data have been compromised in this way, it is only now that
the non-attainment sanctions have become a serious possibility. A
credible, independent federal presence is badly needed to guard
against this possibility.''
   Several reports suggest that in checking compliance with
55-miles per hour speed limit, states played similar games to avoid
loss of highway aid _ locating radar guns on hills, in congested
areas and so forth so that reported speeds would be low and
unrepresentative of actual speeds.

   A boat carrying eight people capsized
during a Memorial Day outing, killing six young women aboard the
overloaded craft and a man who tried to rescue them, authorities
said.
   The operator of the 16-foot, aluminum boat was able to swim
ashore and one person on the craft was rescued, authorities said.
   The operator, Robert Armstrong, 32, said the boat's occupants
were on a slow ``joy ride,'' splashing water on each other when the
accident occurred the on Lake Tillatoba on Monday afternoon.
   ``One girl leaned over when the boat was turning and some water
started coming in the boat and everybody panicked,'' said
Armstrong, who acknowledged that the boat was overloaded.
   ``Everybody stood up and started moving around in the boat. Then
it turned over. They was just hollering `Help! Help! Help!'
Couldn't none of them swim.''
   Three of the girls held hands when the boat overturned and were
still holding hands when their bodies were recovered, Armstrong
said Monday night.
   Yalobusha County Coroner Stanley True identified the drowning
victims as boat occupants Anna Martin, 21; her 20-year-old sister,
Marlee; their cousin, Janice Martin, 20; Sherry Taylor, 21; Sandra
Baker, 24, and Sherry Jenkins, 19. Eddie Lee Rounds, 41, died after
swimming from the shore in a rescue attempt, the coroner said.
   Another passenger, Melvin Pernell, whose age was unavailable,
was clinging to the boat when he was rescued by a fisherman, said
Armstrong. Pernell was in stable condition at Grenada Lake Medical
Center.
   The boat had traveled about 30 yards from the shore of the
25-acre lake, located on Mississippi 330 between the rural
communities of Coffeeville and Tillatoba in north-central
Mississippi, when the accident occurred, said the County Sheriff's
Department.
   The coroner said the bodies were recovered in eight to 10 feet
of water near the boat, and no alcohol was involved.
   The flat-bottom boat was powered by a 25-horsepower outboard
motor and was designed to hold up to five people, said Deputy
Sheriff Homer Melton.
   ``It was kind of loaded but we was going slow, though,''
Armstrong said. ``They was playing in the water. That's what caused
the accident.''
   The cause of the accident was under investigation, authorities
said.
   True said no life jackets were on the boat, but Armstrong said
there were two, although neither was worn.
   ``I told them to hold onto the boat and don't panic,'' said
Armstrong, who can swim. ``When I'd get one, there another would
turn loose and grab me. I did all I could. I got welts all over my
back now. I went under a lot of times.
   ``There were about 35 or 40 people on the shore and I was
saying, `Somebody help us.' People on the shore kind of panicked. A
couple people fainted.
   ``When Eddie Lee jumped in to help them (boat occupants), they
just grabbed him and he drowned, too.''
   Armstrong said he struggled for about 30 minutes to save the
others until he could do no more, and barely made it to shore
himself.
   True said the deaths were ruled accidental.

<HEAD>IMF Reports Some of Its Programs Hurt the Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report from the International Monetary Fund
acknowledges that poor people have been hurt by policies it has
pressed on Third World countries with the support of the United
States.
   In the past the IMF has stressed that countries will be worse
off if they delay the austerity policies such as devaluation of
currencies and cuts in government spending usually required as a
condition for IMF loans.
   The fund is owned by 151 governments, with the United States
holding the biggest block of votes. At the end of March, poor
countries owed the fund $28.6 billion.
   Though founded in an effort to keep all currencies stable, in
recent years the fund has spent its money almost entirely on
helping about 80 poor countries keep up with their debt, much of it
owed to the U.S. government and banks.
   ``Although many of the major policy instruments improved the
position of the dominant poverty groups in the sample countries,
other poverty groups were made worse off in the short run,'' the
new report says.
   It chooses seven sample countries whose governments in recent
years have adopted ``adjustment programs'' in order to get loans
from the fund: Chile, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Kenya,
Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
   The authors are five members of the fund staff led by an
American, Peter S. Heller. The fund distributed the report this
week from its headquarters in Washington.
   The statement that introduces it comes from Michel Camdessus,
the fund's French managing director:
   ``Adjustment does not have to lower basic human standards. ...
The more (that) adjustment efforts give proper weight to social
realities _ especially the implications for the poorest _ the more
successful they are likely to be.''
   Large groups of poor people in the cities of Chile, the
Dominican Republic and the Philippines suffered from devaluations,
it says.
   For the Philippines, the report tells how spending on health and
schools was cut, devaluation and restrictions on imports raised
prices sharply while restrictions on the supply of money held down
the number of jobs and the amount of wages.
   In the Dominican Republic, basic items were subsidized by a high
exchange rate for the peso. When the rate was lowered there was
what the report calls ``major social unrest.''
   More than 50 people died in the Dominican rioting of 1984.
   Sharp cuts in government spending may have hurt the poor in the
long run as well as the short run in Sri Lanka and Kenya, according
to the report. But it adds that the cuts might have been even
greater if there had been no agreement between the governments and
the fund.
   A rise in the tax on beer hit the people of Ghana and Kenya,
``though not perhaps in welfare terms,'' the report adds.
   On the positive side, the report says fund programs brought more
credit for poor farmers in the Dominican Republic and Sri Lanka and
the removal of price controls helped cut rents in the Philippines
and Ghana.
   It also says that lowering the exchange rate helped increased
the real earnings of poor people in the country who were raising
crops for export in Ghana, and to a lesser extent in Kenya and the
Philippines.

<HEAD>Party Conservatives Preventing Reformers From Attending Crucial
Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading reformer says he expects Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's liberalization drive to prevail at next month's crucial
party conference despite conservatives' success at blocking some of
its backers from attending.
   The Soviet leader's ``policies and programs are sufficiently
strong to carry the conference,'' prominent political scientist
Fyodor M. Burlatsky said Monday. He is among those who have been
excluded.
   The Communist Party conference, the first since 1941, will lay
out a a slate of policy decisions and proposals forming a blueprint
for legislative changes. It will amount to passing judgment on
Gorbachev's wide-ranging program of social and economic reforms
known as ``perestroika.''
   The selection of the 5,000 delegates to the June 28 conference
has already turned into a showdown between backers of reform and
those who seek to limit change _ often to preserve their privileges.
   Burlatsky said the conference will not name any new people to
the 300-member, policy-making Central Committee, in part to protect
the committee headed by Gorbachev from changes viewed as harmful.
   ``If elections to the party conference have become so difficult,
how do we know elections to the Central Committee won't be tied up
by some of these negative factors?'' he asked.
   Burlatsky fell with the fortunes of Nikita S. Khrushchev, the
late former premier, but resurfaced to back Gorbachev's
``perestroika'' campaign.
   He said the party's charter does not spell out procedures for
selecting delegates to party conferences: ``We are learning
democracy, finding a style as we go. It is certainly experimental.''
   Since the last party conference was in 1941, times have changed
radically and old ways of choosing delegates are no longer
relevant, the political scientist said.
   Instances where Gorbachev's backers failed to get elected as
delegates were sometimes the result of individual party officials
striking the backers' names from lists forwarded by factories,
institutes and local party organizations, Burlatsky said.
   ``There were cases where regional secretaries themselves, for
formalistic reasons, withdrew certain names,'' he said, using a
term that suggests conservatism.
   Burlatsky; historian Yuri Afanasyev; and Tatyana Zaslavskaya, a
prominent sociologist are among those turned down by regional party
authorities after being selected by their local groups as
candidates to attend the conference.
   Exclusion of such noted backers of reform prompted
demonstrations in Moscow and Leningrad over the weekend and
accusations that the selection process was rigged.
   Ms. Zaslavskaya criticized the delegate selection process at a
news conference last week, saying the choices had not in every case
been beneficial for the fate of Gorbachev's reforms.
   Burlatsky joked that his own absence would take its toll at the
party conference, ``but I don't think it is dangerous to
perestroika.''
   Among the proposals are suggestions for jury trials; relaxation
of restrictions on religion; reform of the criminal justice system;
limits on the political terms of party officials, and some formal
sanctioning of the informal groups springing up in the Soviet
Union, which Burlatsky said now number about 30,000. The groups,
which are unofficial but sometimes tolerated, have come together to
press causes like environmental protection and individual freedoms.

<TEXT>
   When Arlene Crane mingles with some of the
seedier characters in the nation's capital, it's all in a day's
work.
   As the wife of Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., she does what is
expected of a congressional spouse: showing up at parties and
receptions, posing for pictures and answering reporters' questions.
   But the mother of eight has another life in what seems like
another world.
   Arlene Crane is a private detective.
   ``So much for stereotypes,'' she said, laughing about the
contrast of life in the public eye and work as a private eye. ``I
guess I must be a maverick.''
   ``But if my life had to revolve strictly around Phil, waiting
for him to come home every night, I think I'd go crazy,'' she
added. ``You have to have diversion, and I get plenty of it.''
   Since graduating from a detective school in suburban Washington
seven years ago, Mrs. Crane said she has handled at least 50 cases
ranging from the search for a missing person to gathering evidence
for a divorce case.
   ``It can be dirty. It's often seedy. But it's always
challenging,'' she said recently. ``It's also amazing who you have
to consort with.
   ``I could recall a few unsavory characters along the way. But
you have to do it. ... If you don't ingratiate yourself to some of
these low-lives, there are times you just won't get the answers you
need.''
   She said another part of the job, surveillance, dispels any
impression that detective work is glamorous.
   ``In one case, the husband knew his wife was having an affair,
and he was certainly right. We got the goods,'' she said. ``But it
was 23{ hours straight, sitting in a car _ not getting out, not
even to go to the bathroom.
   ``I'll never forget it as long as I live. In fact, I don't think
I'll ever wear those clothes again.''
   Mrs. Crane began as a full-time detective with an agency when
she received her diploma. She now works part time as a freelance
investigator, often for lawyers, because she wanted more freedom.
   She was reluctant to talk about most of her recent
investigations, largely background checks, but said her clients
never include members of Congress.
   Does she carry a gun?
   ``I could, but I don't. I can't even think of a time when I
needed to,'' she said. ``Ironically, you can't carry one in D.C.,
period, unless you get a special dispensation and, even then, it
has to be seen. So I'd look a little silly going to a reception
with a holster on my belt.''
   Crane said he is proud of his wife's atypical occupation, but
also finds humor in the situation.
   ``I bet I'm the only guy on the Hill who wouldn't get mad if his
wife was caught standing outside some stranger's hotel room,'' he
said recently.

   All eight people aboard were killed when a small
plane crashed in southern China's Hunan province after spraying
pesticides, the official Xinhua News Agency said today.
   The report said the Yun-5 utility biplane crashed Monday in a
mountainous area of Wangcheng county during a return flight to the
provincial capital of Changsha. The four crew members and four
workers aboard were reported killed.
   The plane belonged to the Hunan Provincial Civil Aviation
Administration.
   Xinhua said the cause of the accident was still unknown.
   The air crash was the first reported in China since January,
when 108 died in the crash of a passenger plane near Chungking,
Sichuan province.

   For Jim Donoho and Nancy Collins-Donoho,
who had known each other 14 years when they wed on the 14th floor
of the State Capitol at 4:14 p.m. on Feb. 14, a reception could
only be held once in a blue moon.
   The two Lincoln residents tied the knot in February, but
celebrated with a reception Sunday night as the celestial
composition neared its unique ``blue moon'' status.
   ``It's a rarity that coincides with the fact that our
relationship seems to be rare in this day and age when people don't
have long-lasting relationships,'' Collins-Donoho said.
   The second full moon in the same month, known in folklore as a
``blue moon,'' occurred at 6:53 a.m. EDT today, according to the
U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington. The last full moon was May 1.
   The term blue moon is applied because of the rarity of the
situation, which occurs once every two or three years, but the moon
does not ecessarily appear blue.
   Donoho, 36, and Collins-Donoho, 31, met years ago while working
at different businesses in Lincoln.

   Train commuters have felt the future of
railroading and it's making them uncomfortable _ and a little
motion sick.
   NJ Transit Corp. has introduced new seats on about 200 trains
that some commuters hate about as much as their commute.
   They say the seats, which do not adjust like the old ones, force
them to ride facing the back sometimes, do not offer enough head
support and have wimpy armrests or none at all. The seats don't
even have hand grips on the sides for people who would rather stand.
   Some suspect a plot against the passengers is afoot.
   ``They made the seat purposely lower on the aisle so the
commuter will shove in and use the more comfortable middle seat. I
guess they figure nobody wants the middle seat,'' said commuter
Albert Papp.
   He also complained when the seats force the passenger to ride
backward ``the forces are reversed,'' he said. ``A lot of people
apparently don't care for that, it can even make them motion sick.''
   The commuters plan to voice their complaints Wednesday at a
meeting of the statewide transportation agency.
   The seats recently were installed and NJ Transit officials say
they aren't inclined to spend the money to replace them. But they
scheduled the meeting to discuss what kind of seats to place in 300
other cars that will be bought or refurbished in the next three
years.
   The commuter dissatisfaction surfaced in an NJ Transit-sponsored
survey of 2,800 riders.

   A carpenter-turned-author says he's not
anti-television, even though his first published book is about a
boy who discovers the library when his television set explodes and
he has no programs to watch.
   ``I'd just like to see (TV) play a less important part in our
lives,'' said Dan West of Minneapolis.
   West's 28-page children's book, ``The Day the TV Blew Up,'' is
being published by Albert Whitman & Co. of Niles, Ill.
   Abby Levine, senior editor at Whitman, said she thought the
story was ``very witty. I liked the subject very much because it
obviously is a problem with children watching television to the
exclusion of all else. But I liked the way (the character) Ralph
found out how to love books. It wasn't too didactic.''
   The 37-year-old West, who has three children ranging from ages 4
to 9, said he sent out three or four stories to different
publishers before this one was accepted.
   West, who rises early each day to put in some writing time
before going to work, has been a carpenter for 11 years. He works
for his father, mostly remodeling and building additions to homes
in south Minneapolis and Richfield.

<HEAD>Meese Leaves Open Possibility Of Resignation Prior To Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III says he may
resign before the November election, but not before he has a chance
to ``set the record straight.''
   Meese said in an interview broadcast Monday night that before he
steps aside, he wants to respond to the allegations that have been
made against him concerning his ties to scandal-plagued Wedtech
Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline project.
   An independent counsel who has been investigating Meese for the
past year is expected to issue a report in several weeks. Meese is
not expected to be indicted but the report will raise questions
about his ethical conduct, according to sources familiar with the
probe.
   Those questions will be investigated by the Justice Department's
Office of Professional Responsibility, in an examination that could
continue for months.
   Once he has had an opportunity to respond to the independent
counsel's report and ``set the record straight,'' Meese said, ``my
own personal plans are going to be the deciding point as to when
the proper time is to step down.''
   He said that time could be next Jan. 20, when President Reagan
leaves office, or ``sometime before that.''
   Meese was interviewed on Cable News Network's ``Larry King
Live'' show. When asked by former White House aide Pat Buchanan,
who was guest host on the show, whether he might resign before
Labor Day, Meese replied: ``I don't think I'd rule anything in or
anything out.''
   Meese refused to discuss any details of his newly disclosed
meeting with Vice President George Bush earlier this month.
   But he said, ``If I were to quit now, for example, it would be a
real liability (to Bush) because people would say there was
something wrong.''
   Meese told Bush he would do nothing to hurt the vice president's
campaign for president, Bush said Monday under questioning by
reporters at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Meese blamed the news media for polling results showing the
public views him unfavorably, and promised a strong counter-attack
once the independent counsel issues his report.
   In the wake of a ``one-sided barrage from the media...I'm
surprised, actually, it wasn't worse than that,'' Meese said of the
poll results.
   An ABC-Washington Post poll last week showed a majority of the
public thinks Meese is not doing a good job as attorney general.
   Meese predicted adverse public opinion would change ``when I'm
unleashed'' following the issuance of independent counsel James
McKay's report.
   The attorney general also said ``it wasn't a crippling blow''
when two of his top aides resigned March 29 in protest of his
continued tenure at the Justice Department.
   Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and criminal division chief
William Weld quit out of concern that Meese was hurting the Justice
Department's operations, morale and public image.

<HEAD>Beijing Beauty Pageant Ends With a Whimper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beijing's first beauty pageant ended with a
whimper when organizers named 12 ``Girls of Elegance'' at a
hush-hush evening tea party, reports appearing today said.
   The Sunday tea party ended the strange on-again, off-again saga
of the Chinese capital's first beauty contest since the Communists
came to power 39 years ago.
   More than 800 women had signed up to participate after an April
announcement that Beijing would host a contest to select 10 ``Girls
of Youth and Elegance.'' Preliminary rounds narrowed the field to
50 contestants.
   The Beijing contest ignited beauty pageant fever throughout the
country, setting off a debate about whether such contests are
appropriate in a country with a low standard of living.
   Some cities quickly dropped plans to name local beauty queens.
   Shanghai called off its contest earlier this month, claiming
``conditions were not ripe.''
   A ``Mr. Canton'' and ``Miss Canton'' were named Saturday night
before a crowd of 5,000 people in the southern city near Hong Kong
_ but plans to broadcast the pageant live were scrapped.
   Meanwhile, Beijing Television Studio, one of two sponsors of the
capital's pageant, announced last week that the capital's contest
had been canceled.
   But Contemporary Television magazine said Saturday that the
pageant would be held as planned June 5, though it would not be
televised, reporters would not be allowed to attend and there would
be no news conference afterward.
   In Beijing, the magazine confirmed today that the pageant had
ended with the selection of 12 ``Girls of Elegance'' on Sunday.
   Reports from Beijing by the pro-China Ta Kung Pao newspaper and
the Hong Kong China News Service did not say why the June 5 finals
were canceled.
   The news service said the 50 finalists attended the tea party
and judges chose 12 ``outstanding competitors who left a relatively
deep impression.'' They included three students, a military nurse
and an employee of the Beijing International Hotel, the report said.
   There was no indication what, if anything, the winners were
awarded.
   ``Ending the competition like this is disappointing,'' the news
service quoted contestant Li Dan, a student at the Beijing Foreign
Language Institute, as saying. ``I hoped to win, but if I couldn't
capture first place I hoped someone else would.''
   Another contestant, Yi Xinxin, was quoted as saying, ``Although
this round of activity is already finishedm, I'm still very
excited. I believe there will come a time when China will host this
kind of competition.''
   Contestants in the Beijing pageant were judged on their talent
in singling, dancing, reading and answering questions revealing
their knowledge and moral values.

   Actress Brigitte Nielsen has suffered a

   Ms. Nielson, 25, who is divorced from her second husband,

   The couple announced their engagement last February and said
earlier this month that they were expecting a baby this fall. A
divorce between the 31-year-old Gastineau, and his wife, Lisa, is
pending.
   In a statement issued through publicist Joel Brokaw, Gastineau
said that he and Ms. Nielsen ``love each other more than anything
else in the world'' and that the miscarriage would not prevent them
from ``starting over again and having another baby.''
   Ms. Nielsen had been working ``12-to-15-hour days'' on the movie
``Domino'' when she began feeling weak last week, said Brokaw. She
miscarried in her hotel and was taken to a hospital ``where she is
being treated for additional complications,'' he said.
   She has a son in Denmark from her first marriage. Gastineau,
once the beefy star of the Jets' ``sack exchange,'' but whose
performance has slumped the last two seasons, has a 5-year-old
daughter, Brittny.
   He and Ms. Nielsen met while working out at a San Diego health
club during Super Bowl week.

<TEXT>
   The nation's jobless rate fell to 2.6 percent in
April, down from 3 percent for the same month last year, the
government reported today.
   Japan's unemployment rate would be about twice as high if
calculated by Western methods.
   The seasonally adjusted jobless rate for April was the same as
for March of this year, the Management and Coordination Agency said
in its monthly report.
   Government officials said April's figure reflected a continuing
steady economic recovery since last summer following a major shift
in Japan's economic structure. The nation has been pushing domestic
demand expansion over previously export-led growth.
   The number of Japanese with jobs in April was 60.38 million, an
increase of 1.08 million over the same month last year, according
to the report, which was presented to the Cabinet today.
   It was the first time that the number of employed Japanese
topped 60 million, the report said. At the same time, there were
1.66 million people out of work.
   Japan's population is about 121 million.

<HEAD>Report: Death Toll At 41 in Week Of Flooding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a week of flooding in
northern Bangladesh has claimed 41 lives and left about 15,000
people homeless, a Bengali language newspaper reported today.
   The Khabar newspaper said all the deaths occurred in the Sylhet
district, about 62 miles north of Dhaka, but did not give details.
   A Sylhet district government official told The Associated Press
by telephone that only 10 deaths had been reported.
   But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
at least 50,000 people had been trapped by flood waters in the
district.
   The flooding has been caused by the Brahmaputra river bursting
its banks. The Brahmaputra flows through Bangladesh and into the
Bay of Bengal.
   Local newspapers say at least 1.5 million people have had their
homes or crops inundated by the floodwaters.
   Flooding is common at this time of year, when the monsoon rains
begin, in this nation of 105 million people. The government says at
least 1,500 people were killed in floods last year.

<HEAD>Australia Seizes Huge Arms Cache Bound For Fiji</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customs officers said today that they
seized a huge cache of weapons bound for Fiji that could have
started a small war in the South Pacific nation, scene of two coups
last year.
   The cache, including submachine guns, automatic rifles, hand
grenades, mortars and anti-tank mines, arrived on a ship from Port
Hodeidah in North Yemen via Sri Lanka and Singapore, said Customs
spokesman Alastair Wilson.
   He said the shipment, discovered Monday in Sydney's downtown
Darling Harbor, was bound for Lautoka, in eastern Fiji, stronghold
of deposed Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra.
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said all the weapons were Soviet-made.
   ``It has nasty connotations,'' the official said.
   News reports said it was the biggest illegal haul of military
equipment in Australian history. Wilson said consigment papers
listed the contents of a more than one-ton container as used
machinery.
   ``Customs officers located the container, opened a number of
sealed boxes, and instead of used machinery they found weapons,''
he told a news conference.
   Wilson said an army demolition squad was brought in to remove
the weapons and officials were doing an inventory. He said the
shipment contained enough arms to have ``started a small war in
Fiji.''
   News reports said the consignment was intercepted after being
loaded onto the french ship Capitaine Cook. The reports said the
captain and his crew were being questioned but had not been
arrested.
   The Foreign Ministry official said authorities in Fiji, which is
about 2,000 miles northeast of Sydney, had been informed of the
seizure.
   Australian officials said they had no immediate indication of
for whom the weapons were bound.
   In Suva, the Fijian capital, authorities expressed surprise at
the seizure. Bavadra, who was ousted in a coup a year ago, was not
available for comment.
   There has been no armed resistance by the majority Indian
community to the coups, which Sitiveni Rabuka said he staged to
protect the rights of ethnic Fijians, who comprise a 43 percent
minority of the islands' 715,000 people.
   Bavadra's Indian-dominated elected government was ousted on May
14, 1987, just one month after it came to power.
   Rabuka staged a second coup four months later, claiming the
interim administration had not settled the issue of Fijian
political dominance.

   The degradation and death of a teen-age
homosexual prostitute will be the focus in the murder trial of a
former university professor who is accused of chopping up his
victim with a chain saw.
   Tracy Leroy Nute, a homeless 18-year-old from Kansas City, Mo.,
died on Aug. 20. He was shot to death in a West Hollywood apartment
six months after leaving home saying he was going to California to
be a movie star.
   After his death, police say, someone took a chain saw to Nute's
body and hacked it into several pieces, later scattering the parts
around California.
   The prosecution in the trial scheduled to begin today seeks to
prove that the gun that killed Nute and the chain saw with which he
was dismembered were wielded by Max Bernard Franc.
   Franc, 58, a former political science professor at Fresno State
University, denies being the killer and blames a man named Terry
Adams.
   But the prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Sterling Norris,
says a lengthy investigation of men named Terry Adams only
convinced him that Franc invented the person.
   Franc, who has no criminal record, was arrested Aug. 29 after he
returned a chain saw to a rental company with bits of flesh and
blood in its inner workings.
   Franc, who lived in Fresno, also maintained an apartment in West
Hollywood.
   Pieces of Nute's body were found near freeways in Fresno and
Valencia, 200 miles apart.
   Superior Court Judge John H. Reid has ruled that jurors in the
trial can be shown some photos of the severed body parts. But he
said other pictures are too gory to show jurors, who might be so
inflamed by them they would convict the defendant without weighing
other evidence.
   Norris, scheduled to deliver his opening statement today, said
he will try to prove through analysis of decomposition time that
Franc refrigerated portions of the body before discarding them.
   He contends Franc killed Nute in a homosexual rage and
dismembered the body to avoid detection.
   According to counselors in the homosexual community, Nute
quickly abandoned his dreams of stardom and wound up working the
streets of West Hollywood as a homosexual prostitute. He dyed his
dark hair blond and wore it in spikes.
   Franc, a native of DePere, Wis., has acknowledged knowing Nute
and said he once loaned him money. But he denies killing the youth.
   Franc resigned his teaching post after his arrest.

<HEAD>Workers Strike Memorial Day At 17 Cemeteries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLMA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burials were postponed today after union
workers struck 17 San Francisco Bay area cemeteries in a dispute
over non-union subcontractors and health benefits.
   ``During this strike there won't be any interment. Mortuaries
will have to hold the bodies,'' said Bruce Green, weekend manager
of Woodlawn Memorial Park in Colma. The strikers, however, did not
interfere with Memorial Day visitors.
   In 1985, more than 800 bodies went unburied until a long strike
was settled.
   The main issue in the strike, which began Monday and is the
area's fifth cemetery walkout since 1971, was the use of non-union
subcontractors, said Carolyn Del Gaudio, business agent for the
Cemetery Workers and Greens Attendants Union Local 265.
   ``That involves a real threat ... to the future of their jobs,
to the union itself,'' said Del Gaudio, whose union represents 150
workers who are groundskeepers, custodians and handle burials and
cremations.
   But John Cantwell, who represents two associations of cemetery
owners, called subcontracting a ``sham issue.'' Cemeteries always
have used subcontractors, and the owners associations' proposal
says no workers will be laid off because of subcontracting, he said.
   The union's three-year contract with Associated Cemeteries and
the East Bay Interment Properties Association expired March 1. It
covered employees at eight cemeteries east of San Francisco and
nine south on the Peninsula. The only cemetery in San Francisco, at
the Army Presidio, was unaffected by the strike.
   Contract negotiations broke off Saturday, and no new talks are
scheduled, Cantwell said.
   At least one cemetery, in Hayward, canceled burials scheduled
for today.
   ``The burials will simply have to be postponed,'' Cantwell said.
   Cemetery workers receive $14.35 an hour after 18 months,
Cantwell said. Under the employers' proposal, employees would
receive raises of 30 cents an hour for each year of the contract,
he said.
   Employers also are offering to pay the same amount for employee
health insurance as under the previous contract, Cantwell said.

<HEAD>Bahamas Helps US Anti-Drug Efforts as Pindling Indictment Seems
Less Likely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bahamas has become more cooperative with the
United States in an anti-drug effort, while chances are diminishing
that the islands' prime minister will face a drug indictment in
this country, a newspaper reports.
   The Bahamian government has joined the United States in combined
drug raids and allowed a U.S. Customs base on Gun Cay south of
Bimini, The Miami Herald reported Monday.
   ``We're at a very high level of cooperation at this point,''
said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan in Miami.
   Sheehan's statement was echoed by Jack Hook, spokesman for the
Drug Enforcement Administration.
   But chances that the prime minster, Sir Lynden O. Pindling,
could be prosecuted on drug-related charges appear remote because
of obstacles in an ongoing probe of an overseas drug-smuggling
network.
   First, the shaky status of federal drug indictments in Miami and
Tampa against Panama Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has raised doubts
about whether the United States would want to indict a foreign head
of state. The Reagan administration reportedly has offered to drop
the indictments in a deal in which Noriega would step down from
power.
   ``I find very little incentive indicting foreign potentates if
the State Department can negotiate them right out from under my
feet,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who has indicated he'll
quit if the indictment against Noriega is dropped.
   Merkle, of Tampa, has refused to comment on the reported probe
of Pindling.
   The Herald said a grand jury in Orlando is hearing testimony
against Pindling, the Bahamian leader since 1967 who was re-elected
last year after his government was rocked by a drug-corruption
scandal.
   The Herald, citing a ``well-placed source,'' said a July 4
deadline has been set for an indictment of Pindling.
   Another major obstacle, The Herald said, is the statute of
limitations. Pindling's probe stemmed from testimony given by
prosecution witnesses in the Jacksonville federal trial of
convicted Colombian drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas.
   Most of the allegations raised against Pindling in the Lehder
trial involved incidents in the late 1970s and 1980, which would
put them past the five-year statute of limitations.
   Merkle prosecuted Lehder, who was accused of using the private
Bahamian island of Norman's Cay as a cocaine trans-shipment point
and was convicted on all drug counts he faced.
   During Lehder's trial, Merkle called Pindling ``a
co-conspirator.'' Prosecution witness George Baron said Bahamian
police were guarding the prime minister when he delivered a
suitcase with $400,000 to Pindling in 1980 for alleged protection
of Baron's marijuana-smuggling through the Bahamas.
   Pindling, in a May 4 statement, denied Baron's story and charges
of corruption and bribe-taking. The Bahamian government ran
full-page ads May 10 in U.S. newspapers stressing its commitment to
fighting drugs and protesting what they called old allegations.
   A 1984 Royal Commission of Inquiry detailed corruption in lower
levels of the Bahamian government and law enforcement, but stopped
short of linking Pindling to the drug corruption.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple who sailed a canvas-covered kayak from
Cuba survived stormy seas and a water spout that broke their
15-foot vessel's frame before being rescued by a fishing boat,
officials said.
   ``I don't know how in the world they made it across the ocean,''
said Don Gurgiolo, captain of a charter fishing boat that rescued
the couple off Upper Matecumbe Key, near Islamorada. ``It was
awfully rough.''
   The fishermen called the Coast Guard to pick up Juan Ramirez
Gomez and his wife, Regina Gilda Sabina Mendez, who were bobbing in
6-foot seas when they were found Sunday morning, 38 hours after
they set sail east of Havana.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Glenn Gerber said he was surprised the
couple had survived the more than 100-mile voyage.
   ``It was not a real seaworthy vessel,'' Gerber said.
   The couple said they left Cuba on Friday night in a kayak loaded
with drinking water, a searchlight, jackets, a compass and other
supplies.
   After they were taken aboard the Gonfishin 5 passengers on the
charter gave them food and clothing, Gurgiolo said.
   ``She got on the boat, dried off her Bible and praised God,''
the captain said.
   The two were being held today at the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service's Krome Avenue detention center in Miami.

   The U.S. dollar lost ground after opening higher
against the Japanese yen in Tokyo today, while stocks gained for
the second consecutive day.
   After opening at 125.21 yen, up 0.23 yen, the dollar lost
strength and closed the day at 124.80 yen, down 0.18 yen.
   ``The dollar ranged between 124.77 and 125.28 yen, sandwiched
between buy and sell orders,'' said an exchange dealer with a major
Tokyo commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The dollar comes under selling pressure when it goes above the
125-yen level, and buy orders start coming in when it falls below
that level,'' he said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained a strong 260.60 points Monday, added
another 193.60 points, or 0.71 percent, to finish the day's trading
at 27,416.70.
   ``Share prices rose substantially just before the end of the
afternoon session, led by large-capital issues, such as steels and
shipbuildings,'' said Hitoshi Otani of Wako Securities.
   Investors are now less worried about the U.S. econony, Otani
said. ``Fears about inflation and a rise in the U.S. official
discount rate have lessened among investors,'' he said.
   With its rallies on Monday and today, the market erased the big
loss suffered on Saturday, when the Nikkei index tumbled 327.99
points in a half-day session.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.7 billion shares,
up from 1 billion shares on Monday.
   Advancing issues included automobiles and precision machineries.
Textiles, drugs and financials also were higher, while some
electricals and constructions lost ground.

<HEAD>Navy Hero, Wife, Buried Side-By-Side After 168 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A duel took Susan Wheeler Decatur's heroic
husband from her 168 years ago and fate kept their remains apart
until now.
   Mrs. Decatur's resting place was dedicated Monday in a church
yard next to her husband's grave. Three students from an elementary
school named for Stephen Decatur participated in a wreath-laying
ceremony attended by about 100 people.
   Decatur was one of the young American Navy's heroes, lionized
for his feats of daring against North African pirates and for a
victory over a British warship during the War of 1812.
   After he was killed by a duelist's bullet on March 22, 1820,
Mrs. Decatur lived 40 years without him. She then lay buried for
128 years in Washington, D.C., while he rested beside his parents
at St. Peter's Episcopal Church here.
   Through the efforts of Georgetown University, the remains of
Mrs. Decatur were removed from a university-owned cemetery, placed
in a mahogany coffin and on May 19 reburied beside her husband, who
had been buried under a 30-foot-tall granite column.
   Monday's ceremony coincided with the opening of a small Decatur
exhibit at the Philadelphia Maritime Museum. Decatur was a native
of Philadelphia, the son of a Revolutionary War naval officer who
was reared among the ships and shipbuilders of the city's late
18th-century waterfront.
   His most intrepid act was his Feb. 7, 1804, burning of the
captured American frigate Philadelphia in the harbor of Tripoli, in
modern-day Libya.
   Then 25 and disguised as a Maltese sailor, Decatur headed a
raiding party that sailed into the heavily guarded harbor. They
boarded, set fires and destroyed the frigate, which had been seized
six months earlier by Tripoli warships.
   Two years later, Decatur married Susan Wheeler, the daughter of
the mayor of Norfolk, Va., and a noted belle of that town and
Baltimore. She was said to be well educated, charming and pretty,
but little else is known about her.
   They were childless and had been married for 14 years when
Decatur died in the duel at age 41.
   Decatur was challenged by Capt. James Barron, whom Decatur had
criticized after a ship Barron commanded was severely damaged by a
British warship in 1807.
   The men stood about 8 yards apart in Bladensburg, Md., outside
Washington and fired a pair of ornate, long-barreled silver
pistols. Barron was wounded in the hip but recovered.
   Decatur also was shot in the hip but the bullet traveled into
his abdomen, and he died in his home that evening.
   Mrs. Decatur eventually settled near the campus of what is now
Georgetown University and in 1837 gave the struggling Catholic
college $7,000.
   She died July 21, 1860, and was buried in a college graveyard
that was forgotten until the ground was prepared for a new building
in 1954, according to Charles F. Meng, Georgetown's vice president
for administration. Her remains were moved to another college
cemetery, where they stayed until she was reburied alonside her
husband.
   ``All of the family, and there are quite a number of us, feel
very good about this,'' said Maria Decatur Garnett, 67, of Kittery
Point, Maine, a great-great-great-niece of Decatur. ``It was a
romantic marriage. They were extremely romantic and very handsome.''

<HEAD>Tons of Toxic and Explosive Chemicals Found At College</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tons of old chemicals that have turned toxic and
potentially explosive were being removed from two buildings at
Hunter College, where they were like ``a time bomb'' in science
laboratories, officials said.
   The discovery of the chemicals, some up to 30 years old, forced
the college to close Thomas Hunter Hall and the North Building on
May 20, city Department of Environmental Protection and school
officials said Monday.
   Among the chemicals found were 25 canisters of explosive and
highly reactive chemicals, including ether and picric acid, and 90
canisters of gases, some of which may be poisonous, said department
spokeswoman Joan Paylo.
   ``Picric acid, when it crystallizes, can be as explosive as
dynamite in small quantities. It is feared throughout labs when it
is old,'' Ms. Paylo said, calling the chemicals ``a time bomb.''
   College officials learned about the chemicals' presence when the
Fire Department discovered ether during an inspection May 11,
college spokesman Robin Elliott said.
   Subsequent investigations revealed tons of expired chemicals in
the buildings' science laboratories and storage rooms, Ms. Paylo
said.
   So far, the spokeswoman said, 135 to 140 rooms have been
searched for dangerous chemicals. A hazardous waste removal
contractor planned to search all 500 rooms in both buildings today,
she said.
   The police bomb squad and individual contractors have removed
some of the dangerous substances, Elliott and Ms. Paylo said.
   ``Some of the gas is still on the premises because it is
difficult to find a contractor who will take it,'' she said.
   The college's policy had been ``to leave the regulation of
materials to individual researchers in the labs,'' Elliott said.
The discovery of the chemicals ``shows that you can't leave this
important safety-related area to individual people.''
   Classes at the college ended for the summer two weeks ago.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Spring snow fell in parts of Montana today as rain showers and
thunderstorms dampened much of the nation after spawning floods and
tornadoes in New Mexico.
   Rain over western Montana turned into snow in higher elevations,
and as much as 3 inches of snow was expected to fall above the
6,000-foot level. A snow advisory was posted for the mountains of
southwest Montana.
   Rain showers and thunderstorms fell from the Nebraska Panhandle
to the Texas Panhandle and from eastern Wyoming to eastern New
Mexico. Showers and thunderstorms also extended from northeast New
York state to central New England, and over southern Florida.
   Heavy thunderstorms Monday triggered flooding near Clovis and
Portales, N.M. Advisories warning of local flooding were posted for
southeast Colorado.
   Near Hartman and Holly, Colo., it was estimated that up to 3{
inches of rain fell in two hours. More than 3 inches fell in Clovis
in six hours overnight.
   Tornadoes touched down south of Clovis and southeast of Portales
on Monday evening, but there were no reports of injuries or major
damage.
   In addition, Clovis was hit by hail the size of golf balls.
Hail, often accompanied by gusty winds, also was reported in
Haxtun, Colo.; Bowman, N.D.; near Edgemont, S.D.; at Hill City,
S.D.; near Alliance, Neb.; and at Syracuse, Kan.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
Rockies to the upper Missouri Valley and the Great Plains from
North Dakota into western Texas; rain over the northern Pacific
Coast; showers from northeast New York state to northern New
England; and scattered thunderstorms over central and southern
Florida.
   Temperatures were expected to reach 90 to 95 degrees from
southern New England to the Carolinas, from Georgia to the lower
Mississippi Valley, and in the Tennessee Valley, the lower Ohio
Valley, southern Texas and the desert Southwest; the 50s and 60s
from the Rockies to Nevada, the Pacific Northwest and along the
central Pacific Coast; the 70s and 80s in the rest of the country.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Butte, Mont., and Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 80
degrees at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Elderly Catholic Bishop Released From Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 80-year-old Roman Catholic bishop jailed since
1982 for ordaining priests outside of the official
Communist-controlled church has been released, an official said
today.
   Bishop Fan Xueyan, also known as Joseph Fan, was released two or
three months ago from the Shijiazhuang Jail in Hebei province, just
south of Beijing, a Hebei Justice Department official said in
response to a question.
   The official gave his name only as Li. He said he did not know
why Fan was released, his present whereabouts or the state of his
health.
   The Vatican ordained Fan bishop of Baoding in Hebei province in
1951, shortly before China's new Communist government ordered the
Chinese Catholic church to break with the Vatican in the name of
anti-imperialism.
   The officially sanctioned Catholic Patriotic Association that
was then formed rejects the authority of the pope and ordains its
own bishops. Hundreds of Catholic clerics and laypeople who refused
to support the association were arrested in the 1950s and many have
been released only in the past 10 years.
   Fan, among them, was arrested in 1958 and spent 15 years in jail.
   He was arrested again in 1982 and sentenced to 10 years in jail
for allegedly maintaining ties with the Vatican and ordaining
priests.
   The government, which under senior leader Deng Xiaoping has
alternated between relaxation and severity in its policy toward
religious dissidents, has shown leniency this year to several
elderly Catholic clerics.
   China's most famous Catholic dissident, Shanghai Bishop Gong
Pingmei, also known as Ignatius Kung, was allowed to fly to the
United States this month for medical treatment. He had been jailed
from 1955-85 and parole restrictions were lifted only this year.
   The Rev. Zhu Hongshen, also known as Vincent Chu, was paroled
from jail in February so he could receive medical care. Zhu, who is
believed to be about 72, had been imprisoned from 1955 to 1979 and
was arrested again in 1981 for alleged subversive activities.
   China's official Catholic church claims more than 3 million
members. An unknown number of Catholics remain loyal to the Vatican
and worship is illegal ``house churches.''

   A storm whipped up tornadoes from Colorado to Texas and caused
flooding that stranded travelers today, while a snowstorm hit the
West and strong wind battered the California coast, forcing holiday
boaters to abandon ship.
   ``We're just happy to be alive. We saw the waves smash some
girls against the rocks,'' said Paul Fritz of Redondo Beach, whose
friend's powerboat was overwhelmed by pounding surf and sank at
Goat Harbor on Santa Catalina, Calif.
   Helicopters plucked 17 yachtsmen from a beach at Goat Harbor on
Monday, while a lifeguard boat rescued three occupants from a boat
beached at Little Gibraltar Cove, Los Angeles County Lifeguard Lt.
John Stonier said.
   The stormy seas apparently claimed two victims Sunday, as the
Coast Guard suspended the search for two people involved in
separate boating accidents.
   Thomas Fortuna was lost when his sailing catamaran capsized off
Santa Catalina, and David Wright was presumed drowned after a boat
on which he was riding crashed into a pier near Long Beach Harbor,
Coast Guard petty officer Dennis Hall said.
   In Utah, several boats were damaged and an unoccupied houseboat
sank during a weekend storm, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area
rangers said. There were no reports of missing boaters.
   Heavy rain from thunderstorms caused flooding Monday near Clovis
and Portales, N.M., where police closed roads and several travelers
were stranded.
   The drivers and passengers of 10 to 15 cars stuck near Portales
were taken to motels or other shelters, said Donna Mowrer of the
Portales Communications and Emergency Preparedness Department.
   The thunderstorms also unleashed at least two tornadoes in the
area Monday, one about 5 miles south of Cannon Air Force Base. No
major damage was reported.
   Tornadoes and hail also were reported in the western Texas
panhandle.
   ``It touched down in open country and has gone back in the
clouds,'' said Peggy Bates, a jailer with the Bailey County
sheriff's department in Muleshoe.
   ``We haven't had any reports of injuries or damage. We did have
reports of baseball-size hail,'' she said.
   Two tornadoes were reported in southwestern Colorado, but
neither did any damage, authorities said.
   Spring snow fell in parts of Montana today, and as much as 3
inches of snow was expected to fall above the 6,000-foot elevation.
   Elsewhere, a snowstorm dumped up to 10 inches on southern Utah,
and up to 6 inches in Wyoming, where rangers closed large sections
of Yellowstone National Park because of the weather.
   Crews brought snowplows out of hibernation Monday after snow
covered Interstate 15 and Highway 89 between Kaysville and
Clearfield in northern Utah.
   ``It just hit real fast,'' said Brett Mann, a Utah Highway
Patrol dispatcher in Ogden.
   Four vehicles were involved in collisions and seven others slid
off the road, but no one was seriously injured, Mann said.
   The storm that began Sunday brought up to 10 inches of snow at
Brianhead Ski Area near Cedar City, slickening roads and leaving
several campers stranded in Cedar Breaks National Monument, Utah
Highway Patrol Dispatcher Karen Clayson said. The campers were able
to leave on Monday.

   A Wells Fargo guard walked into FBI
offices with his attorney and $50,000 of $2.5 million stolen from
an armored car, surrendered and then told agents where to find the
rest of the booty, the FBI said.
   Jared Layne Gray, 26, appeared just before 1 a.m. Monday to
confess to the May 5 robbery. He was booked and held without bail
in the Salt Lake County Jail, pending arraignment today before a
federal magistrate.
   ``We were somewhat surprised,'' said FBI special agent Bob Lund.
``We'd been working on this, and on something like this you
generally expect to go out and make an arrest.''
   Gray told authorities where the rest of the stolen cash was
hidden and agents recovered all of the money late Monday, Lund
said. He declined to say where it was found, except that it was in
another state.
   Lund also would not elaborate on Gray's whereabouts for the past
25 days or say whether authorities believed there was an accomplice.
   ``He had been inside Utah and he'd been in some of the
surrounding states,'' Lund said.
   Gray, one of three Wells Fargo guards transporting the money
from Boise, Idaho, to the Federal Reserve Bank in Salt Lake City,
had been sought since he disappeared the night the $2.52 million in
$100 bills was taken from the truck.
   Authorities say the armored car pulled in to a convenience store
near Corinne, and the two other guards were locked inside by a
wedge of wood used to jam the door.
   Gray is charged with three federal felony counts: theft by an
agent of the Federal Reserve Bank, theft of bank funds and theft
from an interstate shipment.
   Lund said he did not know why the guard turned himself in, but
suggested that a nagging conscience probably was a factor.
   ``No. 1, he doesn't have a criminal history. No. 2, I think he
probably planned this thing out and said, `Yeah, I can live without
my family for a while. I can go to South America ... live
luxuriously for a long, long time,''' he said.
   ``Then he just got to missing these people. I think he might
have had some conscience pangs,'' Lund said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Profit-taking pushed the U.S. dollar lower against
most foreign currencies in European trading early today. Gold
bullion rose.
   The dollar fell in moderately active dealings as market players
took profits on the currency's gains Monday, traders said.
   A Rome trader said there was no fundamental reason for Monday's
rise other than the closure of the London and New York markets for
national holidays.
   Mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday,
were:
   _1.7264 West German marks, down from 1.7270
   _1.4398 Swiss francs, down from 1.4415
   _5.8005 French francs, down from 5.8025
   _1.9317 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9335
   _1,278.50 Italian lire, down from 1,280.00
   _1.2366 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2378
   Against the trend, the dollar rose compared to the British
pound, which slipped to $1.8443 from $1.8478. The pound has been
declining steadily over the past few days.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 124.80 Japanese yen, down from
Monday's close of 124.98 yen. A trader said the dollar came under
selling pressure above the 125-yen level.
   In London trading later today, the dollar was holding steady at
125 yen.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price at
mid-morning of $454 a troy ounce, up from $452 on Friday. London
bullion markets were closed Monday for a public holiday.
   Gold also traded at a bid of $454 in Zurich, up from late
Monday's rate of $452.50.
   Earlier, gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $455.80, up from
$454.31.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid of $6.58 a troy
ounce, down 1 cent from late Friday. Silver cost $6.57 in Zurich on
Monday.

<TEXT>
   Soviet troops evacuated towns south of
Kabul today in their second major retreat from Afghan outposts,
leaving government forces to ward off rebel attacks in the
strategic area, Western and Soviet diplomatic sources said.
   Soviet troops left Ghazni, 85 miles southwest of Kabul, and were
heading north toward the Soviet border, said the sources, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   A Soviet convoy from Ghazni reached the outskirts of Kabul about
sunrise today and passed around the edge of the capital, the
Western source said. It was not known how many troops were involved.
   The Western source said the Soviets today were also pulling out
of Gardez, 60 miles south of Kabul.
   The evacuation of Soviet troops from the area leaves the Afghan
army largely unassisted, at least on the ground, against attacks by
anti-government guerrillas in the provinces separating Kabul from
the Pakistani border to the south and southeast.
   The guerrillas, who have been fighting both Afghan and Soviet
troops, have headquarters in Pakistan, which serves as their
conduit for arms supplies by Pakistan, the United States and China.
   The Soviet withdrawal started May 15 with departure of troops
from Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul.
   Under an April agreement signed in Geneva, the Soviets are to
complete withdrawal by Feb. 15, 1989. When the pullout began, the
Soviets had an estimated 115,000 soldiers in Afghanistan. About
10,000 have left so far, according to reports from Moscow.
   The Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan started in Dec.
1979 when troops were dispatched to prop up a Soviet-style
government in the face of escalating guerrilla attacks.
   Meanwhile, the guerrillas claimed from their headquarters in
Pakistan that they had captured the strategic Panjsheer Valley
northeast of Kabul last Thursday.
   The claim could not be verified in Kabul. Afghan and Soviet
officials declined to comment.
   The guerrillas claimed Afghan and Soviet troops had left the
valley and said they controlled the towns of Rokhah and Anawa.
   If true, the guerrillas would hold major vantage points near the
Soviet evacuation route north of Kabul leading to the Salang tunnel.
   The guerrillas said the Salang Highway was still open to
withdrawing Soviet convoys, giving credence to a report from
Western diplomatic sources last week that rebels operating in the
area were letting the Red Army through provided that the Soviets go
peacefully.
   A Western source in Kabul said he did not know if the claim was
true, but he said the guerrillas had captured Bazarak, 6 miles
northeast of Rokhah, on May 23. Rokha is 50 miles northeast of
Kabul.
   Military analysts from several Western nations, all speaking on
condition of anonymity, said guerrillas were now operating within 6
to 12 miles of Kabul.

<TEXT>
   The wounds from the Civil War have not
yet healed, according to retired Gen. William C. Westmoreland, who
commanded U.S. troops in Vietnam and whose relatives fought for the
Confederate Army.
   Westmoreland, speaking Monday in a Memorial Day ceremony at
Gettysburg National Cemetery, said the three-day Battle of
Gettysburg and other confrontations in the Civil War played a
crucial role in the evolution of the United States.
   ``A nation is never fully formed,'' Westmoreland told about
1,000 spectators in the cemetery where President Abraham Lincoln
delivered his famed ``Gettysburg Address'' in 1863.
   Lincoln sought unity and equality, Westmoreland said. He added
that while the states remain united, ``We have not made a
completely equal opportunity available to all.''
   ``Perhaps the most serious failure in our nation-building effort
has been the fate of our land's original inhabitants, the
Indians,'' he said.
   But, he said, many wounds have healed since Union and
Confederate troops fought here in what many historians consider the
decisive battle of the Civil War.
   ``America, as we know it today, is a vibrant national entity ...
I believe Lincoln would be pleased with the American nation of
1988,'' Westmoreland said, standing near a monument marking the
spot where Lincoln dedicated the cemetery nearly five months after
the fighting ended with Confederate troops retreating from northern
soil.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Socialists made big gains, the
government-leading Christian Democrats advanced slightly, and the
Communists were the main losers in Italy's local elections,
official results showed today.
   Newspapers and politicians said the elections strengthened the
national five-party coalition of Christian Democrat Premier Ciriaco
De Mita, confirmed a political shift to the center, and signalled
continuing movement on the left from the Communists toward the
Socialists.
   According to final returns from municipal elections Sunday and
Monday, the Christian Democrats took 36.8 percent of the vote, up
from 35.6 percent in the last local voting in 1983 and 34.9 percent
in last June's parliamentary elections.
   The Socialists made the biggest gains, recording 18.3 percent,
compared to 15.3 percent in 1983 and 14.2 percent last summer.
   The Communists, Italy's second largest party and the biggest
Communist party in the West, got 21.9 percent, a big drop from the
25.8 percent of 1983 and 26.8 percent of last June.
   Seven million people, about one-fifth of Italy's electorate,
were eligible to vote Sunday and Monday in the elections for city
councils in 1,200 cities and towns, and governments in three
provinces.
   The final turnout was put at 86.2 percent.
   The vote was not expected to affect the balance of power on the
national scene, but it gave an indication of the political climate
just over a month since De Mita formed Italy's 48th post-war
government _ a five-party coalition of Christian Democrats,
Socialists, Social Democrats, Republicans and Liberals.
   Rome's left-leaning La Repubblica, Italy's largest newspaper,
said in a front-page editorial, ``The real political result is the
crossing of votes on the left between the Communists and
Socialists, the start of a rebalancing of the Italian left.''
   The Christian Democrats, who have dominated Italy's post-war
politics, noted that it was the first time since 1970 that they
have increased their percentage over the previous local election.
   Another significant result was the poor showing of the far-right
neofascist Italian Social Movemement, which slipped to 3.9 percent
from 5 percent in 1983 and 6.8 in the national election last summer.
   La Repubblica said the losses of the Communists and the
far-right were evidence that ``like in all economically mature
countries, our electorate is moving to the center of the political
sphere and abandoning the areas further away from the point of
balance.''

   A number of Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets
fired from Lebanon landed in northern Israel early today, causing
damage in a settlement, the army said. No injuries were reported.
   The rockets damaged an electricity line, causing a power
shortage, and hit a fruit orchard, the army command reported.
   Israel's army radio said the Katyushas were apparently fired
from beyond Israel's self-designated security zone, a six- to
10-mile strip that the country mantains to the north of its border
with Lebanon.
   The radio said most of the recent Katyusha attacks on Israel and
the affected zone were carried out by Palestinian guerrilla groups.
It said there were 10 such attacks on the security zone in the last
several weeks.
   The army delayed information about the attack and withheld the
name of the settlement for security reasons.

<HEAD>Red Cross Visits Prisoners in Cuba, U.N. Team to Study Human
Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Red Cross officials have arrived in Cuba to
visit political prisoners and investigate prison conditions for the
first time since Fidel Castro came to power 29 years ago, an
organization spokesman said today.
   Carlos Bauverd, spokesman for the Geneva-based International
Committee of the Red Cross, said the team arrived in Havana on
Monday and hoped to begin visiting prisoners today.
   Cuba is believed to be the third Soviet ally to permit the Red
Cross to visit prisoners. Poland and Afghanistan have already done
so.
   The officials, including one doctor, hoped to visit every
political prisoner in the Communist country during their stay,
expected to last about one month, Bauverd told The Associated Press.
   The delegation planned to visit all of Cuba's prisons, Bauverd
said. Cuban authorities say there are 15.
   Bauverd said Cuban officials had agreed to the standard Red
Cross procedures of visiting prisoners without witnesses and
reserving the right to repeat visits in the future.
   He said the Red Cross would not have an exact number of
political prisoners in Cuba until after the visit.
   However, according to published reports, the Cuban government
has said the Red Cross would be allowed to visit 323 prisoners,
described as ``counter-revolutionaries,'' or state-security
prisoners.
   Bauverd said the Red Cross team would give a confidential report
to the Cuban government after the visit and that its contents would
not be made public under Red Cross policy.
   In a related development, the United Nations announced today the
composition of a team of delegates from its Human Rights Commission
who are to visit Cuba later this year.
   The six-member team will be headed by the commission chairman,
Alioune Sene of Senegal. It includes delegates from Bulgaria,
Colombia, Ireland, Nigeria and the Philippines, U.N. spokeswoman
Therese Gastaut told a weekly briefing.
   Ms. Gastaut said a date for their visit had not been set. Sene
said in March that the visit would probably take place in July or
August.
   The Human Rights Commission decided at its annual meeting
earlier this year to accept an invitation from Castro's government
to send a delegation to Cuba to investigate the human rights
situation there and report back to next year's commission, which
begins in February.
   The decision followed allegations by the United States and some
international organizations, including Amnesty International, of
human rights violations in Cuba, such as torture and mistreatment
of political prisoners.
   Cuba, which was an observer to the commission last year, was
elected last week to sit on the 1989 commission.

   The United States and the Soviet Union today
signed an accord providing that each superpower will notify the
other of the time, place and intended target of
intercontinental-range missile tests.
   But that agreement, signed in the Kremlin by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze as
President Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev
looked on, is only a slice of the unfinished Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START).
   That accord remains elusive, although both Reagan and Gorbachev,
answering reporters' questions at the outset of their day of summit
talks, voiced fresh optimism that it can be achieved.
   The testing accord is what has come to be called a
confidence-building measure. Last weekend, senior Reagan
administration officials said it was snagged in a dispute with the
Soviets, who wanted a broader agreement.
   The differences were worked out by senior American and Soviet
negotiators, under the direction of Reagan and Gorbachev, along
with another agreement, providing for joint tests this summer in
Nevada and at Semipalatinsk of U.S. and Soviet devices to measure
the force of blasts.
   Asked why Reagan and Gorbachev did not sign the pacts, Gennady
Gerasimov, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman quipped. ``It's
too small for them. It`s important, but not that important.''
   The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, called the
pre-notification accord ``a practical new step designed to reduce
the risk of misinterpretation, miscalculation, or accident.''
   The notice of a test launching must be given at least 24 hours
in advance and will be made through risk-reduction centers in
Washington and Moscow.
   A third accord extending for three years and expanding
U.S-Soviet cultural exchanges was signed by Charles Z. Wick, the
director of the U.S. Information Agency, and by Soviet Culture
Minister Vasuky Zamharov.
   Six other agreements were signed later at the foreign ministry.
   One gives fishermen in the two countries access to each other's
waters. Another provides for cooperation between the U.S. Coast
Guard and the Soviets in search and rescue operations. A third
extends cooperation in radio navigation techniques.
   A fourth agreement extend a 1973 accord for peaceful uses of
atmomic energy. Another sets up five working groups to explore
cooperation in solar and other outer space programs. A sixth calls
for cooperation in transportation.
   ``You see the harvest,'' Shevardnadze told reporters with a
smile.
   Asked when the START treaty would be ready, Shultz said
negotiating the terms was ``a hard job.'' Shevardnadze added:
``Generally speaking, it's in the fall that we collect the
harvest.''
   Shultz signed all six accords for the United States.
Shevardnadze signed four for the Soviet Union. The fisheries
agreement was signed by Nikolai I. Kotlyar, the fisheries minister,
while Boris L. Tolstykh, chairman of the state committee for
science and technology, signed the transportation accord.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze then resumed their negotiations.
   Negotiators working on arms control, human rights, bilateral and
regional issues met this morning and were to report their progress
later in the day to Shultz and Shevernadze, officials said.
   Two senior U.S. officials, briefing reporters separately under
rules which barred disclosure of their names, scaled down an
optimistic account by Gerasimov of progress toward resolving other
arms control disputes.
   Nor was there any sign from either side of a breakthrough on the
U.S. program to develop a defense in space against ballistic
missiles. Even if other issues are resolved, the Soviets have
refused to complete the START treaty until the Star Wars dispute is
resolved.
   ``The two sides could not convince each other,'' Gerasimov said.
   The Soviets and many American analysts contend the U.S. program
threatens the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. It limits
defenses on the theory a potential aggressor would be inhibited if
he faced the prospect of devastating retaliation.
   The Reagan administration argues the program is not in conflict
with the treaty.
   On START, Gerasimov said, the United States cleared the way to
removing one of five major obstacles to a treaty, dropping a demand
for a ban on mobile missiles.
   But the senior White House official disagreed, saying the U.S.
position ``at this point is a ban on mobiles missile. We are still
discussing it.''
   Soviet officials said before the summit that they thought the
United States was ready to agree to allow mobile missiles if they
could be restricted to a specific area and monitored by spy
satellites and possibly through on-site inspection.
   Gerasimov told reporters that ``mostly all the questions of
verification have been agreed upon ... about the territory where
these missiles are going to be stationed.''
   But the U.S. official said ``we haven't heard a verification
scheme that could work.''
   Evidently, there was progress on counting cruise missiles aboard
warplanes, though Gerasimov again was more upbeat than the U.S.
official.
   One American official reported some progress but no breakthrough
on the counting rules, and said the United States would consider
any scheme the Soviets propose for verifying compliance on ceilings
for mobile land-based intercontinental ballitic missiles.
   The Soviets have deployed two mobile missiles, the SS-24 and
SS-25. The United States is developing one of its own, the
Midgetman.
   Gerasimov complained that the United States was balking at a
Soviet proposal to remove a third obstacle to the START accord,
verifying limits on the number of cruise missiles carried by ships
and submarines.
   The United States has rejected conducting an experiment the
Soviets say will demonstrate a technology to detect the presence of
nuclear weapons aboard warships by detecting the emission of
neutrons and gamma rays.
   ``We think this is not a serious approach at all,'' Gerasimov
said. ``Send us two warships and we will tell you which one of them
carries these nuclear weapons without touching them.''

   The owner of a storage company
discovered a suitcase crammed with $90,000 in cash in a rental
compartment after the renter stopped paying the monthly fees,
police said.
   ``It's difficult to understand why somebody would not pay a $45
monthly fee and leave $90,000 lying around unless something
suspicious was involved,'' Lt. Leon Kimble of the Nashville Police
Department's armed robbery division said Sunday.
   In December, a man rented the garage-like storage unit
apparently under a fake name and address, police said. Company
log-in sheets show no one has visited the unit since Dec. 18, two
days after it was rented.
   When the renter became three months late on his rent, the
company sent him a letter, but it was returned as undeliverable.
   ``When your 90 days late on your rent, they send you a
registered letter advising you that if you don't pay, they will
inventory the stored items and auction them off at public sale,''
Kimble said.
   On Sunday, the owner of the storage business unlocked the unit.
   ``He found a suitcase with a little over $90,000 in wrapped $10
and $20 bills,'' Kimble said. ``It was really filled up.''
   The unit also contained a police radio scanner, an empty plastic
cooler and three or four hampers full of adult and children's
clothing, Kimble said.
   Police say the money will be held in the department's property
room until the rightful owner is found.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks, schools, restaurants, gas stations
and other businesses closed today in Christian east Beirut's Rmaeil
district to protest a car bombing that killed 20 people and wounded
78.
   Christian militia leaders blamed Monday's bombing on Syria.
Police estimated the car that blew up in a crowded street in Rmaeil
was packed with more than 200 pounds of TNT.
   Charred corpses wrapped in nylon bags were turned over to the
victims' relatives at the St. Georges' Greek Orthodox hospital for
burial, police said.
   ``The victims will be buried separately because they come from
different villages and areas,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot
be identified under standing regulations.
   He said the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia, had
banned a mass funeral, adding: ``They don't want a large crowd
gathered at one place. It will be too tempting a target for another
terrorist attack.''
   The bomb exploded about 500 yards from an office of Christian
President Amin Gemayel's Phalange Party. It shattered facades of
eight apartment buildings, badly damaged 20 others and wrecked at
least 30 cars.
   The bombing came four days after Syrian troops moved into the
slums of south Beirut, ending three weeks of bloody clashes between
Shiite Moslem militias in which nearly 300 people were killed and
1,000 wounded.
   The Lebanese Forces blamed Syria for the bombing.
   Karim Pakradouni, the militia's second in command, told a news
conference: ``The day before yesterday (Saturday), we received the
propaganda message. Today (Monday) we received the bloody message.''
   He referred to a statement Saturday by Information Minister
Mohammed Salman of Syria, who said presidential elections in
Lebanon would only be possible this summer if the Lebanese Forces
withdrew from east Beirut.
   Syria deployed about 2,400 troops in the slums of south Beirut
on Friday and Saturday to end street battles between the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the Syrian-supported Amal militias.
   The police spokesman said about 40 percent of south Beirut's
estimated 250,000 population who fled the fighting had returned to
the devastated area since the Syrians moved in to enforce a
cease-fire.
   Government buses resumed services in the area today after
bulldozers removed earth barricades used by the feuding factions
for combat positions.
   In December 1985, Gemayel torpedoed a Syrian-brokered peace
treaty intended to end Lebanon's civil war. Pakradouni maintained
Syria wants the Lebanese Forces out of east Beirut to facilitate
the election of a pro-Syrian president and to extend Syria's
control over the whole country.
   Syrian forces now control Moslem west Beirut, most of the
capital's southern slums and Lebanon's eastern and northern
provinces. Most of Lebanon's Moslems, who have been at war with the
Christians since 1975, are backed by Syria.

<HEAD>Fraternity Penalized For Flying Too-Large U.S. Flag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUBURN, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fraternity members have been ordered to
perform community service at a veterans hospital for flying a huge
U.S. flag in violation of a rule aimed at stopping another
fraternity from displaying a Confederate banner.
   ``I don't want to cause any problems,'' said Barry King,
president of the Tau Kappa Epsilon chapter. ``We just want to fly
the American flag.''
   The Interfraternity Council Court at Auburn University ordered
Tau Kappa Epsilon members to work at the Veterans Administration
Hospital in Tuskegee after they flew the 18-by-12 foot flag during
a party.
   The incident violated a 3-year-old school rule designed to block
the Kappa Alpha fraternity from draping its house with a huge
Confederate battle flag. Under the rule, fraternities are barred
from flying flags larger than 5 feet by 7 feet.
   School officials enacted the flag rule in 1985 amid protests by
black students, who claimed that the Confederate banner hung on the
front of the Kappa Alpha house symbolized racial oppression.
   Tau Kappa Epsilon is challenging the flag rule, and a university
committee on fraternities and sororities will likely consider
revamping the guideline, Grant Davis, assistant dean of students,
said Monday.
   Ken Smith, chairman of the fraternity court, told The Auburn
Plainsman, the university's student newspaper, that ``none of us
had a problem with them flying the flag'' at the April 28 party.
   But, he said, some action had to be taken because the rule
against oversized flags was violated.
   ``It was an awkward situation because you don't want to fine a
fraternity for flying the American flag,'' he said.

   When a group of Cub Scouts set out to lay a
wreath at the foot of George Washington's statue, they didn't
expect him to return their salute. But at least he could have
looked their way.
   Members of Pack 469 headed out to the statue in a plaza at the
Brooklyn entrance of the Williamsburg Bridge, where Washington sits
atop his horse, and prepared to salute the nation's first president.
   They found themselves saluting the tail end of the horse.
   It seems the horse and rider face the bridge and Manhattan,
rather than Brooklyn.
   Assistant Cubmaster Thomas Youngfleisch of Pack 469
characterized the situation as embarrassing and said the 800
members of Brooklyn's Dawn Star District of the Boy Scouts of
America will attempt to get the president and his steed turned
around.
   Next year marks the 200th anniversary of Washington taking the
presidential oath in Manhattan, and District Commissioner Reggie
Regula said the Founding Father should be allowed to take a good
look at Brooklyn for the occasion.
   Regula said the Scouts would keep the area surrounding the
35-foot statue clean if the city turned it around. City officials
are contemplating the offer.

<HEAD>Delegates Demand ``General Overhaul'' Of The Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates at a national Communist
Party conference today demanded ``a general overhaul'' of the party
and replacement of those leaders who have led the country into its
worst economic and social crisis in postwar history.
   ``The party needs a general overhaul, and that process has to
start with the presidium (Politburo) of the Central Committee,''
Boro Avramovic, a delegate from the largest republic of Serbia,
said during the third day of the conference.
   Other delegates blamed their leaders for failing to implement
changes to ease the nation's crisis.
   ``It is unlikely that those people who have led us into this
crisis will be able to bring us out of it,'' said Rade Milicevic,
another Serbian delegate.
   Yugoslavia has been wrestling with a $21 billion foreign debt
and unsuccessful attempts to lower its 170 percent inflation and 15
percent unemployment.
   The government Saturday announced austerity measures _ including
an almost 24 percent devaluation of the national currency and
lifting of price controls _ to combat the economic crisis. But
growing labor unrest in protest of the new program is threatening
the current Communist government.
   Luka Miletic, a delegate from Zagreb, said the Yugoslav people
``increasingly insist'' that the entire Communist leadership should
be replaced for failing to implement the necessary reforms.
   Several delegates today called for a special party congress to
be held by the end of this year in order to replace the current
leadership.
   ``We don't need a special congress,'' Zvonimir Hrabar, head of
the state-run trade unions, said today. ``What we need is action,''
he added.
   Party conferences are largely advisory in nature and are
intended to help the ruling party deal with problems arising
between two party congresses. Party congresses, held every four
years in Yugoslavia, have broad powers to make changes in personnel
and party organization.
   Vilma Mancek, from Yugoslavia's economically most advanced
republic of Slovenia, opposed calls for a special congress, saying
it would be ``a waste of time and money.''
   ``Those who demand a special congress should have the courage to
propose the replacement of the party presidium,'' she said, ``since
the Central Committee has the power to recall members of the
presidium'' without holding a special congress.
   ``Young people are reluctant to join the Communist party because
they have no confidence in our organization,'' said Metka Tekavcic,
a Slovenian delegate.
   Party members account for less than 10 percent of the country's
population of 23 million, and their number is rapidly dropping.
   The official Communist publication Komunist said recently that
50 percent of Yugoslavia's young generation shows repulsion toward
party membership, compared with 10 percent seven years ago.
   Komunist attributed this to the general disillusionment with the
party after nearly 10 years of economic decline.

<HEAD>Rabin Meets With Arabs, Says Uprising Is Waning</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout with to UPDATE with details on meeting between
Rabin and Palestinian leaders, Israeli soldier indicted. No pickup.

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin today said he
opened a dialogue with Palestinians, including supporters of the
PLO, because the Arabs should now realize their uprising in the
occupied lands has failed.
   ``I have met with those thought to be tending more to the PLO,
to Jordan. I intend to continue meeting with people who represent
different layers and points of view,'' he told Israel radio.
   Rabin met Monday with four local Palestinian leaders, the second
such session in less than a week.
   ``It is only natural that at this stage of, I hope, the start of
a thought that by stones and firebombs they can achieve nothing,
there's a place to start a dialogue,'' Rabin said today.
   The Palestinian leaders presented Rabin with a list of requests
to ease restrictions and what they termed ``collective punishment
measures'' in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab
participants said.
   Rabin said he told the Palestinians that ``the more we move
towards quiet, the lighter would be the means used ... and ... we
have no intention to take revenge when what they call the intifada
(Arab for uprising) is over.''
   But Palestinian participants said Rabin could not predict any
significant political movement.
   ``The minister said the (U.S. Secretary of State George) Shultz
initiative has missed the train and we can't expect anything'' from
the U.S.-Soviet Moscow summit, said Yasser Obeid, head of the West
Bank health services.
   He also quoted Rabin as saying ``until the elections in Israel
and the United States and maybe six months after ... we cannot
expect an active political process to start.''
   An Israeli soldier, meanwhile, was indicted Monday on a charge
of manslaughter in the killing of an Arab in the Gaza Strip, the
army command said. The Maariv newspaper said the soldier shot the
Arab from a distance of about two feet while talking to him.
   The occupied territories were mostly quiet after Monday's less
than successful strike. It faltered when thousands of Palestinians
ignored orders by underground leaders to stay away from their jobs
in Israel.
   Since violent protests began in the occupied lands on Dec. 8,
198 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed.
   The Israeli-owned news agency Itim quoted Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir as saying Monday that the end of the uprising is in sight.
``The dying down of the violence is clear and certain,'' Shamir
told the agency.
   Shamir's chief rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, also said
in remarks broadcast on Israel radio that Palestinians were
starting to question the value of the uprising. He said they were
asking: ``Where does all this lead to? What are all these strikes,
stones and bottles?''
   Hanna Nasser, a Bethlehem businessman who participated in
Monday's meeting with Rabin, said: ``It was a good thing to meet
with him and exchange ideas.''
   Other participants in the meeting included Othman Hallak, editor
of the An Nahar newspaper in east Jerusalem, and Yasser Obeid, head
of the health services in the West Bank. Nasser said the meeting
was requested by Rabin.
   ``We talked briefly about the situation, the uprising,'' Nasser
said. ``It was a discussion of domestic affairs, nothing
political.''
   The Palestinians, according to Nasser, asked Rabin to free all
the Arab detainees, especially students supposed to attend classes,
to stop demanding tax payment certificates for official
transactions and to ease restrictions limiting the sums the Arabs
are allowed to bring into the country.
   ``Rabin promised to examine that question individually and to
check closely the cases of arrests,'' Nasser said. ``I don't know
if these promises are going to be fulfilled. He said it depends on
how far the uprising will go.''
   The army, meanwhile, said that Pvt. Yakov Tamir confessed and
was indicted on Monday in the killing an Arab on Jan. 10 in Gaza
City. The military court verdict was expected Sunday, it said.
   Maariv wrote that Tamir started to talk to a Palestinian after a
car he was travelling in was stoned. Passengers in the vehicle, the
newspaper said, began to incite Tamir and he shot the Arab in the
stomach. The army declined comment.

<TEXT>
   A small West German plane crossed the
Norwegian border into Soviet air space a year after the dramatic
flight by Mathias Rust to Moscow's Red Square, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said today.
   Spokesman Lasse Seim said the Cessna 150 was on its way from
Ivalo in northern Finland to Kirkenes in the northeast corner of
Norway on Saturday when the pilot strayed over Soviet territory.
   The plane crossed deeper into Soviet air space when it returned
to Ivalo on Sunday, Seim said. He said the aircraft penetrated
``several miles'' over Soviet territory, and may have violated
Soviet airspace for 20 or 30 minutes.
   Norwegian government sources and the West German Embassy
identified the pilot as Andreas Sommer of Hamburg. No further
information on him was immediately available.
   In Helsinki, Matti Autio, spokesman for the Finnish Border
Patrol, said Sommer was questioned and released, and left Finland
today, apparently for Sweden.
   Another Border Patrol official, reached by telephone at the
northern base of Rovaniemi, said Sommer claimed he lost his way due
to bad weather. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed it was cloudy in the area during the weekend.
   A Soviet Embassy spokesman was quoted on Swedish radio as
calling the incident ``a stupid practical joke'' rather than a
provocation.
   ``No one wants to blow up this case,'' Seim said.
   Seim said Norway contacted Soviet authorities on Sunday, and
``we have the impression that they followed the plane. They knew
about it.''
   The Aftenposten newspaper speculated that the Soviet may have
refrained from shooting at the plane because of the superpower
summit in Moscow.
   Seim said the Soviet Border Commission asked for a meeting with
the Norwegians on Monday, when they handed over a formal protest.
   Asked if Saturday's flight was timed to the anniversary of
Rust's flight, Seim said, ``We don't know. But it seems likely,
doesn't it?''
   Rust, also of Hamburg, flew a similar Cessna to Moscow from
Helsinki, Finland, on May 28, 1987, landing outside the Kremlin's
walls. He is serving a five-year prison term in the Soviet Union.
   Rust was 19 at the time he made the flight. On Sept. 4, 1987, he
was found guilty by a Moscow court of illegal entry into the Soviet
Union, violating international flight regulations and malicious
hooliganism. He was sentenced to four years in a labor camp, but is
currently being held in a Moscow prison.
   Rust's flight embarrassed the Soviet air defenses, which failed
to stop him, and prompted a shake-up in the Soviet military.

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis has has virtually
erased the lead held by Republican George Bush in the predominantly
GOP state, a poll indicates.
   The poll, published in Monday's Salt Lake Tribune shows Bush
with a 3-point lead over Dukakis, well within the poll's 4.4
percent margin of potential sampling error. Two months ago,
pollster J. Roy Bardsley said, Bush held a 21-point lead over
Dukakis.
   The Bardsley research organization asked 490 people by telephone
whether they supported Dukakis or Bush. In all, 42 percent favored
Bush, 39 percent favored Dukakis and 19 percent were undecided.
   In late March, the survey showed that 55 percent favored Bush,
34 percent liked Dukakis and 11 percent were undecided.
   Bardsley said the main difference between the two polls is the
switch of independent voters to Dukakis. Independents favored Bush
by a 5-to-4 margin in March, but the latest poll shows independents
support Dukakis by a 5-to-3 ratio.

<TEXT>
   Democratic members of Alabama's congressional
delegation, still lukewarm in their support for Michael Dukakis,
say the Masachusetts governor's chances at the White House would be
greatly enhanced by picking a Southern running mate.
   Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., said he told Dukakis last week that to
win the South in November he would need a Southerner on the ticket,
preferably Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia or Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee.
   ``I gave him some good advice, and I hope he takes it,'' Bevill
said.
   All seven Democratic members of Alabama's congressional
delegation expressed similar sentiments when asked how Dukakis, who
is closing in on the Democratic nomination, can capture Southern
electoral votes.
   ``I would hope he would seriously consider Sam Nunn,'' said Sen.
Richard Shelby, D-Ala. Shelby, a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said Nunn's experience on defense issues would
neutralize Dukakis' perceived weaknesses in the area.
   ``That's an area in which Dukakis is lacking experience,
knowledge and maybe a vision,'' Shelby said. ``It would be a vacuum
that the senior senator from Georgia could fill.''

<HEAD>Libertarian Candidate Applauds Tax Defeat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ron Paul, the Libertarian candidate
for president, says the local activity that helped defeat a
proposed school tax increase in Fort Collins is the kind that will
help turn Libertarian philosophy into public policy.
   Paul appeared in Fort Collins the past weekend for the Colorado,
Wyoming and Alaska Libertarian Convention.
   ``I run to win, but not with any naive belief that that's an
absolute certainty,'' said the former Republican congressman from
Texas. ``A lot of good comes from it _ more attention, more
publicity. It's a grass-roots movement, actually.''
   Mary Margaret Glennie, a Fort Collins Libertarian leader, helped
lead the opposition to a school mill levy increase earlier this
month, and Paul said this is the type of activity the party needs.
   ``She took a Libertarian position and was successful,'' Paul
said.
   In his speech before the convention, which was attended by about
75 people, Paul condemned compulsory public school attendance and
encouraged parents to educate their children privately to obtain
tax credit.
   ``The disintegration of public school systems shows that
government monopolies are bad,'' he told the audience.
   The Libertarian party, which claims it has more than 200,000
registered members, has run presidential candidates since 1972.

   A general strike today shut down a city at the
center of a territorial and ethnic dispute between Armenians and
Azeris in the southern Soviet Union, sources said.
   A Moscow dissident, Sergei Grigoryants, said the strike has been
under way for a week in Stepanakert in the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The strike closed factories and mass transit in the city today,
with thousands of Armenians staying away from work, said a resident
in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. The resident
declined to give his name.
   Also today, the official Soviet news agency Tass announced two
officials in the region were dismissed from the Communist Party for
organizational and political mistakes that led to violence between
Armenians and Azeris.
   Word of the strike in Stepanakert came after a new demonstration
was held Monday in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, said
Grigoryants.
   In the Yerevan protest, 300,000 Armenians took to the streets to
demand that Nagorno-Karabakh, in the neighboring republic of
Azerbaijan, be put under Armenian jurisdiction, Grigoryants said.
   The majority of Nagorno-Karabakh's residents are Armenian.
   Grigoryants, a half-Russian, half-Armenian journalist, said the
protest in Yerevan occurred outside the Opera Theater on a square
where huge demonstrations took place earlier this year.
   Armenians began agitating in February for the right to annex
Nagorno-Karabakh. At the end of that month, ethnic rioting broke
out in the Azeri city of Sumgait in which 32 people _ six Azeris
and 26 Armenians _ were killed.
   Communist authorities rejected the demand to change jurisdiction
over Nagorno-Karabakh, instead chosing a program of social and
economic development. The ruling Politburo also replaced this month
its party leaders in both republics.
   New party shakeups were announced today. Tass said the former
first secretary of the Nagorno-Karabakh regional party committee,
Boris Kevorkov, was dismissed from the party because of his
``serious political mistakes.''
   ``His errors resulted in the loss of the party organization's
vanguard role and in the heightening of inter-ethnic relations,''
Tass said in announcing the action taken by a plenary meeting of
the Azerbaijani party organization. ``He was found to be personally
responsible for the disorders tht took place in the autonomous
region.''
   Tass said the plenum also dismissed from the party D.M.
Muslim-Zade, the former first secretary of the Sumgait city
committee, for ``serious shortcomings in organizational and
political work that brought about the tragic developments in
Sumgait.''
   In another development, Grigoryants said police in Yerevan had
detained two friends of Paruyr Ayrikyan, an Armenian nationalist
arrested in March.
   The two, Mofses Gorgisyan and Nehak Gabrilyan, were accused of
organizing a protest on Thursday, were held for 10 hours and fined
the equivalent of $80, he said. The two are members of Ayrikyan's
nationalist group called the Alliance for National
Self-Determination.
   On Saturday, about 50,000 Armenians in Yerevan were said to have
gathered to demand that authorities free Ayrikyan.
   Ayrikyan, 38, emerged as a primary spokesman for activists
shortly after Armenians began demonstrating Feb. 13 for annexation
of Nagorno-Karabakh. He remains jailed, charged with spreading
false information discrediting the Soviet Union.

   The nation honored its war dead at thousands of ceremonies large
and small on Memorial Day, including a crowd of 15,000 at the
Vietnam Memorial in Washington, while millions of Americans
welcomed the beginning of the summer season.
   A holiday outing in Tillatoba, Miss., was hit by tragedy when a
16-foot boat carrying eight people capsized, killing six young
women aboard the overloaded craft as well as a man who tried to
rescue them, authorities said.
   The operator of the boat said the occupants were enjoying a slow
``joy ride,'' splashing water on each other, when the accident
occurred Monday afternoon.
   A total of at least 340 people died on the nation's highways as
of midnight Monday, according to a state-by-state count by The
Associated Press.
   The National Safety Council had estimated that the long weekend
would claim 380 to 480 lives in traffic accidents. Last year, 416
people died, the Chicago-based council said.
   Although most of the country enjoyed sunny holiday weather, a
snowstorm hit the West on Sunday, dumping up to 10 inches of snow
on southern Utah. Up to 6 inches of snow fell in Wyoming, where
rangers closed large sections of Yellowstone National Park.
   Strong winds battered the California coast, and helicopters
plucked 17 boaters from a beach on Santa Catalina on Monday. On
Sunday, the stormy seas apparently claimed two victims in separate
boating accidents.
   Where the weather was good, people headed for the outdoors. In
Michigan, tourists packed motels and a state park along Grand
Traverse Bay on the state's Lake Michigan side.
   ``Last year we never did fill up,'' Traverse City State Park
Manager Ivan Rockwell said. ``This year, we were full on Saturday
night.''
   In Maryland, a fantasy weekend rock concert broadcast ``live''
by a Baltimore station from an imaginary town called Livestock had
as many as two dozen people calling state police asking how to get
to the concert.
   ``It's like the `War of the Worlds' all over again,'' said Sgt.
Kenneth Frick, referring to the fictional 1938 radio broadcast by
Orson Welles.
   The concert was ``just a way of having fun over Memorial Day
weekend,'' said WGRX general manager Bill Hopkinson. ``Every famous
group in the world was there. It was a nice escape for our
listeners.''
   Other memorial events around the nation included:
   _ A wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns in
Arlington Cemetery in Virginia, across the Potomac River from the
nation's capital, that drew 4,000 people.
   _ In Boston, a cannon on the 190-year-old USS Constitution was
fired 21 times beginning at noon.
   _ In Gettysburg, Pa., retired Gen. William C. Westmoreland, who
commanded U.S. troops in Vietnam and whose ancestors fought for the
Confederacy, said the wounds of the Civil War have not yet healed.
The three-day Battle of Gettysburg and other Civil War
confrontations played a crucial role in the evolution of the United
States, he said.
   _ In Springfield, Ill., officials said the state's new Vietnam
Veterans' Memorial, dedicated less than a month ago, attracted more
weekend visitors than Lincoln's Tomb.
   _ The Kennedy family spent a quiet Memorial Day at their Hyannis
Port, Mass., compound following a small memorial service Sunday for
the 71st birthday of President John F. Kennedy, said family
spokesman Marc O'Connor.
   _ Solemnity was followed by Dixieland jazz at a cemetery in
Omaha, Neb., when a band and a crowd of 100 followed up a Memorial
Day observance with a graveside salute to Anna Wilson, a bordello
madam who left $1 million to charity when she died in 1911.
   _ In Seattle, Washington state Supreme Court Justice Fred Dore
told a Memorial Day audience that paying tribute to the sacrifices
of the past was not enough, and that the nation's ``prayers and
best wishes'' were with President Reagan in his meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to reduce the chances of more war death.
   _Holiday fun turned rowdy at the usually sedate resort town of
Chelan, Wash., and about 400 citations were issued and 150 arrests
made, mostly for public intoxication and consumption of alcohol by
minors.

   A concert broadcast ``live'' from a tiny town
called Livestock, featuring dead rocker Jimi Hendrix and a Beatles
reunion, turned out to be a mirage.
   As many as two dozen people called state police in Hagerstown on
Saturday night and Sunday, asking about the concert in the
non-existent town, said Sgt. Kenneth Frick. Others called state
police in Cumberland.
   Baltimore radio station WGRX-FM was promoting appearances by Led
Zeppelin and the Eagles at an outdoor concert billed as attracting
huge crowds like those that appeared near Bethel, N.Y., for the
Woodstock songfest in 1969.
   And despite disclaimers and radio accounts of lines a mile long
for portable toilets and people sleeping in trees, fans wanted to
be there.
   When Tony Colter came on the air Sunday afternoon, he asked
listeners to stop calling police and said, ``Stay home. The concert
is sold out. We'll bring it to you live on WGRX.''
   And then he promised: ``Coming up at 7 o'clock, live on stage
Jimi Hendrix.''
   The concert was ``just a way of having fun over Memorial Day
weekend,'' said WGRX general manager Bill Hopkinson. ``Every famous
group in the world was there. It was a nice escape for our
listeners.''
   ``Obviously, Jimi Hendrix has been dead for a long, long time,''
Colter said. ``It's supposed to be a fantasy fun weekend.''

<TEXT>
   George Bush, seeking to develop a
platform for the general election contest, was consulting economic
advisers today at his oceanside retreat here.
   Among those expected to meet with Bush was Martin Feldstein, a
former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers.
The outspoken Feldstein, now a Harvard economist, quit his post in
Reagan's first term after clashes with other White House aides over
his advocacy of a tax increase to help balance the federal budget.
   Bush, like Reagan, has vowed opposition to any tax increases.
   Money for Bush's campaign is another issue under close scrutiny
during his week in Maine.
   Though he has been able to raise money quickly through the
primary season, he has now nearly reached the primary spending
limit of about $29 million _ including money for accounting costs.
   Bush told reporters on Tuesday that he might have to cut back on
his travel plans the rest of the summer. That is one of the items
his strategists are discussing this week.
   ``It's expensive to take this show on the road,'' Bush said to
reporters Tuesday.
   The economists he was meeting with today also included Michael
J. Boskin, a professor of economics at Stanford University who is
among Bush's top economic advisers.
   Bush has sought to closely identify himself with the record
65-month peacetime economic expansion, and one of his closest
economic advisers is Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III.
   A Baker protege, former deputy Treasury secretary Richard
Darman, now a consultant with Shearson Lehman Brothers., a Wall
Street brokerage firm, will be among those visiting with the vice
president today.
   Also invited to Bush's summer home were Richard Rahn, chief
economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Kathleen Eickhoff,
a private economist who was formerly the chief economist for the
Office of Management and Budget.
   Reps. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., and Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.; and Sen.
James McClure were also expected to participate in today's session.
   On Monday, Bush confirmed that he had met recently with
embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III and that the two
discussed the impact of Meese's current predicament on Bush's
campaign.
   Bush campaign aides have said that Meese is a political
liability, making it difficult for Bush to pursue his theme of
returning high ethical standards to public office.
   Bush told reporters on Monday that he had met recently with
Meese, and that the attorney general had promised to do nothing to
endanger Bush's presidential campaign.
   Bush has said in the past, and he reiterated on Monday, that he
would withhold judgment on Meese pending the report by the
independent counsel, due out shortly.
   Meese said in a broadcast interview Monday night that if he were
to quit before the report is out, it could reflect badly on Bush.
   ``If I were to quit now, for example, it would be a real
liability because people would say there was something wrong,''
Meese said on CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
   However, he said he would not rule out a departure before the
end of the summer.
   Meese added that his Justice Department has ``a remarkable
record that will be an asset to any Republican running for office
this fall.''
   Bush gave the keynote address on Monday at a Memorial Day parade
here in the town square of Kennebunkport, his vacation home.
   In that speech, in the rain, Bush praised the efforts of
President Reagan in reaching an arms limitation agreement with the
Soviet Union, and said that if elected he would seek to reach
additional agreements, including ones to eliminate chemical and
biological warfare.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev played tour
guide to President Reagan today, showing him the sights on
cobblestoned Red Square near historic St. Basil's church with its
famous onion domes.
   The superpower leaders strolled on the square, where hundreds of
people were lined up to see Lenin's tomb, after they extended their
meeting at the Kremlin by more than an hour.
   They chatted with groups of clapping tourists gathered in the
square amid heavy security. When Reagan mentioned peace and
friendship, people said ``thank you, good'' in Russian.
   ``It was wonderful, I had never actually seen Red Square,'' the
77-year-old president said later.
   Like an American politician, Gorbachev picked up a toddler in a
multicolored suit, and said to the little boy, ``Do you recognize
the president?'' The child did not respond.
   Gorbachev pointed out various features of Red Square which dates
from the 15th century, joking there should be ``no perestroika ..
no rebuilding here.''
   When one woman mentioned peace, Gorbachev said ``women are more
active, but men want peace too.'' Reagan also commented on the
female sex.
   ``I was just saying to the general secretary how much I have
great admiration for the women of Russia. They are courageous,'' he
said.
   The two men seemed in a good humor. ``What we have decided to do
is talk to each other rather than about each other and it's working
just fine,'' Reagan said.
   Gorbachev said he and Reagan sometimes criticized each other's
country, ``But I see that some of this is a misconception about
each other.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reinstate Affirmative Action Plan for DC Fire
Department</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate
an affirmative action plan designed to increase the number of
blacks in the District of Columbia Fire Department.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the plan _
calling for hiring at least six blacks for every 10 job openings _
unlawfully discriminates against whites.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last year that the
hiring quota violates federal law and the Constitution.
   Relying on recent Supreme Court rulings, the appeals court said
the plan is not narrowly tailored to remedy past discrimination.
   The appeals court noted, for example, that since 1981 about 75
percent of those hired as city firefighters are black.
   The appeals court said, ``We are entirely at a loss to discern
any act of hiring discrimination, much less any pattern or practice
of discrimination'' that the quota seeks to remedy. ``There were no
present-day impediments to black hiring. There were no relics from
yesteryear to overcome.''
   The appeals court added: ``To be valid, race-conscious remedies
must in fact be remedial in nature. They are not to promote the
Utopian goal, as some might see it, of a society in strict
proportional racial balance in every employment setting, from brain
surgery to basketball.''
   The appeals court overturned a federal judge's decree approving
the plan.
   The plan had been challenged by white firefighters and the
Reagan administration.
   City officials, in asking the Supreme Court to reinstate the
plan, said the appeals court ruling ``has crippled voluntary
efforts by government employers to eliminate discriminatory
barriers to employment and to cure the lingering effects of past
unlawful discrimination.''
   City officials said past discrimination was caused in part by a
written test for firefighters used from 1969 to 1980 that was not
related to the job and resulted in the hiring of whites for most
openings.
   The city also said that the appeals court ruling has put the
fire department in a bind, with some 100 firefighter vacancies now.
   City officials note that Congress, in an appropriations bill for
the District of Columbia, effectively has barred the fire
department from hiring at random from among applicants.
   The city has hired a testing firm to develop an examination for
hiring firefighters that would pass legal muster. But the exam is
not expected to be completed until 1989.
   Also at stake in the case could be back pay and seniority for
whites allegedly discriminated against by the affirmative action
plan.
   The Reagan administration, urging the justices to reject the
city's appeal, said the hiring quota is improper because there is
no continuing segregation that must be addressed.
   Justice Department lawyers, noting that some 38 percent of the
District of Columbia firefighters are black, said that ``compares
very favorably to the 29 percent black population in the greater
Washington metropolitan area'' that includes parts of Maryland and
Virginia.
   City officials said the relevant figure is the 64 percent
working-age black population within the borders of the nation's
capital. Approximately 70 percent of the city government's
workforce is black.
   The city's appeal was supported by state officials in
California, Illinois, Maryland, Ohio, South Carolina and Wyoming.
   Civil rights groups also urged the high court to reinstate the
plan. They said the appeals court ruling, if adopted elsewhere,
could have a devastating impact on voluntary efforts to fight
racial discrimination.
   The case is Barry vs. U.S., 87-1150.

<HEAD>Justices Say Cable Systems Need Not Carry All Local Signals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to resurrect
federal rules that would force cable television operators to carry
all local TV signals on their systems.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck down
as unconstitutional interim ``must-carry'' rules adopted by the
Federal Communications Commission's in 1986.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last December that
the rules, which were to be imposed for five years, violated
free-speech rights.
   The National Association of Broadcasters, the Association of
Independent Television Stations and other broadcast organizations
urged the justices to reinstate the rules, saying they fear cable
operators may drop their over-the-air signals.
   The appeals court said the need for such rules ``is more
speculative than real.''
   Lawyers for the FCC agreed, and urged the justices to reject the
broadcasters' appeals.
   The appeals court in 1985 said the commission's original set of
rules unlawfully ``coerce speech'' because they required cable
operators to carry local broadcasters' signals irrespective of
whether the operator considered them appropriate programming.
   After the Supreme Court refused in 1986 to disturb that ruling,
the commission issued the interim rules _ forcing cable system
operators to carry local signals for five years.
   The rules entitled a television station to insist that its
signal be retransmitted on any cable system serving the station's
local service area.
   Cable systems, especially those with fewer channels, have
opposed the rules because they often were forced to run the same
programming on a number of stations if stations they are required
to carry broadcast programs from the same television network.
   For example, a cable system in Maryland might be forced to carry
the signal of the NBC affiliates in Baltimore and Washington, even
though the programming is identical much of the time.
   In its December ruling, the appeals court said, ``The FCC's
reimposition of must-carry rules on a five-year basis neither
clearly furthers a substantial governmental interest nor is of
brief enough duration to be considered narrowly tailored (in
imposing) restrictions on speech.''
   In one of the appeals acted on today, lawyers for the National
Association of Broadcasters contended that the appeals court ruling
could affect what television programming is available to tens of
millions of American families.
   ``The lower court has made the television choices that are
available to these homes largely dependent on the economic and
political predilections of the only cable operator to provide cable
service in any given neighborhood,'' the appeal argued.
   But Justice Department lawyers representing the FCC told the
court that during the 16 months between the appeals court's
invalidation of the original must-carry rules and imposition of the
interim rules ``cable operators generally did not stop carrying
local broadcast signals.''
   They said the appeals court's ruling ``gives the commission an
opportunity to observe how broadcasters and the cable industry will
operate without must-carry rules.''
   ``If experience, as opposed to prediction, proves that
must-carry rules are needed to advance public interests, the
commission may build a record supporting new must-carry rules and
defend those rules in the courts,'' the government lawyers said.
   The cases are Office of Communications of the United Church of
Christ vs. FCC, 87-1487; Corporation for Public Broadcasting vs.
Century Communications, 87-1506; National Association of
Broadcasters vs. Century Communications, 87-1510; and Association
of Independent Television Stations vs. Century Communications,
87-1551.

<HEAD>Court Leaves $25 Million Fine Intact for Check-Kiting Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a $25
million fine against a businessman for what prosecutors called the
biggest check-kiting fraud in the history of American banking.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal
question,'' rejected a challenge to a New York law that says those
convicted in such schemes may be forced to pay fines equal to twice
the amount gained through their criminal conduct.
   Edward J. Halloran was convicted of defrauding Marine Midland, a
New York City bank, of $23 million through a complex, synchronized
drawing and depositing of some 15,000 checks.
   The evidence showed that Halloran had accounts at Marine Midland
and Citibank, and that he kept shifting funds from one to the other
for a one-year period that began April 1, 1983.
   His admitted aim was to save his financial empire, including the
Taft Hotel in New York, a Holiday Inn in Fort Washington, Pa., and
several concrete companies.
   Halloran was sentenced to six months in jail and fined $25
million. Harold F. Madden, a co-defendant who was not involved in
the appeal acted on today, was ordered to perform 120 hours of
community service and was fined $100,000.
   Halloran said his fine is excessive and violates his
constitutional rights. He denied that he made anything like a $25
million profit from the check-kiting scheme.
   But state Judge Carol Berkman, in upholding the fine, said
prosecutors demonstrated that the fraud enabled Halloran not only
to save his empire without paying interest but also that his
holdings substantially increased in value.
   Halloran's ``gain'' from the fraud was said to be more than $22
million.
   Moreover, the judge said, ``At trial, to avoid a grand larceny
conviction, the defendants were eager to show the health of
Halloran's financial empire.''
   Afterward, the judge said, ``The empire became moribund: its
gains limited to the amount pumped in from the kite; its losses
oppressive and all but wiping out any capital gains.''
   ``These self-serving arguments and conclusions at sentence did
not rebut the people's evidence that defendants' gains went well
beyond the monies taken in the course of the kite and returned to
Marine Midland Bank upon discovery of the fraud,'' the judge said.
   Halloran argued that he ``borrowed'' the money from the bank and
intended to repay it.
   He repaid Marine Midland some $23 million after a shortfall in
that amount was discovered in his account at the bank.
   In urging the Supreme Court to hear Halloran's appeal, his
lawyers said the case could have a bearing on government seizures
of property and profits from illegal drug operations and other
criminal enterprises covered by the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act.
   ``Constitutional questions concerning the applicable standard of
proof and the permissible limits of the term `gain' are both
important and recurring,'' they said.
   The lawyers said it is unconstitutional for a defendant to be
ordered to pay a fine up to twice the amount of the alleged gain
when proof of that gain is based only on ``a preponderance of the
evidence'' _ the standard used in the New York law. Most often used
in criminal cases is the more stringent ``beyond a reasonable
doubt'' standard of proof.
   The case is Halloran vs. New York, 87-1595.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a $5 million
punitive-damages award won by a California savings and loan
association against an Ohio-based insurance company.
   The justices, over two dissenting votes, refused to hear
arguments that the award, believed to be the largest of its kind
ever upheld in California courts, is unconstitutionally excessive.
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to
hear arguments in the case, but four votes are needed to grant such
review.
   Justice John Paul Stevens did not participate in the case, for
uannounced reasons.
   The high court earlier this month passed up deciding in a
Mississippi case whether the ban on ``excessive fines'' imposed by
the Constitution's Eighth Amendment applies to non-criminal cases.
   No court ever has applied the constitutional principle to
non-criminal cases.
   A California jury awarded the Downey Savings and Loan
Association $123,769 in compensatory damages and $5 million in
punitive damages after ruling that the Ohio Casualty Insurance Co.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Ohio Casualty Corp., had denied
insurance benefits in bad faith.
   Downey had been insured by Ohio Casualty Insurance against any
dishonest or fraudulent act by the savings and loan's employees.
Downey sought to collect on that insurance bond after one of its
branch managers allegedly took part in a conspiracy to bilk Downey
for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   Downey claimed the scheme was partially successful, and resulted
in a lawsuit against the savings and loan by the American Funding
Corp.
   In defending against that suit, Downey paid over $68,000 in
legal fees and $55,000 in settlement costs. Downey in 1977 sought
reimbursement of those expenses from Ohio Casualty Insurance.
   The jury in 1984 found that Ohio Casualty acted in bad faith in
denying Downey's claim.
   The challenged $5 million award was upheld by a state appeals
court, and the California Supreme Court refused to hear Ohio
Casualty's appeal last May 29.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Ohio Casualty argued
that the punitive damages award, and the way it was awarded, ``are
the inevitable, yet unpredictible, products of a system
fundamentally out of control in which fines are becoming larger and
are imposed more frequently.''
   Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rated, in
recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be
recovered in personal-injury lawsuits.
   New Hampshire has abolished the awarding of punitive damages _
those aimed at punishing wrongful conduct that harms others and
deterring such conduct in the future.
   Some commentators have decried soaring damages awards, charging
that such a trend spurs more lawsuits, some of them frivolous, and
that it overcompensates injured people.
   But other commentators contend that awarding punitive damages in
addition to compensatory damages serves a vital public interest in
deterring wrongful conduct.
   The case is Ohio Casualty Insurance Co. vs. Downey Savings and
Loan Association, 87-159.

<HEAD>Times Says Four Hostages In Lebanon May be Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Times of London said today that four hostages
in Lebanon, three Americans and an Indian, may soon be freed
following the Syrian army's takeover of the Beirut district where
they are believed held.
   The paper identified the four as Americans Robert Polhill, Jesse
Turner and Alann Steen, and Indian Mithileshwar Singh, all
educators at Beirut University College. They were abducted Jan. 24,
1987.
   ``The Syrians appear set to produce four Western hostages from
the suburbs of Beirut within a week of their military deployment
there,'' the Times reported from Beirut.
   It said the four ``are now believed to be in the hands of the
Shiite Amal movement, Syria's proxy militia in west Beirut, and to
be in the Bourj el-Barajneh district of the suburbs which is now
under Syrian military control.''
   The Times said Amal leader Nabih Berri, Lebanon's justice
minister, has scheduled a news conference this week, ``and there is
understandable speculation that this may be to announce the
hostages' release.''
   The Beirut newspaper As-Safir reported Monday that the four
educators might be freed soon. The newspaper, which cited
unidentified sources close to President Amin Gemayel, linked the
possible release to the deployment of Syrian troops in Beirut's
southern slums.
   Eighteen foreigners _ including nine Americans _ are believed
held in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief
Middle East Correspondent of The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reduce Award Won from Tampon Manufacturer By
Kansas Family</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reduce a
jury award of more than $11.2 million won from a tampon
manufacturer by the family of a Kansas woman who died of toxic
shock syndrome.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Playtex
Holdings Inc. seeking to reduce the award.
   Playtex was sued by Kelly O'Gilvie, whose wife, Betty, died
April 2, 1983.
   His lawsuit charged that Mrs. O'Gilvie, a mother of two
children, died from toxic shock syndrome caused by her use of
Playtex super-absorbent tampons.
   The company's warning on its package that ``tampons are
associated with toxic shock syndrome'' was inadequate, the suit
said.
   A jury awarded actual damages of $1.5 million and punitive
damages of $10 million. Playtex was ordered to pay 80 percent of
the actual damage award and all of the punitive damages.
   But a federal judge reduced the punitive-damages amount to $1.35
million on condition that Playtex withdraw its super-absorbent
tampon from the market.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the judge's
ruling in June 1987 and restored the full $10 million award.
   The appeals court said, ``The record reveals abundant evidence
that Playtex deliberately disregarded studies and medical reports
linking high-absorbency tampon fibers with increased risk of toxic
shock. There is evidence that Playtex deliberately sought to profit
... by advertising the effectiveness of its high-absorbency tampons
when it knew other manufacturers were reducing the absorbency of
their products.''
   The appeals court also said the judge lacked adequate grounds to
reduce the punitive award.
   The reduction only would be proper if the judge found the award
was ``so excessive that it shocks the judicial conscience,'' the
appeals court said.
   It said by lessening the judgment in return for Playtex'
agreement to withdraw the high-absorbency tampons, the judge
``rewarded the company for continuing its (injury-causing) conduct
long enough to to use it as bargaining chip.''
   Toxic shock, caused by bacteria in the vaginal tract, was first
linked to tampon use in the mid-1980s by the federal Center for
Disease Control.
   The case is Playtex Holdings vs. O'Gilvie, 87-1021.

   President Reagan, in an extraordinary
question-and-answer session with Soviet students, said today that
the United States ``would like nothing better'' than to help in the
search for Soviet soldiers missing in Afghanistan.
   The session, covering topics as diverse as the plight of
American Indians to the two-term restriction on American presidents
and arms control, followed the president's speech at Moscow
University. He took questions from a stage beneath a towering bust
of Lenin and a banner emblazoned with a hammer and sickle.
   Reagan noted that there once had been hopes that he and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev could mark the Moscow summit by signing
a sweeping treaty to cut strategic nuclear weapons by half.
   ``There are many things still to be settled,'' Reagan said, all
but confirming the treaty will not be signed this week.
   ``It is not completed, there are still points that are being
debated,'' said Reagan, who has only one more scheduled meeting
with Gorbachev before departing Thursday.
   ``We are both hopeful that it can be finished before I leave
office'' in January, he said. ``If it isn't, I assure you that I
will have impressed on my successor that we must carry on until it
is signed.''
   One student told Reagan th!t there are 310 Soviet soldiers
missing in Afghanistan after eight years of fighting. The student
asked if Reagan would assist in the search and return of the forces.
   ``Very much so,'' Reagan replied. ``We would like nothing better
than that.'' The United States has vowed to continuing supporting
the Afghan rebels as long as the Kremlin supportsthe Kremlin-backed
regime in Kabul.
   Another student told Reagan that a delegation of American
Indians had traveled here because they found it impossible to meet
with him in Washington. Reagan said he did not know they had sought
an audience, and that ``I'd be very happy to see them.''
   He said the United States had given the Indians millions of
acres of land and established reservations where they could live if
they chose. ``We've done everything we can to meet their demands as
to how they want to live. Maybe we made a mistake. Maybe we should
not have humored them'' and insisted that they become integrated in
American life.
   As for the delegation here, he said, ``I don`t know what their
complaint might be.
   The question-and-answer session followed a speech in which
Reagan preached free markets, freedom of speech and the American
way of life.
   The appearance, at the university where Mikhail S. Gorbachev
earned a degree in 1954, was one in a string of events undertaken
by Reagan to promote the concept of freedom and human rights. White
House planners said the appearance gave Reagan an opportunity to
pass along some thoughts to a generation that one day will govern
the Soviet Union.
   ``Progress is not fore-ordained,'' he said. ``The key is freedom
_ freedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of
communication.'' He praised the economic progress of such
free-market citadels as Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. And he
added:
   ``Perhaps most exciting are the winds of change blowing over the
People's Republic of China, where one-quarter of the world's
population is now getting its first taste of economic freedom.''
   As if that was not challenge enough to the world's other major
communist state, Reagan said he hoped that Soviet families will
soon be free to visit their relatives overseas.
   ``Recently, a few individuals and families have been allowed to
visit relatives in the West. We can only hope that it won't be long
before all are allowed to do so, and Ukrainian-Americans,
Baltic-Americans, Armenian-Americans can freely visit their
homelands just as this Irish-American visits his.''
   Extolling the importance of a free enterprise system in which
entrepreneurs may try and sometimes fail, Reagan said, ``it's so
hard for government planners, no matter how sophisticated, to ever
substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to
make their dreams come true.
   ``The fact is, bureaucracies are a problem around the world.''
   Reagan said ``Americans make no secret of our belief in
freedom,'' and exercise it by choosing a new president every four
years and enjoying freedom of religion, speech and assembly and a
judicial system where the accused is presumed innocent until proven
guilty.
   ``Freedom is the right to question and change the established
way of doing things,'' the president said.
   He said that in his talks with Gorbachev, ``I have spoken of how
important it is to institutionalize change _ to put guarantees on
reform.
   ``And we have been talking together about one sad reminder of a
divided world, the Berlin Wall,'' Reagan said. ``It is time to
remove the barriers that keep people apart.''
   He told the students they are living ``in one of the most
exciting, hopeful times in Soviet history. It is a time when the
first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart beats to the
accelerated rhythm of hope, when the accumulated spiritual energies
of a long silence yearn to break free.''
   He said, ``We do not know what will be the conclusion of this
journey, but we are hopeful that the promise of reform will be
fulfilled.
   ``In this Moscow spring, this May 1988, we may be allowed that
this hope _ that freedom, like the fresh green sapling planted over
Tolstoy's grave, will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile
soil of your people and culture.''
   At a meeting earlier today with writers, artists, film makers
and others, Reagan said freedom for the arts has been expanded in
the Soviet Union in recent years. ``We hope to see it go further.
We hope to see the works of Alexander Solzhenitsyn published in the
land he loves and we hope to see a permanent end to creative
restrictions on all writers and artists.
   ``We want this not just for your sake but for our own,'' Reagan
said. ``We believe the greater freeoms in other countries, the more
secure our own freedoms and peace.''
   He said both artists and political leaders had to be able to
grasp a vision and to put it into life.
   ``By the way, I`ve found that Mr. Gorbachev has the ability to
grasp and hold a vision and I respect him for that,'' Reagan told
the 38 intellectuals assembled in the House of Writer's elegant
wood paneled restaurant.
   Praising what he called the recent thaw in the Soviet arts,
Reagan said he hoped all constrictions on the arts would finally
fall, and that artists like ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov and
cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich would once again
perform in their homeland.
   The president's speech drew a warm standing ovation. Afterwards,
writer Fyodor Burlatsky called it ``one of the best speeches of his
life.
   ``He spoke very sincerely, he spoke about his private life, he
mentioned all the names which are very dear to Russian
intelligentisa,'' Burlatsky said.
   Sergei Zalygin, editor of Novy Mir, a literary journal which has
published several previously banned works recently, was asked
whether he thought Solzhenitsyn's works would appear. ``Yes,'' he
said, declining to forecast when and saying this depended on
negotiations with Solzhenitsyn himself.

   A fire broke out in a high school shed
containing hazardous chemicals, exposing firefighters and residents
to fumes and leaving four people hospitalized today, authorities
said.
   Eighty-three people, firefighters and residents were examined at
Latrobe Area Hospital as a precaution Monday night, shortly after
the fire broke out, said nursing supervisor Lisa Sciullo.
   Those examined complained of throat irritation, burning eyes and
coughing, Ms. Sciullo said, adding that four people were admitted.
   The cause of the fire in the shed about 30 yards from Ligonier
Valley Senior High School was not immediately determined.
   Classes began on schedule this morning, said school secretary
Lois Goodman.
   Gerry Tripoli of the state Department of Environmental
Resources' Bureau of Waste Management said the spillage posed no
danger as long as the area near the shed was kept off limits.
   The shed was used to store chemicals collected from chemistry
labs and photography clubs prior to disposal, said Ligonier Valley
School Superintendent Milroy ``Bud'' Carnahan.
   County Emergency Management Deputy Director Jack Simon said
phosphorous and sulfuric acid posed the greatest danger among the
leaking chemicals.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Award Won by San Diego Gas Station Against
Atlantic Richfield</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a $3.5
million punitive-damages award won by a San Diego gas station
operator against Atlantic Richfield Co.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the award, believed to be the second largest of its kind ever
upheld in California courts, is unconstitutionally excessive.
   John V. Nielsen had operated an ARCO station as an independent
dealer for 12 years before agreeing to convert his service station
to a mini-market and self-service station in 1979.
   His lawsuit charged ARCO with fraudulently misrepresenting facts
in connection with the conversion of his station.
   A state court jury awarded Nielsen $525,788 in compensatory
damages _ $79,061 in out-of-pocket losses, $396,727 in lost
anticipated profits and $50,000 for emotional distress.
   The jury also awarded him $3.5 million in punitive damages
against ARCO.
   A state appeals court upheld the award except for the
emotional-distress damages, and the California Supreme Court
refused to hear ARCO's appeal.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for ARCO argued that the
huge punitive-damages award _ seven times the compensatory-damages
award _ violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on ``excessive fines.''
   No court has ever applied that constitutional principle to
non-criminal cases.
   The Supreme Court in May passed up deciding in a Mississippi
case whether the constitutional ban on ``excessive fines'' can be
applied to personal-injury lawsuits.
   Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates, in
recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be
recovered in personal-injury lawsuits.
   Lawyers for ARCO urged the justices to ``send a clear signal
that the state courts must stop these gargantuan awards.''
   But lawyers for Nielsen argued that the ARCO appeal should not
be granted because the oil company's lawyers had not raised the
``excessive fines'' argument in state courts.
   The justices refused to address the punitive-damages issue in
the Mississippi case decided earlier this month after noting that
it had not been raised in state courts.
   ARCO's appeal did not challenge the $475,000
compensatory-damages award won by Nielsen.
   The case is Atlantic Richfield vs. Nielsen, 87-1196.

<HEAD>ALCOA Must Share in Award to Idaho Woman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Aluminum Company of America failed today
in its Supreme Court bid to avoid having to pay part of a $275,000
award to an Idaho woman hit in the eye by a twist-off cap from a
7-Up bottle.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that ALCOA, which
makes the caps, was partly at fault in the accident.
   Carolyn Sliman of Gooding, Idaho, lost the sight in her left eye
when the cap shot off the bottle Oct. 9, 1979.
   Mrs. Sliman was using a pair of needle-nose pliers to try to
remove the ``pilfer-proof'' band that secures the cap to the bottle.
   A jury found that Mrs. Sliman was partly at fault. But it also
determined that ALCOA knew the use of tools to remove the cap could
cause it to blow off, and should have done more to warn consumers
of the hazard.
   Mrs. Sliman was awarded $130,000 from Alcoa and $145,000 from
7-Up.
   The Idaho Supreme Court last November ruled there was
substantial evidence that ``ALCOA not only foresaw but had actual
knowledge of consumers' using tools to remove caps. The jury
readily could have found that ALCOA could have foreseen Carolyn
Sliman's actions.''
   ALCOA should have done more to assure that 7-Up warned its
customers of the danger, the state court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, ALCOA said Mrs. Sliman would not
have been injured ``if she had simply twisted the cap off the
bottle as approximately 83 million other aluminum caps had been
removed prior to her injury.''
   But the Idaho Supreme Court said there also were consumer claims
that caps had blown off such bottles 229 times in the past and that
ALCOA was aware of the claims.
   The case is ALCOA vs. Sliman, 86-1569.

<HEAD>Court Says New York Can Force Some Judges to Retire at Age 70</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's policy of forcing elected judges to
retire at age 70 even though no such mandatory retirement is
imposed on appointed judges was left intact by the Supreme Court
today.
   The justices, four of whom are over 70, threw out an appeal by
eight current or former New York judges who say the retirement
policy violates the Constitution's equal-protection guarantees.
   The court cited the lack of a ``substantial federal question''
in dismissing the appeal.
   The New York policy, reflected in the state's constitution and a
state law, was upheld by the New York Court of Appeals last Sept. 3.
   The state's highest court ruled that the differing treatment of
elected and appointed judges is valid.
   The state policy previously had applied to state and local
judges in New York, whether elected or appointed. A challenge to it
was rejected by the Supreme Court in 1985.
   But the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which
originally protected only people between 45 and 70 and does not
apply to elected officials, was amended in 1987 to bar employment
discrimination against people over 70.
   New York's policy subsequently was changed to exempt appointed
judges, sparking the equal-protection challenge.
   ``That the state policy requiring retirement of judges is
partially frustrated because the federal statute preempts it with
respect to appointed judges does not render the policy irrational,
and the state is free to pursue that policy to the extent doing so
is consistent with federal law,'' the state court ruled.
   The state court used the least stringent standard of review for
equal-protection challenges, in which courts decide whether a law
or governmental policy that allows differing treatment is rational.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the five state judges
argued that differing treatment based on age should spark the same
stringent standard of review in courts as does differing treatment
based on race.
   The state Court of Appeals rejected that argument.
   The eight judges who challenged the state policy are: Benjamin
Glass, an elected state trial judge in New York City forced to
retire in 1981; Benjamin Nolan and Louis Grossman, elected New York
City Civil Court judges; Barbara Kaiser and Ralph Diamond, elected
state Family Court judges in Westchester and Nassau Counties,
respectively, who turned 70 last year; Samuel Greenstein, an
elected New York City Civil Court judge who is 65; and James P.
Griffin and H. Buswell Roberts, whose judicial positions were not
listed in submitted court documents.
   Federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, are appointed
for life. The four justices over 70 are William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and Byron R. White.
   The case is Diamond vs. Cuomo, 87-1361.

   A billboard advertising company says it
will mark the 20th anniversary of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination
with 38 billboards around the country recalling his life.
   The memorials are to be unveiled Wednesday at sites including
one near the Los Angeles hotel where Kennedy was shot June 5, 1968,
after winning the California Democratic presidential primary.
   Patrick Media Group said in a release from its Hartford office
that branch offices are responsible for creating the displays in
their respective regions. But each billboard will carry a black
border.
   Kennedy, brother of the late President John F. Kennedy and
former U.S. attorney general, was a U.S. senator from New York when
he was killed.
   ``We hope our displays will remind millions of Americans to
pause in their daily routines to join us in honoring his memory,''
said Gerard P. Joyce, president and chief executive officer of the
Patrick Media Group.

   States sometimes may execute convicted
murderers even if their constitutional right to a lawyer's help was
violated, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   By a 5-3 vote, the justices said for the first time that such
errors may be deemed ``harmless.''
   But the justices voted 8-0 in stating that such an error in the
prosecution of convicted Texas murderer John Satterwhite was not
harmless. The decision overturned his death sentence.
   The high court in 1981 ruled that a defendant facing a possible
death sentence if convicted has the right to consult with a lawyer
before submitting to a psychiatric examination designed to
determine his future dangerousness.
   Writing for the court today, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said
violations of that right do not necessarily mean that an ensuing
death sentence, in part based on a finding of future dangerousness,
must be thrown out.
   The court refused to adopt an automatic rule that would call for
reversing the death sentence in any case in which such a violation
occurs.
   a We believe that a reviewing court can make an intelligent
judgment about whether the erroneous admission of psychiatric
testimony might have affected a capital sentencing jury,'' O'Connor
said.
   The ruling thus leaves to a case-by-case review the fates of
other death row inmates whose right to consult with a lawyer before
taking such tests were violated.
   O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan and Harry A.
Blackmun favored imposing an automatic rule to strike down any
death sentence in a case in which such a constitutional violation
occurred.
   ``The unique nature of a capital sentencing determination should
cause this court to be especially hesitant ever to sanction
harmless-error review of constitutional errors that taint capital
sentencing proceedings,'' Marshall wrote for himself and Brennan.
   He said an error such as the one in Satterwhite's case should
not be subject to a harmless-error review.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the case.
   Satterwhite was convicted of the March 12, 1979, murder of Mary
Frances Davis, a convenience store clerk in San Antonio.
   The case is Satterwhite vs. Texas, 86-6284.

   It wasn't the Indianapolis 500, but Gov. Roy Romer
took to the track like a pro in a red Corvette convertible to win
his drag race against a police officer.
   Romer covered the quarter-mile straightaway with a time of

race at Bandimere Speedway's Memorial Day Kops 'N Kids program.
   ``It just got my competitive juices rolling,'' Romer said. ``It
was fun to win. I'd never done it before, and it was fun to learn.''
   Romer beat Adams two out of three times at the event promoting
the Communities for a Drug Free Colorado, the governor's initiative

   Adams is a member of the Race-a-Cop drag-racing team, which
gives teen-agers a chance to test road skills against police
officers in a friendly competition.

   Police used an undercover agent
posing as a prospective buyer today to recover three 19th-century
masterpieces, including works by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cezanne.
   All three paintings taken from Amsterdam's Municipal Museum last
month were recovered undamaged, according to police spokesman Klaas
Wilting.
   The paintings, valued at up to $52 million, were seized when
police raided a hotel and arrested a 36-year-old man who was
selling them for $1.14 million, Wilting said. The money was
confiscated during the raid at the Pullman Hotel, he said.
   The paintings are Van Gogh's 1888 ``Carnations,'' the 1894 still
life ``Bottle with Apples'' by Cezanne, and a work by Dutch painter
Johan Jongkind, ``The House of Maitre Billaud in Nevers,'' done in
1874.
   In their pre-dawn raid, police found the Van Gogh inside the
hotel and the two other paintings in a car parked outside, Wilting
said. The artworks were wrapped in blankets, Wilting said.
   Another police spokesman, Joost van Wijngaarden, said an
undercover police officer had posed as a buyer in the deal, but he
refused to give details.
   Two other people, thought to be genuine prospective buyers, also
were arrested, police said earlier. All suspects were being held
pending charges. None were identified, in line with Dutch police
practice.
   Police refused to say whether the undercover police officer was
posing as a partner of the other two prospective buyers, or whether
police had a role in raising the substantial amount of cash.
   There was no immediate word whether the alleged seller, who has
a police burglary record, was involved in the May 20 break-in and
theft at the Municipal Museum. In that incident, a ground-floor
window was smashed to gain access to the museum.
   Last week, police received anonymous tips that buyers for the
paintings were being solicited abroad, Wilting said.
   ``We got hard evidence of that early this week and that's when
we decided to act,'' said Wilting.
   Museum director Wim Beeren said when the paintings were stolen
that they are so famous it would be almost impossible to sell them
on the open market. He speculated they were stolen on commission by
a private collector.
   The three works were only insured for fire damage, but Beeren
said at the time the huge loss estimate was due in part to the
record prices paid for recently auctioned van Goghs.
   Last November, a collector paid $53 million for van Gogh's
``Irises'' at a New York auction and eight months earlier, the
artist's ``Sunflowers'' was auctioned in London for $29.8 million.
   However, experts at the Christie's auction firm in London said
soon after the Amsterdam burglary that the three paintings together
were worth just $11 million, with van Gogh's estimated at about $2
million. Experts at the Amsterdam museum put the value of the three
at up to $52 million.
   The smashed window in the May burglary at the Municipal Museum
triggered an electronic alarm at the museum's private security
firm, which reportedly took 20 minutes to warn police and
investigate the burglary.
   The museum holds about 3,200 mainly 19th and 20th-century
artworks, but has had no night guard since 1975, when
round-the-clock surveillance was abolished as an economy measure.

<HEAD>W.R. Grace Pleads Guilty To Concealing Chemical Use From EPA</HEAD>

   W.R. Grace Co. pleaded guilty today to charges it
lied about the amount of a hazardous chemical it used at its plant
in Woburn, where residents have blamed pollution of drinking water
for six cancer deaths.
   U.S. District Judge Joseph L. Tauro fined the New York-based
chemical company the maximum $10,000 for understating the amount of
acetone bought by its Cryovac division in Woburn.
   The judge, as part of an agreement between W.R. Grace and
federal prosecutors, dismissed a second charge against the company
that it had concealed the fact that waste materials had on numerous
occassions been dumped behind the plant.
   In a separate civil suit filed by eight Woburn familes, Grace
was found liable for polluting town wells. The case was settled in
1986 for a reported $8 million.
   In Februrary 1982, the company asserted in a letter to the
federal Environmental Protection Administration that it had bought
only one five-gallon pail of acetone in 1978 for the Woburn plant.
   The company said that acetone purchase was the only one it made
for the Woburn plant in 22 years covered by the EPA inquiry.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Tobin Harvey told Tauro that from 1973
to 1976, Grace had bought 65 gallons of acetone and had used the
solvent repeatedly in the 1960s and 1970s to clean paint spray guns
and circuit boards at Cryovac, a food packaging machine shop.
   W.R. Grace attorney Robert Popeo told the judge that no company
officials were aware of that the reports to the EPA were inaccurate
at the time they were filed.
   ``No one suspected ... they committed any act that would have
been hazardous,'' Popeo said.
   W.R. Grace was charged by a federal grand jury in January 1987
with lying to the government about chemicals it used at the Cryovac
plant located near two contaminated Woburn wells.
   The two-count indictment charged that in 1982 Grace knowingly
and falsely reported to the EPA amounts of toxic chemicals bought
and used at Cryovac.
   The indictment also charged that Grace concealed the dumping
outside the plant from the EPA.

   The nation's legislators are having their usual headaches over
budgets and taxes, but they've also found time this year to debate
the merits of key lime pie in Florida, banana slugs in California
and gold in them thar Black Hills.
   It's all part of the perennial mania for naming official state
symbols for just about everything under the sun, from state song to
state insect.
   Supporters say the custom can boost tourism, get young people
involved in the political process and provide harmless comic relief
for lawmakers.
   Opponents say it wastes time and money and makes legislators
look foolish.
   ``It gets so tense in there sometimes. It's just too much,''
said Rep. Mary Vanderlinde in South Dakota, where this year's
Legislature designated the triceratops, a plant-eating dinosaur, as
the official fossil and Black Hills gold as the official jewelry.
   ``This livens it up, and then people will relax and get back to
work.''
   Black Hills gold was honored for its economic importance to
South Dakota. About 2,000 people work in the state's mining
industry and 500 more are employed in making jewelry from the gold.
   Minutes after the gold measure was passed by the House in
January, lawmakers adopted a second, tongue-in-cheek resolution
naming Vanderlinde the state's official jewel because she takes
gold shots for arthritis.
   ``Everybody's human, they enjoy a little touch of
lightheartedness like anyone else,'' said Elaine Knapp, an editor
who helps keep track of official state symbols for the Council of
State Governments in Lexington, Ky.
   ``Sometimes it becomes a tool for schoolkids to become involved
in state government and lobby the legislature,'' Mrs. Knapp said.
``It can also be a recognition of certain things that are
indigenous to the state.''
   The latter was the case in Rhode Island, where the Legislature
voted last year to designate the quahog, the Narragansett Indian
name for clam, as the state shellfish. The idea was pushed by a
junior high school shell club.
   ``We are a tourist state ... and we are an ocean state and if
for no other reason, we should recognize our fishing industry,''
said Sen. Jennie D. Day, the bill's sponsor. ``It's quite serious.
It wasn't done in jest.''
   She said the quahog is beginning to appear on tourist
information and billboards.
   Florida's House voted last month to name the key lime pie the
official state pie, inspired by a legislative report that
recommended the honor as ``an excellent way to promote a genuine
Florida product, since the pie can only be properly made with key
limes from Florida.''
   The measure has stalled in the Senate, where Rules Chairman
Dempsey Barron favors sweet potato pie more common to the Panhandle.
   In West Virginia, the Senate named the monarch butterfly the
state insect in response to a campaign by a group of schoolchildren.
   ``People think it's crazy, but you've got to encourage these
kids,'' said Sen. Mario Palumbo. ``This year, one kid got all
dressed up as a monarch butterfly. They were all excited.''
   The House proved less sympathetic, failing even to consider the
measure.
   On Thursday, the California Senate nearly squashed a proposal to
name the banana slug the state's official mollusk. Sen. Becky
Morgan had to settle for a chance to have the proposal reconsidered
in the future.
   ``These things are repulsive, I mean look at them.... The joke
has to stop here,'' said Sen. John Doolittle, as banana slugs oozed
around inside a glass terrarium on a cart parked on the floor of
the upper house in Sacramento.
   No such shenanigans were allowed this year in Indiana, where
House Speaker Paul S. Mannweiler and Senate President Pro Tem
Robert D. Garton specifically warned lawmakers not to introduce
frivolous bills for the biennial short session.
   ``It creates the wrong image for the Legislature,'' said Garton.
``It's a frivolous image. It creates the image that that's all we
do, and it detracts from the serious business.''
   But Mrs. Knapp in Lexington defended the practice of designating
symbols.
   ``It's not something that takes up a great deal of attention or
time,'' she said. ``I don't think anybody expects every minute to
be taken up with something serious. Maybe it's more harmless than
raising taxes.''

<HEAD>Mrs. Reagan Vows to Write Book Giving Her Side of Astrology Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LENINGRAD, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan said today she might
write a book giving her version of star-gazing in the White House,
and that her account will ``absolutely'' interest former chief of
staff Donald T. Regan.
   During a flight from Moscow to tour this northern Soviet city,
the first lady was questioned for the first time about the flap
over Regan's recently published memoir, ``For the Record.''
   In the book, Regan disclosed that Mrs. Reagan consulted an
astrologer for help in timing the events on President Reagan's
schedule. The former chief of staff also portrayed the president as
an incurious, passive chief executive controlled by a manipulative
wife and media-conscious staff.
   Regan also made clear his bitterness at being ousted from the
White House staff at the height of the Iran-Contra affair. He
contended he was the victim of a cabal created and controlled by
the first lady.
   At first, Mrs. Reagan refused Tuesday to let reporters draw her
into discussing any of Regan's allegations. ``Everything has been
said about that that needs to be said,'' she said.
   Asked if the ``stars were wrong'' for providing an answer, and
she gave her questioner a sharp, disgusted look.
   But when asked if she intended to write her own book about the
matter, she replied, ``Could be,'' and laughed heartily.
   Mrs. Reagan borrowed a line from a Frank Sinatra song to
indicate she was intent on telling her side of the story.
   ``My way,'' she said, pointing at herself and repeating sternly,
``My way.''
   Will Regan be interested in what she has to say? she was asked.
   She laughed and replied, ``Absolutely.''

<TEXT>
   A Pershing II rocket motor was fired
successfully at dawn today, sending a plume of exhaust across the
plains in a pollution test designed to help determine whether the
site can be used to demolish the missiles as required by a new
U.S.-Soviet treaty.
   Originally scheduled for May 20, the test burn had been delayed
again and again because of bad weather. Today was the last day open
for the test under the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces treaty.
   The 56-second test started at 6:35 a.m. at Pueblo Army Depot
Activity 15 miles east of here, officials said.
   ``There was a steady, bright white light from the end of the
rocket nozzle extending approximately 75-80 feet,'' said depot
spokeswoman Mary Wilson.
   A brownish plume stretched out horizontally before the wind
swept it across sagebrush-covered plains and about 50 monitors set
out by the Colorado Department of Health, which will analyze the
exhaust to see if such firings would pose any threat to the
environment.
   ``The firing was conducted successfully. We expect the test
itself will be a success from our initial indications,'' Wilson
said.
   The intermediate nuclear weapons treaty was ratified last week
by the Senate, and copies are scheduled to be exchanged Wednesday
at the summit meeting in Moscow between Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and President Reagan.
   The treaty requires that the Army's 420 Pershing missiles be
destroyed, and the United States plans to destroy the missiles by
firing their rocket motors, which cannot be reused.
   If the test had not been done today, it would have had to be
delayed by at least 30 days because it would have been governed by
the treaty.
   ``If we were to test fire it, it is then treated as an
elimination (of a weapon) under the treaty and subject to
inspection by the Soviet inspectors,'' said Wilson. ``They'd have
to witness it. ... We have to give them 30 days' notice for an
elimination inspection.''
   Brad Beckham, director of the Health Department's Air Pollution
Control Division, said it would be several weeks before a complete
assessment of the test firing data will be complete.
   The Health Department is requiring the test before the Army can
designate the depot for the $9 million program.
   ``We didn't believe that the composition of the propellant would
present any significant environmental problem. We did have some
concern for some of the pollutants and the net result from the test
fire,'' Beckham said.
   Hydrogen chloride, which in extremely high levels can be an
irritant, is one of the pollutants the division will be studying,
Beckham said.
   Beckham noted that a similar test burn was conducted in Alabama
in March.
   Because the Army stores and maintains Pershings at Pueblo, the
installation is the preferred site for demolishing them, but three
other installations also are being considered, Wilson said.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told President
Reagan today it may be ``time to bang our fists on the table'' to
prod negotiators working on a treaty halving strategic nuclear arms
stockpiles. But it was clear that an agreement would not come at
this week's summit.
   ``I'll do anything that works,'' Reagan said.
   Officials in both delegations said the goal was to reach an
agreement before Reagan leaves office next January. Gennady
Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that
``unfortunately, there will be no more signings'' beyond minor
agreements finalized today.
   On their third day of talks, Reagan and Gorbachev met in the
Soviet leader's Kremlin office, sitting beneath a portrait of Karl
Marx. After their discussions, they took an unscheduled stroll on
Red Square past the tomb of Lenin and shook hands with surprised
tourists. ``Wonderful,'' Reagan said of the square.
   Reagan appeared tired and had difficulty following questions
from reporters. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan
had slept poorly and that everyone in the delegation was tired,
despite a four-day rest stop in Helsinki.
   Nancy Reagan, asked about her husband, said, ``He sleeps fine.''
Fitzwater said Reagan was in good health and ``his stamina is just
fine.''
   At a meeting with Soviet students, Reagan was asked about his
impression about Soviet dissidents and refuseniks with whom he met.
Soviet newspapers described one of the dissidents as a collaborator
with the Fascists during World War II. The president said he knew
nothing about this allegation.
   Reagan said Gorbachev ``has been most helpful and agreeable
about correcting'' the problems incurred by those groups. ``We have
the same type of thing happen in our country,'' Reagan said,
blaming it on bureaucrats.
   The Soviet leader expressed new hopes for completing a major
arms treaty, but it was not clear whether he was talking about
getting it done by summit's end _ or merely before Reagan`s term
concludes next January. Soviet and American officials have said
repeatedly they do not expect a strategic arms pact (START) to be
concluded here.
   During an encounter with reporters, Reagan was asked if he still
believed the Soviet Union was an ``evil empire,'' as he has called
it in the past.
   Standing next to his host, Reagan said he no longer thought that
way. ``I was talking about another time, another era,'' the
president said.
   The leaders also watched and joined in the applause as Secretary
of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze signed several secondary agreements, including a pair
of arms accords. Under one such pact agreed to in Moscow, the
superpowers will notify each other of the time, place and intended
target of intercontinental-range missiles tests.
   Reagan, continuing his public relations offensive to promote
freedom and human rights in the Soviet Union, met over lunch at the
House of Writers with artists, filmmakers and writers.
   Talking to some of the Soviet Union's leading intellectuals, he
discussed how an actor could become president _ explaining that
both artists and political leaders had to be able to grasp a vision
and to put it into life.
   ``By the way, I`ve found that Mr. Gorbachev has the ability to
grasp and hold a vision and I respect him for that,'' Reagan said.

   Later, in an address prepared for delivery to students at Moscow
State University, Reagan said the young people were living ``in one
of the most exciting, hopeful times in Soviet history'' when ``the
first breath of freedom stirs the air.''
   He said ``we are hopeful that the promise of reform will be
fulfilled.''
   The president cautioned that ``progress is not fore-ordained.
The key is freedom _ freedom of thought, freedom of information,
freedom of communication.'' He cited steps in Singapore, South
Korea and Taiwan, adding that the most exciting changes were in
China ``where one quarter of the world`s population is now getting
its first taste of economic freedom.''

   At the Kremlin meeting, Reagan appeared to dig in his heels on
his Strategic Defense Initiative missile defense plan, one of the
key obstacles to agreement on a strategic arms treaty. ``It's never
been a part of the negotiations,'' he said in response to a
question.
   Without addressing Star Wars, Gorbachev said he was confident
there would be progress on arms issues.
   ``And I'm sure that if the president makes good use of his time
that we have remaining, I'm sure that we will be able to prepare
the treaty,'' Gorbachev said.
   At that point, a reporter asked Reagan if he, too, thought a
treaty could be concluded. ``Yes, I'm very pleased to hear what
they're saying.'' Asked again if a treaty was possible, Gorbachev
stepped in to answer, saying, ``If that question is to me, yes I
think a START treaty is possible.''
   The Soviet leader recalled that he and Reagan, at their first
summit in Geneva in 1985, had reached an impasse at one point. He
said that at that point, ``the president said, `Well, let's stamp
our fists on the table.' `I said all right,' and by morning
everything was agreed, the Geneva negotiations were successfully
completed.''
   ``Maybe now it is again a time to bang our fists on the table
once again,'' Gorbachev said.
   Asked by a reporter if he agreed, Reagan said, ``I'll do
anything that works.''

   Nancy Reagan, welcomed to the
``Venice of the North'' by tens of thousands of waving and smiling
people, marveled today at the city's art and architectural gems
after paying homage to the 650,000 Russians who starved to death in
Leningrad.
   Mrs. Reagan placed a bouquet flowers at the Monument to the
Heroic Defenders, located near the front line of World War II where
the fiercest battles were fought.
   From there she traveled to the Hermitage, which houses one of
the most fabulous art collections in the world. Paintings by
Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso, Matisse and other great artists can be
found in the collection, begun in 1764 by Catherine the Great.
   ``Staggering, staggering, there's just too much to digest,'' the
first lady exclaimed at the end of her five-hour tour of the city.
   Queried whether she had any more sympathy for communism after
viewing the extravagent finery used by the imperial family before
the revolution, she replied quickly, ``No.''
   As she began her tour of the museum, Mrs. Reagan was asked about
the reception the people of Leningrad had given her.
   ``Wasn't that wonderful,'' she said. ``I was waving, hoping they
would know which car I was in.''
   The outpouring of affection appeared to be spontaneous.
Officials had not released the first lady's motorcade route, which
traveled the length of several of the city's renowned boulevards.
At some points, people lined up several deep on the broad sidewalks
to catch a glimpse of the petite first lady.
   En route to Leningrad, Mrs. Reagan told reporters aboard her
plane that the Soviet people ``are very warm and very open'' but
that she was less impressed with her high-level contacts. ``Their
philosophies and positions are completely different from ours,''
she said.
   Asked about her hand-holding with Raisa Gorbachev, Mrs. Reagan
replied, with a shrug of her shoulders, ``I don't know. It just
sort of happened,'' indicating that it was an action that she
hadn't initiated.
   Lidiya Gromkyo, the wife of Soviet President Andrei Gromyko,
accompanied Mrs. Reagan on the trip.
   The first lady said she found Mrs. Gromyko ``very nice, very
friendly, very warm.'' But asked if she had the same reaction to
her tours with Mrs. Gorbachev, Mrs. Reagan smiled, and sat silent
for a full 12 seconds pondering her answer.
   ``Well, she's a .... everybody's different,'' she finally said,
evoking laughter from the reporters. She joined in.
   Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev will get back together on
Wednesday to view icons in the famous Tretyakhov Gallery in Moscow.
   The trip to Leningrad provided reporters with their first chance
to question Mrs. Reagan about the report by former Chief of Staff
Donald Regan that astrology influenced the president's schedule.
But she refused to be drawn into any discussion of the matter,
declaring, ``Everything has been said about that that needs to be
said.''
   But she also promised to tell her own side of the story, saying
Regan will ``absolutely'' be interested in the contents of the book
she intends to write.
   The first lady started her campaign to visit Leningrad _ and
particularly the priceless collection of art in the 400 rooms of
the Hermitage Museum _ last December when she mentioned her
interest to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at a White House
state dinner.
   Leningrad was constructed on the northern marshland of the Neva
River by Peter the Great in the early 1700s, and has become a jewel
of Russian historical and cultural treasures. But the city is also
a monument to the strength of the Soviet spirit.
   The city was first named St. Petersburg and then Petrograd, and
it was the capital of the Russian Empire from 1703 to 1918.
   It was in the forefront of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, and
its citizens heroically withstood a siege by Nazi forces for 900
days during World War II.
   More than 650,000 people died of starvation during the blockade
and more than 17,000 were killed in air raids and artillery
shelling.
   Traditionally, newlyweds place flowers at the 150-foot high
Monument to the Heroic Defenders, composed of an obelisk and
sculptures with figures such as a mother mourning a dead child.
   The Hermitage's main building, Catherine's Winter Palace, is
itself a work of art. The baroque architecture was done by
Bartolomeo Francesco Rastrelli, an Italian who designed several
other Leningrad landmarks.
   In all, the complex has 1,050 rooms, 117 staircases, 1,886 doors
and 1,945 windows, and many a visitor has become exhausted trying
to see the 65,000 works occupying 400 rooms in the museum.
   Even though guides advise spreading a tour over several days,
Mrs. Reagan had less than an hour to spend at the palace.
   It proved to be a focal point of the revolution when the troops
of Czar Nicholas II fired on peaceful demonstrators, killing as
many as 30 people in what came to be known as ``Bloody Sunday.''
The Winter Palace was a residence of the Imperial Family until the
provisional government occupied it in 1917.
   The final item on Mrs. Reagan's Leningrad agenda was a trip by
hydrofoil to Peter the Great's summer palace, built by the czar as
a monument to Russia's victories over the Swedes in his struggle to
find an outlet to the Baltic Sea.
   The interiors of the palace are a collection of sumptuous and
ornately furnished reception areas, but the highlight is the
collection of cascading fountains, canals and gardens.

   Witnesses watched from the windows of a
popular restaurant as an ultra-light plane crashed and burned,
killing its pilot, a sheriff's investigator said today.
   The pilot had waved to restaurant patrons and was attempting to
regain altitude ``when his left wing folded, the plane started
spiraling and crashed'' several feet from the restaurant's parking
lot Monday night, said Sheriff's Department investigator Tom
Erickson.
   Jeffrey A. Blankestyn, a 34-year-old auto mechanic from
Kankakee, was the pilot, Erickson said.
   ``At this time we don't know if it was pilot error or structural
failure,'' Erickson said.
   No one else was injured in the accident, the investigator said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the Kankakee County
Sheriff's department were investigating, Erickson said.
   According to witnesses, the plane had taken off from the
Kankakee Airport and was headed southwest when it crashed and
caught fire, Erickson said.

   During a question-and-answer session with students at Moscow
State University, Reagan said ``there are many things still to be
settled.''
   ``We are hopeful that it can be finished before I leave
office,'' he said, ``but I assure you, if it isn't, ... I will have
impressed upon my successor that we must carry on until it is
signed.''
   In addition to their walk through Red Square, the leaders also
strolled through the Kremlin`s Cathedral Square, winning applause
from several dozen onlookers. Like any politician, they waved to
the crowds. Moving along with the leaders was a remarkable swarm of
security agents.
   The square had been cleared of people except for hundreds
standing in a single file to view Lenin's tomb and eight groups of
about 25 each stationed in the area of St. Basil's Cathedral.
   The surprise visit to Red Square threw the official summit
schedule out of whack. Reagan told one cluster of people that,
``What we have decided to do is talk to each other rather than
about each other and it's working just fine.''
   Playing the part of tour guide, Gorbachev pointed out landmarks
in the historic square and joked, ``There be no perestroika .. no
rebuilding here.''
   Reagan and Gorbachev approached each of the groups, and
Gorbachev introduced the president at each stop. The crowds
applauded warmly.
   Gorbachev told one group, ``When we meet, the president and I
talk and he sometimes has criticisms about the Soviet Union. I do
the same about America. But I see that some of this is a
misconception about each other.''
   Shultz and Shevardnadze also signed an agreement providing for
joint tests this summer in Nevada and at Semipalatinsk of U.S. and
Soviet devices to measure the force of blasts.
   Another agreement, extending for three years and expanding
U.S.-Soviet cultural exchanges, was signed by Charles Z. Wick, the
director of the U.S. Information Agency, and by Soviet Culture
Minister Vasuky Zamharov.
   Gorbachev told reporters at a Kremlin signing ceremony that his
morning one-on-one meeting with Reagan dwelled on economic
questions.
   ``I criticized the position of the president and the Congress
which has put very many roadblocks on the path of development of
healthy economic cooperation,'' the Soviet leader said. ``The
president considers that we need to move more actively to improve
this.''
   Mrs. Reagan broke away from the presidential party and flew to
Leningrad, where she viewed the treasures of the Hermitage Museum,
housing 65,000 pieces of art, and visited the summer palace of
Peter the Great, scene of revolutionary Soviet history.
   Halfway through their four-day meeting, Reagan and Gorbachev
seemed at ease with each other. They chatted and laughed together
Monday night at a state dinner in the Kremlin's frescoed and
icon-covered Hall of Facets despite lingering differences on human
rights, arms control and other issues.
   Nevertheless, Gorbachev told Reagan they should conduct their
business ``without interfering in domestic affairs, without
sermonizing or imposing one's views and ways, without turning
family or personal problems into a pretext for confrontation
between states.''
   Reagan said they should continue searching for common ground.
Underscoring his lobbying campaign, he gave Gorbachev a videotaped
cassette of an old American movie entitled ``Friendly Persuasion,''
depicting a story set in the Civil War era.
   Gorbachev could be excused for dividing his attention between
the summit and a domestic sensation _ an unprecedented instance of
a fallen Soviet leader publicly criticizing those who ousted him.
   Former Moscow Communist Party chief Boris N. Yeltsin used a
British Broadcasting Corp. interview to accuse the Kremlin's No. 2
official, Yegor K. Ligachev, of blocking Soviet political reforms.
   Yeltsin had been an outspoken supporter of Gorbachev's reforms.
In the interview, he said he was hurt by Gorbachev's refusal to
support him after he criticized Ligachev at a 1987 meeting of the
Central Committee.
   Meantime, the American contingent here was growing. Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd and Bob Dole boarded an Air Force
Boeing 707 in Washington to fly here to attend a ceremony at which
Reagan and Gorbachev will exchange the documents of ratification of
the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty. The treaty was
approved by the Senate last Friday and the Soviet Presidium the
following day.
   In the absence of agreement on a new, major arms treaty on
strategic nuclear weapons, the already-ratified accord will serve
as the crowning element of the summit windup on Wednesday. Reagan
bids Gorbachev farewell on Thursday and flies to London. On Friday,
he returns home.
   U.S. officials said several cultural and bilateral agreements
were ready for signing today. The two sides have been working on a
three-year extension of the educational and cultural exchanges
signed by the two leaders in Geneva in 1985. They also were
expected to sign agreements on fisheries, cooperating on search and
rescue operations at sea and the exchange of transportation
technologies.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Reagan and
Gorbachev had discussed on Monday _ but found no agreement on _
Reagan's plans for a ``Star Wars'' space-based anti-missile
defense, the biggest obstacle to a START agreement to cut
superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov reported there was progress
in two of the most biggest obstacles to a treaty, involving mobile
missiles and cruise missiles fired from warplanes.
   However, a U.S. official, while reporting progress, was not as
upbeat. The official, who refused to be identified, said there
still were problems in agreeing on how to count the air-launched
cruise missiles.
   As for land-based mobile missiles, the official said, ``we
haven`t heard a verification scheme we think will work. ... I would
not expect closure'' on the problem.
   Gorbachev, in his Kremlin dinner toast, said: ``Our main task
continues to be the working out of an agreement on 50 percent
reductions in strategic offensive arms while observing the ABM
Treaty,'' the landmark 1972 agreement between the superpowers
limiting missile-defense systems.
   Reagan, in his answering speech, said: ``I intend to pursue the
search for common ground during the months left to me as President.
When I pass the job on to my successor, I intend to tell him it is
a search that must be continued.''

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down Way Ohio Promotes Tax Credits the Use of
Gasohol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today unanimously struck
down the way Ohio promotes through tax credits the use of
``gasohol,'' a motor vehicle fuel less environmentally troublesome
than gasoline.
   The court ruled that the Ohio tax-credit scheme, challenged by a
gasohol producer in Indiana, interferes unconstitutionally with
interstate commerce.
   Gasohol is the common name for a blend of 90 percent gasoline
and 10 percent ethanol, a 199-proof alcohol derived from corn and
other sources.
   Use of gasohol reduces the toxic emissions from leaded motor
vehicle fuels. To advance environmental goals, most states and the
federal government have offered tax credits for the production and
sale of gasohol.
   Prior to 1985, Ohio offered reductions in its fuel taxes for
fuels containing ethanol, regardless or where the ethanol was
produced.
   But since 1985, the state Legislature has extended the credit to
gasohol containing ethanol produced out of state only if it comes
from a state in which Ohio-produced ethanol receives a tax credit.
   The credit for gasohol amounts to about 25 cents per gallon.
   The reciprocity feature of the state law was challenged by New
Energy Co. of Indiana, which produces gasohol at its South Bend,
Ind., plant and in 1985 was shipping about 25 percent of its output
to Ohio distributors.
   New Energy said it was priced out of the market in Ohio when it
lost its tax incentives.
   The Ohio Supreme Court struck down the tax-credit law as
unconstitutional by a 4-3 vote in late 1986. But shortly thereafter
two of the justices in the court's majority were voted out of
office.
   In 1986, the newly constituted state court granted a rehearing,
and Ohio's tax credit for ethanol was upheld.
   Today, the nation's highest court said the Ohio Supreme Court
was wrong.
   Scalia said the law ``imposes an economic disadvantage upon
out-of-state sellers, and the promise to remove that if reciprocity
is accepted no more justifies disparity of treatment than it would
justify categorical exclusion.''
   The case is New Energy Co. vs. Limbach, 87-654.

<HEAD>Court Overturns Murder Conviction and Death Sentence of Georgia
Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today unanimously overturned
the murder conviction and death sentence of a Georgia man accused
of a 1977 killing in Putnam County.
   The justices ruled that Tony B. Amadeo should have been allowed
to raise the issue of discriminatory jury selection in a federal
court appeal.
   The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled
that Amadeo was not entitled to raise that issue because his
lawyers failed to comply with a state procedural rule requiring
such objections to be raised before trial.
   The appeals court rejected a federal judge's finding that
Amadeo's lawyers could not be expected to have learned about the
discrimination against women and blacks in the selection of Putnam
County grand juries and juries before Amadeo's trial began.
   In a separate case, Putnam County officials were found to have
structured the jury-selection process in a way in which blacks and
women were under-represented.
   Writing for the high court today, Justice Thurgood Marshall said
the appeals court should not have rejected the judge's finding
unless convinced it was ``clearly erroneous.''
   ``Because there is sufficient evidence in the record considered
in its entirety to support the district court's factual findings,
the court of appeals should not have set them aside,'' Marshall
said.
   ``The district court's conclusion that (Amadeo's) lawyers did
not deliberately bypass the jury challenge was supported by events
contemporaneous with the jury-selection process,'' Marshall added.
   Amadeo had been convicted in the Sept. 29, 1977, killing of
James Turk Sr. Prosecutors said Amadeo was one of three men
involved in the crime, each of whom was a Marine absent without
leave from Camp LeJeune.
   Today's decision means Georgia officials must give Amadeo a new
trial or set him free.
   The case is Amadeo vs. Kemp, 87-5277.

<HEAD>Court Will Settle Case Between Delaware and New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to settle a
multi-million dollar dispute between Delaware and New York over
unclaimed dividend and interest payments on securities.
   The justices granted Delaware's request that it be allowed to
sue New York in the Supreme Court without the case first having
been heard in some lower court.
   The court has such ``original'' authority in disputes between
states.
   The conflict stems from the fact that 15 of the nation's largest
stock brokerage firms are incorporated in Delaware but based in New
York.
   Each year, the firms recover substantial amounts of money in
dividend and interest payments for people who cannot be located.
   All states have so-called ``escheat'' laws providing that such
abandoned money goes into the state treasury after remaining
unclaimed for a certain time.
   In Delaware, the waiting period is seven years. In New York, it
is three years.
   Delaware's escheat law is binding on all corporations chartered
in the state, but New York considers brokerage firms with New York
trading addresses subject to its escheat law and has pursued
unclaimed payments.
   Delaware Attorney General Charles M. Oberly III said New York
has been collecting such payments from Delaware-chartered brokerage
firms since 1971. He said more than $50 million could be involved.
   Oberly told the justices, ``New York should be directed to pay
Delaware amounts already paid to it to which Delaware is or will be
entitled under the Delaware escheat law and to cease interfering
with Delaware's right to escheat the property of unknowns held by
the Delaware brokerage corporations.''
   But New York Attorney General Robert Abrams urged the high court
to reject Delaware's lawsuit.
   He said Delaware has not yet exhausted all administrative
remedies, and added that New York is entitled to the dividend and
interest overpayments held by brokerage firms with New York trading
addresses.
   ``Delaware's failure for 17 years to employ New York's claim
procedure, in contrast to other states, or to attempt to negotiate
with New York before bringing this original action demonstrates
that the case is not ripe for decision by this court,'' Abrams
argued.
   The case is Delaware vs. New York, 111 Original.

<HEAD>Court Gives Federal Regulators Power to Oust Bank Executives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today gave federal
regulators broad power to oust bank executives from their jobs
temporarily when the executives are accused of serious crimes.
   In a 9-0 ruling, the court said the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. acted properly in suspending an Iowa bank president.
   The justices upheld a law permitting the FDIC to suspend a bank
executive accused of serious wrongdoing for up to 90 days while the
agency decides the executive's appeal for reinstatement.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said a bank
executive's ``interest in continued employment is without doubt an
important interest that ought not be interrupted without
substantial justification.''
   But Stevens said, a suspended officer also ``has an interest in
seeing that a decision concerning his or her continued suspension
is not made with excessive haste.''
   The case stems from the indictment in 1986 of James E. Mallen,
president of the now defunct Farmers State Bank of Kanawha, Iowa,
on charges he made false statements to the FDIC.
   Mallen was accused of concealing financial interests in other
businesses and of concealing loans his banks made. His small
agricultural bank in a town of 750 people had assets of $18 million.
   He was convicted in federal court last year and sentenced to
three years in prison and fined $10,000. He was ordered to spend
only 60 days in jail and the rest of the sentence was suspended.
   Prior to his criminal trial, the FDIC barred him from continuing
as bank president and director, prohibited him from taking part in
running the bank and said he could not vote his stock in the bank's
holding company.
   The FDIC acted under a law empowering federal banking regulators
to suspend executives charged with crimes involving dishonesty or
breach of trust that are punishable by imprisonment for more than
one year.
   The law gives the executive a right to appeal to the regulatory
agency. But the statute allows the agency to take up to three
months to resolve the appeal.
   Moreover, the law does not guarantee the banker a chance to
present oral arguments in making the appeal.
   A federal judge ruled Mallen's rights were violated by the
suspension and by the ban on oral testimony to the FDIC.
   The Reagan administration, on behalf of the FDIC, appealed the
ruling to the Supreme Court.
   The case is FDIC vs. Mallen, 87-82.

   Jury selection began today in the
case of a Jordanian-American couple who allegedly hired a hit man
to kill their daughter's husband, his mother and his sister, and
cut off pieces of their bodies as souvenirs.
   The murder plot, which the prosecution says was hatched because
the daughter had been promised to someone else in a marriage
arranged by the parents, never was carried out.
   The case of Dr. Saud Tarawneh, 46, and his 44-year-old wife,
Ghada, involves a clash between the American ways of love and the
family's culture, where murder to avenge one's honor is acceptable,
their lawyer says.
   ``Keeping body parts as souvenirs _ I don't think is normal,''
said Assistant State Attorney William Dimitrouleas, adding that he
expects unusual testimony in the Broward Circuit Court trial.
   After several routine motions, jury selection began late this
morning.
   The parents left Jordan 18 years ago and lived in Toledo, Ohio.
When their daughter married her Syrian cousin in 1986 and moved to
Tamarac, Fla., tradition required that insult to be avenged, the
prosecution says.
   The parents, arrested February in Toledo, are accused of
conspiracy and solicitation to commit murder for allegedly hiring
an assassin and attempting to have the victims' body parts
preserved and shipped to Toledo.
   A private investigator that prosecutors say the couple hired to
find a hit man cooperated with authorities in their criminal
investigation. The assassin was supposed to receive an initial $500
and $2,000 after the killings, according to authorities.
   Agents taped phone conversations between the investigator and
the family, said Mike Breece, an investigator with the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement.
   Defense attorney Barry Roderman said threats about killing and
cutting off body parts are common in the Middle East, but are
seldom carried out.
   ``There's a definite clash of cultures here between the Arab
mind and the American mind,'' he said. ``The Tarawnehs are from a
tribe where they handle their problems their own way, inside the
family.''
   The parents declined to comment.
   Tarawneh, a gynecologist who became a U.S. citizen in 1980, and
his wife, a nurse, already had arranged a marriage for their then
17-year-old daughter, Raniah, and refused to allow her to marry
Mouataz Abdulsalam, now 28.
   ``My father said, `Don't mention this again,''' the daughter
said in a sworn statement. ``I think he was against the whole idea
of me marrying someone I wanted to.''
   The alleged targets were their unwanted son-in-law, his younger
sister Azza and his mother Najwa, 45.

<HEAD>Justices Pave Way for Some Deregulation; Consumer Benefit Eyed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a decision the Reagan
administration says could save consumers an estimated $100 million
a year, cleared the way today for price deregulation of some
natural gas.
   The justices, 8-0, reversed an appeals court ruling that had
placed a floor under the gas prices.
   The appeals court ruling was challenged by the administration,
the New York State Public Service Commission and natural gas
distributors who buy from producers.
   The dispute was over interpretation of the Natural Gas Policy
Act of 1978, a federal law that phases out regulation of natural
gas prices and is designed to assure an adequate supply of gas for
delivery across state lines.
   Prior to the law's enactment, there was a ceiling on the price
of gas sold interstate but no such regulation for gas produced and
sold within the same state.
   The two-tier system prompted producers to commit more of their
supplies to the intrastate market, causing shortages in interstate
supplies of natural gas.
   The 1978 law created a complicated system of phasing out price
controls that divides gas into three categories _ old, new and
difficult-to-produce gas.
   Generally, the price regulations applied more to old gas and
lifted controls for new gas to encourage discoveries and production.
   Old gas is that produced from wells operating before the law was
passed, and new gas is that from wells that began producing after
the law's passage. The third category covers gas produced by
particuarly high-cost methods, such as that obtained from between
layers of more impervious rock.
   The gas supplies involved in the case decided today overlap the
categories, qualifying for both regulated and deregulated treatment
under the 1978 law.
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 1985 eliminated
controls for such ``dually qualified'' gas _ allowing the price to
be determined by the free market.
   The commission said maintaining controls would lead to a
regulated price higher than the free-market price _ an opposite
effect from the one intended by Congress in enacting the 1978 law.
   But the 10th Circuit court, acting on appeals by gas producers,
said the commission's deregulation rule violated the 1978 law.
   Writing for the high court today, Justice William J. Brennan
said the appeals court wrongly overturned the commission's rule. He
said the commission's interpretation of the 1978 law was correct.
   Justice Byron R. White did not participate in the case for
unannounced reasons.
   The case is FERC vs. Martin Exploration Management Co., 87-363.

   Eduardo Colindres, deputy information minister, said Duarte will
leave San Salvador at a 2 p.m. (4 p.m. EDT) in a private plane for
Washington, D.C., where he will undergo treatment at Walter Reed
Army Medical Center. Earlier, a secretary reported Duarte was going

   Government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that before his departure, Duarte planned to meet with members of
his Cabinet, the Roman Catholic Church and prominent private
leaders to tell them about his health.
   Doctors in El Salvador diagnosed a gastric ulcer last week and
recommended the 62-year-old president seek treatment outside the
country.
   Under the Constitution, Vice President Rodolfo Castillo
Claramount will assume the functions of the presidency while Duarte
is out of the cuntry.

   Fire broke out at a freight terminal early
today, forcing officials to evacuate more than 800 people and close
schools because of pesticides stored in the building, officials
said.
   The fire at a Roadway Express terminal, in a primarily
residential area just outside the city, was reported about 12:30
a.m., said fire Capt. Robert Clayton. No serious injuries were
reported.
   A dark gray cloud shifted after daybreak and blew several
hundred feet above a school where most evacuees were taken.
   Polyvinyl chloride containers caught fire late in the morning,
prompting firefighters to pour water on the blaze to extinguish it.
The containers were smoldering, and authorities were concerned that
the smoke could cause watering of the eyes, nausea and diarrhea.
   All public and parochial schools in Alliance were closed today,
and officials in two districts east of the city also closed some
schools.
   Ed McNabb, director of the Alliance Red Cross chapter, estimated
that 800 people, including 90 nursing home residents, were at
Stanton Middle School. Other evacuees went to the homes of
relatives and friends.
   By mid-morning, residents were returning to the nursing homes
because, officials said, they would be better off there than in the
crowded school gymnasium.
   ``We're quite happy there are no major medical problems,'' said
William Rodman, a physician at Alliance Community Hospital who went
to the school. ``Most of the medical problems we've seen are the
chronic ongoing kind. There are only one or two patients
complaining of symptoms that might be associated with a toxic
chemical such as burning eyes and nausea.''
   Evacuees came from about 10 square miles around the fire. Safety
Service Director John Benincasa urged other people to remain
indoors because of drifting smoke.
   The evacuation was ordered after officials discovered a
pesticide company stored chemicals in the building, said Mike
Dalton, manager of spill response for the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Officials could not immediately determine what types of chemical
fumes might be in the air. ``Most pesticides break down readily in
high temperature,'' he said.
   Officials had originally planning to let the fire burn out to
reduce possible runoff of contaminated water. Workers were
attempting to dam such water as was used.
   Clayton said Roadway Express and Consolidated Trucking used the
building as a freight terminal while Clem Lumber Co. and The d-Con
Co. used it as a warehouse.
   Terry G. Kelley, spokesman for Sterling Drug Inc. in New York,
said d-Con was leasing space to store rodenticides and pesticides
made at its Alliance plant, as well as manufacturing components.
   Alliance is about 50 miles southeast of Cleveland and has 24,000
residents.

   A sharpened consumer appetite for fish and
seafood offers an opportunity for American farmers to reel in a
share of a growing worldwide aquaculture industry, says a report by
the Agriculture Department.
   Expanding world population and growing consumer demands have
already forced some nations to harvest ``previously underutilized
species'' of fish and seafood, and to develop alternative sources,
the report said.
   ``Many commercial fisheries, which harvest from the wild, are
approaching their maximum sustainable yield,'' it added. ``Thus
aquaculture _ growing fish or other aquatic life in a controlled
environment _ is expanding.''
   Americans are also honing their appetites, last year consuming
more fish and seafood per person than veal, lamb and mutton,
roasting chicken or turkey. Beef, pork and broiler chicken,
however, remain far in the lead as American favorites.
   In 1980, aquaculture accounted for 13 percent of the global
production of aquatic foods and goods, up from 7 percent in 1970.
Industry sources indicate that by the year 2010 aquaculture will
provide 25 percent of the worldwide aquatic harvest.
   The report was included in the June issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine issued by the department's Economic Research
Service. The article was written by economists Mike Dicks and Dave
Harvey.
   By 1981, total U.S. fish consumption had grown 30 percent from
1970. About 47 percent was imported.
   ``Population growth accounts for only half the increase,'' the
report added. ``Per capita U.S. consumption of fish and shellfish
has grown, reaching a record 15.4 pounds (edible weight) in 1987.
It is expected to expand another 50 percent by 2010.''
   Dicks said in a telephone interview that the 1987 per capita
consumption figure included only 0.5 pound of the estimated 3 to 5
pounds per capita of U.S. aquaculture production. The half pound,
he said, only included catfish and none of the other species,
ranging from trout and salmon to oysters and shrimp.
   Despite the recent increases, U.S. per capita fish and seafood
consumption is well behind Europe, which averages 40 to 45 pounds
per person, and Japan, which averages 130 to 140 pounds annually.
   Per capita consumption of veal last year by Americans averaged
1.5 pounds; lamb and mutton, 1.3; mature chicken, 2.5; and turkey,
15.2. Beef consumption was 75.5 pounds; pork, 58.8; and broiler
chicken, 60.1. Those are retail weights as sold by grocery stores.
   The U.S. aquaculture industry _ fish farming _ has expanded
greatly in recent years but still is led by catfish, produced
primarily in the South. In 1986, for example, the U.S. aquaculture
harvest was nearly 620 million pounds valued at more than $496
million.
   Of those amounts, catfish comprised 327 million pounds worth
$229 million to growers, the report showed.
   Comparatively, in 1980 the total harvest was 203 million pounds
valued at $192 million, with catfish comprising less than 77
million pounds at a value of $54 million.
   Catfish, crawfish, salmon and trout make up about 90 percent of
the total U.S. aquaculture production.
   By 2010, according to industry estimates, U.S. aquaculture
production is expected to exceed 2 billion pounds, and that doesn't
count production from ``catch-out'' ponds and direct sales to
consumers, the report said.
   A study in Mississippi showed that for every 10 million
additional pounds of catfish produced, 220 new jobs are created in
the industry, and 1,100 jobs are created in related industries.
   Most catfish are grown in Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas,
while salmon output is mainly in Washington and Oregon, crawfish in
Louisiana and Texas, and trout in Idaho.
   Channel catfish east mostly soybean products and corn. To get a
pound of catfish requires one pound of soybean meal, a half pound
of corn meal, and a half pound of other nutrients.
   Nearly 55 percent of the usual diet of farm-grown salmon are
also from the farm _ 17 percent whey, 16.5 percent wheat germ, 15
percent cottonseed meal, and 6 percent soybean oil.
   The report said aquaculture is suited to small as well as
commercial farms and that a modest operation can provide
significant income.
   ``Many agricultural institutions still regard aquaculture as a
sideline,'' the report said. ``Even so, aquaculture has become a
technical and highly capitalized commercial enterprise.''
   One problem has been the ``limited information'' available to
potential lenders, the report said. As a result, it added, many
federal agencies have been reluctant to aid aquaculture producers
financially.

   Muscovites responding to their first peek at U.S.
television news say they wish it had more music and less talk, but
they still are wide-eyed over glimpses into the personal lives of
government leaders and average Americans _ even when they don't
understand the language.
   Cables News Network is being broadcast into central Moscow
during the summit under an agreement with the state broadcast
agency Gostelradio. Those Muscovites lucky enough to own recent
model television sets can pick it up on Channel 6.
   It also is available in the Rossiya Hotel overlooking Red
Square, where many foreign journalists are staying. Maids and
plainclothes KGB agents are often seen sitting together before
television sets in halls, watching attentively and sometimes with
the volumn off.
   For most, it marks the first time they have seen fast-paced,
round-the-clock, up-close-and-personal American television.
   Television news imported from the United States is a far cry
from the Soviet evening news show Vremya. The show has been jazzed
up in recent months with new graphics and backdrops, but it is
still dry and focuses on agricultural reports and Politburo
announcements.
   A 46-year-old clerk who would only give her first name,
Svetlana, said she was watching American news this week as often as
she could.
   ``I enjoyed learning something about the private life of former
President Carter,'' she said, smiling shyly. ``I saw him on a
fishing trip. For us, this is very unusual.''
   ``I would like to see such things about General Secretary
(Mikhail S.) Gorbachev on Vremya. But for the moment, we have only
rumors about his personal life,'' she said.
   Svetlana said she understood some English. But a lack of
language comprehension has not stopped Soviets from tuning in to
CNN, sometimes for hours.
   ``We've watched at least two hours a night all this week, even
though I don't know any English,'' said Lyubov Ivanova, 50. ``I
wish it had more music, but I'm still very interested. It is nice
to see President Reagan in Moscow and now I would like to see one
of his movies.''
   Both Svetlana and Mrs. Ivanova said they were disappointed that
the stories on American television, which last an average of two or
three minutes, were so short. On Soviet television, an item like a
Gorbachev speech can take up the entire newscast, which is
sometimes extended to two hours.
   CNN producer Ruth Oxenberg said the network was broadcasting its
program only in central Moscow and had received comments and
telephone calls from Soviets which indicated it was widely watched.
   ``We know sometimes official Soviets are not happy about the way
we do our reporting, but we think it is good for Moscow that we
were allowed to do this,'' she said.
   Moscow-born Andrei, 25, agreed.
   ``I think it is important to see even these small pieces of the
lives of Americans,'' Andrei said.
   ``We Soviets may be able to learn things that could help us,''
he said. ``For example, the Americans seem so relaxed and social
compared with us. Maybe we can learn how to take it easy by
watching them.''
   Andrei said he was disappointed to learn CNN would go off the
air here once President Reagan leaves Moscow on Thursday. ``It's
too bad,'' he said. ``I wish American TV could stay here and our
show Vremya could go to the United States. Television should have
no borders.''

<HEAD>Bomb Explosion in Punjab Market Kills 6, Wounds 32</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb hidden in a plastic bag exploded
in the crowded vegetable market of a Hindu town in Punjab state
Tuesday, killing six people and wounding at least 32, police
reported.
   They blamed Sikh extremists for planting the bomb in the market
at Dinanagar, 50 miles northeast of Amritsar, the Sikh holy city.
   It went off at about 6:30 a.m. as people were beginning their
morning shopping, said D.S. Khala, deputy police commissioner of
Punjab. He said most of the victims were Hindus.
   Dinanagar is in the Gurdaspur district, where seven bombs have
killed at least 13 people this year. The bombings are blamed on
extremists who have been fighting since 1982 for an independent
Sikh nation in Punjab, the only Indian state where the sect has a
majority.
   On Monday, an explosion in a crowded market in Amritsar killed
23 people and wounded 44.
   Police initially said the cause appeared to be the accidental
ignition of a propane gas cylinder. But the United News of India
quoted Suresh Arora, the Amritsar district police chief, on Tuesday
as saying it was a bomb, probably set off by remote control.
   Authorities blamed Sikh extremists for the Amritsar explosion.
   Two Hindu-dominated political parties sponsored a general
protest strike Tuesday in Amritsar that closed many stores and
offices.
   The bombing deaths and the killing of a Sikh man Tuesday in the
Amritsar district raised to at least 1,230 the number of deaths
blamed on Sikh radicals in Punjab so far this year, 200 more than
the 1,030 in all of 1987. Most of the gunmen's targets are Hindus,
but they also kill Sikh moderates.
   Police defused two bombs in a New Delhi residential neighborhood
Tuesday, and a bomb scare delayed the departure of a Paris-bound
Air India jet for more than 16 hours, Indian news agencies reported.
   Press Trust of India said the two bombs were found in a plastic
bag in the Kailash Nagar neighborhood and defused by the police
bomb disposal squad.
   Air India's Flight 123 to Paris was delayed because an anonymous
telephone caller said a bomb was aboard, but a search revealed no
explosives, United News of India said. There was no claim of
responsibility for either incident in the capital.
   Thousands of people have been killed since Sikh militants began
their violent campaign for a homeland in Punjab, a rich
northwestern state that is India's main agricultural region.
   Sikhism was founded 500 years ago as an alternative to Hinduism
and Islam. Members of the sect, who make up only 2 percent of
India's 800 million people, claim discrimination by the predominant
Hindus.

<HEAD>Teachers Begin Indefinite Strike; Classes Put off for 2Oth Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schoolteachers began a strike for more pay
Tuesday. It was the 20th time in the past three months that public
schools have been closed because of teacher work stoppages.
   Unlike past strikes, this one was called for an indefinite
period. It was the first indefinite work stoppage by civil servants
in the public administration since Spain returned to democracy in
1977.
   The strike meant no classes for the nearly 6 million students in
Spain's public elementary, secondary and technical schools. There
is just one month left in the regular school year.
   The six unions representing Spain's 272,000 public
schoolteachers approved the indefinite strike Thursday. The
government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez broke off negotiations
after the strike was approved.
   Teachers are demanding pay parity with civil servants of similar
qualifications and monthly pay increases of $223 by September 1990.
   Teachers at elementary schools earn an average of $929 a month.
Teachers at secondary and technical schools earn about $1,090 a
month.
   On May 4, five of the six teachers unions reached a tentative
agreement with the Education Ministry for a monthly pay increase of
$178 by September 1990.
   The teachers branch of the Communist-oriented Workers
Commissions union opposed the pact, and a referendum was held May
16. Of the teachers who voted, 75 percent rejected the pact.
   A government decree published last week forces teachers to
guarantee students their required tests and final exams by June 30
or face suspension from their jobs for three to six years. The
unions said teachers would comply.
   In announcing the breaking off of talks last week, government
spokesman Santiago Varela, said ``this kind of strike is
unjustified.''
   ``It threatens the constitutionally guaranteed right of
education for students and impedes further talks in search of a
reasonable and just solution,'' Varela added.
   The National Confederation of Student Associations has
criticized the teachers' indefinite strike, as has the National
Confederation of Parents of Students.

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Michael Dukakis moves closer to the
Democratic presidential nomination, some Florida Democrats are
pressing him to choose Sen. Bob Graham as his running mate.
   Rep. Bill Grant, for one, is heading a group of Floridians
writing Graham-promoting letters to Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, as
well as to uncommitted Democratic delegates and other party leaders.
   The group has distributed 500 ``Graham for V.P.'' buttons, and
Grant said a formal committee will be put together as the
Graham-backers expand.
   ``We're trying to create a national awareness that he is a
viable possibility,'' said Grant, adding that the committee hopes
to flood the national convention in July with Graham banners, signs
and stickers.
   Another active Graham supporter is state AFL-CIO President Dan
Miller.
   ``Bob Graham is not only a favorite son, he's a very strong
candidate,'' Miller said. ``He was a very popular Southern
governor, and he would bring a Southern flavor to the ticket.''
   Other Florida Democrats have mixed feelings about the effort by
Graham supporters, one of the better organized efforts across the
country to promote possible vice presidential candidates.
   Though many Democrats want Dukakis, a Northeasterner, to pick a
Southerner, Graham isn't the most frequently mentioned possibility
from that region.
   ``Not to take anything away from Bob Graham because Graham is
very qualified, but my strong recommendation would be Sam Nunn,''
the Georgia senator, said William Boyd, a Tallahassee attorney and
Dukakis supporter.
   Graham's press secretary, Ken Klein, said in Washington,
``Senator Graham is not seeking a spot on the ticket. He is not
active in trying to make the phone ring. He has been flattered by
the suggestion that it might ring.''
   Meanwhile, state Party Chairman Charles Whitehead feels pulled
in two directions.
   ``The greatest thing for me as party chairman would be Bob
Graham on the ticket, because I believe that would ensure us of
carrying Florida,'' Whitehead said. ``But the worst thing for me
would be to have Gov. Bob Martinez get to appoint a senator.''
   If Graham were elected vice president, the Republican governor
would appoint someone to serve as senator until a special election
in 1990.

   President Kurt Waldheim will make an
official visit to Saudi Arabia this month, his chancellory
announced Tuesday.
   The visit is scheduled for June 4-6.
   The statement said planned visits to the United Arab Emirates
and Kuwait have been postponed because of an upcoming Arab summit
in Algiers.
   Waldheim, who was elected in June 1986, has not been invited or
received by any Western heads of state because of allegations about
his World War II past.
   He visited Pope John Paul II in June 1987 and visited Jordan a
month later at the invitation of King Hussein, whom Waldheim
welcomed in Vienna earlier this year.
   An international commission of historians in February questioned
Waldheim's moral integrity as a second lieutenant serving in the
German army in the Balkans during World War II.
   It said Waldheim knew of Nazi war crimes but did nothing to
prevent them. It left open the question of whether he was guilty of
atrocities.
   Waldheim has denied any wrongdoing.

   A Continental Airlines DC-9 with 84 people
aboard narrowly misseda small plane when the
jetliner's pilot took evasive action while preparing to land, a
Federal Aviation Administration official said today.
   The encounter occurred in restricted air space at about 7,000
feet Monday afternoon about 5  colliding with miles southeast of Cleveland-Hopkins
International Airport.
   ``The small plane did not show up on radar. We don't know if he
had a transponder or, if he had one, if it was on,'' said spokesman
Mort Edelstein from his Chicago office. A transponder makes an
aircraft more visible on radar.
   Flight attendant Milotka Liebelt was injured as Continental
Flight 283 made a sharp climbing turn to the left. She was treated
at Southwest General Hospital for bruises to her batain explained the incident
to passengers after they landed in
Cleveland.
   ``Thank God that our first officer responded instantly,'' said
Mrs. Liebelt, who has been a flight attendant for a year.
   She said the passengers remained calm and none were injured
because they were all in their seats in preparation for landing.
   The Continental pilot reported the incident to the FAA as a near
collision, estimating the distance between the planes as 100 feet
vertically and the span of the DC-9's wing horizontally.
   Small planes entering restricted airspace near airports are
required to get tower permission and to carry transponders.
   There was no immediate indication whether the private plane also
took evasive action, or whether its pilot even saw the airliner.
The Continental pilot told the FAA that he gained 800 feet of
altitude in making his maneuver. The airliner landed safely in
Cleveland.

   A small fishing boat hit a mine in the
Gulf of Oman today and exploded, killing one fisherman and injuring
the two others on board, United Arab Emirates officials said.
   The official Emirates News Agency quoted an Interior Ministry
statement as saying the blast occurred off Dednah, about 20 miles
south of the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf.
   The Interior Ministry said all the victims were Indians. The two
survivors were rescued by another fishing boat and taken to
Fujairah for treatment.
   The area where the explosion occurred is just north of an
anchorage off Khor Fakkan used by tankers and other commercial
vessels. The anchorage is the staging area for U.S. Navy-escorted
convoys of American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers.
   At least two vessels hit mines in the area last autumn. One, a
small offshore supply boat, sank with the loss of six crewmen.
   The previous mine explosions, which U.S. and other officials
blamed on Iran, prompted United Arab Emirate authorities to close
the anchorage temporarily. No mines had been reported in the Gulf
of Oman for several months.
   The United States reflagged the Kuwaiti vessels to protect them
from attacks that are an offshoot of the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war.

   The year's first tropical depression has formed 150
miles southwest of Havana just in time to inaugurate the 1988
Atlantic hurricane season, forecasters announced today.
   ``We don't expect significant strengthening,'' said
meteorologist Randy Lascody of the National Hurricane Center.
``Generally the winds at this time of the year are not favorable
for that.''
   Even if the weather system's 30 mph winds did strengthen, its
current 5 mph north-northwest course would take it across Cuba,
probably breaking up the depression, he said.
   The Caribbean system is expected to continue its path through
Wednesday, when a reconnaisance plane will investigate.
   For a depression to be upgraded to a named storm, winds must
reach 39 mph, and the system becomes a hurricane only when it
breaks the 74 mph barrier.
   The 1988 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins Wednesday.

<HEAD>Chemical Drums Aboard Italy's Ship Of Poison Are Damaged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENOA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some drums of chemical waste aboard a
freighter dubbed the ``ship of poison'' are damaged, and guinea
pigs will be used to see if any dangerous substance is leaking, the
port commissioner said Tuesday.
   More than 2,200 tons of unidentified wastes from Italian
chemical companies are in about 12,000 drums aboard the freighter
Zanoobia, which docked in Genoa on Sunday after spending more than
a month anchored off the coast of Carrara.
   The wastes were originally shipped from Italy 15 months ago but
were rejected by four countries before officials in Genoa agreed to
let them unload.
   Genoa port commissioner Giuseppe Francese said the guinea pigs
will be lowered into the ship's holds to see if they suffer any
toxic effects.
   Francesco Rizzuto, a lawyer for the ship's owner, Tabalo
Shipping, said a chemical analysis of the wastes must be completed
before the unloading begins.
   Francese said the entire process, including unloading, transport
and incineration of the wastes, could take two months.
   The Zanoobia is the last of three freighters used to ship the
wastes to ports in Djibouti, Venezuela, Syria, Greece and then back
to Italy.
   ``We could have vetoed docking of the ship in an Italian port,
but it looked like an unfair decision since the waste had
originated from Italy,'' Francese said.
   Lawyers for Tabalo Shipping say two people have died, possibly
after being contaminated by the wastes. A boy in Venezuela died
after playing near the cargo, and a Zanoobia crewman died during
the voyage to Italy from Greece.
   Five crewmen were hospitalized last month with symptoms possibly
caused by exposure to the wastes. Three others were treated and
released Monday.
   Dock workers walked off the job Monday to protest the smell and
fumes spreading from the Zanoobia, but they returned to work
Tuesday because the ship was moved to a more isolated part of the
port.
   The wastes originally were shipped from the Tuscan port of
Marina di Carrara in February 1987.
   Rizzuto said a group of Italian chemical companies paid the
Milan-based company Jelly Wax about 40 cents a pound to dispose of
the waste. He said the company instead shipped it out of the
country.
   The first ship took it to Djibouti, then to Venezuela, where it
was unloaded. After the boy died, the government ordered the wastes
shipped out of the country.
   It was loaded on a second ship bound for Syria, where it was
transferred to the Zanoobia. That ship made one stop in Greece
before it took the wastes back to Carrara.

   A gas explosion tore through a coal mine in
central China and killed at least 49 people, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported Tuesday.
   Xinhua said only seven people survived the blast Sunday at the
Shengfo mine in Huoxian County, Shanxi province. One person was in
serious condition.
   The explosion caused cave-ins and damaged ventilation
facilities, Xinhua said. The cause of the accident was under
investigation.
   Coal mine disasters are frequent in China, particularly in small
mines where safety regulations are ignored.
   More than 50 people died in a gas explosion in a coal mine in
southern China's Guizhou province on May 6. Another 28 miners died
in Heilongjiang in the northeast in February, and 44 were killed in
an explosion in a mine in Anhui province, central China, in
December 1987.

consideration'' as a vice presidential candidate if Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis should beat him for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Jackson, while refusing to give up his own fight for the top
spot on the ticket, said of front-runner Dukakis, ``If he wins,
I've earned consideration.'' He said that if he wins the nomination
he will give Dukakis the same consideration.
   The civil rights activist also was to give a speech on urban
policy today, one week before elections in New Jersey, California,
New Mexico and Montana close out the Democratic primary season.
   Jackson said in Trenton today that he and Dukakis must work
together to defeat Vice President George Bush, the Republican
Party's all-but-certain nominee.
   ``Together, we must use our combined strength to change the
course,'' Jackson said.
   ``If I put forth a vision, then reward me,'' Jackson added.
   Dukakis, who is expected to win enough delegates to sew up the
nomination next Tuesday, said Sunday that Jackson would have a
major role at the Democratic National Convention and in the fall
campaign.
   On Monday in New Jersey, Jackson, who upset Jews and others by
calling nearby new York ``Hymietown'' in his presidential bid four
years ago, issued a Memorial Day call for blacks and Jews to unite.
   Feelings were still high in the New York primary this spring,
and Mayor Edward I. Koch said Jews would have to be crazy to vote
for Jackson. But Jackson drew cheers in Englewood from a mixed
crowd of black and white supporters.
   Citing the holiday and its commemoration of America's war dead,
he told a story of black U.S. soldiers coming upon a Nazi
concentration camp in World War II.
   He offered the meeting between the GIs and Jewish survivors as
an example of how blacks and Jews might unite now.
   ``Cannot the sons and daughters of the victims of the Holocaust
and the sons and daughters of slaves find common ground? That is
the challenge of our day,'' Jackson said.
   He added, to cheers, ``Let's take a journey. Let's take our
nation beyond anti-Semitism.''
   In the past week, as the primary season draws to a close,
Jackson has been making policy statements, coupled with a call for
his proposals to be included in the Democratic Party platform.
   Last week in California, he released a five-year budget plan,
and has been urging front-runner Michael Dukakis to adopt some of
his foreign policy views. Dukakis is well ahead of Jackson in polls
taken in New Jersey and California.
   The Massachusetts governor said Monday he expected Jackson would
have a role in his likely fall campaign against George Bush.
Jackson concurred.
   ``I expect to have a big role at the convention and a big role
this fall,'' said Jackson. ``That role has not been determined ...
I will exercise my own options.''
   On Monday, Jackson observed Memorial Day with a call for world
peace.
   ``Study war no more,'' Jackson told a crowd as he campaigned
here. ``Nations must not rise up against nations.''
   He also laid a wreath at a war memorial.
   ``War is absurd. War is obscene. Peace is reasonable,'' said
Jackson.
   Earlier, at a rally at city hall in nearby Elizabeth, Jackson
talked about the thousands of Vietnam War veterans who cannot
afford housing while the nation spends billions of dollars on
defense.
   ``We're not just sacrificing veterans, we're sacrificing old
people, we're sacrificing sick people, we're sacrificing the
homeless,'' he said. ``I want to lead our nation beyond war.''

<HEAD>FTC Approves Major Grocery Takeovers</HEAD>

   A pair of acquisitions involving four major
Western grocery chains won tentative approval Tuesday from the
Federal Trade Commission.
   In one case, American Stores Co. will be allowed to acquire
Lucky Stores Inc., provided that American sells off between 31 and
37 stores in California plus its interest in a Midwestern chain.
   In the second instance, Vons Companies Inc. will be allowed to
acquire three Safeway divisions with stores in Southern California
and Nevada, provided a dozen California stores are sold to other
companies.
   Both acquisitions were approved by 3-1 votes, with Commissioner
Mary L. Azcuenaga dissenting. The vote opens both mergers to public
comment, after which the commission will make the decision final.
   Under terms of the FTC approval, American stores promised to
sell at least 31 and possibly as many as 37 stores in California
within six months after the merger. In addition, it will sell its
half interest in Eagle Food Centers, a Midwestern chain.
   In their agreement with the commission, Vons and Safeway agreed
to sell 12 stores to other companies before completing Vons
takeover of the three Safeway divisions.
   American Stores, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, operates
supermarkets across the nation under the names American, Acme,
Alpha Beta and Jewell. Lucky is based in Dublin, Calif.
   Vons is based in El Monte, Calif., while Safeway has its
headquarters in Oakland, Calif.

   The chimes from Spassky Tower heralded President
Reagan on Tuesday as Mikhail S. Gorbachev led his guest onto the
ancient cobblestones of Red Square _ stones so famous that even a
reformer wouldn't think of repaving them.
   They first turned in the direction of St. Basil's Cathedral with
its multicolored facade and onion domes. Reagan gazed upward at the
15th century cathedral as Gorbachev pointed and apparently
explained some of its features.
   The square that draws millions of Russian and foreign tourists
annually had been swept clear of people, save for the single-file
line of those waiting silently to enter the Lenin mausoleum, and
eight groups of selected Soviets standing by to meet Reagan.
   ``So let us welcome the president,'' Gorbachev said as he
approached one of the groups of about 25 people, who burst into
applause with shouts of hello.
   Bystanders voiced concerns ranging from nuclear war to
cooperation in space between the superpowers.
   ``You should apply some pressure on the president. You are
always pressuring me for results,'' Gorbachev joked to the crowd
when peace issues were broached.
   The two leaders emerged from the Kremlin onto the square shortly
after the changing of the guard at Lenin's tomb. The colorful
ceremony is performed hourly and draws crowds of tourists, even at
midnight.
   After strolling past the cathedral, the red-painted Spassky
Tower, the contemporary marble structure where the body of Vladimir
I. Lenin rests, and the fur trees planted along its edge, Reagan
proclaimed the square ``Beautiful.''
   ``This is our flag waving over the Kremlin,'' Gorbachev proudly
told the president.
   ``And there,'' he said, pointing over the Kremlin wall to the
area behind the mausoleum, ``is one of the most beautiful rooms in
the Kremlin, perhaps in the world.''
   As they walked along the cobblestones of Red Square, Gorbachev
remarked: ``There should be no perestroika _ no rebuilding here.''
   Gorbachev, in explaining the history of area, pointed toward the
Kremlin side of Red Square and to where he said Vladimir I. Lenin
had worked. The leaders walked in the area of the mausoleum, but
Reagan did not enter to see the embalmed body of the founder of the
Soviet state.
   ``We want friendship between the two people,'' Reagan told
bystanders. ``What we have decided to do is to talk to each other
rather than about each other. And that's working.''
   Gorbachev gently chided Reagan for saying ``some critical
things'' during their talks.
   ``I do the same thing about America,'' he added. ``But I see
that some of this is based on misconceptions about each other.''
   As they strolled, Gorbachev quoted a few Russian proverbs,
adding what he called an extension to one of them.
   ``If arguments are at the boiling point, then truth
evaporates,'' he said. ``So we should have dialogue.''
   At one point, Reagan seemed to think Gorbachev was dwelling too
long on past exchanges of criticism.
   Putting his arm around Gorbachev's shoulder, he said, ``Before
this goes too far, let's do something.''
   Gorbachev reached out in one group to take a little boy into his
arms. The boy, Alyosha Filatov, peered at Reagan as the general
secretary asked, ``Do you recognize President Reagan?''
   The little boy looked at Reagan, saying nothing.

   Four murals that may be America's oldest
wall paintings have been restored after years hidden under paint
and varnish and go on display Wednesday, showing a whimsical side
to colonial New England life.
   The three walls surrounding the central stairway of Portsmouth's
Warner House are thought to have been painted around 1716 when the
mansion, now a National Historic Landmark, was built for a ship
captain.
   The first scene, at the foot of the stairway, shows a woman
working at a spinning wheel, a standard symbol of hearth and home,
said conservationist Christy Cunningham, who supervised the
restoration.
   But the coziness ends quickly.
   Next to the woman, a dog barks at an eagle that has just swooped
down to snatch a dead, bleeding chicken in its claws. Up the
stairs, in a biblical scene, Abraham raises a sword over his head
to kill his son Isaac. And guarding the landing are two formally
dressed Indian chiefs _ the king of the Mohawk Wolf tribe and
Prince of the Rivers _ invited to England in 1710 to discuss an
alliance against French colonists in Canada.
   Only at the top of the stairs is there a gentleman on horseback,
perhaps a military officer, whose red coat, three-cornered hat and
white wig restore the image of stately, puritanical New England.
   What the 500 square feet of paintings mean, who painted them and
why the scenes were put together as they were are mysteries. But
Cunningham says their theatrical qualities indicate a freer
colonial lifestyle than is generally acknowledged.
   ``It's not what often comes to mind,'' she said. ``The dainty
people, their tea parties, can you imagine them living with this
stuff roaring at them every day?''
   ``This is so bold and playful, it's hard to understand right
away, but in fact these should help us understand better the way
people lived. It's not the dainty people rustling around with
pursed lips. They were wild people. They wore pink skirts and wigs
and they were playful.''
   Whether the murals are the oldest of their kind depends on
whether the man on the horse is Alexander MacPhaedris, the home's
original owner, said Mary Black, a former curator and director of
folk art museums in New York and Williamburg, Va. She believes the
man is MacPhaedris.
   ``As far as I know, they are the earliest extant interior wall
paintings in the 13 colonies,'' she said.
   Cunningham's work at Warner House included stripping away damage
by earlier restorers.
   Two walls had been concealed under wallpaper. The most recent
restoration attempt was in the early 1950s, when a colored varnish
was added to cover imperfections and make the paintings look
antique, she said.
   Cunningham and several assistants started work Feb. 1. They used
techniques learned working on wall paintings from ancient Rome, the
only other society that decorated ordinary homes in such a way.
   After the old paint was stripped and the chipping paint
stabilized, they filled cracks with ``gesso,'' an ancient mix of
natural Italian calcium carbonate and rabbit-skin glue.
   Cunningham did not do fresh painting.
   ``These are old paintings and they've been through a lot, and
I'm not going to push them with a lot of make-up and make them look
new,'' she said. ``Let it be old.''
   The project was paid for by the non-profit Warner House
Association, which raised $100,000 from residents and foundations.
   The home was a private residence until the 1930s, when money was
raised to buy it to prevent it from being torn down to make way for
a gas station, said Margaret Harrington, a past president of the
Warner House Association.
   Many colonial murals were destroyed by Americans who did not
realize their worth, Cunningham said.
   ``The Pompeii paintings were decorations of houses, just like
ours,'' she noted. ``They (Americans) go off to Europe to look at
other people's paintings then come home and rip out their walls.''

   Jesse Jackson had the campaign trail to himself today, pushing
for the Democratic presidential nomination but talking about the
vice presidency, as George Bush spent the day at his Maine home and
Michael Dukakis worked at his Statehouse office in Boston.
   Jackson, while still pressing his presidential bid in New
Jersey, said that if Dukakis beats him ``I've earned
consideration'' for the No. 2 spot on the party's election ticket.
He said he would give Dukakis the same consideration if Jackson
wins the nomination.
   Dukakis, who is expected to sew up the nomination in next
Tuesday's primaries in New Jersey, California, Montana and New
Mexico, planned to fly to California to resume campaigning on
Wednesday.
   ``Together, we must use our combined strength to change the
course,'' Jackson said today. ``If I put forth a vision, then
reward me.''
   Dukakis and Jackson both said over the Memorial Day weekend that
Jackson would play a major part in Dukakis' expected fall campaign
against Bush. But both said the nature of that role hadn't yet been
worked out.
   Bush, who was meeting with economists today at Kennebunkport,
Maine, has been taking a beating in recent public opinion surveys
matching him against Dukakis. He has said Reagan administration
controversies were probably partly to blame for his showing.
   He hasn't singled out Attorney Gen. Edwin Meese III as one of
those sore points, but both Jackson and Dukakis have criticized the
attorney general, who is under criminal investigation, and have
urged him to quit.
   The vice president, who has refused to call for Meese's
resignation, confirmed Monday that the two recently met privately.
   Bush declined to detail what was discussed, but when asked if
Meese had promised to keep from hurting his campaign, he told
reporters: ``Yes, yes, I think it's fair to say that.''
   Meese, in an interview on CNN on Monday night, said he and Bush
had ``talked frankly about the campaign,'' and said he believed it
would harm Bush if he were to step down at this time.
   ``If I were to quit now, for example, it would be a real
liability because people would say there was something wrong,''
said the attorney general. ``I think it's important to George Bush
... as well as myself that the record be set straight.''
   However, in the interview on the ``Larry King Live'' show, Meese
left open the possibility that he might leave office by the end of
the summer. Pressed by guest host Pat Buchanan, a former White
House aide, as to whether he might step down by Labor Day, Meese
responded: ``I don't think I'd rule anything in or anything out.''
   Bush says he doesn't want to comment on the Meese matter until
after an independent counsel's report is issued. The vice president
says he expects that will be soon.
   In any event, Meese said, the Justice Department has a
``remarkable record that will be an asset to any Republican running
for office this fall.''
   Bush was turning his attention today to economic affairs. He had
meetings scheduled with advisers including Martin Feldstein, former
chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
   Dukakis was spending today at the Statehouse in Boston. On
Monday, he met with black supporters from around the country and
told them that Jackson would play a part in the campaign leading up
to his expected November face-off with Bush.
   ``I think we can put together as strong a coalition that has
ever been put together for any presidential campaign,'' the
governor told reporters after the closed session.
   Jackson, who was campaigning in New Jersey, said he expected to
have ``a big role'' at the convention and in the fall, but said it
hadn't been worked out yet.
   ``I will exercise my own options,'' he said.
   There are 466 Democratic delegates at stake in next Tuesday's
primaries _ enough to put Dukakis over the 2,081 needed to
nominate. The Massachusetts governor can lay claim to more than
1,700 delegates now, compared with fewer than 1,000 for Jackson.
   Jackson, however, has his own agenda. He has been using the
final primary campaigns to push forward the ideas he wants
incorporated into the party platform, and to underline the historic
nature of his presidential effort. Jackson is Dukakis' sole
remaining rival for the nomination, out of the eight Democrats who
declared their candidacies.
   ``Never forget this campaign,'' Jackson told supporters on
Sunday.
   All three candidates made Memorial Day observances on Monday.
   The vice president gave a speech in Kennebunkport's town square
after the local Memorial Day parade. Bush pointed to the superpower
summit under way in Moscow, saying the arms control agreement
eliminating intermediate-range weapons would not have been reached
``if the United States had not been strong.''
   Jesse Jackson sounded a pacifist theme as he paid tribute to
those who died in battle.
   ``Study war no more,'' he told a crowd as he campaigned in New
Jersey, in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. ``Nations must not
rise up against nations.''
   Dukakis attended a Memorial Day service in Boston.

<HEAD>Algae Carpet Spreads to Danish Waters, Threatens Tourism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blanket of yellow sea algae that
killed hundreds of tons of fish along the coasts of Norway and
Sweden is now threatening Danish fishing and tourism, officials
said Tuesday.
   ``There has been a significant drop in fish exports since the
explosive growth of algae in Danish waters in recent days,'' said
Poul Toerring, director of the Fish Industry and Export Association.
   Dead fish were found in three locations along the coast of
Denmark since the algae spread from the southern coasts of Norway
and Sweden last week, Toerring said in a statement. Tests were
being conducted to determine whether the fish were killed by the
algae, which suffocates fish by clogging their gills.
   ``There is nothing to indicate that the growth of algae has
culminated,'' said Henrik Sandbech, deputy director of the state
Environment Agency.
   The agency's emergency staff is worried that the algae could
spread even further along the coast later this week, when winds are
forecast to shift.
   Experts blamed nitrates from agricultural fertilizers and
phosphorus from sewage and industrial pollution for the dramatic
growth of the single-cell plants.
   Carpets of algae up to 10 feet thick have been found about 33
feet under the surface of the water.
   Resort owners along the west coast of Denmark's Jutland
Peninsula fear news of the algae might ruin the lucrative tourist
trade this summer.
   ``If the algae plague gets worse in the next 14 days, we risk a
nose dive in the number of West German tourists,'' said Kurt
Larsen, head of tourism in west Jutland.
   Tourism is a $2.3 billion business in Denmark, and about 10
percent of that amount comes from Jutland.
   In Norway, fish farmers were advised by marine biologists to
kill their fish. As a result, the farmers have lost salmon, sea
trout and other domestically grown fish worth $38.5 million.
   Some fish, particularly herring and flounder that swim at the
bottom of the sea, have not been as hard hit as fish cultivated in
pens. Some major fish farms in western Norway began towing their
pens away from coastal areas into Norway's deep, cool fiords to
avoid the algae threat.
   Danish authorities have dispatched two marine environment
research vessels to the Skagerrak Strait between Denmark and Norway
and the Kattegat belt between Denmark and Sweden to monitor the
growth and movement of the algae.
   Swedish Environment Minister Birgitta Dahl called for a special
session of the Nordic Council _ an association of Icelandic,
Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Finnish parliamentarians _ to deal
with the algae threat in the Baltic and North seas.

<HEAD>Treasury Official Says Ailing S&L Industry Must First Help Itself</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Treasury Department official says
when the federal fund that insures deposits in savings institutions
needs more money, the industry _ not taxpayers _ should make the
first contribution.
   ``There comes a point ... when you're really burdening the
industry so that it's self defeating,'' said George D. Gould,
undersecretary for finance. ``But I don't think you're there yet.''
   In an interview recently that touched on the stock market, the
debate over new powers for banks and the condition of the nation's
savings institutions, the pipe-puffing former investment banker
said it seems probable that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp. will need more money beyond the infusion provided by Congress
last August.
   Gould, the No. 3 official at treasury, is the administration's
top policymaker for banking and finance. He has been mentioned as a
likely successor to Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, should
Baker resign as expected this summer to run the presidential
campaign of Vice President George Bush.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board estimates it will cost $21.8
billion to clean up the roughly 500 insolvent S&Ls. However,
private analysts say it could cost between $50 billion and $64
billion.
   The insurance fund is expected to have only about $20 billion to
work with over three years. Most of that is coming from $10.8
billion in bond sales, which are being paid off by a special
assessment on the industry.
   The $64 billion figure is ``absurd,'' Gould said, but he
conceded, ``that $20 billion is probably not enough.''
   The question is when and how to provide more money.
   In the debate last year, the administration urged a $15 billion
bond sale, while the industry was pushing to hold it to $5 billion.
The $10.8 billion was a last-minute compromise.
   Gould said the industry could pay for another $5 billion bond
sale, although he conceded that another $15 billion probably would
be too much.
   Leaders of the industry's largest trade group, the U.S. League
of Savings Institutions, say healthy S&Ls are paying all they can
without deteriorating financially.
   ``It's a clever maneuver, but it's not clever enough,'' Gould
said of the league's position.
   ``The new gambit that `Gee, it's too big for us to handle' means
`Gee, the taxpayers have got to bail us out,''' he said.
   Merging the FSLIC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as a
means of avoiding a taxpayer bailout is a bad idea, Gould said,
because it would damage confidence in the FDIC.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., who is expected to become
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee next year, said two weeks
ago that S&Ls will be at the top of the committee's list of
priorities when Congress returns after the November elections.
   Gould said it might help public confidence if Congress began
re-examining the problem next year, but he said, for now, FSLIC has
all it can spend without beginning to flood the market with
foreclosed real estate.
   The debate ``should be done in kind of a thoughtful environment,
not `Gee, we ought to respond to a crisis,' because there is not a
near-term crisis,'' he said.
   The S&L mess was one of Gould's first assignments after being
appointed in November 1985.
   Through last fall and winter, he led administration's push for
the repeal of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which prevents
commercial banks from underwriting most securities.
   Most recently, he headed an interagency working group that
formulated the administration's policy response to the October
stock market crash.
   Gould said he was cheered by the Senate's lopsided, 94-2
approval of a bill substantially repealing Glass-Steagall. However,
he said he has been a little discouraged by the slow pace of the
bill in the House. He puts the bill's chances of enactment at 50-50.
   Regarding Democratic criticism of the administration's stock
market policy, Gould conceded that the working group recommended
few changes. But, he said, ``We don't think a lot of the suggested
changes are really worth a damn.''
   Gould said Congress, instead of looking for a quick fix, should
be looking at the root causes of greater market volatility such as
the fact that more and more stock is being concentrated in the
hands of a few professional managers of pension funds, mutual funds
and college endowments.
   ``I don't want people to feel better if there is no reason to
feel better, because that will take their eye off looking at some
more fundamental things. ... Maybe greater volatility is inherent
in greater concentrations of capital,'' he said.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   GRAY MARKET
   
   The court ruled the bulk of so-called ``gray market'' goods are
legal, giving a green light to a big part of a multi-billion-dollar
business that allows consumers to buy costly, brand-name imports at
steep discounts.
   In another case, the court ruled that states sometimes may
execute convicted murderers even if their constitutional right to a
lawyer's help was violated.
   The case is K Mart vs. Cartier, 86-495.
   
   CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
   
   The court ruled that states sometimes may execute convicted
murderers even if their constitutional right to a lawyer's help was
violated.
   By a 5-3 vote, the justices said for the first time that errors
in which a convicted murderer's constitutional right to a lawyer's
help was violated may be deemed ``harmless.''
   But the justices voted 8-0 in stating that such an error in the
prosecution of convicted Texas murderer John Satterwhite was not
harmless. The decision overturned his death sentence.
   The case is Satterwhite vs. Texas, 86-6284.
   
   FIREFIGHTERS
   
   The court refused to reinstate an affirmative action plan
designed to increase the number of blacks in the District of
Columbia Fire Department.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the plan
_ calling for hiring at least six blacks for every l0 job openings
_ unlawfully discriminates against whites.
   The case is Barry vs. U.S., 87-1150.
   
   CABLE ACCESS
   
   The court refused to resurrect federal rules that would force
cable television operators to carry all local TV signals on their
systems.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck down
as unconstitutional interim ``must-carry'' rules adopted by the
Federal Communications Commission's in 1986.
   The cases are Office of Communications of the United Church of
Christ vs. FCC, 87-1487; Corporation for Public Broadcasting vs.
Century Communications, 87-1506; National Association of
Broadcasters vs. Century Communications, 87-1510; and Association
of Independent Television Stations vs. Century Communications,
87-1551.
   
   CHECK-KITING
   
   The court left intact a $25 million fine against a businessman
for what prosecutors called the biggest check-kiting fraud in the
history of American banking.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal
question'', rejected a challenge to a New York law that says those
convicted in such schemes may be forced to pay fines equal to twice
the amount gained through their criminal conduct.
   The case is Halloran vs. New York, 87-1595.
   
   TAMPONS
   
   The court refused to reduce a jury award of more than $11.2
million won from a tampon manufacturer by the family of a Kansas
woman who died of toxic shock syndrome.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Playtex
Holdings Inc. seeking to reduce the award.
   The case is Playtex Holdings vs. O'Gilvie, 87-1021.
   
   NATURAL GAS
   
   The Supreme Court, in a decision the Reagan administration says
could save consumers an estimated $100 million a year, cleared the
way today for price deregulation of some natural gas.
   The justices, in an 8-0 decision, reversed an appeals court
ruling that had placed a floor under the gas prices.
   The case is FERC vs. Martin Exploration Management Co., 87-363.
   
   PUNITIVE DAMAGES
   
   The court let stand a $5 million punitive-damages award won by a
California savings and loan association against an Ohio-based
insurance company.
   The justices, over two dissenting votes, refused to hear
arguments that the award, believed to be the largest of its kind
ever upheld in California courts, is unconstitutionally excessive.
   The case is Ohio Casualty Insurance Co. vs. Downey Savings and
Loan Association, 87-159.

<HEAD>Fishing Boat Hits Mine In Gulf Of Oman Killing Fisherman</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small fishing boat with three people
aboard hit a mine and exploded in the Gulf of Oman on Tuesday,
killing one fisherman and injuring two, United Arab Emirates
officials said.
   The official Emirates News Agency quoted an Interior Ministry
statement as saying the incident occurred off Dednah, 20 miles
south of the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz.
   The waters are just north of a major anchorage off Khor Fakkan
that is used by tankers and other commercial vessels going to and
from the Persian Gulf. The anchorage is the staging area for U.S.
Navy-escorted convoys of American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers bound for
Kuwait.
   There was no word on whether the mine was floating free or
tethered to the floor of the gulf.
   The area was plagued by a spate of mines last fall, and at least
two vessels were hit. One, a small offshore supply boat, sank, and
six crewmen died.
   The incidents, which the United States and other officials
blamed on Iran, prompted UAE authorities to close the anchorage
temporarily and were a factor in Britain and France deciding to
dispatch mine sweepers to the gulf region.
   Some of those craft eventually cleared the area, and no mines
had been reported in the Gulf of Oman for several months prior to
Tuesday's incident.
   The ministry said all of the victims Tuesday were Indians. The
two survivors were rescued by another fishing boat and taken for
treatment to Fujairah, another port down the coast, it said.
   Salvage workers at Fujairah were attempting to seal off leaking
ammonia from a Liberian-flag, Norwegian-owned gas tanker towed
there after being severely damaged in an Iranian gunboat attack on
Thursday.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit in London said salvage
officials may unload the ammonia cargo. Lloyd's officials said the
cargo had formed a ``poisonous cloud'' around one of the Dutch
salvage tugboats that assisted the damaged vessel.
   Lloyd's said the ship, the 15,530-ton Mundogas Rio, suffered
more minor damage on Monday in a blast believed caused by a
rocket-propelled grenade that had earlier failed to explode.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three-way race for a key House Democratic
leadership post is openly moving beyond traditional shoeleather
campaigning into the big-bucks realm of special-interest money.
   In their quest to become chairman of the Democratic caucus,
Reps. Mike Synar, D-Okla., and Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, are
following the traditional path, buttonholing colleagues in the
cloakroom and visiting their offices.
   But Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., applying proven congressional
election techniques to an in-House contest, is openly soliciting
political action committees and Washington lobbyists to support his
candidacy.
   Gray, chairman of the Budget Committee, is the first person to
openly bring active fund-raising and spending into a race for a
leadership post, according to House members and veteran Capitol
Hill staffers.
   Gray says that the money he raises will be given to Democrats to
help their campaigns for election to the House.
   Oakar and Synar say they are running low-key and low-budget
campaigns for the caucus chair, which ranks just behind speaker and
majority leader in the Democratic hierarchy and is now filled by
Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   ``I'm not raising money for my caucus chair race,'' says Oakar.
``I've been going to (House) members, just like I go door to door
at home. ... I don't think winning the job or any office in the
House is dependent on how much money we pass out.''
   ``We are running on our own merits,'' Synar says. ``The major
expense for us will be coffee and donuts.''
   It is not unusual for representatives and senators seeking
leadership jobs to make contributions to the political campaigns of
colleagues, either from their own campaign funds or from their own
``leadership'' PACs.
   But until now, all of them, including Gray, have insisted that
their giving had nothing to do with their leadership candidacies.
Critics say the tactic amounts to attempted vote-buying.
   In February, Gray hosted a dinner for House Democrats from
Pennsylvania, who each got a $1,000 campaign contribution just for
showing up. Gray said he wanted to share his money because he was
facing no serious challenge to his re-election to the House this
year. Jon Plebani, his administrative assistant, said the dinner
was unrelated to the caucus chair race.
   Since 1983, Gray has given out at least $72,400 to Democratic
incumbents and challengers, according to the Washington newsletter,
Campaign Industry News.
   Despite the earlier denials, Gray cited the caucus chair
campaign in at least two recent mailings sent out under the
letterhead of the Committee for Democratic Opportunity, the
political action committee he formed last December.
   ``I need your active help,'' he said in a May 3 letter. ``I need
to raise funds to pursue this new challenge. I would appreciate
your sending me a check for $500 to $1,000 so that I can begin to
build the active support within the Democratic members of Congress
to win this key leadership position.''
   Former Rep. Bob Edgar, D-Pa., now a special assistant to Gray,
said the letters were sent to about 25 to 30 Pennsylvanians who had
given to Edgar's election campaigns.
   Asked how much money he needed for the caucus race and how he
planned to spend it, Gray replied: ``The PAC is designed to help
support good Democratic candidates running for Congress. Support of
those candidates is not dependent on whether they support me for
caucus chair.''
   In another mailing in May, Gray cited the caucus contest to
people he invited to a breakfast at a restaurant near the Capitol.
The letter made no specific appeal for money, but it said anyone
wanting to help Gray could contact Plebani.
   Plebani and Gray spokesman Neil Strawser did not return phone
calls seeking to identify the recipients of this letter. At least
one Washington lobbyist received one.
   The open solicitation of money for an in-House election comes as
some lawmakers are trying to put brakes on the escalating cost of
getting elected to Congress itself.
   Senate Democrats trying to enact spending limits have been
blocked by Republican filibusters. In the House, a group headed by
Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., is ready to start moving a bill once the
Senate passes one.
   Swift's legislation would ban the type of ``leadership'' PACs
established by Gray and others.

<HEAD>Most European Papers Praise Reagan's Human Rights Stance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Western European newspapers Tuesday applauded
President Reagan for putting the stress on human rights at his
summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow.
   A French official said Reagan's stance would help Gorbachev in
his efforts to reform the country.
   Hubert Vedrine, President Francois Mitterrand's spokesman, said
in a radio interview that when Reagan speaks of human rights,
Gorbachev ``knows it, in a certain way expects it, and even
benefits from it because that's part of the evolution he wants for
his country.''
   No official comment was reported from other European capitals,
but many newspapers devoted editorials to analyzing Reagan's
speeches and actions in Moscow concerning religious freedom and
human rights. Most of them gave him high marks.
   Reagan ``has used his first visit to Moscow _ and the new
opportunities of glasnost _ to take the message of the West to the
Soviet citadel. The citadel has not been stormed; but neither is it
unscathed,'' commented the conservative Times of London, adding:
   `` ... President Reagan showed, in his forthright American way,
that he probably understands the needs of Russians, as people and
individuals, as well as Mr. Gorbachev does. Unlike Mr. Gorbachev,
however, he has the freedom to put his inner thoughts into words
and talk about the spiritual dimension.''
   However, London`s left-leaning Guardian, was skeptical, saying:
``The human right he (Reagan) seemed, at root, most concerned about
was the right of the Soviet people to throw out the Communist Party.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev, it is to be hoped, will still be smiling on and
after Thursday; but if he isn't, the formidable pack of White House
advisers should pause and ask themselves which humans seeking
rights were truly helped by the street theater in Moscow this
Monday.''
   The Guardian also seized on Reagan's statement that human rights
were fundamental to U.S. relationships ``with all nations,'' asking
whether this applied to Pakistan, Guatemala, South Africa and Iraq.
   In Bonn, the respected conservative paper Die Welt dismissed the
argument that Reagan had meddled in Soviet internal matters.
   It said Reagan did not tell the Soviets ``how they should live.
He told them that all human beings should have the freedom to live.
   ``He ... does not believe a nation which denies its own citizens
basic human rights deserves the trust of other nations.''
   The independent Belgian daily Het Belang van Limburg voiced
understanding for Gorbachev's predicament.
   ``A dictatorship which itself is in the midst of reforms, is
very unstable. And in a super-centralized, multi-ethnic nation such
as the Soviet Union such an operation is doubly dangerous,'' it
said.
   ``Gorbachev... balances on a high wire suspended on one end on
the `good old days' and, on the other, on a breakup of the Soviet
state.''
   In Italy, Franco Venturini wrote in Milan's conservative daily
Corriere della Sera: ``The message Reagan is bearing into the
wolf's lair is that coexistence must have a moral dimension and
that the search for disarmament is inseparable from the reduction
in ideological contrasts. ...''
   He said that ``if a crack appears in the wall of prohibitions
that bears upon the Soviet citizens, Reagan will share part of the
credit.''
   Sandro Viola of Rome's left-leaning La Repubblica, Italy's
largest daily, commented that Reagan took up human rights because
``he realized that putting pressure on the Russians at this time
could lead them to concede what they would have never conceded a
number of years ago...''

<HEAD>Soviet Leader Projects Image of Vitality During Reagan Visit</HEAD>

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has cast
himself in the summit's lead role, projecting a vital image as
statesman, negotiator and presidential tour guide and giving
impromptu interviews to reporters.
   On the eve of the first press conference by a Communist Party
chief on home turf, Gorbachev on Tuesday sped through an ambitious
summit itinerary, prolonging a one-on-one session with President
Reagan, sporting him around Red Square's landmarks and overseeing
the signing of arms control protocols _ all before noon.
   He bantered with reporters before his talks with the president
in the morning, insisting that it was ``time to bang our fists on
the table'' to get negotiators moving on a strategic arms reduction
treaty.
   Showing Reagan around Red Square, Gorbachev introduced the
president to groups of Soviets clustered at one end of the
cobblestone expanse and pointed out famed sights like Soviet
founder Vladimir I. Lenin's red marble mausoleum and St. Basil's
Cathedral.
   Stealing the limelight from the man known as the Great
Communicator, Gorbachev gingerly took a little boy into his arms
and motioned to Reagan to get acquainted with the young Soviet,
while cameras whirred and captured the Kremlin chief in a congenial
pose.
   Later, at an unscheduled stop in Cathedral Square, Gorbachev
shook hands with Soviet and American tourists and gave an impromptu
interview to CBS News anchorman Dan Rather, whose crew was filming
nearby.
   At the signing ceremony, Gorbachev entered the Red Salon of the
Grand Kremlin Palace with a wave and a greeting for journalists.
After the session he returned to an Associated Press reporter who
had asked a question during his entrance.
   ``What was it you wanted to ask?'' he said. The party chief then
recapped his morning meeting with Reagan, saying it was spent
tackling economic problems and barriers to broader cultural ties.
   ``I criticized the position of the president and Congress for
having thrown up a great deal of logjams in the way of healthy
economic cooperation,'' he said, adding that Reagan had agreed with
him that improvements are in order.
   Reagan, who is 20 years Gorbachev's senior, appeared fatigued on
the third day of his meetings with Gorbachev and declined to answer
questions about the results of his talks. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said the president had slept fitfully and was
tiring, like the rest of his staff.
   In the afternoon, Reagan met with Soviet writers, addressed
students and faculty members at Moscow State University and
presided over a state dinner in honor of the Gorbachevs at Spaso
House, the U.S. ambassador's residence.
   But during the events that pit the two leaders together,
Gorbachev has emerged as the more vibrant figure. That image,
combined with any specific achievements that could come out of the
summit, could propel him into a more secure position going into an
important party gathering on June 28.
   Soviet government spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov commented last
week that Gorbachev would have to divide his time during the summit
between the affairs of state and the pressures of an approaching
party conference that will pass judgment on ``perestroika,''
Gorbachev's reform program.
   The conference could prove explosive, as some of the 5,000
delegates are believed to share Kremlin ideology chief Yegor K.
Ligachev's view that changes are being introduced too quickly.
   Hosting the Reagans at broadly publicized events like Monday
night's state dinner and showing them around a spruced-up Soviet
capital has apparently impressed the populace and strenthened their
pride in their nation.
   The 57-year-old Gorbachev has been more accessible to Western
reporters than Reagan, and the Soviet assessment of how the summit
is progressing trickles out through a battery of Soviet briefings
for the thousands of reporters covering Reagan's visit.
   The usually bureaucratic Soviet business world has taken a cue
from the leader, showing unusual attentiveness to the needs of the
press and officials. The Tass news agency published the state
dinner menu in English and has distributed unusually detailed
historical reports on summit venues like St. Catherine's Hall and
Spaso House. Managers of the International Hotel housing the summit
press center have made rounds of some offices to ensure that the
air-conditioning works and that waste baskets are emptied.
   As part of the public relations drive, Gorbachev planned to give
a press conference at the Foreign Ministry press center on
Wednesday afternoon, the first-ever event here that approximates a
U.S. presidential press conference.
   He has met with reporters during his three previous summits with
Reagan in Geneva; Reykjavik, Iceland, and Washington, and during
visits to other major countries.
   Gorbachev bristled at a question about Soviet political
prisoners during his first full news conference in Geneva, but has
since shown himself to be adept at handling the range of queries
thrown out to him by Western reporters.
   His first session in Moscow will give him a chance to set out
his views of how the summit turned out, and to portray himself as a
victor on the foreign affairs front as he heads toward the domestic
debate of the party conference.

   Two prominent Soviet political commentators on
Tuesday disputed former Moscow Communist Party boss Boris N.
Yeltsin's claim that the Kremlin's No. 2 official is blocking
economic and social reforms.
   Yeltsin, in an unprecedented public airing of high-level Kremlin
disagreement, told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a television
interview Monday that Yegor K. Ligachev should resign.
   Feodor Burlatsky, a former member of the party's policy-making
Central Committee who writes for the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta,
said Ligachev would face severe punishment if he were a true
opponent of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``If Ligachev has his own views, it is only natural. It is
another thing to lead some conservatives, and I think this is not a
fact. ... I don't think that anybody leads some opposition. It is
just impossible in our political system. If such a person appears
on the political scene, he would be out of the leadership,''
Burlatsky told reporters.
   Alexei Arbatov, deputy director of the Institute for
International Economy and International Relations, said he
disagreed with Yeltsin that Ligachev is blocking reform. ``I also
can express my opinion and I do not agree with Mr. Yeltsin. Those
opinions are those of Mr. Yeltsin,'' Arbatov said in an interview.
   The 67-year-old Ligachev, who oversees Communist Party ideology,
has indicated in speeches he feels Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or open discussion of the country's problems, has
gone too far in denouncing most of the economic and social policies
of the past.
   Yeltsin said in the interview that Ligachev should go ``because
the party is still lagging behind, because the process of
democratization in the party is not developing...and Comrade
Ligachev is the main person responsible for this.''
   Arbatov's father, Georgy, a Central Committee member who heads
the Institute for the Study of the U.S.A. and Canada, took issue
with Yeltsin on another point _ his decision to give the interview
to the BBC, as well as one to CBS News.
   ``In our point of view I don't think it was too correct for him
to do it, but that is my personal opinion,'' he told a news
conference.
   Yeltsin, 57, was removed Feb. 18 as a candidate, or non-voting,
member of the ruling Politburo. His problems began when he made a
speech to the Central Committee on Oct. 21, 1987 in which he said
Gorbachev's reforms were going to slowly and attacked Ligachev.
   On Nov. 11, the Moscow Communist Party Committee had fired
Yeltsin.
   At the time, Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of using immature words
and of radical actions and said he ``placed his personal ambitions
above the interests of the party.''
   Removed from the Politburo, he was named to the Cabinet-level
position of deputy head of the State Construction Committee. He
lost his job on the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's
nominal legislature, on May 4.
   As Moscow party boss, Yeltsin stood out for his brusque,
aggressive manner and populist style. He was popular among
Muscovites for criticizing consumer shortages and sometimes
striding into stores to take his complaints straight to shopkeepers.
   Rumors circulated in Moscow in mid-April that Ligachev and
Gorbachev had a bitter face-off, with Ligachev reportedly backing a
newspaper article defending the late dictator Josef V. Stalin and
Gorbachev supposedly counterattacking through another article
pushing radical reforms.
   The two have made several public appearances together since
then, with no obvious sign of disagreements.

   A teen-ager killed six people with an ax,
including four of his relatives, before he fell to his death into a
ditch while fleeing a village mob, newspapers reported Tuesday.
   The killings occurred May 26 in the remote village of Linjoka in
northern Kenya, but the incident was not reported until Tuesday.
Linjoka is 135 miles north of Nairobi, Kenya's capital.
   Witnesses said 17-year-old William M'Maroo's victims included
his stepmother, his 4-year-old stepsister, his stepmother's uncle,
her cousin, a neighbor, and another man.
   Newspapers said M'Maroo fled when 600 villagers gathered at the
scene and gave chase. M'Maroo reportedly fell into a 40-foot deep
gully while running away and was fatally injured.
   There was no motive for the attacks.
   One witness said M'Maroo had arrived home Wednesday night from
Mombasa, Kenya's second largest town. He said the youth had gone to
the Indian Ocean port town to sell miraa, a popular leaf chewed for
its narcotic effect.

   Georgia enshrined the tiger swallowtail and Utah embraced the
allosaurus, but no such warm welcome awaited the banana slug in
California or the monarch butterfly in West Virginia.
   The fate of these and other creatures was debated in
legislatures across the nation this year, part of the time-honored
custom of naming official state symbols for everything from fish to
fossils, from mollusks to muffins.
   Critics say the practice wastes time and holds lawmakers up to
ridicule, but defenders say it can help get young people involved
in the political process, boost tourism, and provide some
beneficial comic relief.
   ``It gets so tense in there sometimes. It's just too much,''
said Rep. Mary Vanderlinde in South Dakota, where this year's
Legislature designated the triceratops, a plant-eating dinosaur, as
the state fossil and Black Hills gold as the state jewelry.
   ``This livens it up, and then people will relax and get back to
work,'' she said.
   After the gold measure was passed by the House in January,
lawmakers adopted a second resolution naming Vanderlinde the
state's official jewel because she takes gold shots for arthritis.
   Idaho adopted a fossil this year, the Hagerman Horse Fossil, a
3{-million-year-old relic found in southern Idaho's Magic Valley.
State and local officials are trying to turn the fossil beds south
of Interstate 84 into a tourist attraction to boost the economy.
   The Florida House voted in April to name the Key lime pie the
official state pie, inspired by a legislative report that
recommended the honor as ``an excellent way to promote a genuine
Florida product, since the pie can only be properly made with Key
limes from Florida.''
   However, the measure ran into trouble in the Senate, where Rules
Chairman Dempsey Barron favors sweet potato pie more common to the
Panhandle.
   On Thursday, the California Senate nearly squashed a measure to
name the banana slug the official mollusk, but narrowly decided to
allow the proposal to be reconsidered in the future.
   ``These things are replusive, I mean look at them.... The joke
has to stop here,'' said Sen. John Doolittle, as banana slugs oozed
around inside a glass terrarium on a cart parked on the floor of
the upper house.
   In some other actions so far this year, Georgia designated the
tiger swallowtail the state butterfly, but the West Virginia House
refused to act on a Senate measure naming the monarch butterfly the
state insect. Utah made the allosaurus the state fossil, and
Hawaii's Legislature approved making the nene, a native goose, the
state bird, and the Hibiscus the state flower.
   Last month in Pennsylvania, a House committee named a
long-extinct aquatic creature _ phacops rana _ the state fossil
after 100 Bucks County schoolchildren trooped into the committee
room and performed skits and gave speeches supporting the
appellation.
   At one point, the committee chairman, Rep. Camille George,
donned a scarf and sunglasses and held an umbrella to show the
children how fossils are formed over millions of years.
   ``There's certainly some time consumed in this, but if you're
involving a bunch of youngsters in the process ... maybe there's
nothing wrong with it,'' said Stephen MacNett, chief counsel for
Senate Republicans. ``I guess it depends on how long it takes and
when on the legislative agenda it occurs.''
   That attitude was not encouraged this year in Indiana, where
House Speaker Paul S. Mannweiler and Senate President Pro Tem
Robert D. Garton warned lawmakers not to introduce frivolous bills
for the biennial short session.
   ``It creates the wrong image for the Legislature,'' said Garton.
``It's a frivolous image. It creates the image that that's all we
do, and it detracts from the serious business.''
   Elaine Knapp, editor with the Council of State Governments in
Lexington, Ky., defended the practice of naming symbols.
   ``It's not something that takes up a great deal of attention or
time,'' she said. ``I don't think anybody expects every minute to
be taken up with something serious. Maybe it's more harmless than
raising taxes.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New-home sales climbed 4 percent in April to
the highest level in a year, the government said Tuesday, but
analysts said rising interest rates would likely dampen sales this
summer.
   New single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 679,000 last month, the fastest pace since new homes sold
at a rate of 728,000 in April 1987, the Commerce and Housing and
Urban Development departments said in a joint report.
   It was the third consecutive increase, coming atop a 1.2 percent
rise in March and an 11.4 percent jump in February.
   ``Overall, it's a very nice report. No question about it,'' said
David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home
Builders. A survey of home builders showed sales remained strong in
early May, he said.
   ``But clearly our concern is what's been going on with interest
rates,'' Seiders said. ``... If rates move much higher, certainly
sales are going to be coming down. Our forecast is for sales
activity to peak in the second quarter.''
   Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conventional mortgages have been
climbing steadily since late March, averaging 10.58 percent last
week, up from the low this year of 9.84 percent, according to the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America, said sales could be helped in May by
purchasers hoping to beat out further increases.
   ``But by June, the bloom will be off the rose and we're going
see sales trailing off,'' he said.
   However, James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions, said higher rates, rather than chasing buyers
from the market, may simply cause them to switch to adjustable rate
mortgages.
   ``We've proved over and over again that adjustable rate
mortgages provide a reasonable alternative to fixed rates. Even
though both rates are moving up, you still have adjustables in what
has to be considered very affordable ranges,'' he said.
   More worrisome, Christian said, is the increase in new home
prices. The median, or midpoint, price of a new home was $110,500
in April, up 3.3 percent from March and 14.5 percent from a year
ago.
   The average price of a new home was $137,000, up 4.2 percent
from March and 16 percent over the past year.
   The recent increases in sales followed declines in the three
previous months: 1.2 percent in January, 6.2 percent in December
and 4.3 percent in November. Economists attributed them to buyers'
uncertainty following the October stock market crash.
   Sales for the first four months of this year are 9.3 percent
below the same period of 1987, when mortgage interest rates hit
nine-year lows.
   There were 671,000 new homes sold in 1987 and 750,000 sold in
1986, a record. Analysts are predicting sales in the
620,000-650,000 range this year.
   Sales increased in all regions of the country in April. They
were up 5.9 percent in the Midwest, 5.5 percent in the West, 2.9
percent in the South and 2.8 percent in the Northeast.
   In a report last week, the National Association of Realtors said
sales of existing homes increased 4.5 percent in April after
increases of 2.5 percent in both March and February.

   More than 280 people have died of
sunstroke and other heat-related illnesses in a heat wave in
northern India, news agencies reported Tuesday.
   Rajasthan state was the area hit hardest. United News of India
said 205 deaths were reported there in the past four days.
Temperatures in some parts of the state hit a record 120 degrees
Tuesday, UNI said.
   In New Delhi, at least 25 people have died, according to reports
from two major hospitals, the Press Trust of India said. The
temperature in New Delhi was 113 degrees on Tuesday.
   Water shortages and intermittent power cuts were reported in
many areas.
   The death tolls reported by the news agencies included 18 in
Maharashtra state, five in Punjab, 11 in Haryana and 18 in Uttar
Pradesh.
   Dust storms were forecast for Punjab, Haryana and neighboring
areas.
   High temperatures often precede the nation's annual monsoon
rains, critical for its agricultural economy. The rains are
expected to begin in southern states early in June. They usually do
not reach northern areas until July.

   Americans are broadly dissatisfied with the
presidential nominating system, with majorities backing major
changes such as eliminating party conventions, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Six in 10 respondents in the national survey said they have not
followed the campaign regularly, only half said the races provide a
good discussion of the issues and sizable minorities said the best
candidates generally lose.
   As the primary season winds down, with the final contests to be
held June 7, the survey of 1,204 adults found unhappiness with the
process that spanned ideolgies and political affiliations.
   Fifty-two percent of those polled favored major changes in the
way the parties pick candidates, while only 38 percent said the
system works well enough as it is. Ten percent said they didn't
know.
   There was a striking split among age groups: The youngest,
18-29, thought by a narrow margin that the system works well enough
as it is, while the oldest, over 64, favored major changes by a
wide 56-28 percent spread.
   Similarly, attentiveness to the races was divided by age, with
just 27 percent of the youngest group saying they followed this
year's primaries regularly, compared with 54 percent of the oldest
group. Overall, 41 percent of the respondents said they followed
the campaign regularly.
   Just 31 percent favored the current nominating system. Rules
vary by state, but generally voters select some delegates, the
party selects others and the delegates meet to choose the nominee
at party conventions, where under some circumstances delegates can
switch allegiance.
   A majority in the poll, 59 percent, said they would prefer to
have voters select the nominees, without any delegates at party
conventions. The smallest share, a scant 3 percent, liked the idea
of letting party leaders make the selection on their own.
   Disfavor with the system also was reflected by the sizable
minorities of Americans who said the parties, particularly
Democrats, generally do not nominate their best candidate from
among those running.
   While 46 percent of respondents said the Democrats generally do
pick their best candidate, 40 percent said not. A majority of women
said the best is nominated, but a plurality of men _ 47 percent to
41 percent _ said not.
   More respondents overall, 52 percent, said the Republicans
nominate their best candidate from among those running, but more
than a third said not.
   Democrats were more likely to be happy with their nominee and
Republicans with theirs. But even the Democratic respondents said
the Republicans make their best choice, 51-38, while Republicans
were split on whether the Democrats make their best pick, 42
percent saying yes and 44 percent no.
   Independents said the Republicans choose well, 48-35, but also
were split on the Democrats.
   When it comes to choosing vice presidential candidates, a large
marjority favored leaving the choice to the presidential nominee,
while less than a quarter said the second-place finisher should be
the running mate.
   While 51 percent said the nomination campaigns usually provide a
good discussion of the issues, 40 percent disagreed, and college
graduates and higher-income Americans were split on the question.
   In what may be a reflection of Jesse Jackson's efforts as a
candidate for the Democratic nomination, a greater share of blacks,
64 percent, said the campaigns provide a good discussion of the
issues. Also, 55 percent of Southerners said the campaigns provide
a good discussion, belying criticism of the Super Tuesday regional
primary as a superficial media event.
   A plurality of all respondents and a majority of Southerners
said Super Tuesday was a good idea, and 54 percent of the
respondents said regional primaries should be held in the future.
   While 41 percent of those polled said they have been following
this year's primary campaigns regularly, 50 percent said they paid
occasional attention and 9 percent said they followed the primaries
hardly at all or not at all.
   The Media General-Associated Press poll consisted of telephone
interviews April 29-May 8 with a randomly selected sample of 1,204
adults across the nation. The margin of error was plus or minus
three percentage points.

   _The two leaders had their third day of talks in Gorbachev's
Kremlin office. Gorbachev said maybe it's ``time to bang our fists
on the table'' to complete work on a U.S.-Soviet treaty slashing
long-range nuclear arms stockpiles by 50 percent. ``I'll do
anything that works,'' said Reagan, who pressed his human rights

   _Gorbachev played tour guide, taking Reagan on an unscheduled
stroll through Red Square past Lenin's tomb and through the
Kremlin's Cathedral Square. Reagan told one cluster of Soviets that
he and Gorbachev had decided to ``talk to each other rather than
about each other, and it's working just fine.'' Gorbachev told

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with 1,204 adults in
the continental United States. The phone numbers were selected
randomly by computer, and interviews were conducted with the adult
in the household who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning the
results theoretically would be within three points of the same 19
times out of 20 if every adult American were asked the same
questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ six points
for the 18-29 age group, for example, and seven points for those
over 64.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll:
   1. The Republicans and Democrats use state primaries and
caucuses and nominating conventions to select their presidential
candidates. Do you think the system works well enough as it is, or
does it need major changes?
   Well enough, 38 percent. Major changes, 52 percent. Don't know
or no answer, 10 percent.
   2. Please tell me which of these statements most closely

and caucuses followed by conventions.
   b. Presidential candidates should be selected by the voters
without any delegates or conventions.
   c. Presidential candidates should be selected by party leaders
at the conventions without any primaries and caucuses.
   Primaries, caucuses and conventions, 31 percent. Voters only, 59
percent. Party leaders only, 3 percent. Don't know or no answer, 7
percent.
   3. This year for the first time, 14 Southern or border states
voted on the same day, Tuesday, March 8. Do you think the regional
primary called Super Tuesday was a good idea?
   Yes, 48 percent. No, 27 percent. Don't know or no answer, 25
percent.
   4. Do you think regional primaries should be held in the future?
   Yes, 54 percent. No, 25 percent. Don't know or no answer, 21
percent.
   5. Generally, do you think the second-place finisher in the
nomination campaign should be the vice-presidential nominee, or
should the presidential nominee select whomever he or she wants?
   Second-place, 24 percent. Whomever, 69 percent. Don't know or no
answer, 7 percent.
   6. From among those who run for the Democratic nomination for
president, do you think the Democrats generally nominate their best
candidate?
   Yes, 46 percent. No, 40 percent. Don't know or no answer, 14
percent.
   7. From among those who run for the Republican nomination for
president, do you think the Republicans generally nominate their
best candidate?
   Yes, 52 percent. No, 36 percent. Don't know or no answer, 13
percent.
   8. Do you think the nomination campaigns usually provide a good
discussion of the issues?

percent.
   9. Have you been following the presidential primary campaigns
regularly, occasionally, hardly at all or not at all this year?
   Regularly, 41 percent. Occasionally, 50 percent. Hardly, 7
percent. Not, 2 percent.

   A whole Sunday school class couldn't do it,
but Jerry Callison, using a metal detector, was a success when he
wasn't even trying.
   Callison found an identification bracelet lost in Fort Gibson
Lake in 1958.
   Callison, of Broken Arrow, dives with the Indian Territory
Historical Club, which focuses on the sport of metal detecting.
Callison found the silver bracelet May 17 in 8 feet of water,
buried 3 inches in the silty bottom.
   Callison cleaned the bracelet and found J. Ned Hansen's name, a
date and the message, ``I'll be loving you always, Joyce.''
   Callison looked up Hansen's name in the telephone directory.
   Joyce Hansen said she gave the bracelet to her husband for their
third wedding anniversary, Feb. 25, 1945. Hansen said his son, Ned,
lost it while swimming in 1958.
   ``The whole Sunday school class helped him look for it,'' Hansen
said. ``He told me it had really hurt him that he'd lost it.''

   Kemp Forest, a World War II bomber pilot,
was recently inducted into a prestigious veterans' group _ in the
Soviet Union.
   Forty-three years ago, Forest was befriended by a group of
Soviet soldiers. after his B-17 was forced down near the front in
Poland. He and his crew spent a week with the Soviets, who repaired
the plane and threw nightly banquets in their honor.
   As a sign of that friendship, a Soviet major and his wife,
Anatoly and Tamara Koshevnikov, presented Forest with a tablecloth
inscribed, ``May your journey back be as smooth as this
tablecloth.''
   Forest, now 66, recently traveled to Moscow to meet the
Koshevnikovs again. There were tears all around, he said.
   He took part in the annual May Day parade, chatted with a priest
in a Russian Orthodox monastery and rubbed elbows with Soviet
generals, publishers and schoolchildren.
   ``Friendship between our countries has to start with someone _
let it be me,'' said Forest, a Lake Travis resident and retired
representative of a clothing manufacturer.
   ``You have to understand your neighbor before you can know him.
The trip was utterly fantastic. It was hard to describe. I have
never felt so welcome anywhere. It came straight from the heart,''
he said.
   While in Moscow, Forest was named an honorary member of the
Soviet Veterans Association and responded by making now-Gen.
Koshevnikov and his wife honorary members of the Lake Travis Lions
Club.

   Actress Brigitte Nielsen has suffered a
miscarriage and her fiance, New York Jets' defensive lineman Mark
Gastineau, has flown to Rome to be with her, a spokesman says.
   In a statement issued through publicist Joel Brokaw, Gastineau
said the miscarriage would not prevent them from ``starting over
again and having another baby.''
   Ms. Nielson, 25, who is divorced from her second husband,
Sylvester Stallone, had been working ``12-to-15-hour days'' on the
movie ``Domino'' when she began feeling weak last week, said
Brokaw. She miscarried in her hotel and was taken to a hospital
``where she is being treated for additional complications,'' he
said.
   The couple announced their engagement last February and said
earlier this month that they were expecting a baby this fall. A
divorce between Gastineau, 31, and his wife, Lisa, is pending.

   Former New York Yankee Joe DiMaggio has no
intention of selling one of his most prized possessions: a baseball
bearing the signatures of President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   DiMaggio got the two to sign the ball when he was at the White

   ``In my life, that's the only time I ever asked anybody to sign
a baseball,'' said DiMaggio, 73, who autographed a lot of balls
himself during his 13 seasons and 10 World Series with the Yankees.
   ``Reagan's signature is very precise and readable. Gorbachev
signed it the way a doctor writes a prescription,'' DiMaggio said

   ``I've had requests to buy it already. But there's no way in the
world I'll sell it. It's history.''

<HEAD>Elsie Frum Remembers 1889 Disaster as `A Roar'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elsie Frum remembers running uphill from
the Johnstown Flood of 1889, which swept everything in its path,
killing 2,200 people in one of the nation's worst natural disasters.
   ``It was just like a roar. There were millions of gallons of
water, you know,'' Mrs. Frum, 105, said Tuesday. ``It came just
like a tidal wave and then it was over. Everything was washed away.
We ran. If we didn't run, I wouldn't be here today.''
   Mrs. Frum was 6 when the South Fork Dam burst and a 40-foot wall
of water and debris slammed into this western Pennsylvania steel
and railroad city 12 miles downstream.
   She and Frank Shomo, 99, of Robinson, are the two remaining
survivors of the May 31, 1889, disaster. They were to be guests of
honor at the annual Flood Survivors' Banquet on Tuesday night.
   The dam held back Lake Conemaugh and was owned by the South Fork
Fishing and Hunting Club, a summer playground for wealthy
industrialists led by Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick.
   After several days of rain, the poorly maintained dam was
breached and finally burst, unleashing a torrent of water that
cleared the Conemaugh River valley of houses, bridges and trains
before it hit Johnstown.
   Pushing ahead uprooted trees, splintered beams, dead and dying
people and farm animals, and miles of wire from a destroyed steel
mill, the watery mass crashed into a Pennsylvania Railroad bridge
just below Johnstown, where it piled up to form a temporary second
dam that soon caught fire. Many bodies never were found.
   When she was a child, Mrs. Frum's family lived in nearby
Conemaugh. As the water approached, her father grabbed his wife and
three daughters and started them running up a hill. The floodwater
passed below.
   ``It happened and then it was over,'' Mrs. Frum recalled.
``After that, it was calm like nothing happened.''
   Shomo, only 100 days old when the dam burst, lived about 20
miles downriver from Johnstown at Lockport. He said the high water
did not reach his house.
   Mrs. Frum survived another flood in 1936, stranded on the second
floor of her Johnstown house. By the area's third flood disaster,
in 1977, Mrs. Frum was living high and dry on a mountain in nearby
Southmont.

<HEAD>Pershing II Rocket Motor Test Burn Completed On High Plains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials fired a rocket motor from a Pershing 2
missile on the high plains east of Denver on Tuesday, hoping to
determine whether hundreds of the motors can be safely destroyed as
required by a new U.S.-Soviet treaty.
   The burn, following 11 days of delays because of bad weather,
came on the final day open for such test firings under the
U.S.-Sov-Range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   ``From our initial indication, the burn, the static firing, was
conducted just as we had planned. And the plume _ the exhaust cloud
_ traveled with the wind over the (50) monitoring sites,'' said
Pueblo Army Depot Actiiet Intermediatevity spokeswoman Mary Wilson.
   The Colorado Department of Health monitors will analyze the
exhaust to see whether such firings would pose any threat to the
environment.
   About 20 reporters and photographers witnessed the 58-second
test at 6:36 a.m. at the depot 15 miles east of Denver, officials
said.
   ``There was a steady, bright white light from the end of the
rocket nozzle extending approximately 75-80 feet,'' Wilson said.
   The weapons treaty was ratified last week by the Senate, and
copies were scheduled to be exchanged Wednesday at the summit
meeting in Moscow between Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
President Reagan.
   The treaty requires that the Army's 420 Pershing missiles be
destroyednal Park Service superintendents were invited to
attend the four-day gathering in Grand Teton National Park.
   The meeting, the first of its kind in 12 years, was called by
Park Service Director William Penn Mott in early 1987, but he left
most of the planning and agenda to a committee of superintendents.
   ``The program was turned over entirely to the superintendents
and they chose subject matter which focuses on current issues, both
internal and external, facing the parks today,'' said George
Berklacy, chief of public affairs for the park service. ``This is
not a regional or headquarters agenda, this conference is by and
for the superintendents.''
   T. Destry Jarvis, vice president of the National Parks and
Conservation Association, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit
citizens group, praised the park service for holding the
superintendents' conclave.
   ``I think it is a very serious, professional thing that they
have done,'' said Jarvis, who planned to attend as an observer. ``I
think it's very important that the National Park Service enhance
the notion that this is a single service, with a single purpose.
I'm sure they will get a lot of business done that would not occur
if they weren't together.''
   Steve Whitney of the Wilderness Society said the meeting ``is in
the best interest of the country. They (the superintendents)
shouldn't wait another decade for another one.''
   Last week the Wilderness Society issued a report calling on the
federal government to move all hotels and other concessions out of
the national parks and describing some parks as endangered.
   The Wilderness Society's assessment was just the latest in a
continuing controversy over what's best for America's officially
preserved natural heritage.
   The National Parks and Conservation Association recently issued
a report recommending a $50 million annual increase in the park
service's budget just to fix a resource management backlog of
problems.
   In 1980, the National Park Service itself issued a report to
Congress on the ``State of the Parks.'' In that summary more than
4,000 individual threats were identified.
   A recent General Accounting Office survey concluded the Park
Service had an unmet need of $1.9 billion for maintenance and
capital improvements in the 1987 fiscal year.
   ``Because of advanced, continuing deterioration, some of these
assets may be lost permanently,'' said the GAO study.
   The National Park System includes 49 full-fledged national parks
and 292 other units, including national recreation areas and
national seashore areas, encompassing a total of 77 million acres.

<HEAD>Program Turns Out Too Many Male Sea Turtles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A program used in some areas to hatch
endangered sea turtles is turning out too many males and must be
changed, naturalists say.
   From May to November, loggerhead and green sea turtles lay eggs
on the beach and abandon them. Eggs buried in cooler sand hatch as
males and in warmer as females, said J. Alan Huff, who heads the
state Department of Natural Resources turtle protection program.
   But some of those nests are dug up by scientists and hatched in
incubators to gurarantee a higher survival rate.
   Until recently, eggs gathered up in the John U. Lloyd State
Recreation Area here and in some other locations around Florida
have been incubated in styrofoam chests. Young turtles do not show
their gender externally, however, and scientists were unsure how
many hatchlings were male.
   But a study of 1986 hatchlings which involved a painstaking
surgical procedure has confirmed what some had suspected _ most of
the turtles from the chests are male.
   To solve the problem, the naturalists are switching to burial of
the turtles in beach sand, but with a cage surrounding them to ward
off predators, as some other South Florida hatcheries do. The cages
are placed near the shore to make the hatchlings' run from their
nest to the sea as short as possible.
   ``We don't know all the implications, and are just being
conservative and encouraging people to use beach hatcheries
whenever possible,'' said Huff. Incubating the eggs in boxes will
now be the choice of last resort, he said.
   The unbalanced sex ratio is not considered serious yet because
only about 10 percent of the turtle nests are dug up and incubated
artificially, he said.
   ``We take so few compared to the worldwide population, it's
unlikely we'd ever affect the wild population,'' he said. But the
aim of the turtle program is to simulate nature as nearly as
possible, he added.

<HEAD>Man Arrested After Climbing Into Tiger Enclosure at Zoo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police seized a shirtless man who climbed atop a
zoo exhibit where a worker was mauled to death last month, thumped
his chest and traded growls with two agitated Bengal tigers.
   The incident, which occurred before about 100 Memorial Day
spectators, came a day after two of the zoo's 15 tigers were
returned to view for the first time since the May 12 mauling of
keeper Ricardo Tovar.
   Robert Lavoie, 27, was charged with criminal trespass and jailed
in lieu of a $1,000 bond, police said Tuesday. He was not injured.
   ``He was making a Tarzan call down to the tigers. He was really
aggravating the animals,'' said witness Larry Spaetgens, who
videotaped the incident. ``I thought he was going to fall. I sent
my wife away.''
   The episode underscored recent employee complaints about lax
safety. Lavoie apparently gained access to a walkway over the tiger
display through a fallen, unmarked gate while a guard was at lunch.
   Zoo officials, who ordered an investigation of safety procedures
after Tovar's death, said Monday's incident is not indicative of
lax procedures.
   ``There is no way we can protect anyone from their own
irrational acts,'' said zoo curator Nelson Herwig.
   But zoo employees have complained that the zoo's design and
management put them and the public in jeopardy. Chief among their
concerns is working alone with dangerous animals because of
staffing shortages.
   Moments before Lavoie appeared atop the 12-inch-wide wall behind
the rocks, he was lingering outside the fallen gate. The gate was
erected as a temporary measure about two years ago, Herwig said.
   ``The walkway was intended as an overview for the cat
facility,'' he said. ``It was never opened because it would be
impossible to prevent an incident such as this.''
   He said he did not know how long the gate was broken, but Zoo
Director John Werler said Lavoie was the first unauthorized person
to have gone past the barrier and into the exhibit.

   The State Department said Tuesday it has
received unconfirmed reports that a U.S. pleasure boat was rammed
by a Nicaraguan naval vessel and that the yacht and a U.S. citizen
have been detained.
   The U.S. Embassy in Managua was trying to learn from the facts
of the case and to seek consular access to the American citizen,
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   She was not authorized to disclose the name of the American
reportedly detained.
   Ham radio operators who picked up a distress call said the
skipper identified the yacht as the Satori, based in Miami. The
incident was alleged to have taken place Monday night 20 miles off
Nicaragua's Pacific Coast.
   The skipper, whose name sounds like ``Melbourne,'' radioed that
he had been rammed and that one large gunboat was a quarter-mile
off his bow and a smaller gunboat was 100 feet off his stern,
preventing his escape, said a Honolulu ham radio operator who spoke
only on condition he not be named.
   The distress call said the vessel was taking on water as a
result of being rammed, but was not in danger of sinking, the ham
operator said.
   The Satori reportedly was en route from Honolulu to Costa Rica.

<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics are praising the adventurous
spirit of this year's Spoleto Festival U.S.A. of the performing
arts, even if some productions haven't emerged unscathed from
reviewers' pens.
   The Washington Post said Spoleto ``has often been daring, but
this year seems to be more so than usual.''
   Everywhere at this year's festival ``there is something
beguiling and new _ or so ancient it's just as challenging,'' said
USA Today.
   The main opera at the festival which continues through Sunday is
Dvorak's ``Rusalka,'' a work which is rarely performed in this
country.
   Spoleto also features the seldom-performed ``Montezuma'' by Carl
Heinrich Graun and saw the premiere of a controversial
dancer-theater piece by New York choreographer Martha Clarke.
   The Post called the Spoleto production of ``Rusalka'' ``one of
the most effective in the festival's 12-year American history.''
   But The New York Times said the staging and special effects are
the real highlights of the opera based on a Czechoslovakian fairy
tale about a water sprite.
   ``Though the singers involved were mostly good second-and
third-level professionals, the principal strengths of this staging,
at least for two of the three acts, were visual,'' the Times
reviewer said. ``Striking stage pictures came and went,
compensating to an extent for a lack of vocal excitement.''
   The State said the production ``is not to be missed by
opera-lovers. Spoleto's staging may be the only opportunity to see
this sadly neglected opera in a lifetime,'' the Columbia newspaper
said.
   ``Montezuma,'' which tells of the Spanish destruction of the
Aztec civilization in the 1500s, is performed even less frequently
and hasn't fared well with the Spoleto critics.
   The News and Courier of Charleston called the cast ``spotty''
and suggested ``it is not an opera for all to enjoy.''
   ``It did manage to give a taste of `Montezuma' however, albeit
with a merely serviceable abstract decor and conducting and singing
that was mostly insensitive and inauthentic to the period, '' wrote
The Wall Street Journal.
   USA Today called Ms. Clarke's ``Miracolo D'Amore'' ``a delicious
little scandal'' for the festival.
   The work, which conjures sometimes violent images of love,
features some nudity and has caused a stir among Spoleto audiences.
A number of people have walked out of the historic Dock Street
Theater before the end of the performances.
   ``Viewed with a calm, receptive eye, `Miracolo d'Amore' is a
profoundly impressive, tight, lucid piece,'' said USA Today.
   ``The naked women evoke Botticelli, and the lyrics and minuscule
amount of text are all in Italian, making for a rather remote
experience if you don't get the references,'' The Wall Street
Journal said. ``It's either a dream or a bore, depending on whom
you ask.''
   One reviewer for The News and Courier called the work
``unsettling'' and described it as ``a hateful piece, bitter and
malevolent. As a theater work it's visually beautiful. But then, so
is a coral snake.''
   Another reviewer for the paper suggested ``this is clearly a
work of _ dare I say it? _ feminist revenge.''
   The reviewer added Ms. Clarke ``has wrought a theatrical
experience that will affect different people in radically, one
might say almost violently, different ways.''
   Composer Gian Carlo Menotti founded the Festival of the Two
Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, in 1958, and later founded the Spoleto
Festival U.S.A. in Charleston and the Spoleto Festival of the Three
Worlds in Melbourne, Australia. He still heads all of them.

<HEAD>Solidarity Says It Will Boycott June 19 Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solidarity trade union federation
announced Tuesday it is boycotting nationwide elections June 19 for
local and provincial councils.
   ``The boycott will be an expression of our resistance to the
deprivation of our rights. It will be an expression on striving for
regaining of social sovereignty,'' Solidarity's national executive
commission said in a communique released by spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said earlier that the
government was prepared for opponents to mount a boycott.
   The vote will be the first held under a new election law that
requires at least two candidates for each seat, secret ballots and
allows various social groups to propose candidates.
   But the ballot continues to be structured in such a way that
Poland's Communist Party is guaranteed a majority of the seats on
the municipal and provincial councils.
   For most seats, only communist party candidates are nominated.
Allied political parties and independents are also allotted a
certain number of seats fixed beforehand by nominating commissions.
   Urban defended the arrangement at his weekly news conference
Tuesday, saying the public will be able to show its preference for
individuals although not for parties.
   But the statement by the outlawed Solidarity movement said any
hopes that Poles would be able to elect candidates ``freely and
democratically ... were in vain.''
   ``Instead of returning to us our rights, we were offered
participation in a show ... Disguising the old practice in which it
is decided for the citizens who can represent them,'' Solidarity
said.
   Solidarity initially had discussed trying to nominate candidates
for the council elections, the first to be held in Poland since
1984.
   But the electoral law passed March 10 said only legal groups
could propose candidates, and it left the final ballot composition
in the hands of the electoral commissions dominated by the party.
   ``This electoral procedure gives us no chances in practice,''
said Warsaw regional Solidarity leader Zbygniew Bujak.
   But Urban said ``many representatives of independent communities
were proposed to be candidates (and) most of them refused because,
as they stated, the electoral procedure wasn't democratic enough
for them.''
   He called it a ``vicious circle. ... They want more democracy
but don't want to take advantage of existing possibilities.''
   Urban also said the government does not fear a boycott and would
not, as in the past, interpret the eventual turnout figures as a
barometer of public support for the government.
   ``Experience shows that these boycotts have minimal effect on
electoral attendance,'' he said.
   In Poland's last nationwide election, the Nov. 29 referendum on
government plans for economic and political reform, 67.3 percent of
the 26.2 million eligible voters participated. It was the lowest
announced turnout of any election in Poland's postwar history.
   Both referendum questions were approved by a majority of votes
cast. But the low turnout prevented them from receiving approval by
more than half all eligible voters, as required by law for the
results to be legally binding.

   Ronald and Nancy Reagan mind their p's and

best-mannered people, an etiquette specialist said Tuesday.
   ``People are aware of role models and they like beautifully
mannered people,'' said Marjabelle Stewart, author of 15 books,
including ``The New Etiquette.''
   Reagan appeared on her list for the fourth consecutive year.
   ``There is such a warmth about that man,'' said Mrs. Stewart.
``People say, `Isn't he wonderful under all this stress.'''
   Mrs. Reagan demonstrates ``real first-lady manners ... and
people have fallen in love with her,'' she said.
   Celebrites are judged on public and private behavior, said Mrs.
Stewart, who queries about 70 journalists, television-crew members,
make-up artists, chauffeurs and maitre d's who have frequent
contact with famous people.
   Also on the list are Sam M. Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores,
who is ``well-mannered but does not flaunt his wealth or act like a
big-shot,'' said Mrs. Stewart.
   Entertainer Dolly Parton, who has ``huggable manners and puts on
no airs,'' also made the list, she said.
   Others in the top 10: actor Jimmy Stewart; Ann Buchwald, wife of
columnist Art Buchwald; musician Lionel Richie; sports broadcaster
Frank Gifford; talk show host Johnny Carson; and Hugh Sidey,
Washington contributing editor for Time magazine.
   Only the Reagans also appeared on last year's list.

<HEAD>W.R. Grace Pleads Guilty To Concealing Chemical Use From EPA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   W.R. Grace & Co., which two years ago paid a
reported $8 million for polluting wells in Woburn, pleaded guilty
Tuesday to lying about the amount of a chemical it used at a plant
there.
   U.S. District Court Judge Joseph L. Tauro fined the New
York-based conglomerate the maximum $10,000 for willfully
misleading the Environmental Protection Agency about purchases of
the cleaning solvent acetone.
   As part of an agreement, the government dropped a second charge
that W.R. Grace concealed dumping of hazardous waste in the ground
behind the plant in Woburn, where a group of families alleges that
chemically tainted water caused six cancer deaths.
   ``I view this to be intolerable corporate behavior and the kind
of behavior we will continue to pursue with the criminal remedies
available to us,'' EPA Regional Administrator Michael R. Deland
said after the plea.
   Deland said the EPA plans to require Grace to clean all
contaminants at the Woburn plant under the federal Superfund
cleanup act.
   In a separate civil suit filed by eight Woburn familes, a
federal jury in September 1986 found W.R. Grace liable for
polluting two town wells. The case was settled for a reported $8
million before a second trial could be held on whether the
contamination caused the six leukemia deaths in the town about 15
miles northwest of Boston.
   In a two-count indictment in January 1987, W.R. Grace was
accused of lying to the government about chemicals it used at the
Cryovac plant near the wells, which were shut in 1979.
   The company asserted in a February 1982 letter to the EPA it had
bought only one five-gallon drum of acetone in 1978 for the plant.
The company said the acetone purchased was the only amount brought
to Woburn in 22 years covered by an EPA inquiry.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Tobin Harvey told Tauro that from 1973
to 1976, W.R. Grace had bought 65 gallons of acetone and had used
the solvent repeatedly in the 1960s and 1970s to clean paint spray
guns and circuit boards at Cryovac, a food packaging machine shop.
   W.R. Grace attorney Robert Popeo told the judge that no company
officials were aware the reports to EPA were inaccurate.
   ``While the company does not dispute that the statement was
inaccurate, it vigorously disputes that it was intentionally so,''
W.R. Grace said in a statement.
   Acting U.S. Attorney Robert S. Mueller said the maximum fine for
a corporation filing false statements with the government was
increased to $500,000 in 1984. Grace was levied the old fine
because the crime was committed in 1982.
   Eight families filed suit in 1982 charging four parties with
causing the hazardous waste contamination of the wells. They are:
W.R. Grace, Beatrice Foods Co., the John J. Riley tannery and
Unifirst, a uniform supply company.
   Unifirst settled for $1 million in October 1985, before the
original trial, and W.R. Grace settled halfway through the 1986
proceedings.
   U.S. District Court Judge Walter Jay Skinner dismissed the
portion of the suit against Beatrice and the tannery and in January
denied the families a new trial. They have appealed to the 1st U.S.
Circit Court of Appeals.

<HEAD>Rabin Meets with Arabs, Who Say He Has Nothing to Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY SEDOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday he
has met with Palestinians in search of ways to end violence in the
occupied lands, but Arabs involved said he had nothing to offer and
that the rebellion will continue.
   The army said 207 Palestinians have been killed since riots
began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip. It is the first time army figures have
exceeded those kept by the United Nations, which put the death toll
at 198.
   According to the army, soldiers shot 157 Arabs to death. The
army said the rest died of other causes or that the circumstances
of their deaths were being investigated. An Israeli soldier and a
Jewish settler also have been killed.
   Dedi Zucker, a left-wing member of Parliament, quoted a
confidential government document as saying 5,133 Palestinians had
been shot or injured.
   He quoted the document as saying that 10,000 Arabs were in jail
and that half of them had been arrested before Dec. 8. He said one
in every 80 residents of the occupied lands over age 16 was in
custody.
   Zucker said a high-ranking defense official blamed ``harassment
and maltreatment by soldiers'' of Palestinians for continued unrest
in the lands that Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
war. He said the official, whom he would not identify further,
commented in a meeting with a few legislators.
   The army said a soldier was convicted of manslaughter in the
killing of an Arab, and a Palestinian human rights group demanded
that Israel close a new prison where Arab inmates were held in
``inhumane and illegal conditions.''
   Rabin said on Israel radio that he decided to meet with Arabs,
including Palestine Liberation Organiation supporters, because he
was convinced Palestinians now realized that ``by stones and
firebombs they can achieve nothing.''
   He held two meetings in less than a week, including one on
Monday, but had said nothing previously about their purpose.
   Earlier this year, Rabin said he would talk with Palestinians
only after the violence stopped. Analysts said the meetings
indicate Rabin believes the rebellion is abating.
   ``I'm the one who represents the Israeli government to the
population in the territories, and I think the time has come to
talk with all sections, with all factions among the Palestinians,''
Rabin said Tuesday. `` I intend to continue meeting with people who
represent different ... points of view.''
   Arabs who attended the meeting Monday said Rabin offered nothing
but frustration to people involved in the 6-month-old
``intefadeh,'' which means uprising in Arabic.
   Yassir Obeid, a physician from Ramallah in the West Bank, the
defense minister told them the U.S. peace initiative had failed and
Arabs could expect no political movement before next June.
   Rabin did not say what he told the Palestinians, and his office
merely confirmed the meeting took place.
   ``He told us the Shultz plan has missed the train and the Moscow
summit will be fruitless,'' Obeid said in an interview. ``We are
too small for the superpowers. They are too involved with important
things.''
   Rabin also told the group another diplomatic initiative could
not begin until months after the United States and Israel hold
elections in November, he said.
   ``It was very frustrating,'' Obeid said. ``This just means the
intefadeh will be more prolonged and the people will have to suffer
longer.
   ``The intefadeh is far from over or waning. The Palestinians
won't stop the violence without realizing some political
aspirations. This is what we told Rabin. The people who are running
things are willing to pay a lot of sacrifices.''
   Hanna Nasser, a Bethlehem businessman, said the Arabs gave Rabin
a list of requests for easing restrictions, releasing children from
jail and ending ``collective punishment'' against entire towns or
refugee camps for the actions of protesters.
   Obeid said Rabin ``made no promises. He said, `If the intefadeh
relaxes, we will relax. If it worsens, the measures will get
worse.'''
   Yaacov Tamir, an Ethiopian immigrant, was the soldier convicted
of manslaughter. The daily Maariv said he shot the Palestinian on
Jan. 10 from less than two feet away while talking with him. Tamir
awaits sentencing.
   Law in the Service of Man, a human rights group founded by
Palestinian lawyers, has demanded closure of the Ketziot detention
center in the Negev Desert, where about 3,000 Arabs are held.
   The group, affiliated with the International Commission of
Jurists in Geneva, said prisoners were held in eight large tents,
deprived of adequate water and subjected to beatings and the
desert's extreme temperatures.

<TEXT>
   The director of a fireworks production at
which a shell exploded, injuring 27 people, said Tuesday he can
account for all the shells that were fired and the exploding one
may have come from somewhere else.
   ``We haven't been able to substantiate that,'' said Lt. Arnold
Meyers, who heads the arson abatement investigating the Sunday
evening accident during the annual Dayton River Festival.
   Thirteen people remained hospitalized, all but one in good or
fair condtion. Steven Stevens, 34, of Springfield, was in serious
condition.
   Rick W. Leibert, producer for National Fireworks Ensemble of Los
Angeles, believes the shell that exploded came from somewhere other
than the launch area, about 600 feet from the bank of the
Stillwater River where it hit.
   The shells, which normally travel 350 to 500 feet in the air
before exploding, are fired off electrically. All 1,500, ranging
from 3 to 13 inches in diameter, were sequenced and timed according
to a script, Leibert said.
   ``When we looked at the videotape, the bursts were all in the
sky where they should be when they were supposed to be,'' he said.
   Meyers, who said investigators had about 40 more witnesses to
interview, said an inspection of the site yielded little conclusive
information.
   ``We found a lot of debris along on the bank, and some of the
markings were not of the type that the show uses,'' he said. ``Yet
we didn't have any odor of gunpowder on it'' which would indicate a
recently fired shell, he said.
   He said it would be several days before anything conclusive can
be released.
   ``Most people were looking at the sky and weren't paying any
attention. We'll get lucky if we find two of three people that saw
something that don't have a claim in this,'' Meyers said.
   San Diego Fireworks of California, which supplied the shells and
the necessary state and federal licenses, carried the $1 million
umbrella insurance policy required by the city, Leibert said.
   Fire Chief Glenn Alexander said the shell appeared to explode
twice. Leibert said his show did not use any ``double-banger''
shells.
   Any drifting debris from the launching site also should have
been pushed away from the accident scene by the prevailing winds,
he said.
   Meyers said that if the shell had come from the launch site, it
must have come out of a launch tube, turned sharply right and
skimmed 15 or 20 feet above the ground until hitting the bank.
   Leibert said the ensemble's most recent show was for the
Kentucky Derby weekend in Louisville and its next show would be the
July 4 celebration in Columbus.

   Traffic accidents claimed the lives of at least
385 people on the nation's roads during the three-day Memorial Day
weekend, authorities said Tuesday.
   Based on ``the past trends of the Memorial Day holiday period,''
the National Safety Council had projected 380 to 480 people would
die in traffic accidents, said council spokeswoman Barbara Carraro.
   The preliminary total late Tuesday morning ``is right around the
normal'' for a non-holiday, three-day weekend, Ms. Carraro said.
   Generally, she said, more people die in accidents on holiday
weekends because automobiles carry more people. The three-day
holiday period began at 6 p.m. Friday, local time, and ended at
midnight Monday.
   During last year's Memorial Day weekend, 416 people died in
traffic accidents, the Chicago-based council said.
   The worst Memorial Day traffic toll in the last quarter-century
was recorded in 1968, when 629 people died. The lowest recorded
toll, in 1982, was 341.
   About 390 traffic deaths on U.S. roadways would be projected for
a non-holiday, three-day weekend this time of year, council
statistics clerk Mary Johnston said.

   Miss Ball, with her first husband Desi Arnaz, starred in the
1951-61 television comedy ``I Love Lucy,'' one of the most popular
television shows of all time. It is still seen around the world in
syndicated reruns.
   The Arnazes, who had two children, Lucie and Desi II, were
divorced in 1960 and Miss Ball married nightclub comic Morton a
year later. He later became her executive producer.

   Nancy Reagan contended Tuesday that
``everything has been said'' about the flap over her astrology use
in the White House, but she let it be known she intends to tell her
side of the story in her own time.
   Mrs. Reagan, on a summit sidetrip to this Baltic capital of the
czars, dismissed reporters' repeated attempts to discuss the
revelation that she has consulted astrologers to advise President
Reagan on his schedule.
   It was the first time reporters had the opportunity to question
her closely about the flap that arose last month when former White
House chief of staff Donald Regan published his book, ``For the
Record,'' revealing the first lady's secret.
   The former chief of staff painted an unflattering portrait of
the first couple, describing President Reagan as an incurious,
passive chief executive controlled by a manipulative wife and
media-conscious staff.
   Regan also made clear his bitterness at being replaced at the
White House at the height of the Iran-Contra affair, contending
he'd been ousted by a cabal controlled and initiated by the first
lady.
   At first, Mrs. Reagan refused to be drawn into any discussion of
the matter, declaring, ``Everything has been said about that that
needs to be said.''
   At one point, she was asked whether the ``stars were wrong'' for
providing an answer, and she gave the reporter a sharp, disgusted
look.
   But when she was asked again whether she intended to write her
own book about the flap, she responded, ``Could be,'' and laughed
heartily.
   Queried whether she intended to go into detail in such a book,
she borrowed a line from a Frank Sinatra song to indicate that she
was intent on telling her side of the story.
   ``My way,'' she said, pointing at herself and repeating sternly,
``My way.''
   And will Regan be interested in what she had to say?
   The first lady laughed again heartily and shot back,
``Absolutely.''

<HEAD>Reagan Tells Russians: U.S. `Humored' Its Indians</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Suzan is correct in 5th graf, ``In Washington''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan told Soviet university
students Tuesday that maybe the American people made a mistake when
they ``humored'' Indians by giving them reservations rather than
integrating them into society.
   The head of the largest U.S. Indian organization called the
remarks insulting.
   ``Maybe we made a mistake'' in trying to maintain Indian
cultures, Reagan said in answering questions at Moscow State
University. ``Maybe we should not have humored them in that,
wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe we
should have said, `No, come join us. Be citizens along with the
rest of us.'''
   Reagan misspoke. Indians are citizens. All American Indians were
made full citizens by an act of Congress in 1924. It wasn't until
1948 when court decisions gave them full voting rights in Arizona
and New Mexico in local and state elections.
   The 1980 census recorded 1.37 million Indians, of whom 332,000
were living on 260 reservations.
   In Washington, Suzan Shown Harjo, a Cheyenne and Creek who is
executive director of the National Congress of American Indians,
said, ``I was appalled by the president's performance but not
surprised. ... He has headed the worst administration for Indians
since the days of outright warfare and extermination ....
   ``I found particularly insulting his statement that perhaps the
United States should not have `humored them,' meaning us,'' she
said.
   Ms. Harjo's organization counts 3,500 individual members and
tribes containing 850,000 members.
   Responding to a student's question, Reagan said he would be
``very happy'' to meet with three Indians who went to Moscow during
the president's summit meeting with Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   They went under the sponsorship of the militant American Indian
Movement to call attention to their grievances, among them hunger
and lack of housing among Indians. The president has never met with
Indian groups.
   Reagan told the Soviets that American Indians ``from the
beginning, announced that they wanted to maintain their way of
life, as they had always lived there in the desert and the plains
and so forth. And we set up these reservations so they could, and
have a Bureau of Indian Affairs to help take care of them.''
   The president's remarks reflected decades-old oscillation in
U.S. policy toward native Americans. The federal government has
flip-flopped on whether Indians should be encouraged to maintain
their culture or abandon it and join the mainstream.
   Current policy is to maintain Indian cultures, treating the
tribes as sovereign governments in their own right.
   From 1887 to 1934, official policy was to try to turn Indians
into self-sufficient farmers. Although Franklin Roosevelt's
administration reversed the policy and originated the
``government-to-government'' idea, the Eisenhower administration
called for ``termination'' of tribes leading to assimilation of
Indians in the larger culture. Sixty tribes were dissolved, though
about half of those have been revived.
   Presidents Kennedy and Johnson reverted to a
government-to-government policy, and President Reagan has
reaffirmed it.
   By any standard, Indians are among the poorest of the poor, but
off-reservation Indians appear to do better than those on
reservations.
   The 1980 census found 12 percent of the nation's population
living in poverty, but among Indians poverty was found in 22
percent of those living off reservations and 41 percent of those on
reservations.
   Just this month, the Bureau of Indian Affairs released a report
documenting performance on standard tests by pupils in the schools
it runs. They do worse than 79 percent of the nation's pupils
overall.
   Reagan told his Moscow audience some Indians ``became very
wealthy because some of those reservations were overlaying great
pools of oil. And you can get very rich pumping oil.''
   Although some tribes distribute royalty revenue to members,
others use the funds as tribal revenues.
   Tribal oil royalties soared with oil prices, rising from $18
million in 1973 to $147 million in 1982, but fell back to $81
million last year as prices receded.
   These figures do not include the Osage Tribe in Oklahoma, which
manages its own lands and collects its own royalties _ by far the
largest of any tribe. The 4,749-member tribe got $71 million, about
$15,000 per tribal member, in 1981, when oil prices were peaking.
   Gregory Frazier, president of the Denver-based National Urban
Indian Council, said, ``There are a few (Indians) who have done
fairly well, but there are probably fewer than 100 Indians you
could point to and say, `They've got some wealth.' But that's not
oil; that's their own hard work.''
   Frazier, a Crow, said he got a check for $38 for oil royalties
last year.
   Frazier's group tries to make sure Indians living off the
reservation aren't forgotten or written out of federal legislation,
and tries to help those Indians use state and local welfare
agencies. There are practically no federal programs devoted to
off-reservation Indians.
   Indians leave the reservation because of ``education, jobs and
politics,'' Frazier said. ``Life can be very hard on a reservation
if you're part of the `Out' party.''
   ``I'm a fan of the president, but the president is a little bit
removed from the reality of American Indians,'' Frazier said.

<HEAD>Striking Hyundai Worker Stabs Himself In Dispute Over Wages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A striking Hyundai worker tried to
commit ritual suicide in Ulsan on Tuesday in a dispute over wage
increases, and police were asked to free 11 Hyundai executives
taken hostage by strikers in Changwon.
   Yoon Jung-han, 28, was in critical condition at a hospital after
plunging a knife into his abdomen before hundreds of colleagues at
a plant in Ulsan, an industrial city on the southeast coast. Yoon
fell to the ground with blood gushing out of a deep cut in his
abdomen, witnesses said.
   The worker took the action when he was asked by union leaders to
stop a speech to striking workers at the plant owned by Hyundai
Precision and Industry Co., a major manufacturer of train cars,
witnesses said. The company is a subsidiary of the Hyundai Motor
Co., the nation's leading automaker.
   Hyundai Motor's assembly line in Ulsan was shut down after more
than 80 percent of union members voted for a strike to press their
demand for wage increases, company officials said.
   About 20,000 Hyundai Motor Co. workers halted production Monday
and walked out in the salary dispute, the officials said.
   The Hyundai workers demanded wage increases of up to $177. The
company offered an increase of $54.
   Hyundai workers with five to six years of experience now earn
about $821 a month, including bonuses and other allowances, the
company said.
   On Friday, 2,000 workers at a Hyundai Precision plant in the
southern city of Changwon held 11 company executives hostage in
offices inside the plant, including chairman Chung Mong-ku and
president Yoo Ki-chul.
   After repeated efforts to free the executives, Hyundai officials
on Tuesday asked police to intervene. The striking workers refused
to back down and blocked all gates to the plant with containers and
trucks.
   Police officials said they would ``wait until the last moment''
to solve the situation without using force. But one police officer
said intervention was inevitable if the workers did not free the
executives ``in a day or two.''
   Police officials said they also needed to investigate an
incident on Friday in which two Hyundai officials were beaten
unconcious by striking workers as they tried to leave the plant in
Changwon. One official remained in criticial condition at a
hospital after brain surgery and the other was listed in serious
condition with head injuries.
   Cabinet ministers met Tuesday to discuss the situation and said
the government would deal sternly with those who broke the law.
   In another development, the U.S. government on Tuesday said it
supported the right of South Korean demonstrators to express their
opinions about the United States, as long as their protests remain
non-violent.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley was asked by
reporters in Washington to comment on recent anti-U.S.
demonstrations in South Korea.
   ``We support the right of free expression, of opinion. We
certainly understand people's wanting to express themselves, but we
strongly oppose the use of violence,'' she said.
   Radicals and students have held demonstrations in recent weeks
demanding the removal of 42,000 U.S. troops in South Korea.
   Thousands of students shouting ``Yankee go home!'' on Monday
joined a Seoul funeral procession for a dissident student who
committed suicide. Police fired tear gas when students burned a
U.S. flag, and a handful of students then threw firebombs at the
police.

<HEAD>Dukakis Plans to Be a Frequent Flyer in Weeks Before Convention</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis expects to clinch the Democratic
presidential nomination next week and then, skipping the
traditional break after the final primaries, immediately begin his
fall campaign with trips to more than a dozen states before the
July convention.
   Dukakis aides say the Massachusetts governor wants to broaden
his exposure throughout the country. His trips will include states
considered vital to his chances in the fall, including Florida and
Texas, Republican strongholds in recent presidential elections.
   ``We want to spend a good part of June out there in America,
traveling, telling people who Mike Dukakis is and why he would be a
good president,'' said Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.
   California, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana hold the final
primaries June 7. Five days later Dukakis will attend a National
Conference of Mayors convention in Salt Lake City. His schedule
then calls for a swing through Texas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky
and North Carolina.
   At the end of June, Dukakis plans to visit several Midwest
states, including Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan. He
also plans another trip to California and other Western states in
early July. The Democratic National Convention is July 18-21 in
Atlanta.
   Vice President George Bush, who has enough delegate votes for
the Republican nomination, plans campaigning in Texas and Colorado
June 9-11 but is scheduled to spend the rest of June and all of
July either in Washington or at his summer home in Maine, a
campaign spokeswoman said.
   During the six weeks between the final primaries and the
Democratic convention, Dukakis also will have to select a running
mate and plot convention strategy, in addition to his state duties.
But aides say he can take care of business while traveling.
   Democratic Party chairmen in Florida and Texas said Tuesday they
viewed early and frequent Dukakis appearances in their states as
vital to the Massachusetts governor's chances of winning them in
November.
   ``I certainly think it is imperative that he start early because
he is not really well known in Texas,'' said Texas Democratic Party
Chairman Bob Slagle. ``He has a reasonable chance in Texas. I
wholly agree with the strategy.''
   Dukakis will attend the Texas Democratic convention June 17-18,
when more than 10,000 state delegates and alternates will be on
hand.
   Bush represented Texas in Congress and claims the state as his
home. But recent polls have shown Dukakis close behind Bush _ and
leading the vice president in a hypothetical race with Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate.
   Slagle said Dukakis' fluent Spanish has made him popular among
Mexican-American voters, and he predicted Dukakis also would win
overwhelming black support in the fall. To beat Bush in Texas,
Dukakis will have to do well among working-class voters who are
traditionally Democrats but who supported President Reagan in 1980
and 1984, Slagle said.
   Charles Whitehead, the Florida party chairman, was equally
enthusiastic about Dukakis' fall chances in his state. Dukakis won
the Florida and Texas primaries in March.
   ``I think it can make the difference in whether or not we win
Florida.'' Whitehead said of the planned Dukakis visit. He said the
latest poll in Florida showed Bush with a slight lead over Dukakis.
As in Texas, the poll showed Dukakis winning if he picks a favorite
son running mate, in this instance Florida Sen. Bob Graham.
   In 1984, Reagan and former Vice President Walter Mondale relaxed
their campaign schedules between the final primaries and the
conventions. But Reagan was an incumbent president and Mondale also
was well known.
   As for Dukakis' plan, Bob Beckel, who managed the Mondale
campaign, said, ``I think it's a very smart move for Dukakis to do
that. It gives him a chance to work on his general election
message. Being out there and being seen will go a long way.''

<TEXT>
   An officer posed as a buyer of
stolen art to set up a raid at a hotel Tuesday that recovered three
stolen masterpieces worth up to $52 million, police said.
   The works by Dutch painters Vincent van Gogh and Johan Jongkind
and the French artist Paul Cezanne were recovered in a pre-dawn
raid on the Pullman Hotel. Police spokesman Klaas Wilting said they
were about to be sold for 1.5 million West German marks ($1.14
million).
   Burglars took the paintings, whose value has been estimated at
up to $52 million, from Amsterdam's Municipal Museum on May 20.
   Police said they arrested three suspects, a 36-year-old seller
and two prospective buyers aged 32 and 44. All are of Dutch
nationality but were not identified further in keeping with
standard police practice.
   Wilting would not reveal the undercover policeman's relationship
with the other two alleged buyers or give other details of his role.
   He acknowledged, however, that the West German currency was
provided by Dutch authorities. Dutch television said the undercover
agent had rented the two hotel rooms used for the transaction.
   Recovered were ``Carnations,'' an 1888 work by Van Gogh; the
1894 still life ``Bottle with Apples'' by Cezanne, and an 1874
painting by Jongkind, ``The House of Maitre Billaud in Nevers.''
   The Van Gogh was found inside the hotel and the other paintings
were in a car outside, all wrapped in blankets, police said.
   Wilting said museum director Wim Beeren told him the Cezanne had
a small scratch but the other paintings were undamaged.
   During the past week, police received anonymous tips that
``buyers were being solicited abroad,'' Wilting said. ``We got hard
evidence of that early this week, and that's when we decided to
act.'' He would not say why the price was set in West German
currency.
   Undercover agents _ ``pseudo-buyers'' as the police call them _
have appeared only recently as a tactic of Dutch authorities. Their
use is controversial because of allegations of entrapment.
   Although Wilting said the alleged seller has a police record for
burglary, there was no immediate word on whether he was believed to
be involved in the theft. A ground-floor window was smashed before
dawn to gain entry to the museum.
   The museum's 3,200 art works, primarily from the 19th and 20th
centuries, have been guarded during the night only by an electronic
alarm system since 1975, when guards were removed to save money.
   An electronic alarm at a private security firm sounded when the
window was broken, but reports indicated authorities were not
notified for up to 20 minutes.
   Beeren, the museum director, speculated after the burglary that
the theft was commissioned by a private collector, since it would
be very difficult to sell the paintings.
   He gave the value estimate of 100 million guilders, or $52
million, and said it was based on the record prices brought by Van
Gogh works at recent auctions.
   Last November a collector paid $53 million for ``Irises'' at a
New York auction, and eight months earlier Van Gogh's
``Sunflowers'' went for $29.8 million at a London auction.
   Experts from the London auction house Christie's estimated the
total value of the stolen paintings at only 21 million guilders
($11 million), with the Van Gogh worth $1.6-2.1 million.

<HEAD>New Protein `Zaps' Transplant-Attacking Cells</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new genetically engineered protein kills
transplant-attacking cells in mice, suggesting it might someday
eliminate the need for risky and costly anti-rejection drugs in
transplant patients, researchers said Tuesday.
   They expect the protein to be introduced for some leukemia
patients this fall and for human transplant patients in a year or
so. The leukemia patients suffer from a form of the disease marked
by an excess of transplant-attacking blood cells.
   ``This is not only more powerful, but it's far more selective''
than conventional anti-rejection treatment, said Dr. Terry Strom,
director of clinical immunology at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston.
   ``This therapy only zaps the cells that are active (against the
transplanted organ) at that time and doesn't depress the
(disease-fighting) immune system across the board,'' he said at the
annual meeting of the American Society of Transplant Physicians.
   Dr. Lawrence G. Hunsicker, the society's president, said the
findings represent `terribly important work.''
   ``The hope is that you could get someone who needs a kidney
transplant and put in whatever one you have available,'' Hunsicker
said. ``Maybe (tissue) matching at that point wouldn't make a
difference.''
   Researchers have been working for nearly a decade on the new
protein, a fusion of a portion of the diphtheria toxin, one of the
deadliest known toxins, and the natural immune system protein
interleukin-2.
   When the body's immune system is confronted with unfamiliar
material such as bacteria or a transplanted organ, it fights back
with a group of cells called T-cells.
   The foreign substances activate a small number of T-cells, which
produce interleukin-2 receptors, points on the cell surface to
which only interleukin-2 molecules will stick.
   Activation of these receptors leads to an immunological cascade
that activates more harmful cells which then attack the
transplanted organ, leading to rejection of the foreign tissue.
   To prevent this from happening, Strom and Dr. Jack Murphy, chief
of biomolecular medicine at Boston University Medical Center,
isolated the part of the diphtheria toxin that binds it to other
cells and replaced it with the binding portion of the interleukin-2
molecule.
   The result was a hybrid protein that seeks out and attaches to
only those T-cells harmful to transplanted organs, and kills the
T-cells with the toxin.
   ``The idea for this particular magic bullet is to use it right
after the transplant,'' Strom said.
   Over the past year, the researchers have tested the fusion
protein on mice that underwent heart transplants.
   Ten mice were injected with the protein immediately after
transplantation and received no other anti-rejection therapy, said
Dr. Robert Kirkman, a transplant surgeon at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston. The injections were administered daily for 10
days.
   Nine of the 10 mice appeared to retain their new hearts
permanently without need for chronic therapy, Kirkman said.
   All the mice receiving the fusion protein fared better than
those that received no treatment and those injected with only a
fragment of the diphtheria toxin.
   ``We're encouraged. We like what we see,'' Kirkman said.
   When the dose was increased 100 times, some kidney abnormalities
were noted, Kirkman said, but no side effects were noted at
therapeutic levels.
   Cyclosporine, an anti-rejection drug approved for general use by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1983, suppresses the
body's entire immune system and therefore enhances the risk of
infection. Side effects include kidney failure, excessive hair
growth and tremors.
   Cyclosporine also costs transplant patients $5,000 a year or
more.
   Researchers plan to test the fusion protein on monkeys, then
patients suffering from T-cell leukemia without any other hope.
Trials on transplant patients will follow, pending FDA approval.
   In humans, it's likely the fusion protein will be accompanied by
cyclosporine, Strom said.
   ``We have reason to think it will work well with cyclosporine in
low doses,'' he said. ``So maybe a little bit of cyclosporine will
go a long way with this toxin.''
   Researchers said the fusion protein eventually may be used to
treat autoimmune diseases, in which the body produces a disordered
immunological response against itself. Such diseases include forms
of diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.
   ``It's the promise for the future that's very exciting,'' Murphy
said.

<HEAD>Coroner Rules Deaths of Seven Drowning Victims Accidental</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COFFEEVILLE, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A holiday joy ride in an overcrowded
aluminum boat turned to tragedy when six young women drowned about
30 yards from the short of a lake, along with a man who tried to
rescue them.
   Funeral home officials who met with the families of the seven
victims said they hoped to complete arrangements by Wednesday
morning.
   Yalobusha County Coroner Stanley True said Monday he had ruled
the deaths accidental. ``There were several people that witnessed
the accident,'' he said. ``It was one of those tragic things.''
   The bodies were recovered in eight to 10 feet of water near the
boat, True said.
   Robert Armstrong, 32, who was operating the 16-foot,
flat-bottomed aluminum boat, said the occupants were on a slow
``joy ride,'' splashing water on each other when the accident
occurred Monday afternoon.
   ``One girl leaned over when the boat was turning and some water
started coming in the boat and everybody panicked,'' said
Armstrong, who admitted that the boat was overloaded.
   ``Everybody stood up and started moving around in the boat,''
said Armstrong. ``Then it turned over. They was just hollering
`Help. Help. Help.' Couldn't none of them swim.''
   ``There were about 35 or 40 people on the shore and I was
saying, `Somebody help us.' People on the shore kind of panicked. A
couple people fainted,'' he said.
   True identified the victims as sisters Anna Martin, 21, and
Marlee Martin, 20; their cousin, Janice Martin, 20; Sherry Taylor,
21; Sandra Baker, 24, and Sherry Jenkins, 19.
   Eddie Lee Rounds, 41, died after swimming from the shore in an
attempt to rescue the women, True said.
   Another boat passenger, Melvin Pernell, who still clinging to
the boat when he was rescued by a fisherman was reported in stable
condition Tuesday at Grenada Lake Medical Center.
   Witnesses told the Yalobusha County Sheriff's Department that
the boat had traveled about 30 yards from the shore of 25-acre Lake
Tillatoba in rural, north-central Mississippi when the accident
occurred. The group went to the lake for a fish fry and barbecue.
   The boat, according to Deputy Sheriff Homer Melton, was powered
by a 25-horsepower outboard motor and was designed to hold four or
five people. True said no life jackets were on the boat, but
Armstrong said there were two, though neither was worn.
   Three of the girls, Armstrong said, held hands when the boat
overturned and were still holding hands when their bodies were
recovered.

   An increase in the state sales tax from
5 percent to 6 percent is expected to pump $70.4 million into the
state's hard-pressed treasury between now and July 1, 1989.
   Paul McKown, president of the West Virginia Retailers
Association, said that, despite objections to the higher tax which
was to take effect at midnight Tuesday, most people ``feel they
have an obligation to participate and pay the bills of the state
and this is one way of doing it.''
   The tax increase was part of an elaborate compromise worked out
among the governor and the Legislature as they battled over
finances earlier this year, when the state was forced to borrow $80
million on a short-term basis to meet operating expenses.
   The compromise was approved during the March 22 one-day special
session of the Legislature. The increased sales tax is expected to
raise $5.4 million for the remaining month of this fiscal year and
and an estimated $65 million during the fiscal year that starts
July 1.
   It is due to expire on June 30, 1989, although some merchants
have said they expect it to become permanent after the general
election in November.
   The tax was included in a bill that allowed the governor to
borrow $30 million from the state black lung fund for miners to
meet a backlog in Medicaid payments for medical treatment for the
poor. The sales tax is to be used in part for the payback on the
loan money.
   McKown said the temporary tax will cause little inconvenience
for the state's 25,000 to 30,000 retailers, who collect and send
the tax to the state Tax Department.
   The state's border counties may see a temporary exodus of
customers to other states, but McKown said he does not expect that
to last long, if it even occurs. Surrounding Kentucky,
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Maryland have a 5 percent sales tax;
Virginia has a 4{ percent tax rate.
   Moore has called two more special legislative sessions to deal
with finances.
   The second special session starts Wednesday and will cover all
areas but education. Moore has proposed a nickel-a-gallon gasoline
tax increase to meet his proposed budget.
   The third special session will be dedicated to education, which
takes up 72 percent of Moore's proposed $1.46-billion budget. The
governor has threatened to revive several taxes which failed
passage in the Legislature previously. No date has been set for the
third session.

   Anti-apartheid clergymen ended an
unprecedented emergency conference Tuesday with a church service at
which they called for intensified non-violent resistance to the
government.
   ``We are determined we are going to obey God whatever the
cost,'' said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu. ``We are on the
march!'' he shouted as a mostly black audience of 1,200 people
shouted, cheered and whistled.
   The 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner then removed symbolic gags
from the mouths of black and white youths on the podium, took up a
wooden cross and carried it back and forth down the center aisle of
the Regina Mundi Cathedral. The audience held hands and swayed
together, singing ``We Shall Overcome.''
   Participating church leaders said they would try to mobilize
support for a three-day national protest planned next week by black
trade unions.
   They also disclosed plans for a campaign seeking release of
political prisoners, to start June 12 and end July 18 _ the 70th
birthday of jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, said: ``We are not trying to undermine
authority or advocate anarchy. We are distinguishing between two
different kinds of authority.''
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, mixed-race leader of the World Alliance
of Reformed Churches, said he wanted the convocation to adopt a
stronger statement calling for more protests and direct
confrontation with the government.
   ``I was hoping the convocation would ask for a personal
commitment that not all church leaders are ready to make either in
their personal capacities or on behalf of the churches,'' said
Boesak. ``It will take time. But we are moving away from a theology
of protest to a life of protest, and resistance.''
   Chikane said there was division among the church leaders, the
largest group in many years to gather to discuss action against
white domination.
   He said the decision to support the national protest next week
was significant but added that the church leaders had decided to
form a committee to work out details of specific actions.
   During the convocation, workshops were held to discuss a range
of anti-apartheid tactics, including ``non-cooperation and
non-collaboration'' with the government. The agenda suggested that
targets of civil disobedience could include tax payments, military
service and racially oriented laws such as those mandating
segregated residential areas.
   People attending the church service were asked to take these and
other proposals back to their congregations for consideration.
   The convocation was sponsored by the South African Council of
Churches, which includes major Protestant denominations active in
the fight for black rights. Also participating were the Roman
Catholic Church and a number of independent African churches.
   Organizers said political conditions in the country have
worsened since leading clergymen decided in early February to
organize the convocation.
   They cited the effective bannings of 17 anti-apartheid
organizations, the closure of two opposition newspapers, and
pending legislation to restrict labor unions and opposition
political groups.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department expressed hope Tuesday
that Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq will follow his
dismissal of the prime minister with prompt, free and fair
elections.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Zia's decision to fire Prime
Minister Mohammed Khan Junejo last weekend appeared to be within
rules set by the Pakistani constitution.
   ``We note President Zia's May 30th statement that there will be
no reversion to martial law, and that basic freedoms, including
speech, press and assembly, remain intact. We also note the
president's statement on holding national elections. We hope that
those elections will be held promptly, and that they will be free
and fair,'' she said.
   Zia, who came to power in a coup in 1977, granted power to a
civilian government three years ago, but the constitution permits
the president to dismiss the government if he feels there has been
a breakdown of law and order. The constitution provides for
elections to be held within 90 days.
   Asked if the United States would send officials to monitor the
elections, Mrs. Oakley said, ``all that is very premature. I'm sure
we'll be watching as the election process develops.''
   Pakistan's $645 million in U.S. aid for the current fiscal year
puts it third on the list of nations receiving American assistance,
behind only Israel and Egypt. Zia's country receives so much
because it acts as a funnel for aid to U.S.-backed resistance
forces in Afghan and provides a haven for more than two million
refugees from the Afghanistan war.
   Mrs. Oakley said the assistance would not be affected by the
political developments in Pakistan.

   Nancy Reagan raced through the
palaces of this czarist-built capital Tuesday, declaring the vast
art collection at the Hermitage ``staggering'' but lamenting the
``monstrosities'' of modern-day high-rises that blocked the view of
the famous skyline.
   Mrs. Reagan said she found the Soviet people ``very warm and
very open.''
   But as for Raisa Gorbachev, ``Well, she's a .... everybody's
different,'' Mrs. Reagan said with a shrug.
   Tens of thousands of waving, smiling citizens clustered along
the main thoroughfares, Nevsky and Moscow Prospekts, as her
two-dozen car motorcade slowed to take in the array of columed
buildings, domed churches and wide squares and statues that adorn
the imperial, inner city area.
   And as she admired the maze of boulevards and buildings, she
lamented the ``monstrosities'' of modern-day high-rises erected on
the edge of the city.
   ``Staggering, staggering, there's just too much to digest,'' the
first lady exclaimed at the end of her five-hour tour of this city
on the Baltic, founded by Peter the Great in 1703 and embellished
by czars and czarinas over the decades.
   Queried whether she had any more sympathy for communism after
viewing the extravagent finery used by the imperial family before
the revolution, she replied quickly, ``No.''
   The outpouring of affection that surrounded Mrs. Reagan appeared
to be spontaneous. Officials had not released her route in advance
and people lined the main streets to catch a glimpse of her. She
appeared as a speck of yellow in the back of a large black
limousine.
   Asked by American reporters during the flight here about her
hand-holding with Raisa Gorbachev at earlier meetings this week,
Mrs. Reagan replied, with a shrug of her shoulders, ``I don't know.
It just sort of happened.''
   Although Mrs. Gorbachev declined to join Mrs. Reagan's tour, she
arranged for Lidiya Gromyko, the wife of Soviet President Andrei
Gromyko, to accompany her.
   The first lady said she found Mrs. Gromyko ``very nice, very
friendly, very warm.''
   But asked if she had the same reaction to her tours with Mrs.
Gorbachev, Mrs. Reagan smiled, and sat silent 12 seconds pondering
her answer.
   ``Well, she's a .... everybody's different,'' she finally said,
evoking laughter from the reporters.
   When someone asked if Mrs. Gromyko lectured as much as Mrs.
Gorbachev, Mrs. Reagan joined in the uproarius laughter. ``Just
between us?'' Mrs. Reagan asked, turning to one reporter. ``How
many viewers and readers do you have?''
   After another long pause, she tried to drop the subject,
pleading, ``I'm desperately trying to think!''
   Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev will get back together on
Wednesday to view icons in the famous Tretyakhov Gallery in Moscow.
   Mrs. Reagan started her tour, as most foreign dignitaries do, by
paying homage to the 650,000 Russians who starved to death during
the 900 day siege of the city by the Nazi invaders in 1941. More
than a million people died in the defense of the city during the
war.
   In a solemn ritual, Mrs. Reagan placed a bouquet of red
carnations at the austere, dark stone Monument to the Heroic
Defenders.
   From there she traveled to the Hermitage, whose art collection _
one of the most fabulous in the world _ was begun in 1764 by
Catherine the Great. With a lecturer from the museum whispering
into her ear, Mrs. Reagan was whisked by masterpieces by Leonardo
da Vinci, Caravaggio, and other Italian, Flemish, Spanish and
French artists.
   ``Oh, so much to see!'' she exclaimed at one point, dramatically
clapping both hands to her head.
   The Mrs. Gromyko, who had some trouble negotiating the many
stairs and hectic schedule, was heard to observe of the American
pace, ``So quick. They stand, they go...'' Asked if she were tired,
she said, ``Of course, I'm tired. I'm 77 years old. How could I not
be tired?''
   The final leg on Mrs. Reagan's tour was a trip by hydrofoil to
Peter the Great's summer palace. She was accompanied by Dmitri
Likhachev, a famous Soviet specialist in early Russian literature
who has backed the preservation of older buildings.
   As the boat passed a series of complexes of austere, high-rise
apartment buildings, Likhachev commented that they were
``impersonal'' to which Mrs. Reagan agreed. He mentioned that the
buildings now blocked a view of the city`s famous skyline.
   ``Progress doesn't always mean something wonderful,'' Mrs.
Reagan observed, gesturing towards the buildings. ``But what are we
going to do about those monstrosities?''

<TEXT>
   An anonymous caller to a Bogota radio
station on Tuesday said a newspaper editor was kidnapped to force
the government to suspend the extradition of drug traffickers to
the United States.
   ``We are The Extraditables,'' the man told Radio Todelar in a
reference to a group that identifies itself with Colombian drug
traffickers that the United States has sought to extradite for
prosecution.
   The man said he and his associates abducted Alvaro Gomez Hurtado
on Sunday in Bogota. Gomez Hurtado, who is also a Conservative
Party leader, was kidnapped by four men carrying machine guns who
shot and killed his bodyguard.
   The caller also said the kidnappers want to exchange Gomez
Hurtado for Carlos Lehder Rivas, a reputed leader of Colombia's
so-called Medellin drug cartel who was convicted in the United
States on drug trafficking charges.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley was
asked about the possibility of an exchange of Gomez Hurtado for
Lehder.
   ``We don't deal. We don't make concessions,'' she said. ``We
deplore this act of violence, whether it emanates from the
traffickers, the violent left or right .... We offer his family and
friends our hope he will be released soon.''
   However, a statement signed by ``The Extraditables'' denied the
group was involved in the kidnapping. Reporters in Medellin, who
received the statement about five hours after the call to the radio
station, said it appeared to be authentic, based on previous
releases from the same group on other matters.
   The voice of the 69-year-old Gomez Hurtado was heard on the
radio station Monday saying: ``Oh, Oh, I'm dying.'' His wife and
daughter said the call should be taken seriously and they asked the
kidnappers for more details.
   The family said it had received an anonymous call and issued a
public appeal to the kidnappers for medical attention for Gomez
Hurtado, saying a team of doctors was standing by and that his
blood type is A positive.
   ``We demand that the government not extradite any more
Colombians to the United States. Furthermore, we don't accept that
our comrade Carlos Lehder is condemned to life imprisonment,'' the
anonymous caller told the radio station.
   Another caller to the radio station, who said he was among the
gunmen, said Monday that Gomez Hurtado had died from wounds
sustained during his abduction.
   But the man who called the radio station Tuesday said Gomez
Hurtado's injuries in an arm and a foot were not serious.
   ``We have Gomez Hurtado, injured,'' the man said, adding that he
had been taken Monday night by helicopter to Medellin, Colombia's
second-largest city, 250 miles northwest of Bogota.
   Lehder was convicted in May in federal court in Florida on
charges that he smuggled 3.3 tons of cocaine from Colombia to the
United States through the Bahamas. He was captured in a Colombian
jungle and flown to Florida for trial.
   Relatives of Gomez Hurtado, who also is a former presidential
candidate, say they were threatened earlier this year by the drug
traffickers because of his intense anti-drug campaign in his
newspaper El Siglo.

<HEAD>Increase in Farm Prices Reported for May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers got for raw products in May
averaged 3.1 percent over April levels and were 4.7 percent over
their mark for the same month last year, the Agriculture Department
said Tuesday.
   ``Higher prices for hogs, oranges, soybeans and broilers were
partially offset by lower prices for tomatoes, onions, milk and
upland cotton,'' the department's Agricultural Statistics Board
said in its preliminary report.
   May farm commodity prices averaged 134 percent of a 1977 base
used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures. A year
ago the index was 128.
   Hog prices climbed to their highest levels since October on
average, while cattle rose to the top levels since May 1979.
Soybeans marked the largest month-to month increase in more than
four years, 58 cents a bushel, and broilers were 5.5 cents a pound
over their April mark.
   According to USDA economists, net cash income of farmers set a
record of about $57 billion in 1987. This year's net _ the
difference between cash receipts and cash expenses _ may be in the
$50 billion-$55 billion range.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
   Preliminary May figures, based mainly on mid-month averages,
showed livestock and poultry prices up 2.7 percent from both April
and May 1987.
   ``Higher prices for hogs, broilers and beef cattle more than
offset lower prices for milk, eggs and calves,'' USDA said.
   Crop prices overall were up 4.5 percent from April and 7.4
percent above the levels of a year ago.
   The price index for oil-bearing crops, which consist mainly of
soybeans, was up 7.4 percent from the previous month and 26 percent
above the May 1987 level.
   Prices paid to commercial vegetable growers decreased 12 percent
from April's levels and 11 percent from last year. USDA attributed
most of the change to lower prices for tomatoes, onions and sweet
corn.
   The report also said:
   Cattle averaged $70 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up
from $69 in April and the $63 reported for May 1987. Those are
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   Hogs averaged $46.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $41.90 in
March and $54.40 a year earlier.
   Corn, at $1.89 a bushel, was up from $1.88 in April and well
over lastyear's mark of $1.66.
   Wheat prices at the farm, according to the preliminary figures,
averaged $2.83 a bushel, up from $2.79 last month and $2.66 a year
earlier.
   Rice averaged $8.27 per 100 pounds, down slightly from $8.33
last month but still far above the year-ago figure of $3.71.
   Soybeans were reported at $6.98 a bushel, compared with $6.40
last month and $5.20 in May 1987.
   Upland cotton averaged 56.4 cents a pounds, a decrease from 59.4
cents in April and 60 cents a year earlier.
   Eggs were 43.1 cents a dozen, down from 45.5 cents in April, and
49.3 cents in May 1987.
   Milk was reported at $11.75 per 100 pounds, an increase from
$11.72 last month but a decrease from $12.37 a year earlier.
   Broilers were 33.5 cents a pound, up from 28 cents last month
and 29.9 cents in May 1987.

   Patrick Alley, the reggae musician who
claimed Mick Jagger stole his music, has filed notice he will
appeal the verdict against him in his copyright lawsuit.
   Lawyer Jerome G. Lee Jr. said Tuesday he had filed a notice of
appeal in U.S. District Court because he had found new evidence
Jagger could have heard Alley's song. He would not elaborate.
   Alley, 36, of the Bronx, claimed the chorus of Jagger's 1985 hit
``Just Another Night'' had been stolen from his 1979 song of the
same title.
   The jury found that Jagger could not have heard Alley's song,
which was released both in New York and Britain and played on
several small radio stations in New York in 1983.
   Alley said he copyrighted his song in 1983 because drummer Sly
Dunbar, who played with Jagger on the album, told him his song was
``being ripped off,'' according to trial testimony. Alley said
Dunbar also played on his version.
   Alley claimed that Jagger had earned as much as $6 million from
the song.
   Jagger, whose song was copyrighted in 1985, testified he had
never heard Alley's song.
   Dunbar, who testified for Jagger, said he could not remember
playing on Alley's recording and denied ever telling Alley the tune
was being plagiarized.
   Jagger's attorney, Peter Parcher, said through his assistant
that he would comment if an appeal actually was filed.
   A notice of appeal, which must be filed within 30 days of a
verdict, does not mean an actual appeal would be filed. Appeal
papers must be filed with the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals,
which would hear arguments.

   Jesse Jackson said Tuesday he's ``earned
consideration'' to run as the Democrats' vice presidential
candidate, though he continued his presidential campaign one week
before the final primaries.
   Jackson, campaigning in New Jersey for the state's June 7
primary, also spoke of possibly going directly to the floor of the
Democratic National Convention in July to fight for platform planks
or other issues he considers important.
   On Tuesday, in what was billed as a ``major urban policy
speech,'' he also renewed his calls for equal rights and justice.
   ``Making America better is our challenge. Invest in the people.
Reinvest in America,'' he said.
   On the subject of the vice presidency, he was asked whether he
would accept if he should receive an offer from Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis to be the Massachusetts governor's
running mate.
   Jackson's reply: ``I've earned consideration.''
   Were he himself to win, he added, he would give the same
consideration to Dukakis.
   He declined to elaborate on his feelings about the No. 2 spot,
saying only, ``I'll discuss that in more detail after June 7.''
   Jackson said he and Dukakis must work together to defeat Vice
President George Bush, the Republican Party's all-but-certain
nominee.
   ``We need each other. We're keenly aware of that. Together, we
must use our combined strength to change the course,'' Jackson said.
   The Democrats' own course, Jackson said, is one that he _ not
Dukakis _ has set with what he called his progressive campaign
centered on a call for ``jobs, peace and justice.''
   Dukakis this week met with black Democrats, and later said
Jackson would have a major role at the convention and in the fall
campaign.
   ``If I put forth a vision, then reward me,'' Jackson said.
   ``I do not foresee confrontation,'' Jackson said. ``We can
effectively negotiate on mutually respectful terms.''
   Jackson said he expects the anchors of his campaign _ including
workers' pay, reduced military spending and the war on drugs _ to
become planks in the party's 1988 platform.
   He said he has been given six seats on the platform committee,
as has Dukakis by Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk.
   As the likely nominee, Dukakis would wield great power over the
platform. But Jackson said he, too, will help set the Democrats'
agenda. ``We've set the tone for the country,'' he said.
   If disputes occur, Jackson said, he and his supporters might
bypass the platform writers and take their issues to the full
convention.
   ``There's room to take one's case to the floor,'' he said.

   Lick Observatory, a pioneering
mountaintop astronomical complex that once boasted the world's
largest telescope, observes its 100th skywatching anniversary
Wednesday.
   It was at Lick where Edward Barnard found the fifth moon of
Jupiter; where the existence was established of innumerable distant
galaxies; where expansion of the universe was mapped; and where
scientists studied how stars form and age.
   Businessman James Lick, who set up a trust and earmarked
$700,000 for construction of the telescope and observatory, made
his orders clear: ``Build a powerful telescope, superior and more
powerful than any telescope yet made.''
   Lick died in 1876, 12 years before the observatory was ready for
operation. But his remains were moved to Mount Hamiliton in January
1887 and placed in a vault at the base of the Lick telescope.
   Astronomy was a strange choice for Lick, who got his start
making pianos in South America, made a fortune in California real
estate and once owned Catalina Island and big pieces of downtown
San Francisco.
   Lick Observatory was built on 4,430-foot Mount Hamilton, and an
immense 36-inch lens was mounted on a 57-foot tube _ then the
world's biggest telescope.
   ``It was the first real demonstration of the value of being on a
mountaintop,'' said Joseph Miller, an assistant Lick director,
noting that before Lick, most observatories were in cities.
   Later, mountaintop observatories became standard, encouraging
the development of other pristine sites, including those in Chile,
Hawaii and Southern California.
   Owned and operated by the University of Califoria, the
observatory 60 miles south of San Francisco has lost some of its
glitter. But its seven telescope domes, offices and workshops have
a world reputation for solid, valuable work.
   The telescope still functions, second in size only to the
40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin.
   The Lick telescopes today also include the 120-inch Shane
reflector, a 40-inch reflector, two 24-inch reflectors and a twin
20-inch refractor. The telescopes are used all the time, and are
most in demand for moonless nights.
   Lick also pioneered the use of reflecting telescopes, which use
a mirror instead of a lens to focus light.

   President Reagan and Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev plan to close their fourth summit with a joint communique
celebrating progress on two obstacles to a strategic arms treaty, a
U.S. official said Tuesday.
   The leaders, who attended signing ceremonies Tuesday for less
important agreements, on Wednesday also will exchange copies of a
ratified treaty to eliminate U.S. and Soviet medium-range missiles.
   That pact was signed at the summit last December, ratified
within the past week by the U.S. Senate and the Soviet Presidium,
and flown to Moscow by White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker
Jr.
   Progress on the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty came on
a U.S. proposal for verifying limits on mobile missiles and a
compromise on counting air-launched cruise missiles, said the
senior administration official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   But no progress was reported on Star Wars, which the Soviets
describe as the main impediment to a START agreement to cut
long-range weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   At the December summit, both leaders said they hoped to sign a
strategic arms pact in Moscow, but talks stalled over Star Wars,
mobile missiles, rules on counting cruise missiles aboard
warplanes, curbs on cruise missiles on submarines, and a U.S. call
to phase out heavy Soviet SS-18 missiles.
   Gorbachev expressed exasperation at the pace of the talks,
although both sides said they hoped the treaty could be signed by
the end of the Reagan presidency.
   Gorbachev told reporters Tuesday that maybe it's ``time to bang
our fists on the table'' to end the impasse.
   Reagan replied: ``I'll do anything that works,'' but said he
would not bargain away Star Wars, formally known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   ``It's never been a part of the negotiations,'' said Reagan.
   Because of difficulties in counting mobile missiles, the United
States had wanted to ban them, although it is developing one, the
Midgetman. The Soviets declined to get rid of their two mobile
missiles, the SS-24 and SS-25.
   During the summit, American negotiators offered a proposal they
had been working on for months, to restrict mobile missiles to
carefully defined geographical areas, dubbed ``garrisons,'' which
would be monitored by on-site inspection as well as surveillance
from spy satellites.
   ``The Soviets reacted positively to our proposal,'' said the
U.S. official.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov referred on
Monday to progress on the mobile issue, but neither the Soviets nor
the Americans gave details of the proposal.
   Arms control working groups, headed by Paul Nitze for the
Americans and Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev for the Soviets, also moved
toward a compromise on counting the number of cruise missiles
aboard warplanes.
   The Americans proposed that certain air bases be designated for
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, with every warplane stationed there
counted as carrying an agreed number of weapons, said the U.S.
official.
   The two sides have set to a limit of 6,000 warheads apiece. Each
bomber carrying gravity bombs and Short-Range Air-Launched Missiles
would be counted as one warhead.
   But negotiators have not agreed how many warheads to count as
being aboard each warplane. The Americans want to ``discount'' the
number, counting each heavy bomber as carrying 10 cruise missiles,
whereas the Russians would put the number closer to 20.
   Soviet officials complained that the United States had rejected
a Soviet proposal to resolve another sticking point, verifying
proposed limits on submarine-launched cruise missiles.
   Roald Sagdeyev, a Soviet scientist who has advised Gorbachev on
arms-related issues, told a news conference that the U.S. Navy was
blocking progress by sticking to its policy of refusing to
acknowledge whether or not a submarine or ship carries nuclear
weapons.
   Sagdeyev said the Americans had rejected a Soviet proposal for
an experiment to determine whether nuclear-missiles can be detected
aboard ships by measuring neutron and gamma ray emissions.
   Reagan and Gorbachev will issue their joint communique as the
summit winds up. They had one more business session scheduled for
Wednesday and then a departure ceremony on Thursday.
   Another senior U.S. official, who also demanded anonymity, said
the statment would be issued Wednesday or Thursday, depending on
the pace of talks senior negotiators were holding.
   In addition to the planned exchange of the ratified
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty and progress in the START
talks, the two sides signed a handful of lesser agreements on
Tuesday.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and his Soviet counterpart
Eduard A. Shevardnadze signed agreements on prior notification of
ballistic missile tests and for an experiment to tighten
verification techniques on a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to
150 kilotons.
   The head of the U.S. Information Agency, Charles Z. Wick, and
Soviet Culture Minister Vasily Zakharov signed a protocol extending
for another three years a cultural agreement signed in 1985. Other
agreements were signed covering transportation, civilian atomic
reactor programs, radio navigation, fisheries and maritime rescue.

   A committee of gun owners filed petitions
Tuesday to block Maryland's pioneering ban on sales of Saturday
Night Specials or cheap handguns and to force a public vote on the
gun control bill in November.
   Fred Griisser, chairman of the Maryland Committee Against the
Gun Ban, submitted petitions to the secretary of state that he said
contained signatures of more than 22,000 voters opposed to the ban.
   The committee will need 33,044 valid signatures by the end of
June to force the bill to referendum, and at least one-third of
those were due Tuesday.
   Griisser challenged statements by supporters of the law that it
will only ban Saturday Night Specials that serve no useful, lawful
purpose.
   ``We feel that this bill has the potential to ban all
handguns,'' he said.
   If the law survives the challenge from gun owners, it will be
illegal to sell or manufacture any handguns in Maryland unless they
are approved by a nine-member review board appointed by the
governor.
   The board is directed to ban guns that are cheaply made of poor
quality materials and are so inaccurate that they can't be used for
sporting purposes or self defense. It also is directed to ban guns
made of plastics or ceramics that can't be detected by metal
detectors.
   It is the first state law attempting to ban the sale of Saturday
Night Specials, and Gliisser said putting it to a vote in November
``is going to be a test case for the nation.''
   The bill drew broad support from gun control groups when it was
signed May 23 by Gov. William Donald Schaefer.
   Among those attending was White House Press Secretary James
Brady, who was seriously wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt
on President Reagan by John Hinckley Jr., who was armed with the
type of gun that would be banned by the Maryland law.
   Griisser said his committee has collected about $80,000,
including $50,000 from the National Rifle Association, for its
drive to defeat the gun law.
   Gun owners are petitioning only one part of the bill. They want
to retain the second part, which would repeal a ruling by the
Maryland Court of Appeals that victims of crimes committed with
Saturday Night Specials can sue the makers and sellers of the
handguns.
   State Attorney General J. Joseph Curran said Tuesday he hopes to
rule by next week whether only half of the bill can be subject to
referendum and, if so, whether the repeal of the court ruling can
stand if the rest of the law is defeated by voters.

<DATELINE>COLMA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bodies remained unburied Tuesday at 17
cemeteries in the San Francisco Bay area in the second day of a
strike by gravediggers with no new contract talks scheduled.
   Members of the Cemetery Workers and Greens Attendant Union Local
265 have complained that under current provisions, cemetery owners
can hire subcontractors for work usually performed by union
employees.
   However, John Cantwell, an attorney representing two
associations of cemetery owners, said the union concerns are
unfounded.
   ``We've given them every assurance that (owner's) contracting
out is not aimed at busting the union,.'' Cantwell said. ``I think
the objection is more emotional than rational.''
   Cantwell said owners have always used subcontractors forts, such as
laying concrete and removing hazardous trees.
Under the owners' provisions, subcontractors would be certain
projec used only for
jobs that would not threaten union positions, he said.
   ``But they've said that until we take that off the table, they
are unwilling to negotiate about anything,'' he said.
   The business agent for the local said the specific jobs that can
be contracted out are broadly mentioned in the current provisions.
   ``It's nice to have assurances, but we're negotiating a contract
here,'' said Carolyn Del Gaudio. ``Their proposal is based on an
open-ended pclosed early Tuesday.
   Goolsby said the heat to the grease vat was turned off when the
restaurant closed, but before it began to cool off it was 400
degrees Fahrenheit.

   Taxicabs are scarce, subway signs are
indecipherable and police guards are everywhere. So when the going
gets tough in Moscow, tough American visitors go shopping.
   Many of the White House staffers and news reporters attending
the Reagan-Gorbachev summit are forced to spend most of their time
in the Hotel Mezhdunarodnaya press center.
   When they grab a few minutes of free time, they usually head for
the hotel's duty-free Beryozka gift shop, which accepts U.S.
dollars and other hard foreign currencies.
   Among the recent gift shop customers was Elaine Crispen, press
secretary to first lady Nancy Reagan, who was found inspecting oil
paintings ofreligious figures. ``You caught me,'' she laughingly
told a reporter.
   Another man who spent time the hotel was John Brown, a U.S.
Information Agency official who flew to the Soviet capital from
Poland to lend a hand at summit coverage.
   He discovered that only a few reporters are selected to
accompany President Reagan on his summit forays. Hundreds of other
media people stay close to the press center, watching outside
events on television monitors and attending press briefings by a
steady stream of U.S. and Soviet officials.
   ``I really haven`t had time to get out since Reagan arrived,''
Brown said.
   White House stenographer Pamela Gray has spent virtually all her
time in the ``Mezh,'' as the press hotel is nicknamed, or shuttling
across town by bus to the Hotel Rossiya, where the television
networks maintain headquarters. She slipped into the shop to buy
souvenirs for a 3-year-old boy back home.
   Some of the most popular items on display are painted wooden
Russian dolls, whose prices range from $3 to $48. Also favored are
lacquered boxes, lifelike children's dolls and coffee table picture
books.
   Determined shoppers who ventured out to the giant GUM department
store near Red Square and other local shops were disappointed by
the merchandise.
   ``I feel sorry for the Russians _ they don't have anything,''
said Diane Jones of Miami, a Pan American World Airways flight
attendant.
   At the ``Marathon,'' a neighborhood cooperative store, one
American shopper found 10 sweatshirts, a few headbands and a dozen
pair of blue jeans _ one of which cost the equivalent of $176 in
rubles. The biggest crowd stood around a display of European-made,
low-heeled leather shoes.
   Besides shopping, the American summiteers enjoy eating the
caviar, ham and cheese sandwiches at the press center or sampling
the borscht, chicken Kiev, mushroom soup and other Russian fare in
hotel restaurants.
   Far more popular, however, were the free hamburgers that a
Louisiana entrepreneur, Bill Spiers, was dispensing at a kitchen in
the Hotel Mezh.
   Spiers, president of a chain of fast-food restaurants called
Fast Track, shipped in 10,000 hamburger patties to serve in a
summit restaurant operated by Cajun cook John Folse.
   When the restaurant's $16 cover charge _ fixed by the Soviets _
turned away many prospective customers, Spiers decided to give his
hamburgers away. He says he figures his $25,000 loss is worth all
the publicity.
   ``Representatives of every major media have eaten my burgers,''
he said.

   A group of international experts returned Tuesday
from a four-day visit to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran to help
prepare an appeal for a huge aid program to the area.
   Paer Stenbaeck, secretary-general of the International League of
the Red Cross, was among the group headed by Prince Sadruddin Aga
Khan, the U.N. relief coordinator for Afghanistan.
   Stenbaeck said the group's talks confirmed the need for a
step-by-step approach in repatriating the more than 5 million
Afghan refugees who have fled to neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
   ``At this time, no one can say whether there will be a
spontaneous or orderly repatriation,'' Stenbaeck said in an
interview. ``We have to work with two different scenarios.''
   He said the new Afghan prime minister, Mohammed Hassan Sharq,
indicated that plans could be made to receive 1 million returnees a
year. Stenbaeck said the ``clear message'' from leaders of the
Moslem guerrillas, who also met with the group, was that under
present conditions the refugees should not return.
   Guerrilla leaders said the situation may change after Aug. 15,
the date by which half of the 100,000 Soviet troops are scheduled
to have left Afghanistan under a settlement signed in Geneva April
14.
   A Swedish-financed survey released Monday in Stockholm said it
would take years and billions of dollars before agricultural
production could be brought back to levels that could support the
returning refugees.
   Stenbaeck said another major barrier to repatriation was the
estimated 5 million anti-personnel mines strewn across Afghanistan.
``Who will take the responsibility for clearing them ?'' he asked.

   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov charged Tuesday that one of the dissidents and refuseniks
invited to meet President Reagan was a Nazi war criminal.
   Gerasimov made the allegation at a news conference when asked to
comment on a question from a Moscow student to Reagan that he had
invited the ``Gestapo'' or German ``Polizei'' to his Monday meeting
with dissidents and refuseniks and their families.
   The student was repeating an allegation voiced Tuesday by the
Soviet news agency Tass, which said that Nikolai Rozhko, one of
those at the meeting with Reagan, ``voluntarily joined Nazi
police'' in 1942, one year after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet
Union in World War II.
   The Communist party newspaper Pravda and government daily
Izvestia also carried negative commentaries on the meeting,
attacking some of the participants by name.
   Tass said Rozhko was sentenced to death by military tribunal in
1944, but that his sentence was later commuted to 20 years'
imprisonment. In 1955, Rozhko was released on parole under a Soviet
government decree, Tass said. It did not say why.
   Gerasimov said Soviet journalists who attended Reagan's
reception for the dissidents, which was criticized by Soviet
officials, turned up the background on Rozhko by looking at Soviet
records.
   They ``were rather curious and looked into the dossier of the
invited,'' Gerasimov explained. ``They found out that one of them
in fact was a policeman sharing in the occupation of our country by
Germany ... so he was a former Nazi agent and a war criminal.''
   When asked about the allegation that a former Nazi was invited
to the meeting, Reagan told the Moscow student he did not know
anything about the man.
   A U.S. official who asked not to be identified said Rozhko is a
resident of the town of Grozdno in Byelorussia, a part of the
western Soviet Union ravaged during Nazi occupation.
   Rozhko was born in the United States and came to the Soviet
Union as a child with his parents, the official said. He has been
trying to emigrate for the past 20 years, but the Soviets have
denied him permission to leave.
   The source suggested that Soviet authorities have charged before
that Rozhko had a Nazi background, but ``never once gave us one
shred of evidence of his Nazi activities.'' The official said,
``This was not an issue (on Rozhko's emigration) until the Soviets
brought it up this week.''
   Memories of the struggle against the Nazis in World War II are
kept vividly alive in the Soviet Union, which estimates that 20
million citizens died in battles against Adolf Hitler's troops.
   The Soviet charges against Rozhko were likely therefore to lend
a highly negative connotation to Reagan's meeting with the
refuseniks, which unlike all other events in his program was
reported with negative comment by the state-run Soviet media.
   A senior Soviet journalist, speaking privately, said that
commentators at first were horrified when they learned of Reagan's
plans to meet with dissidents and refuseniks at his Moscow
residence. But he indicated they were then ordered to tone comment
down, and Communist Party leaders had made clear there would be no
other reaction to the meeting, he said.
   Pravda, quoting Reagan's reference to poet Alexander Pushkin
that ``it's time'' for more Kremlin reforms, said, ``Indeed, it's
time. Time to stop speculating on the problems of human rights
using this serious question as an easy reason for
self-advertisement and politicizing.''
   Izvestia criticized participants at the meeting, including
Alexander Ogorodnikov, a religious activist it accused of links
with ``anti-Soviet clerical centers abroad,'' Lev Timofeyev, a
campaigner for press freedom, and Abe Stolar, a 73-year-old
American citizen who has been trying to emigrate with his family
since 1975.
   Tass and Izvestia accused the people invited to meet Reagan at
the U.S. ambassador's residence of opposing official efforts at
reform and have nothing to do with efforts at changing the Soviet
Union because they want only to leave or to dismantle its Communist
system.
   ``Those invited to Spaso House are hampering (reforms) by their
noisy behavior, because far from being interested in them, they are
pursuing their selfish goals _ self-advertisement, gifts and praise
from the West,'' Izvestia said.

<TEXT>
   The United States signed an agreement on
Tuesday with India to end a seven-year trade dispute over the sale
of American almonds.
   Under the six-year agreement, India agreed to allow annual
almond imports from all sources to increase to $20 million during
the first three years. In the second three-year period starting in
1991, India said it would remove all import licensing restrictions
on almonds if India's balance of payments position improves to an
agreed-upon level.
   In return, the California Almond Growers Exchange agreed to
withdraw a petition it had filed in January 1987 charging India
with unfair trade practices.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and India's
ambassador, P.K. Kaul, attended a ceremony Tuesday to mark an end
to the dispute.
   U.S. almond sales to India have averaged around $4 million a
year in recent years.
   ``This agreement will create significant additional
opportunities for U.S. almond growers and demonstrate to the world
that we are serious about expanding our markets,'' Yeutter said.

<HEAD>Nancy Reagan Says She's Had Little Time With Her Husband During
Summit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan said Tuesday that she
and President Reagan have had such hectic schedules during the
U.S.-Soviet summit that they are ``like ships passing in the
night.''
   Mrs. Reagan, who met twice with reporters aboard the U.S. plane
that took her on a day-trip to Leningrad, said she's ``pretty well
adjusted'' to the jet lag and the eight-hour time difference
between Washington and Moscow.
   The first couple had a 3{-day stopover in Helsinki, Finland, in
order to adjust to the time change and to prepare for the five-day
superpower summit.
   ``I was awake at 6 a.m. this morning, and usually I wake up at 3
a.m., so that's progress,'' Mrs. Reagan said.
   Given the observation by some reporters that Reagan appeared
quite tired, Mrs. Reagan was asked how her husband was sleeping.
   ``He sleeps fine,'' she said.
   However, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said at a
briefing that while there was no problem with the president's
health, ``he did have a difficult night's sleep. And we're all a
little tired.''
   Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, took Mrs. Reagan's
side, saying he walked up a steep staircase with Reagan.
   ``I felt breathless, but the president felt OK,'' Gerasimov said.
   The first lady said she's had little chance to discuss summit

   Standing beneath a towering bust of Lenin,
President Reagan quoted from Boris Pasternak's once-banned ``Doctor
Zhivago'' Tuesday in a fervent plea that ``the first breath of
freedom'' be allowed to flourish in the Soviet state.
   He won a standing ovation from about 2,000 teachers and students
at Moscow State University, where his host, Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, earned a degree in 1954.
   In a session that covered topics as diverse as the plight of
American Indians to the two-term restriction on American
presidents, Reagan took questions from a stage beneath Lenin's bust
and a banner emblazoned with a hammer and sickle.
   ``Let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on
human freedom,'' said Reagan, ``from one of the greatest writers of
the 20th century.''
   With that he quoted Pasternak's famous novel, banned for many
years in the land where its author lived:
   ``I think that if the beast who sleeps in man could be held down
by threats, any kind of threat, whether of jail or of retirbution
after death, then the highest emblem of humanity would be the lion
tamer in the circus with his whip, not the prophet who sacrificed
himself. But this is just the point: what has for centuries raised
man above the beast in not the cudgel, but an inward music, the
irresistible power of unarmed truth.''
   Soviet young people are living ``in one of the most exciting,
hopeful times in Soviet history'' Reagan said, when ``the first
breath of freedom stirs in the air.''
   The world is undergoing an economic revolution, but progress
``is not foreordained,'' he said. ``The key is freedom _ freedom of
thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication,'' he
said.
   One student told Reagan that a delegation of American Indians
had traveled here because they found it impossible to meet with him
in Washington. Reagan said he did not know they had sought an
audience, and that ``I'd be very happy to see them.''
   He said the United States had given the Indians millions of
acres of land and established reservations where they could live if
they chose. ``We've done everything we can to meet their demands as
to how they want to live. Maybe we made a mistake. Maybe we should
not have humored them'' and insisted that they become integrated in
American life.
   He also said that after he leaves the White House he would
deliver after-dinner speeches preaching his conservative political
agenda and campaigning for a constitutional amendment restoring a
president's ability to serve more than two full terms.
   In a luncheon meeting with writers, filmmakers and other artists
at the Writers Union, Reagan praised what he called a recent thaw
in the Soviet arts.
   Dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov and cellist Slava Rostropovich should
be able to perform again in Moscow and Nobel Prize winning author
Alexander Solzhenitsyn should be published ``in the land he dearly
loves,'' Reagan said.
   ``He spoke very sincerely, he spoke about his private life and
he mentioned all those names which are very dear to Russian
intelligentsia,'' Fyodor Burlatsky, an adviser to Gorbachev, said
after Reagan's speech at the Writers Union.
   But Dan Unguryanu, a history student from the Soviet republic of
Moldavia, said ``the leader of a great country should be more
intellectual.''
   ``But he is charismatic,'' said Unguryanu. He added that in
signing a treaty banning medium- and shorter-range nuclear
missiles, Reagan ``has shown us a good example of American
political pragmatism.''
   Mikhail Vasyanin, 20, a student in the linguistic department and
a member of the Young Communists League said, ``Really, the term
`Great Communicator' is good for him.'' He said that some of
Reagan's answers did not correspond to the questions, but he made a
good imression anyway.
   Physics graduate student Alexander Glazkov, 23, said, ``It's too
bad Ronald Reagan has to leave office. There are those who don't
agree with me, but I'd like to see him elected to a third term.''
   Students interviewed before and after the meeting said they were
members of the Young Communist League and had received their
tickets from the organization.
   Students from different university departments approached two
microphones in an orderly manner, suggesting their order and
questions were prearranged.

<TEXT>
   Honduras' former ambassador to Panama pleaded
innocent Tuesday to charges he imported 26 pounds of cocaine into
the United States.
   Rigoberto Regalado Lara, 49, was stripped of his diplomatic
immunity and his post by the Honduran government after U.S. Customs
officials discovered the cocaine hidden inside coffee bags in his
luggage at Miami International Airport on May 15.
   He faces federal charges of importing cocaine and possession
with intent to distribute.
   On Tuesday he told U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff he was
innocent of the accusations. The case was assigned to U.S. District
Judge Edward Davis, but no trial date was set.
   Regalado was then returned to the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center in southwest Dade County, where he has been
held without bond since his arrest.
   Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office have described
Regalado as a relatively low-level ``mule'' who simply transported
the drugs.

<HEAD>Soviets Issue Stamp in Honor of Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has issued 2 million stamps
celebrating the Moscow summit between Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and President Reagan, a news report said Tuesday.
   Novosti, a government news agency that produces feature reports,
said the stamp first was issued on May 29, the day Reagan arrived
in Moscow, and shows a firm handshake with a background of the U.S.
and Soviet flags and the Kremlin's Spasky Tower.
   The stamp, which is worth 5 kopeks (8 cents), has an inscription
across the top saying, ``Soviet-American Summit.'' Below it is
written the dates May 29-June 2.
   Novosti said the sketch for the stamp was done by artist Yuri
Livinovsky.
   The news agency said several dozen stamps on the theme of
U.S.-Soviet relations have been produced in the Soviet Union since
1943, when the first was produced before the Tehran conference of
World War II allies.
   A stamp was produced in honor of the Washington summit meeting
in December 1987, and a month later the Soviets produced a stamp to
mark 30 years of a Soviet-American agreement on culture, technology
and education.

   A flight attendant who was injured when a pilot
abruptly turned a Continental Airlines DC9 to avoid a small plane
said Tuesday that passengers remained calm and she didn't know what
happened until after they landed.
   Milotka Liebelt said she was bent over her luggage near the rear
of the airplane when the small plane was spotted about 100 feet
away.
   ``It just happened in a split-second,'' Mrs. Liebelt said
Tuesday from her Akron home. ``Before I could realize what was
going on, I was on the floor with my bag in my lap.''
   Mrs. Liebelt was the only person reported injured when
Continental Flight 283 narrowly missed colliding with the small
plane while the jet prepared to land Monday at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport. The flight from Boston to Cleveland carried
79 passengers and a crew of five.
   Mrs. Liebelt, 35, was treated at Southwest General Hospital for
bruises to her back and left knee.
   ``I don't see how that (small) plane could not have seen us,''
she said. ``Thank God that our first officer responded instantly.''
   ``The first officer (co-pilot) observed a light aircraft
approximately 100 feet below our aircraft and to the right. He
initiated a sharp climb to the left and gained an additional 800
feet of altitude,'' said Continental spokesman Ned Walker in
Houston. ``The Continential pilot did a professional job in
reacting the way he had been trained.''
   Walker said the airline does not release crew members' names.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident,
officials said Tuesday. The encounter occurred in restricted air
space at about 7,000 feet and five miles southeast of the airport.
   However, FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein said from Chicago that air
traffic controllers were unable to track the small plane, which
didn't show up on radar.
   Small planes entering restricted airspace near airports are
required to get tower permission and to carry transponders, which
produce a signal to display airplane identification on radar
screens.
   Mrs. Liebelt said the flight had been uneventful and the
passengers, who were in their seats in preparation for landing at
the time of the sudden maneuver, remained calm.
   ``It's amazing when things happen, you don't have time to get
scared. You just assume your responsibilities,'' she said.
   Mrs. Liebelt said the plane's captain told the passengers what
had happened after the plane landed at Hopkins.

<HEAD>Houston-Area Restaurant Owner Cited For Hiring Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL L. GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents slapped $10,000 worth of citations
on the owner of a Mexican restaurant chain Tuesday, claiming he is
Houston's most blatant employer of illegal aliens.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service agents delivered
citations and notices of intent to fine to lawyers for Ghulan
Bombaywala, president and chief executive officer of Marco's
Restaurants Inc. The chain operates 10 Mexican restaurants that
employ about 500 people, INS officials said.
   Bombaywala's lawyer said the government was overreacting.
   Under provisions of the 1986 Immigration Reform Act, Tuesday was
the last day federal officials had to serve citations before
issuing fines.
   Starting Wednesday, ``we can go directly to the fine. That's the
major difference beginning June 1,'' INS District Director Ronald
Parra said at a news conference.
   Parra said Bombaywala and his lawyer, Harry Gee, had 30 days to
respond to Tuesday's notices by either paying the fine or
requesting a hearing before a federal administrative law judge. Gee
said they likely would request the hearing.
   INS officials said they raided one Marco's Restaurant in January
and arrested 18 illegal aliens working there. In April, another
raid netted nine illegal workers.
   ``He didn't have any intention to clean up his act,'' said
Michael McMahon, INS deputy director in charge of employer
sanctions. ``The top rung of the ladder _ the corporate structure _
had some knowledge.''
   But Gee said the INS citations and fines were an overreaction by
the government and the result of a misunderstanding.
   ``Our client has made very strenuous efforts to comply,'' Gee
said. ``All of our people now are in compliance.''
   Gee, who described Bombaywala as a Pakistani who has become a
U.S. citizen, said his client has made good-faith efforts by
meeting with INS officials and by getting attorneys for
undocumented aliens who wished to apply for amnesty.
   ``We have a disagreement (with the INS) as to what constitutes a
good-faith effort,'' Gee said.
   He estimated more than 100 aliens had been aided by Bombaywala.
   Ronald Finch, the INS special agent who delivered the four-page
citation and intent to fine to Gee with about a dozen reporters and
photographers in tow, said the Houston INS office was working about
25 such cases, with around 15 nearing the stage at which fines will
be sought.
   Parra said most of the 66,000 Houston businesses have cooperated
with immigration officials to comply with the tough, new federal
laws regarding hiring of illegal aliens.
   ``We are not going to tolerate non-compliance with the law,'' he
said. ``The message to employers is: It's no longer good business
to hire illegal aliens.''

   Thousands of Armenians stayed away from work on
Tuesday in a general strike that shut down factories and mass
transportation in a city at the center of an ethnic dispute, a
local resident said.
   Also Tuesday, the Tass news agency announced that two officials
were dismissed from the Communist Party for alleged negligence that
led to the violence between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   In the Armenian capital of Yerevan, round-the-clock
demonstrations were reported to be continuing for a fifth day.
   The resident of the city of Stepanakert, reached by telephone
from Moscow, said public transport was not running and that
factories and other businesses in the city were closed in a strike
that had been going on for days.
   ``People aren't working,'' the woman said. Asked how many, she
answered: ``Many thousands. Everyone.'' She hung up the telephone
before a reporter could ask her name or other questions.
   In Moscow, dissident journalist Sergei Grigoryants said the
general strike had been under way for about a week.
   Telephone calls to Stepanakert city offices and radio and
television stations did not go through.
   Stepanakert is the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in
the republic of Azerbaijan. Armenians want the Armenian-dominated
region to be made a part of their neighboring republic.
   Armenian literary critic Rafael Popoyan, 45, said by telephone
from his Yerevan home that since Friday about 5,000 people have
gathered during the day and 20,000 in the evening on the square
outside the city's Opera Theater. He said smaller groups of
protesters, mostly students, continued the vigil overnight,
``awaiting an official response to their demand.''
   The protesters want Armenia's Supreme Soviet, the republic's
parliament, to consider the annexation issue at a meeting next
week, he said.
   Popoyan, who spent four years in jail and six months in internal
exile for distributing underground literature, said Yerevan
authorities have not tried to stop the demonstrations.
   On Monday, Grigoryants, who is half-Armenian and half-Russian,
said the crowd in Yerevan swelled to about 300,000. It was unclear
why the figure he cited was so much higher than that given by
Popoyan.
   Armenians began agitating in mid-February for the right to annex
Nagorno-Karabakh. At the end of the month, ethnic rioting broke out
in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait. At least 32 people _ six
Azerbaijanis and 26 Armenians _ were killed.
   Most of the 160,000 residents of Nagorno-Karabakh are ethnic
Armenians, most of them Christians. Since 1923, the region has been
part of Azerbaijan, whose titular ethnic group is predominantly
Moslem.
   The Soviet government rejected the demand to change jurisdiction
over Nagoro-Karabakh, opting instead for a program of social and
economic development.
   On May 21, Communist Party officials fired the two leaders of
Armenia and Azerbaijan, apparently because they had not quelled the
unrest.
   New party shake-ups were announced Tuesday. Tass said the former
first secretary of the Nagorno-Karabakh regional party committee,
Boris Kevorkov, was dismissed from the party because of his
``serious political mistakes.''
   ``His errors resulted in the loss of the party organization's
vanguard role and in the heightening of inter-ethnic relations,''
Tass said in announcing the action taken by a plenary meeting of
the Azerbaijani party organization. ``He was found to be personally
responsible for the disorders that took place in the autonomous
region.''
   Kevorkov had been dismissed as head of the Nagorno-Karabakh
party committee on Feb. 24. He was replaced by Genrikh Pogosyan,
subsequently identified by Tass as an Armenian born in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Tass said the plenum also dismissed from the party D.M.
Muslim-Zade, the former first secretary of the Sumgait city
committee, for ``serious shortcomings in organizational and
political work that brought about the tragic developments in
Sumgait.''

   Republicans working Tuesday on their
party platform accused the Democrats of being less open than the
GOP and of trying to hide liberal views of likely nominee Michael
Dukakis.
   GOP Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said of the Democrats,
``They are simply not interested in writing an honest,
straightforward platform that expresses their true plan for
America. The Republican approach is one of openness.''
   Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin said Republicans would force the
Democrats ``to take the field'' on critical issues and would
``flush the Dukakis Democrats'' out, exposing what he said were
their left-of-center views.
   The seven-member committee met to discuss social issues in one
of four hearings it will hold before the national convention in New
Orleans.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas said in remarks to the committee
that the value of the platform should be restored by shortening it
and not ``making it a catch-all and promise-all.''
   Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk has made a similar request
concerning his party's platform.
   Kassebaum said, ``The one major difference between Republicans
and Democrats is that government must have a limited role.''
   Gov. Mike Hayden of Kansas urged the committee to include a
strong rural plank in the platform.
   ``Sometimes policies of the federal government have
discriminated against rural areas,'' Hayden said. ``We have heard
about urban renewal, but seldom have we heard about rural
revitalization.''
   The party's 1980 and 1984 platforms, the latter particularly
pleasing to conservatives, will serve as a basis for the 1988
platform, said Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, chairman of the platform
committee.
   ``It's a good base,'' Mrs. Orr said of the 1984 platform. ``But
times have changed. There is a different emphasis that we will
place on things.''
   Fahrenkopf said the 1984 platform ``established a base, a soul''
for the party.
   ``But times have changed, problems have changed,'' Fahrenkopf
said at a news conference held by the seven committee members
during a lunch break. ``We want to take conservative approaches to
solve the problems we see coming down the road.''
   ``We have had no specific direction from Bush,'' Mrs. Orr said,
referring to likely GOP presidential nominee George Bush. ``We will
have a line of communication open. We're very interested in the
vice president's views.''
   As for the party's November opponents, Fahrenkopf said, ``The
Democrats face a level-with-America dilemma. Do they hide the
liberal agenda and record of their nominee Michael Dukakis, or do
they level with Americans and detail their liberal goals and
plans.''

<HEAD>Government Gives Toledo Zoo OK To Continue Panda Exhibit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service gave the
Toledo Zoo the go-ahead Tuesday to continue exhibiting two giant
pandas on loan from China.
   David Klinger, spokesman for the service, said export documents
provided by the zoo late Friday have been reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
   ``The permit is acceptable to us,'' Klinger said. ``The
condition of the law has been met. That should settle it.''
   He said the zoo will be notified by letter Wednesday and that
the panda exhibit will be allowed to continue.
   However, a lawsuit is pending in which a wildlife group contends
the pandas _ an endangered species _ are being exploited for
commercial gain.
   In its federal suit against the Fish and Wildlife Service, the
World Wildlife Fund argues that the exhibit violates an
international convention that bars trafficking in endangered
species for commerical purposes.
   U.S. District Court Judge Norma Johnson has set a hearing on the
suit for June 13.
   The pandas entered the United States on May 13 accompanied by an
exemption form instead of a full Chinese export permit as required.
   The animals were allowed to begin their three-month exhibit last
Tuesday as part of Toledo's 150th anniversary celebration, but the
USFWS gave the zoo until May 29 to provide the proper documentation.

<TEXT>
   Fallen PTL founder Jim Bakker returned to
the Heritage USA theme park Tuesday and said he would try to buy
back the ministry if it were liquidated in bankruptcy court.
   ``I would set up offices near here, which I probably will do. As
every peice of ministry comes up for sale, I would buy it to
restore it to the people it was meant for,'' Bakker said in a break
in a meeting with PTL attorneys, his attorneys and Roe Messner, the
primary builder of the Heritage USA theme park.
   ``I want to see the ministry restored 100 percent,'' Bakker
said, adding right now it ``looks bleak'' for the ministry.
   He said the meeting was to back up Messner's claims against PTL
in the bankruptcy proceedings. Messner, next to the Internal
Revenue Service, is the largest single creditor in the PTL
bankruptcy proceeding.
   Bakker left PTL after charges of paying off Jessica Hahn, a
church secretary, to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with him,
and that was followed by revelations of a lavish lifestyle led by
Jim and Tammy Bakker.
   When he came out of the World Outreach Center where the meeting
was being held, a group of about a dozen supporters shouted words
of support and hugged him.
   He said after the meeting he would be visiting friends and
relatives and riding around the grounds of PTL.
   Bakker said he was there at Messner's request, and charged that
most of the records he had left behind when he left PTL in March
1987 have been destroyed.
   ``Almost all of the blueprints of all the buildings are
missing,'' Bakker said.
   When asked who might have destroyed the records, he said, ``Any
of them who might want to take over the ministry.''
   Pressed for further specifics, he said, ``I don't know.''
   Asked how he would buy back PTL, he said, ``I have a lot of
friends.'' He again would not provide specifics.
   Bakker said the meeting did not touch on whether he should come
back to the ministry, but that he would if he were asked.
   ``I think everybody else has had a chance ... it's being sold
off. What would be wrong with giving Jim and Tammy a chance,''
Bakker said.
   The ministry is in bankruptcy court now, with up to $130 million
in debt, and a reorganization plan calling for the sale of much of
PTL's assets is up for final approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Rufus Reynolds on June 16 in Columbia.
   Before the meeting, Bakker told reporters he wants to meet with
new ministry trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton to ensure the ministry's
Lifetime Partners are given everything they're owed.
   Bakker said he would like to meet with Charlotte, N.C.,
businessman George Shinn. Shinn, owner of the Charlotte Knights
minor-league baseball team and the new Charlotte Hornets of the
National Basketball Association, is one of the people interested in
buying Heritage USA, and he would like to build a baseball stadium
there.
   Bakker didn't say how long he'd remain in the area, but said his
wife, Tammy, will join him in a few days.
   Ryan Hovis of Rock Hill, another Bakker attorney, said the
Bakkers have left their home in California and are returning to
their home in Gatlinburg, Tenn.
   Bakker is being investigated by a federal grand jury in
Charlotte for possible mail fraud and tax evasion and is involved
in lawsuits with PTL and his former attorney Roy Grutman.
   David Clark, who recently stepped down as PTL trustee, filed a
$52 million lawsuit in January against Bakker, his wife and former
top aide David Taggert. Earlier, Bakker and Taggert sued PTL for
$1.3 million and $187,000 respectively.
   In March, Bakker sued Grutman for $10,000 for conflict of
interest.
   The Bakkers stayed at their former Tega Cay residence for
several weeks in June 1987 as they attempted to regain control of
the ministry from the Rev. Jerry Falwell. They also returned in
October 1987 to visit Jim Bakker's father Raleigh, who was ill at
the time.

   At Moscow's House of Writers, President Reagan
talked to some of the Soviet Union's leading intellectuals about
how an actor could become a politician, explaining that both
artists and political leaders had to be able to grasp a vision and
to put it into life.
   ``By the way, I've found that Mr. Gorbachev has the ability to
grasp and hold a vision and I respect him for that,'' Reagan told
the 38 intellectuals assembled in the House of Writers' elegant
wood-paneled restaurant.
   Using references to two beloved and persecuted Soviet poets,
Nikolai Gumilyev and Anna Akhamatova, Reagan went on to explain
that artists _ and, in a democracy, politicians _ understood the
need to embrace all the strands of human existence.

   It had the makings of a potential disaster for the
U.S. Information Agency's office at the international press center.
   Copying machines are rare in the Soviet Union, so USIA had a
large copier flown in to handle the job of reproducing the reams of
papers the government provides to reporters.
   But the machine literally blew up _ smoke poured from the top _
on Sunday when it was plugged in because it had not been converted
to the proper electrical current.
   John Harrod, a USIA spokesman, said the office needed another
machine ``real quick like,'' so officials had one brought in Monday
morning from Germany. That machine proved to be defective.
   Two technicians, taking instructions from someone in Washington
over the telephone, managed to repair the machine more than 24
hours after Reagan arrived.
   ``The whole idea of a summit is communications and if you can't
communicate, you're in trouble,'' Harrod said.

   Muscovites woke up to a new sound Tuesday _ a
radio talk show broadcast straight from WAVA, a station in
Arlington, Va., a suburb of the U.S. capital.
   Don Geronimo and Mike O'Meara, working in Virginia, were on the
air for about 30 minutes Tuesday morning, speaking English on Radio
Moscow.
   The two irreverent disc jockeys took calls from American
listeners, talked to a relative in Beloit, Wis., and cracked jokes
about pollution. ``That's something the Russians can relate to,''
one said.
   They closed the show, telling the Russians they were planning to

<HEAD>Norwegian Relief Group May Suspend Activities in Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Norwegian relief group said Tuesday it
may suspend work in Lebanon if a member of its staff who has been
missing for 10 days does not turn up.
   Fears that Dr. Jan Cools, a 32-year-old Belgian physician, was
kidnapped have been expressed by the relief group NORWAC and others.
   ``Within one week we will stop working in Beirut if nothing
happens,'' said Kristin Ingebrigben, coordinator for the NORWAC
group. ``We are also thinking of stopping our activities in
Tripoli,'' a port in northern Lebanon.
   NORWAC evacuated its seven staff members from south Lebanon on
Saturday. It has 18 people in Lebanon.
   Cools has worked with NORWAC for three months. He vanished May
21 after leaving his apartment in the Rashidiyeh Palestinian
refugee camp near the ancient port of Tyre in south Lebanon.
   Ms. Ingebrigben said the group had no confirmation that Cools
left the camp. She said he was bound for a base of the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Tyre to pick up his mail.
   ``We cannot take the responsibility any longer for foreign
people as long as we don't know anything about what happened to Dr.
Cools,'' she told a news conference at her group's headquarters in
Moslem west Beirut.
   Police say they have no information about his disappearance.
NORWAC said it did not know what happened to Cools despite
contacting ``all the organizations and authorities concerned in the
area.''
   All Lebanese and Palestinian parties NORWAC approached denied
involvement in the physician's disappearance, Ms. Ingebrigben said,
and ``we didn't hear anything from anybody. We don't accuse anyone
of Jan's disappearance.''
   Rashidiyeh's ``popular committee,'' which runs the camp's
day-to-day affairs, said last Thursday that gunmen seized Cools at
a road junction near Tyre. It gave no details and did not identify
the alleged abductors.
   Ms. Ingebrigben said Cools' disappearance might affect
humanitarian work in Lebanon. She did not elaborate, but said
NORWAC had been in touch with other humanitarian agencies.
   Three other relief workers, two Scandinavians and a Briton, were
kidnapped in south Lebanon this year.
   Jan Stening, 44, and William Jorgenson, 58, of Norway were
seized Feb. 5 near Sidon, another southern port, and freed March 2.
They worked for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which cares for
Palestinian refugees.
   UNRWA blamed the abduction of Stening and Jorgenson on
Palestinians acting for personal motives. It evacuated foreign
staff members and reduced its services in the refugee camps until
the men were released.
   Palestinian guerrillas seized Peter Coleridge, Middle East
coordinator of the British relief agency Oxfam, and a Syrian aide
in Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp March 4 after he took
photographs. Both were freed March 8.
   Eighteen missing foreigners are believed to be held hostage by
extremist Moslem groups in Lebanon, most of them in south Beirut by
pro-Iranian Shiite factions.
   Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<TEXT>
   A final statement saying the
Communist Party can fix the chaotic economy ended a three three-day
conference Tuesday during which delegates castigated party leaders
and demanded their removal.
   Many delegates took the floor to accuse the leadership of
bungling. Some said the failure to solve severe economic problems
is destroying public trust in the party.
   ``Young people are reluctant to join the Communist Party because
they have no confidence in our organization,'' Metka Tekavcic, a
Slovenian delegate, declared during debate.
   Fewer than 10 percent of Yugoslavia's 23 million people belong
to the party and the number has been declining rapidly. In the
opening speech of the conference Sunday, party chief Bosko Krunic
rejected calls for a multiparty system.
   Yugoslavia has a foreign debt of $21 billion, Europe's highest
annual inflation at 170 percent and an unemployment rate of 15
percent. Economic problems have caused increasing social and labor
unrest.
   The 38-page final conference document was not made public
immediately, but informants said it did not hold out the prospect
of a special party congress to replace the leadership, as many
delegates demanded.
   Tanjug, the official news agency, said the document declared:
``The party is capable of seeking and finding a way out of the
political and economic crisis.''
   According to Tanjug, the document ``directs competent
institutions and organs to complete the reform of the economic
system, based on strong orientation toward market economy, by the
end of the year.''
   On Monday and Tuesday speakers said party leaders had not
implemented reforms recommended in resolutions of the 1986 party
congress and should be replaced if economic problems continue.
   Congresses are held every four years and have broad powers to
change Communist Party rules and personnel, but the conferences
held between them are largely advisory.
   Boro Avramovic of Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six
republics, declared Tuesday: ``The party needs a general overhaul,
and that process has to start with the Presidium (Politburo) of the
Central Committee.''
   Many delegates have criticized Krunic, the party chief, and his
predecessor Milanko Renovica by name for not pursing reforms
recommended by the 1986 congress.
   ``It is unlikely that those people who have led us into this
crisis will be able to bring us out of it,'' said Rade Milicevic of
Serbia.
   Luka Miletic of Zagreb, said Yugoslavs ``increasingly insist''
the entire Communist leadership be replaced since it had not fired
officials who impeded radical reform.
   The government announced new austerity measures Saturday that
party leaders acknowledged would be unpopular and cause more
hardship. Krunic said in his speech Sunday that ``social upheavals
are certain and may be grave.''
   Included in the new plan are substantial price increases, wage
cuts and currency devaluation. One result is likely to be lowering
the standard of living, which already has declined by one-third
since 1980.
   On Monday, many delegates said a special party congress should
be held by the end of the year to replace the party leadership.
   ``Unless we carry through a complete social reform by next
autumn, it will be necessary to call a special party congress,''
said Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian party chief.
   Several delegates said Tuesday, however, that they opposed a
special congress and preferred immediate action by the Central
Committee.
   Vilma Mancek of Slovenia, the most industrially developed
republic, said a congress ``would be a waste of time and money.''
   ``Those who demand a special congress should have the courage to
propose the replacement of the party Presidium, since the Central
Committee has the power to recall members of the Presidium''
without holding a special congress, she said.
   Party officials have said the situation is not critical enough
to warrant a special congress.

<HEAD>Gorbachev `Into Jazz,' Brubeck Says After Performance</HEAD>

   Pianist Dave Brubeck solved another mystery about
the Soviet Union's highest official on Tuesday night, finding out
that when it comes to jazz, Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ``very into
it.''
   ``I'm ready to fly to the moon,'' the 67-year-old American jazz
great declared after his quintet played at a dinner President and
Mrs. Reagan hosted for the Gorbachevs.
   In an interview before the performance at Spaso House, the U.S.
ambassador's residence where the Reagans are staying during the
summit, Brubeck said he was curious to find out what the general
secretary and his wife think of American jazz.
   He got the answer despite the language barrier.
   ``I can't understand Russian, but I can understand body
language,'' said the pianist, who added the general secretary
appeared to be ``very into it'' and was seen tapping his foot, not
an easy thing to do to Brubeck's odd rhythms.
   Brubeck's 36-year-old son Chris, who plays bass guitar and
trombone in the quintet, said he learned from a woman sitting near
the general secretary that Mrs. Reagan turned to Gorbachev at one
point during the music and asked if he like jazz. According to the
younger Brubeck, the 57-year-old Kremlin chief responded: ``I like
good jazz, and this is good jazz.''
   That puts Gorbachev in the ranks of at least one other Soviet
general secretary, Yuri Andropov, who was reputed to be a jazz fan.
At the opposite extreme, jazz struck a dissonant chord for Premier
Nikita Khrushchev, who said in December 1963 that ``When I hear
jazz, it's as if I had gas on the stomach.''
   Brubeck said that after his group's 15-minute performance, the
Gorbachevs came up to him ``all smiles and complimentary.''
   As for the Reagans, who last heard Brubeck in a Feb. 21 White
House performance, ``They couldn't have been kinder.''
   The pianist said the president, a former Hollywood actor, told
him at the February performance ``how much he loved the big bands
and how much they were a part of American history.''
   The group began with Duke Ellington's ``Take the A Train,'' a
well-known jazz classic in the Soviet Union because it is the theme
song for a daily Voice of America shortwave radio jazz program that
has introduced thousands of Soviets to the American art form since
the 1950s. Next was ``Someday my Prince Will Come'' and ``King for
a Day.'' Brubeck wound up with his 1958 standard ``Take Five,'' the
first jazz single ever to go gold.
   Brubeck said the Spaso House audience, which included Sen.
Robert Byrd, a fiddler from West Virginia, ``was more charged''
than any other he had played for in the halls of kings and
presidents in his 50-year career.
   Brubeck's music is well known in the Soviet Union, through Voice
of America broadcasts and imported record albums and tapes. He
toured the Soviet Union in March and April of last year in a
critically acclaimed concert series.

<HEAD>British Doctors Perform Third Transplant Using Fetal Brain Cells</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British doctors have given a third sufferer of
Parkinson's disease brain cells transplanted from an aborted fetus,
a hospital announced Tuesday.
   A 58-year-old woman underwent the surgery May 17 at the Midland
Center of Neurosurgery and Neurology at Smethwick in central
England. She was reported to be back home and showing ``an
initially good response'' to the treatment.
   The hospital announced the development in a statement by
neurologist Edward Hitchcock, whose team carried out Britain's
first known fetal brain-cell transplants in March and April.
   Parkinson's disease is a potentially fatal condition that causes
gradual loss of muscle control. Fetal tissue is thought to
stimulate production of dopamine, a brain chemical lacking in
Parkinson's disease.
   Hitchcock's disclosure last month that he used the experimental
procedure provoked controversy. Critics complained it reduced the
aborted fetus to the status of a human spare part. Others welcomed
it as a possible medical breakthrough.
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has banned
government scientists from carrying out surgery using tissue from
aborted fetuses, pending study of the ethical, legal and medical
questions involved.
   The first documented use of the experimental procedure was
reported in January, when surgeons in Mexico City said they
injected tissue from a miscarried fetus into the brains of two
Parkinson's sufferers last September. Swedish doctors subsequently
reported use of the technique, with disappointing results.
   Hitchcock said last month that his team transplanted fetal brain
cells into a 60-year-old woman and a 41-year-old man, both of whom
were said to have shown ``dramatic improvement.''
   Hitchcock said the latest operation was carried out under
guidelines issued by the British Medical Association last month.

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department signaled Tuesday it
is prepared to assist farmers in the nation's drought-stricken
heartland by easing curbs on the use of land idled under
conservation programs.
   Hay production and cattle grazing on such land will be allowed
in counties found to be suffering from a natural disaster that
harms pasture and forage crops, the department said.
   The statement came amid heightened concern over a drought
hammering broad stretches of the nation's heartland from south
Texas to the Canadian border and as far west as Idaho. Thus far,
however, no disaster counties have been declared.
   The statement from Milton Hertz, administrator of the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, mainly
outlined possibilities already open to the department. It contained
no new programs.
   Under the 1985 Farm Act, farmers must devote a specified portion
of their land to conservation uses if they are to be eligible for
crop programs that produce federal payments. The amount of land
involved varies from one crop to another. For example, it is 27.5
percent for wheat.
   Producers also receive payments for placing endangered land in
the long-term Conservation Reserve Program.
   Under the law, haying and grazing are banned on acreage devoted
to conservation programs. The theory is that farmers already derive
economic benefit from the land in the form of government payments.
But USDA may make exceptions in the case of natural disasters.
   In counties found to be suffering from such a disaster, Hertz
said, ``haying and grazing will be allowed for any consecutive
five-month period between April 1 and October 1.''
   He said determination of counties eligible will be made on a
county-by-county basis.
   Hertz said no requests from state and county offices will be
approved if it appears that doing so will adversely effect haying
operations in the counties involved. No hay or forage harvested may
be sold, he added.
   A producer may charge a ``reasonable harvesting fee'' for
allowing other farmers to hay and graze on his acreage, however,
the department said. But it said he ``may not receive compensation
for the value of the vegetative matter that is harvested or
grazed.''
   Hertz noted that a number of steps already have been taken in
response to rising concern over the drought.
   He said producers enrolled in USDA's wheat and feed grains
programs may take part in the 0-92 disaster program, even though
the March 11 deadline for participation has passed. Under the 0-92
program, farmers produce no crop but still receive 92 percent of
the federal payments they otherwise would get.
   He also pointed to two programs under which the government
provides subsidies to farmers to purchase livestock feed.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets Clash Over Need for Nuclear Weapons Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's top arms control official, Lynn
M. Hansen, said Tuesday the United States will keep testing nuclear
weapons to preserve its nuclear deterrent. A senior Soviet official
called such tests ``immoral.''
   Speaking on the first day of a special four-week U.N. session on
disarmament, Hansen added that the United States will not try to
pass a U.N. resolution calling for arms cuts by Third World nations.
   Hansen, assistant director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said: ``We are not going to come here and
insist that developing countries somehow change their defense
priorities for the acquisition of arms.
   ``Of course, we would like them to spend less money on arms and
put more money into development of their own countries.''
   The Reagan administration wants to increase arms sales to
foreign buyers this year to more than $15 billion, $3.3 billion
more than last year. The Soviet Union is also a major arms supplier.
   Hansen said if the United States refused to sell to a foreign
country seeking arms, ``they would go to another country that would
say `yes.'''
   When asked why America keeps testing nuclear weapons, he
replied: ``The security policy of the United States and its allies
is based upon the concept of deterrence.
   ``And as long as this is the policy which undergirds our
security and that of the Western alliance, we will continue to
test, because the requirement exists.''
   At a separate news conference, Deputy Soviet Foreign Minister
Vladimir F. Petrovsky said, ``We decline this strategy and policy
of nuclear deterrence, not only because of practical unusefulness
but because of the immoral nature of this kind of deterrence. ...
   ``We think the time is right to stop the nuclear tests.''
   Petrovsky said Moscow intends to ``reduce the number and might
of nuclear tests conducted during each year'' and to press for
adoption of a test ban treaty.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar opened the
session by noting it began ``at a most opportune time ... (when)
President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary (Mikhail) Gorbachev
are engaged in a dialogue in Moscow partly in the context of the
reduction of strategic nuclear weapons.''
   He expressed pleasure over the recent ratification of the
U.S.-Soviet intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty to scrap
medium and shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   Perez de Cuellar said it ``clearly shows that, with political
will, agreements to reverse the nuclear-arms race are possible and
compliance with them can be duly verified.''
   He called on the superpowers to take the next step and cut in
half their long-range nuclear arsenals under a strategic arms
reduction treaty, or START.
   Petrovsky told reporters the Soviets will seek to focus the
attention of the U.N. disarmament session on ``the whole range of
nuclear issues, on the nuclear weapons test ban, prevention of the
weapons' expansion into outer space, the soonest possible
conclusion of a convention on the ban on chemical weapons,'' as
well as reducing conventional forces.
   The United States wants the session to stress cuts in
conventional arms.
   Hansen said the United States does not seek to bring Britain and
France into superpower talks to reduce nuclear arsenals.
   Moscow would prefer a treaty that would include British and
French weapons.
   Hansen said the United States also seeks to balance European
arms control with progress on human rights issues.
   The U.N. General Assembly stated in 1979 that the United Nations
should play a central role in disarmament, and that complete
nuclear disarmament was the priority.
   No breakthroughs are expected to emerge at this U.N. session,
during which at least 25 presidents and prime ministers are
scheduled to address the General Assembly.

<HEAD>Jackson Sees No Confrontation at Convention</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Tops with 10 grafs to UPDATE with Bush comment; picks up 7th

   Jesse Jackson offered Michael Dukakis hope for a harmonious
Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, and Republican George
Bush emerged from a seaside meeting with economists to renew his
no-tax-increase pledge.
   With his two front-running presidential rivals taking a break
from campaigning, Jackson stumped in New Jersey and spoke of the
convention in Atlanta this July.
   ``I do not foresee confrontation,'' Jackson said. ``We can
effectively negotiate on mutually respectful terms.''
   That kind of talk was bound to be welcomed by Dukakis, as he and
his supporters looked forward to gaining a mathematical lock on the
nomination in the primary-season finale next Tuesday.
   In a weekend interview with The Associated Press, Dukakis also
had said he looked for a convention without the divisiveness that
some feared.
   ``I think we're going to have a good convention,'' Dukakis said.
``I don't see any deep divisions. ... I don't see anything that
can't be resolved.''
   Bush, his Republican nomination long assured, met with
economists at his home at Kennebunkport on the Maine seacoast.
Afterward, he said he would reject a call for new taxes even if it
is recommended by a blue-ribbon bipartisan commission.
   But Bush, who often says he wants to become ``the education
president,'' said higher local school taxes might be needed.
   ``They may have to,'' Bush said. ``Ninety-three percent of the
money for education comes from sources other than the federal
government. If it's taxes, that's where it has to be. It isn't
going to be at the federal level, absolutely.''
   Bush urged the Federal Reserve not to tighten credit too much,
which he said risks shutting down economic growth.
   Dukakis stuck to his duties as governor of Massachusetts,
spending the day at the Statehouse in Boston. He had an evening
fund-raiser in Baltimore.
   The race for the presidency, at a quiet point in the campaign
season, drew a pleased comment from the Soviet side at the summit
in Moscow.
   Soviet government spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said: ``What we
like about your campaign is that the Soviet-American relations, at
least as I see it, are not an issue. Everybody agrees, both
candidates agree, that you must have normal relations with our
country. We like it.''
   While Jackson said he foresaw no major convention rifts, he
still left open the possibility of a convention floor fight. He
said he expects the issues of his campaign _ including workers'
pay, reduced military spending and the war on drugs _ to become
planks in the party's 1988 platform.
   Jackson also talked about the vice presidential spot on the
ticket, repeating his contention that ``I've earned consideration''
for the No. 2 spot with Dukakis, if Dukakis should win the
nomination.
   The presidential primary season ends Tuesday with the heftiest
delegate prize, California, and also contests in New Jersey,
Montana and New Mexico.
   Dukakis was to resume campaigning after flying to California on
Wednesday.
   He planned stops in Montana and New Jersey, and a brief visit
back where it all began _ in Des Moines, Iowa, where party caucuses
in the February cold were the initial delegate event of the season.
Dukakis planned a breakfast meeting with supporters pointing toward
the fall race against Bush in the farm state, as he crossed the
country.
   Dukakis and Jackson both said over the Memorial Day weekend that
Jackson would play a major part in Dukakis' expected fall campaign
against Bush. But both said the nature of that role hadn't yet been
worked out.
   There are 466 Democratic delegates at stake in next Tuesday's
primaries _ enough to put Dukakis over the 2,081 needed to
nominate. The Massachusetts governor can lay claim to more than
1,700 delegates now, compared with fewer than 1,000 for Jackson.
   Bush was weighing fall campaign strategies with advisers as his
campaign faced a series of polls showing him trailing Dukakis
nationally.
   The vice president acknowledged to reporters his campaign is
facing a money crunch of sorts that might require him to cut back
on summer campaign travel. The problem is he has nearly reached the
federal spending limit for the primary campaign.
   ``It's expensive to take this show on the road,'' Bush said.
   Bush recently met with embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese
III, whose problems some Republicans say are damaging to Bush's
campaign. Meese, in an interview on CNN on Monday night, said he
and Bush had ``talked frankly about the campaign.''
   Meese said if he were to resign now it would harm Bush ``because
people would say there was something wrong.'' He left open the
possibility, however, that he might leave office by the end of
summer.

   Vice President George Bush said
Tuesday he would reject any call for a federal tax increase, even
if one came from a blue-ribbon bipartisan commission now working on
ways to trim the huge federal deficit.
   However, he also said that higher local school taxes might be
needed to carry out his education policies.
   On another economic subject, Bush cautioned the Federal Reserve
Board against tightening credit too much, saying, ``I don't want to
see action taken that's going to shut down economic growth.''
   Bush, the all-but-certain Republican presidential nominee, met
with a group of private economic advisers, then spoke with
reporters in a meeting hall in this oceanside town where he has a
vacation home.
   He said that, while he had full confidence in Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, he wanted to voice ``a word of caution.''
   The Federal Reserve in recent weeks has been slightly tightening
credit in hopes that by nudging up interest rates it can keep
inflation in check.
   Bush said ``there was some expression of concern'' about recent
Fed actions among the economists during the first day of a two-day
session.
   The group included Harvard economist Martin S. Feldstein, a
former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers,
and Stanford economist Michael J. Boskin. They are two of Bush's
most frequently consulted economic advisers.
   Feldstein quit his White House post after his advocacy of tax
increases to reduce the federal deficit ran afoul of Reagan
administration no-new-taxes policy.
   Bush said of Federal Reserve policymakers, ``I think they are
putting a great emphasis on inflation. Whether it's too much, I
don't know. ... It's a tough balancing thing.''
   In response to a reporter's question, he said he would reject
the notion of a tax increase even if it were part of the
recommendations of the bipartisan commission now at work.
   The panel, which includes administration appointees as well as
members appointed by Democratic and Republican congressional
leaders, was formed earlier this year to seek ways to trim the
nation's massive budget deficit.
   ``It seems to me that commission might well come up with a tax
increase,'' Bush said. ``And I'll be saying, wait a minute, I've
taken my case to the American people to hold the line on taxes.''
   The commission, which will also gain two new members appointed
by the president-elect after the November election, is scheduled to
present its findings in 1989.
   ``I wold be interested in their views, but not persuaded'' if a
tax increase is included, Bush said.
   However, the vice president, who has told audiences he wants to
be the ``education president'' and has stressed educational issues
in his campaign, was asked if local school taxing authorites might
have to increase taxes to carry out some of the still-unspecified
programs he envisions.
   ``They may have to,'' Bush said. ``Ninety-three percent of the
money for education comes from sources other than the federal
government. If it's taxes, that's where it has to be. It isn't
going to be at the federal level, absolutely.''
   Bush is spending a week at his family oceanside retreat in a
series of meetings with advisers and Republican consultants.
   The vice president said that there was wide support among the
economists for his propsal for a ``flexible freeze'' on spending to
reduce the budget deficit.
   Bush's plan would hold federal spending, except for Social
Security benefits, to the levels of the 1989 budget plus inflation.
Individual programs would not have to be frozen. However, for every
one that went up, another would have to go down by a corresponding
amount.
   Bush says such a plan could result in a balanced budget within
four years.
   He said there was some discussion of taxes at Tuesday's meeting,
but that he made his position clear from the outset that he opposed
any form of tax increase.
   On other subjects, Bush:
   _Said he was pleased with how things were going in the
superpower talks in Moscow and did not think that Reagan ``offended
the Soviets by talking too much about human rights. I don't believe
that for a minute.''
   _Said that his wait-and-see position on Attorney General Edwin
Meese III hasn't changed. ``We're so close to hearing from that
independent counsel we ought to get the report and let Ed sort all
that out.''
   _Said remarks like a recent comment by Democratic National
Chairman Paul Kirk that he was a ``country club Republican'' didn't
bother him. ``Listen, that's just part of the territory. That was
mild, they didn't even lay a glove on me.''
   Bush had said over the weekend that his campaign was running low
on cash and tht it might have to curtail some travel plans after
the June 7 California primary.
   Aide Bob Teeter said on Tuesday that, of the $29.5 million
raised so far by the campaign, including $7 million in federal
matching funds, less than $1.5 million is left in campaign coffers.
   Bush has raised the maximum allowed by law for pre-convention
spending.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev pronounced the jazz ``good,''
and the rest of Moscow society tapped their feet to the distinctly
American rhythms at President Reagan's lavish dinner Tuesday for
the Soviet leader and his wife.
   The superpower leaders exchanged toasts touching on arms issues,
and Reagan said the two nations should work together ``that we
might forever keep our swords at our sides.''
   Gorbachev recalled the history of Soviet-U.S. relations, from
their World War II alliance to the tensions of the Cold War era,
when ``we all felt the breath of impending catastrophe.''
   ``Even today, we're sometimes chilled by cold winds,'' Gorbachev
said.
   He said the two countries ``may be standing at the threshold of
a uniquely interesting period in the history of our two nations''
and added: ``May the years to come bring a healthier international
environment.''
   Weightier issues aside, the evening was filled with the rhythms
of jazz great Dave Brubeck's quintet. The musician is one of the
Reagans' favorite performers. Jazz, which began in the United
States, is heard by thousands of Soviets though a daily Voice of
America shortwave radio program. And Brubeck has toured the country
in critically acclaimed concert series.
   ``I can't understand Russian, but I can understand body
language,'' said Brubeck, who added that Gorbachev appeared to be
``very into it.''
   Brubeck's 36-year-old son Chris, who plays bass guitar and
trombone in the group, said he learned from a woman sitting near
Gorbachev that Mrs. Reagan turned to Gorbachev at one point during
the music and asked if he liked jazz. According to the younger
Brubeck, the Kremlin chief responded, ``I like good jazz and this
is good jazz.''
   Reagan and the 120 guests seemed to enjoy the the lobster
bisque, supreme of chicken with truffle sauce and California wines.
   During the dinner party, Reagan was seated next to the wrong
man. The official seating chart called for Aleksandr Yakovlev,
secretary of the Communist Party's central committee, to be on
Reagan's left, while Mrs. Gorbachev was on the other side.
   In fact, Reagan's dinner partner was Yegor Yakovlev, editor of
the Moscow News, the English language weekly newspaper and a beacon
of glasnost.
   Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman, said she did not know
how the confusion occurred. Said Mrs. Crispen of the mix-up: ``I
hope somebody was able to tell the president.''
   Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov came to the dinner, as did the
elite of Soviet political, cultural, scientific and sports circles.
The guest listed ranged from Yegor Ligachev, No. 2 in the Communist
Party, to Olympic gold medalist Katya Gordeyeva and Bolshoi
ballerinas Nina Ananiashvili and Natalya Bessmertnova, and Defense
Minister Gen. Dmitri Yazov.
   But Gorbachev's daughter, Irina Virganskiy, and her husband,
Anatoly, snubbed the dinner. ``They accepted, but they did not
arrive,'' Mrs. Crispen said. The couple did not give a reason for
their no-show.
   The Russian guests appeared to appreciate the entertainment, and
many tapped along with their feet as Brubeck's quintet played
``Take the A Train,'' ``Take Five,'' and ``Some Day My Prince will
Come.''
   Sakharov, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, told reporters he
believed the summit was ``very important as a continuation of
mutual understanding and achieving trust.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, in genial mood as he raised
a vodka toast in the direction of the press, made an extra point of
greeting Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner.
   Reagan, his wife, Nancy and the Gorbachevs posed for pictures
briefly before walking into the resplendent towering reception
rooms at Spaso House, a mansion built in czarist days and now the
residence of U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock.
   The first lady wore a gray and white Galanos knee-length dress,
while Mrs. Gorbachev wore a shimmery fitted gold tunic top with a
ruffled collar and a straight black satin skirt.
   The crowd of Soviet and American guests arrived about 30 minutes
before the Reagans and the Gorbachevs, and mingled in an ornate
anteroom while they sipped drinks and listened to soft violin music.
   ``The atmosphere is terrific,'' said Ambassador Selwa Roosevelt,
the American chief of protocol who helped usher guests into Spaso
House.

<HEAD>Storms Roar Across Texas Panhandle; Upper Midwest Cooks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Showers and thunderstorms dumped heavy rains Tuesday in the
Texas Panhandle and across the Plains, while sunny skies produced
record high temperatures in the Midwest's northern reaches.
   The greatest concentration of thunderstorms in the southern and
central Plains region extended from eastern Nebraska south into
central and western Texas, prompting tornado watches and causing
heavy rain.
   More than 3 inches of rain fell at Amarillo, Texas, Tuesday
morning. Numerous accidents were reported and Interstate 40 in
western Amarillo was closed for a few hours because of submerged
underpasses, police said.
   Thunderstorm winds blew part of the roof off a house in Fremont,
Neb. The same thunderstorm produced marble-sized hail at Herman,
Neb.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued in parts of southern
Florida. There were also isolated areas of rain and rain showers in
Montana, light rain in western Washington and Oregon and a few
showers in northern Maine.
   Sunny skies Tuesday afternoon brought high temperatures in the
upper 80s and low 90s from much of the Mississippi Valley and the
Great Lakes region to the East Coast from the mid-Atlantic states
south to central Florida.
   Partly cloudy to cloudy skies across the central and northern
Rockies held afternoon temperatures down into the 50s and 60s.
   A high wind advisory was posted for the Guadalupe Pass area of
southwest Texas, where winds reached 54 mph in gusts early Tuesday
afternoon.
   Record high temperatures for the date included 91 degrees in
Cape Hatteras, N.C.; 85 in Duluth, Minn.; 93 at Flint, Mich.; 93 in
Fort Wayne, Ind.; and 94 in Toledo, Ohio.
   Record low temperatures for the date also occurred with 24
degrees in Alamosa, Colo.; 38 in Albuquerque, N.M.; 37 in Grand
Junction, Colo.; and 49 in Tucson, Ariz.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 39
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 95 degrees at Greenville,
S.C. and Meridian, Miss. The morning low was 21 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Wednesday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms
scattered from the central and eastern Great Plains into the lower
Missouri Valley and also across southern Florida. Rain and rain
showers should be prevalent in the Pacific Northwest, scattered
rain showers in northern Maine, isolated afternoon showers from
northern Michigan to southern New York, and scattered thunderstorms
across parts of the mid-Atlantic region.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 50s and 60s across
northern and central New England, 60s in the northern and central
Rockies and the northern and central Pacific Coast region and 90s
through the middle and lower Mississippi Valley, western Ohio
Valley and much of the Southeast. Highs should rebound into the 90s
or near 100 in the Southwest deserts and interior valleys of
Southern California. The rest of the nation was forecast to have
high temperatures in the 70s and 80s.

<HEAD>Similarities Between Taiwan, Aloha Crash Only Coincidence, Boeing
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing 737 that disintegrated and crashed
over Taiwan in 1981 and another one that lost part of its fuselage
over Hawaii in April were built back-to-back, but Boeing officials
Tuesday attributed any similarities to coincidence.
   The 151st 737-200 model Boeing produced was the Far Eastern Air
Transport jet that broke up at 22,000 feet over central Taiwan Aug.
22, 1981, killing all 110 people on board.
   No. 152 was the Aloha Airlines aircraft on which a 20-foot
section of forward upper fuselage ripped away at 24,000 feet on
April 28. A flight attendant fell to her death and 61 passengers
were injured, but the flight crew landed the plane safely.
   The cause of the Aloha accident is still under investigation.
But the Federal Aviation Administration has ordered U.S. airlines
flying older 737s to re-inspect the aircraft, including mandatory
electronic testing of planes with more than 50,000 landings.
   Boeing believes the Far Eastern crash was caused by maintenance
problems, spokesman Jack Gamble of Boeing Commercial Airplanes said.
   Any connection between that crash and the Aloha accident are ``a
series of coincidences,'' Gamble said.
   ``We do not think that is a fair assessment'' to directly link
the two, he said.
   At the time of the planes' manufacture in 1969, Boeing was
turning out two or three 737s a month, Gamble said. He said he knew
of no other problems involving 737s made about that time.
   Benjamin Cosgrove, Boeing Commercial Airplanes vice president
and general manager for engineering, was quoted by The Wall Street
Journal Tuesday as saying the consecutive aircraft numbers were
coincidence.
   Although both accidents involved the same part of the fuselage,
nothing was inherently wrong with that portion of the aircraft,
Cosgrove said.
   He told the Journal that the Taiwanese 737 repeatedly was used
to ship fish in open containers, and corrosive salt water may have
gotten into the cargo hold. The newspaper said Far Eastern
officials denied that.
   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Michael Benson in
Washington, D.C., said Tuesday the safety board's investigators
also believe leaking salt water from fish shipments caused the
Taiwan jet's corrosion.
   Gamble said Boeing had issued a series of service bulletins on
older 737s. Those included a March 1978 bulletin recommending
additional inspections of fuselage skins for possible corrosion. On
July 1, 1981, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive requiring
U.S. carriers to inspect older 737s.
   Boeing had supplied kits to airlines to allow them to replace
corroded skin on planes, Gamble said.
   A kit was delivered to Far Eastern in April 1980, which means it
was in the company's spare parts inventory considerably before that
crash, but it apparently was never used on the plane, he said.
   Cosgrove was in Washington, D.C., to attend a conference on
problems with aging aircraft and was unavailable for comment
Tuesday, Gamble said. The FAA called the three-day conference after
the Aloha incident to study safety issues involving older aircraft.
   One of the FAA directives issued after the Aloha accident
focuses on early models of 737s in which Boeing used a cold-bonding
process, in which structural parts of the fuselage were laminated
using an adhesive that cured at room temperature.
   T. Craig Martin, director of public relations for Boeing
Commercial Airplanes, said that about 1971, after the first 291
models of 737s were built, the company changed to a hot-bonding
process that used an adhesive that cured with heat. He said the new
method was a technological improvement over the previous process,
which was more prone to corrosion.
   About that time, Boeing also made a series of changes in
manufacturing processes and design, including strengthening parts
of the fuselage and making the skin thicker where sections
overlapped, Martin said.
   The twin-engine 737 is the world's most popular commercial
aircraft, with more than 2,000 on order.
   Martin said he found a number of differences between the two
accidents. The Taiwanese plane, for example, was 12 years old and
had approximately 33,000 landings, while the Aloha jet was 20 years
old and had about 90,000 landings.
   He said that ``as best we know,'' the Far Eastern accident was
caused by corrosion in the plane's cargo hold, while the Aloha
accident involved the top of the plane.
   ``But again, the appropriate thing is to see what the NTSB and
the FAA conclude before drawing all these analogies and
comparisons,'' Martin said.

   The U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of
execution for condemned Georgia death row inmate Son H. Fleming on
Tuesday, a day before he was scheduled to die in the state's
electric chair.
   The high court granted the stay with no immediate comment,
except to note that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron White and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, said court
spokeswoman Kathy Arberg.
   Fleming, 58, was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. Wednesday for the
1976 slaying of Ray City Police Chief Ed Giddens. If the stay had
not been granted, he would have been the 99th person put to death
since the Supreme Court allowed states to restore the death penalty
in 1976. Georgia has killed 12 people.
   Giddens was abducted and killed after he stopped a car matching
the description of one used in a robbery. He had pleaded for his
life and told his captors he planned to retire the next day,
according to trial testimony.
   Henry Willis also received a death sentence for the slaying, but
no execution date has been set. A third defendant, Larry Fleming,
nephew of Son Fleming, was sentenced to life in prison.
   Earlier Tuesday, Fleming's family had asked the state Board of
Pardons and Paroles to block the execution.
   Son Fleming's attorney, Ken Shapiro, said Tuesday's appeal was
virtually the same as one filed two years ago, when Fleming came
within hours of execution. The latest petition has a supplement
containing a statement from Fleming's son, Shapiro said.
   The earlier appeal raised questions about Fleming's role in the
crime and cited three heart attacks Fleming has suffered during 12
years on death row. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed
the execution.
   Parole board Chairman Wayne Snow said after the 40-minute closed
hearing that the board would review the new appeal through the
afternoon. He said the board would consider Fleming's frail health
and his relatives' arguments.
   About 10 members of Flemings's family attended the hearing,
including four of his sisters and his younger brother, Handy
Fleming.
   ``I think he deserves another appeal,'' Handy Fleming said. ``I
really don't think he done it.''
   Shapiro said relatives described Fleming as a compassionate,
devoted family man who was a father figure for his younger brothers
and sisters after their father left home.
   ``There remains a question of Son's culpability,'' Shapiro said.
``Son has always maintained that he was not the triggerman.''

<HEAD>Soldiers, Peasants Clash in Northwest Haiti</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers and peasants clashed in
the hamlet of Danti in northwest Haiti with a rural law officer
reported killed and many peasants wounded, radio stations in the
capital said Tuesday.
   The report coincided with a plea by Foreign Minister Gerard
LaTortue on Tuesday for international aid for this impoverished
Caribbean nation. He told a news conference at Puerto Rico's
Department of State, ``No democratic process can sustain itself if
it is not accompanied by economic development.''
   The United States suspended most of its aid to Haiti following
election violence last November.
   Section chief Leroy Ely was killed in Danti last Thursday,
touching off the clashes which reportedly continued until Monday.
   Section chiefs in Haiti are rural police officers with military
rank, responsible for supervising public works as well as
maintaining law and order. Under the 29-year Duvalier family
dictatorship, section chiefs exercised wide powers.
   Ely traveled to Danti to impose the authority of the capital
city of the section, Le Borgne. Peasants demanded their hamlet be
assigned to neighboring Gros Morne district and in subsequent
rioting, Ely was killed.
   Soldiers came to quell the unrest. Radio Lumiere, Radio
Metropole and Radio Haiti Inter reported that from Thursday to
Monday, Danti residents were beaten and arrested or forced to flee.
Their homes were pillaged and burned.
   Witnesses interviewed by Radio Metropole said many people were
wounded or forced to take flight. Radio Haiti Inter said 25
peasants were arrested.
   According to Radio Metropole, Danti is in a relatively fertile
zone and Le Borgne authorities did not want to lose it.
   Disputes over land have become common and violent in this arid,
mountainous and overpopulated nation that shares the island of
Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.
   Last July, hundreds of peasants clashed with landowners and
among themselves over property in the northwest village of Jean
Rabel. Dozens were killed.
   In asking for foreign help, LaTortue said in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, that ``For us Haitians, economic development means ... food
and water for the great majority of the population, and health
services, education and housing.''
   The United States has been Haiti's biggest foreign aid donor,
contributing $103 million a year to the poorest nation in the
Western Hemisphere, with a population of 5.3 million.
   Most U.S. aid was suspended following cancellation of last
November's national elections because of violence, which the
then-ruling junta under Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy did little to curtail.
   France and Canada maintained their aid commitments to Haiti, but
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have withheld
$40 million in loans.
   LaTortue, who spent 10 years in Puerto Rico as part of his
25-year exile during the Duvalier dictatorships, criticized U.S.
officials for blocking aid to Haiti following controversial
national elections last January.
   He asked Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth, to make available
scholarships for Haitian students and do what it could to promote
Haiti's economic development.
   Dictator Francois Duvalier ruled Haiti since 1957. His son,
Jean-Claude, took over at his death but fled Feb. 7, 1986 during a
popular uprising. A president, Leslie Manigat, was chosen in
January.

<HEAD>Chile Extends State Of Emergency</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with junta member saying emergency will be
lifted before referendum, more exiles to be allowed to return. No
pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The military government on Tuesday
decreed a 90-day extension of the state of emergency. Opposition
leaders say the extension will prevent a fair campaign in the
presidential referendum this year.
   In another development, Interior Ministry officials issued a
list Tuesday of 25 political exiles allowed to return home. It
included several prominent figures in the leftist government of
President Salvador Allende that was overthrown in September 1973.
   More than 4,000 exiles have been authorized to return since the
government began issuing periodic lists early in 1986, but only a
few hundred have done so. Human rights groups say 400 exiles still
are banned. The government claims the number is closer to 300.
   No date has been set for the presidential referendum, in which
Chileans will be allowed only to vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on a
single, military-appointed candidate for the 1989-97 term.
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who is 72 and has been president since
the 1973 military coup, is considered the most likely candidate.
   If voters reject the government's choice, a competitive election
is to occur a year later, with Pinochet remaining in office until
then.
   The state of emergency would have expired Tuesday.
   ``By renewing the state of emergency, the government is casting
doubt on the fairness of its own plebiscite,'' said Patricio
Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian Democratic Party, the
largest opposition group.
   Enrique Silva, president of the centrist Radical Party, said:
``Under the state of emergency, the most basic guarantees for a
clean electoral process cannot exist.''
   Government officials have hinted the election might be held
Sept. 11, which means the emergency would cover at least part of
the campaign.
   Adm. Jose Merino Castro, the navy chief and member of the ruling
military junta, told reporters after a junta meeting the emergency
would be lifted 30 days before the referendum.
   ``If the opposition doesn't like it, it means the state of
emergency is good,'' Merino said.
   Genaro Arriagada, a leading member of a 15-party coalition
organized to promote a ``no'' vote in the referendum called
extending the emergency ``a gross abuse'' by the government.
   Officials claim the emergency is necessary to deal with what the
government calls a growing terrorist threat from radical leftists.
   The Roman Catholic Church and several foreign governments,
including the Reagan administration, have urged Pinochet to lift
the restrictions before the referendum.
   Under the emergency, which was imposed when the military seized
power and has been enforced intermittently since, the government
can restrict freedom of the press and ban public gatherings.
   It allows authorities to censor mail and prevent citizens from
entering or leaving the country or traveling freely. The emergency
is enforced by regional military commanders.
   On December 17, 1987, President Reagan declared his support for
a European Economic Community statement urging Pinochet's
government to lift the restrictions several months before the
election. The EEC statement said that was essential for a fair
campaign.

   An anti-pornography group is planning to
picket videotape retailers, who plan to retaliate with boycott
threats against protesters' employers, as amendments to the state's
obscenity law take effect.
   A group called the Minnesota Cleanup Project plans to protest at
about 50 videotape stores throughout the state Saturday to draw
attention to provisions taking effect Wednesday and to urge local
officials to enforce it, said Robert P. Heinrich, director of the
anti-pornography organization.
   But video store owners are planning a countermove, said David
Ballstadt, president of Adventures in Video, which operates 10
videotape stores in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
   ``In retaliation for this picketing, video store operators are
going to hire private detectives, take down license plate numbers
of people picketing and find out where they are employed,''
Ballstadt said. Letters will be sent to the picketers' employers
telling them their products will be boycotted because of their
employees' activities, he said.
   ``If these people think they can walk around and express their
freedoms, which they have a right to do, they're going to have to
pay a price, just as we have to,'' Ballstadt said.
   The Legislature approved amendments this year to make the
state's obscenity law conform with U.S. Supreme Court rulings.
   ``The changes technically are not that great, but they do
provide some tools for prosecutors to use,'' Minnesota Solicitor
General Norm Coleman said.
   The previous law provided only for civil penalties and left
unclear what role prosecutors should play in enforcing it, Coleman
said.
   The new law provides for criminal penalties, which clearly are
in the purview of county prosecutors, he said. A first offense is
considered a gross misdemeanor and carries a penalty of up to one
year in prison, a $3,000 fine or both. Subsequent offenses are
considered felonies and carry a prison term of up to two years, a
fine of up to $10,000 or both.
   Among its provisions, the law prohibits distribution of obscene
materials and specifically includes videotapes in its definition of
materials that may be deemed obscene.
   ``Anything on film or video is more enticing than a still
picture, and this material is readily available to children of all
ages and people of all ages,'' Heinrich said.
   Heinrich said pickets will target ``major hard-core pornography
outlets throughout the state'' which previously were contacted by
the group and have refused to remove what the group considers
obscene materials from their shelves.
   Besides picketing stores in Minneapolis, St. Paul and some
suburbs, protests are planned at stores in Mankato, St. Cloud and
Rochester, he said.
   Though Ballstadt came up with the idea for the boycott to
counter the pickets, his own stores may no longer offer the
videotapes targeted by the group. A decision has yet to be made, he
said.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Leader Calls For Better Relations With U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE FAUL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam of
Ethiopia called on Tuesday for better relations between his Marxist
government and the United States, reminding Americans, ``Once upon
a time we were good friends.''
   The leader of this East African nation also made an impassioned
defense of Ethiopia's war in its northern provinces, charging that
the rebels are fighting a proxy war to consolidate Arab control of
the Red Sea.
   In reply to a question, Mengistu denied that his government was
using food as a weapon in the north, where the war and a big
government counteroffensive have jeopardized a massive
Western-financed relief effort for 3.2 million Ethiopians facing
starvation in Eritrea and Tigre provinces.
   Instead, Mengistu insisted, rebels were using ``an issue as
sensitive as a food deficit situation and hunger to elicit
international sympathy and support for them to promote their
propaganda activities against us.''
   Mengistu spoke with unusual candor on a wide range of issues,
gesticulating with passion and occasionally smiling and laughing
during a six-hour news conference with foreign reporters, his first
since May 1986.
   For the first time, Mengistu accused Arab states of backing the
northern secessionist insurgency, where rebels have won major
victories this year by capturing several towns.
   Rebels of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front have been
fighting for 27 years in Africa's oldest civil war.
   Mengistu made no reference to the insurgency by rebels of the
Tigrean People's Liberation Front, who have been fighting for 14
years for a bigger say in the governing of their province.
   Mengistu said the U.S. government refused to impose sanctions on
South Africa but was ``imposing an undeclared embargo'' on
Ethiopia. He said Washington was ``at the verge of cutting the last
tethers which we have to the United States'' with congressional
discussions last week on stopping annual imports of 20,000 tons of
Ethiopian coffee.
   ``We are not really pleased with our relations with the United
States and it is our hope that better times will come in the
future. We want to assure them, and I am sincere, quite sincere,
about this, that we will do our best to improve relations,''
Mengistu said. ``We have always pushed for better relations with
the United States and I hope the United States will reciprocate ..
. Once upon a time we were good friends.''
   He said Ethiopians were fond of the American people and admired
their achivements, but relations could improve only if ``the United
States accepts us on a basis of equality and respect.''
   ``We are really not sure what mistakes we have committed against
the (U.S.) government,'' he said, adding perhaps it was Ethiopia's
choice of socialism that was repugnant to ``the defender of
capitalist values.''
   He said Ethiopia's Marxist revolution of September 1974 had
improved lives of the country's 42 million people. Contrary to
Western news reports, he said, and to U.S. government insistence on
categorizing it as communist, his government was not an ogre intent
on filling Ethiopia's prisons with political dissidents and
starving its people.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, were
puzzled by Mengistu's conciliatory attitude. They said Ethiopia at
the last minute caused Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of
state for African affairs, to cancel a January visit when it
announced he would not be meeting Mengistu.
   In February, Crocker said he believed Ethiopia was not serious
about improving relations with the United States.
   Once-warm U.S. relations with Ethiopia deteriorated after the
revolution in which Mengistu and a clique of fellow army officers
overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie.
   The United States continued to arm the new military government
until Somalia invaded Ethiopia's southern Ogaden region in 1977.
   In a dramatic superpower reversal, the Soviets switched sides to
Ethiopia and the United States started backing the Somalis.
   Mengistu said Tuesday that rebels in Ethiopia also had won
support from progressive countries, which the diplomats identified
as Cuba and the Soviet Union, which in the past have helped trained
Eritrean rebels. About 2,500 Cuban troops in Ethiopia have refused
to fight in the north.

   A federal judge Tuesday temporarily enjoined
the Navy from starting tests of a high-powered electrical generator
designed to simulate one of the effects of a nuclear explosion.
   U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn, after hearing arguments
from attorneys representing the Navy and the Foundation on Economic
Trends, issued a temporary restraining order against the tests,
which were set to begin Wednesday.
   The restraining order, which expires at noon Friday, was issued
to give the government time to file a motion striking a paragraph
from a consent decree the foundation contends prohibits the Navy
from beginning the tests.
   Navy officials had planned to begin the test Wednesday with
Empress II barge in international waters about 15 miles off the
Virginia-North Carolina coast.
   The Empress II barge is equipped with two diesel generators and
a huge antenna system, capable of sending ``pulses'' of electrical
power into the atmosphere at power levels up to 7 million volts to
test a phenomenon known as electro-magnetic pulse, or EMP.
   Each pulse lasts only a billionth of a second, and the Navy
maintains the testing will have no affect on human or marine life.
   Electro-magnetic pulse is a powerful wave, or surge, of
electrical energy that is released by a nuclear explosion and which
can travel long distances through the atmosphere or water.
   EMP became a matter of concern to the military in the early
1960's when the Pentagon discovered a nuclear bomb detonated at
high altitudes could generate a pulse so strong it could disable
the electronic components used in computers, communications and
guidance equipment.
   As a result of that discovery, military laboratories have
studied the phenomenon for 25 years in the course of developing
methods for ``hardening'' electronic weapon components to withstand
EMP. The Navy wants to use the Empress II barge to test its success
in hardening electronic equipment on warships.
   The Foundation on Economic Trends, an activist environmental
group that has long tried to curtail biological weapon research,
sued the Defense Department in March 1987 with the goal of stopping
all EMP testing until environmental impact studies had been
performed.
   The lawsuit asserted that EMP experiments could ``affect human
health directly, and through the disruption of electronic circuits
in nuclear power plants, automobiles, computers, airplanes, phone
lines and navigational systems, can cause potential catastrophies
under many possible circumstances.''
   Two weeks ago, the Pentagon agreed to settle that suit by
sharply curtailing or shutting down EMP research facilities across
the country until environmental assessments were performed. In the
case of Empress II, however, the Navy argues it already has
performed the necessary environmental study and thus can proceed
with testing.
   The foundation acknowledges the Navy has finished one
environmental study, but says the recent settlement clearly
envisioned the Navy performing a second study because the first
focused on the effect of EMP testing in the Chesapeake Bay, not the
Atlantic Ocean.
   Congress prohibited EMP testing in the Chesapeake.
   ``The U.S. Navy has violated the settlement,'' asserted Jeremy
Rifkin, the president of the foundation.
   ``Our attorneys questioned them on this before we finalized the
settlement. They can't claim now that the first impact study is
sufficient. And if Congress says it's too dangerous for the bay,
why should the waters off North Carolina be treated differently?''
   Penn's ruling gives the Navy time to file a motion to strike the
paragraph in the consent decree that Rifkin contends prohibits the
test.

   Skeletal remains found by workers at an apartment
complex were identified Tuesday as those of a young runaway listed
as a victim of the Green River serial killer.
   The discovery of Debra Lorraine Estes' remains brings to 40 the
number of victims officially identified as victims of the nation's
worst known serial killer, who has never been captured.
   An additional eight young missing women are listed as probable
victims of the killer, who frequently dumped bodies in clusters in
wooded areas east and south of Seattle. Ms. Estes, 15 when she
vanished, had been on that missing-victim list until her remains
were identified.
   Her bones were discovered Monday by two maintenance workers
digging postholes at the Fox Run Apartments, a newly built,
143-unit complex in Federal Way, located between Seattle and
Tacoma, King County Police Sgt. Steve Davis said.
   Ms. Estes, also known as Betty Lorraine Jones, was reported as a
juvenile runaway by her parents in July 1982. She was last seen
Sept. 20 that year along Pacific Highway South, a strip near
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport frequented by many of the
Green River victims, most of whom had ties to prostitution.
   She was included on the Green River missing list on April 23,
1984.
   Ms. Estes was a Federal Way resident with prior contacts with
King County and Seattle police for prostitution and theft. She had
two distinctive tattoos: the word ``STAR'' on her right shoulder
and the initials ``MB'' on her left hand.
   Her remains were identified by comparison with dental X-rays on
file with the King County medical examiner's office, said Vaughn
Van Zant, medical investigator.
   The cause of death was listed as ``homicidal violence of
undetermined nature,'' the official cause listed for all Green
River victims.
   The killer's victims disappeared between the summer of 1982 and
early 1984. Four victims were found in Oregon, but the killer has
operated primarily in the Puget Sound area.
   The case takes its name from the Green River in south King
County, where the bodies of the first five victims were found in
the summer of 1982.
   The killer is thought to have picked up many of his victims
along the ``Sea-Tac strip,'' an area of motels and fast food
restaurants near the airport. Others disappeared from downtown
Seattle, Aurora Avenue in north Seattle and the city's Rainier
Valley area.
   It is known that the early victims were strangled. Police later
refused to discuss causes of death and attributed them only to
``homicidal violence.''
   The case has been described by police as the nation's worst
unsolved, recognized serial murder puzzle.

   Researchers studying four AIDS-infected men who
appeared to stop producing detectable antibodies to the disease
confirmed the finding Tuesday and said the virus may have stopped
reproducing in those patients.
   Tests to pinpoint AIDS and protect blood supplies are based upon
detection of the antibodies produced naturally by the body to fight
the virus. But Homayoon Farzadegan and Alfred J. Saah, both
professors of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins School of Public
Health, said their findings do not imply increased dangers of blood
supply contamination.
   ``I don't think the risk to the blood supply is any different
today than it was yesterday,'' said Saah during a news conference.
The instances of AIDS victims who stop producing detectable
antibodies to the disease are ``very, very rare,'' and so far have
only been observed in those who show small amounts of the virus
present in their bodies, Saah said.
   Four of 1,000 homosexual men who participated in the
researchers' continuing study showed the loss of antibodies up to
3{ years ago and continue to test negative.
   ``Usually when an infected person loses HIV-1 antibodies, he or
she is in the end stages of AIDS and has a deteriorated immune
system,'' said B. Frank Polk, also a professor of epidemiology at
the school and co-author of a report on the study.
   But the four men ``had no clinical symptoms of illness, such as
swollen lymph glands or abnormal counts of the white blood cells
targeted by the virus,'' he added.
   The researchers reported their findings in June 1987, but could
not determine whether the men were properly diagnosed as having
AIDS initially and whether mistakes had been made in laboratory
tests.
   During follow-up, the researchers used a new method to test for
the virus rather than the antibody and have determined that the men
show evidence of infection, but not antibodies to the AIDS virus.
   The new test, called polymerase chain reaction assay or PCR,
magnifies the presence of the virus' genetic material up to 1
million times.
   Farzadegan speculated that the virus may go into a latent phase
during which it does not reproduce.
   ``We don't know if something in the virus itself is defective
and causing it not to reproduce, or whether it is something within
the host,'' Saah said, adding that researchers have not determined
whether the disease is transmissible during this phase.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that attacks the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to fatal infections and cancers. It is
most often transmitted by sexual contact or by drug abusers sharing
contaminated hypodermic needles and syringes.
   All of the men who participated in the initial report are
participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) that
follows nearly 5,000 homosexual and bisexual men in Baltimore, Los
Angeles, Chicago and Pittsburgh to document the natural progression
of AIDS.
   The latest findings are to be published in the June 1 issue of
Annals of Internal Medicine.

<HEAD>Group Urges Legislation To Outlaw Execution Of The Mentally
Retarded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates for the mentally retarded said
Tuesday that executing the mentally retarded, even those convicted
of first degree murder, is cruel and unusual punishment and urged
lawmakers nationwide to outlaw the practice.
   ``It has been our experience that even the foremost proponents
of the dealth penalty draw the line at young children and people
with mental retardation,'' said James W. Ellis, president-elect of
the American Association on Mental Retardation.
   ``States which have the death penalty, in our view, must pass
laws that make it unlawful to execute someone who is mentally
retarded or to sentence to death someone who is mentally
retarded,'' said Ellis.
   Ellis announced the organization's resolution calling for a ban
on the death penalty for the retarded at a press conference during
the group's annual conference, citing a recently passed Georgia law
that allows for a plea of ``guilty but mentally retarded.''
   Ellis, a law professor at the University of New Mexico at
Albuquerque, said the Georgia law requires a psychological
examination for defendants who wished to enter the plea.
Individuals convicted under the law could be sentenced to life
imprisonment but not executed he said.
   Ellis also noted that most of the members of the Georgia
Assembly are strong supporters of capital punishment.
   The Georgia law, which becomes effective July 1, was prompted by
widespread criticism of the June 24, 1986 execution of mentally
retarded convicted murderer Jerome Bowden.
   ``This position, that the mentally retarded should never be
sentenced to death or executed, leaves the whole array of the
criminal justice system left to deal with in any way that seems
most appropriate,'' said Richard H. Burr of the NAACP Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, Inc. which has handled several capital
punishment cases involving the mentally retarded.
   According to figures compiled by Burr's group, at least 13
percent of the 66 persons executed since capital punishment was
reinstated in 1976 had been diagnosed as mentally retarded.
   Burr also noted that while blacks comprise 40 percent of the
general prison population, 80 percent of all mentally retarded
prisoners are black or Hispanic.
   Both men agreed that initial determination of a defendant's
mental capacity was vital to correcting the problem. They urged
states to follow the example of Texas, which routinely tests its
prison inmates for mental deficiencies.
   ``We need to address the needs of criminal offenders or criminal
defendants from the very begining when confessions are sought, when
waivers of rights are sought, '' Ellis said. He noted the need to
educate members of the criminal justice system about mental
retardation ``to make sure justice is done'' in cases involving the
mentally retarded.
   But Burr cautioned that even with these procedures in place a
number of mentally retarded defendants may be ``deemed competent to
stand trail or educated sufficiently to become compenent to stand
trial ... and (could be) convicted'' to face possible execution.
   Burr noted that there were several cases currently in the court
system in which a retarded individual sits on death row. He cited
the case of Limmie Arthur, 28, of South Carolina who was convicted
in the ax murder of a crippled neighbor in 1985.
   Burr said the courts should be to asked decide whether executing
Arthur, whom he said has the mind of a 10- or 12-year old, would
constitute a violation of the 8th Amendment's prohibition of cruel
and unusual punishment.

   Any student who assaults a teacher will be
expelled, and school security will be beefed up, officials decided
Tuesday after a rash of attacks on teachers.
   ``The notion you have a right to free education is assumed,''
Chancellor Richard Green said. ``Students who violate that right by
assaulting teachers or any other school personnel will forfeit that
right for the rest of the school year.''
   He said students who engage in anything ``beyond a normal fight,
will find themselves without a public education in New York City.''
   Previously, students were suspended or transferred to other
schools.
   The decision came after Green met with Mayor Edward I. Koch, the
city's district attorneys and the police commissioner about
violence in the schools.
   Koch said security measures at the schools will include metal
detectors, electromagnetic locks, listening devices and more police.
   He added later that the city was researching whether it needs
action by the state Legislature to permit expulsions.
   Just hours after the announcement, a Bronx teacher was grazed in
the leg by a stray bullet as she left her school, but the police
said the shooter apparently was not a student.
   The recent incidents include an attack with a baseball bat
against one teacher and the injury of another who was burned when
she picked up a firecracker tossed into her classroom.
   Board of Education spokesman Frank Sabrino said the number of
serious incidents, such as assault, robbery, sex crimes, weapons
possession and drug violations, is running about 10 percent ahead
of the 3,528 reported during the last school year. From July 1 to
April 30, 969 assaults included 198 against teachers, he said.
   Koch said at a City Hall news conference that the expulsion
policy was ``the first and most important action'' that came out of
the meeting of the officials.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said more police will be
assigned to patrol at schools where needed.
   ``We are committed to covering those schools at the beginning of
the school day and at the end of the school day,'' he said.
   He estimated that about 200 of the system's 932 schools will
have police officers assigned, at least until the end of the school
year.
   Koch also said the officials agreed ``to ask the Legislature for
a change in the existing law so as to make it a felony if there is
an attack upon a public official, teachers, others in the
performance of their duties.''
   Bronx District Attorney Paul Gentile said he was for greater
punishment of school thugs.
   Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers,
said she was satisfied at the outcome of the officials' meeting.
   ``We're going to be watching it very carefully to make sure
these commitments are carried out,'' she said.

   Firefighters used backhoes Tuesday to dig
their way toward a warehouse containing pesticides in an attempt to
smother a blaze that forced the evacuation of 800 people.
   The fire at the Roadway Express Freight Terminal started about
12:30 a.m., and firefighters were still dealing with small fires
and hot spots Tuesday night. The terminal itself and several
tractor-trailer rigs parked at its loading dock were destroyed.
   Twenty people complaining of nausea and headaches were treated
at hospitals and released. Two firefighters were treated for
injuries from falls.
   Authorities quit spraying the building with water for about
seven hours starting at 3 a.m. to prevent runoff of possibly
contaminated water. Later, firefighters used backhoes to dig toward
the fire and smother it, Alliance Safety Service Director John
Benincasa said.
   Most of the residents evacuated from within a 10-mile radius of
the terminal were told they could return home by midafternoon
Tuesday, but authorities advised residents who lived within a few
blocks of the burning building to stay away. Alliance, a community
of 24,000, is located about 50 miles southeast of Cleveland.
   Tim Hickin of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency said rat
poisons, ant killer, two other pesticides and an aerosal propellant
were being stored in the building.
   The terminal was used by Clem Lumber Co. and The d-Con Co. as a
warehouse.
   The blaze prompted the closing of the Alliance, Sebring, West
Branch and Western Reserve schools as a precaution against wind
carrying a dark gray cloud of smoke from the freight terminal. The
public beach at Atwood Lake, about 40 miles south of the fire, also
was closed because the wind was carrying the cloud in that
direction Tuesday morning.

<HEAD>Couple Face Trial In Murder, Mutilation Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors say a couple who went
on trial Tuesday for allegedly plotting to dismember their
son-in-law and his family wanted color photos and body parts to
restore the honor they lost when their daughter married against
their will.
   The alleged plot was stopped before anyone was hurt, but Saud
and Ghada Tarawneh, of Toledo, Ohio, were accused of murder
conspiracy and solicitation to commit murder. The Tarawnehs were
arrested in February in Toledo.
   The defense contends the threats of death and dismemberment were
Arabic overstatement in an attempt to frighten their daughter, who
was living in Tamarac.
   Attorneys were scheduled to deliver opening statements
Wednesday. Before a jury was selected Tuesday, defense attorney
Barry Roderman sought to suppress tapes of the couple talking to a
police informer. District Judge Russell Seay denied the motion.
   ``Preparing for trial I read a book called `The Arab Mind' and
the contention there is that the Arab mind does a lot of barking
but very little biting,'' Roderman said outside the courtroom. ``I
don't mean to say that to start an international feud, but I think,
again, if you listen to the tapes when they're played you're going
to get a different perspective on the case.''
   Prosecutors also agree there is a cultural element in the case,
the pride of the Bedouin tribe the Tarawnehs belonged to _ but they
consider the plot deadly serious.
   ``Keeping body parts as souvenirs _ I don't think is normal,''
said Assistant State Attorney William Dimitrouleas.
   The couple left Jordan 18 years ago and moved to Toledo. When
their daughter married her Syrian cousin in 1986 over their
objections and moved to Tamarac, tradition required the insult be
avenged.
   By tradition the head of a family who loses his honor is no
longer a man, and his family shares that disgrace.
   Tarawneh, 46, a gynecologist who became a U.S. citizen in 1980,
and his wife Ghada, 44, a nurse, already had arranged a marriage
for their 17-year-old daughter Raniah and refused to allow her to
marry Mouataz Abdulsalam, now 28.
   When Raniah left Jordan with her new husband, the family wanted
to send her back and sell her into a prostitution ring, according
to Mike Breece, an investigator with the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement.
   The parents then allegedly tried to set up the killings of their
daughter's new husband, his younger sister and his mother.
   The plans included instructions for the killer to hang all three
people, take photographs of the bodies, cut the mother's tongue out
and sexually mutilate the husband and his sister, Breece said.
   A private investigator the parents allegedly tried to hire told
authorities about the plot and agreed to cooperate with
investigators, Breece said.

<HEAD>Two Former Latin American Presidents Offer To Mediate in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidents Daniel Oduber of
Costa Rica and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela said they offered
to mediate a solution to the crisis in Panama at a meeting Tuesday
with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   They told reporters they met Noriega, who as head of the Defense
Forces is the effective leader of Panama, for two hours at Tocumen,
a Panamanian air force base near the capital.
   Acting chief executive Manuel Palma Solis also attended.
   Andres Perez told reporters, ``We came to offer our good offices
to try to find a solution to the problem. We are doing this as
Latin Americans because we are worried.''
   Both former presidents are involved in the effort launched this
week by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica to solve the crisis
over Noriega, who is under indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking and money laundering charges and under pressure from
the Reagan administration to quit.
   Noreiga has refused to step down. Negotiations by a State
Department envoy and Noriega representatives to have him resign if
the indictments are dropped have failed to budge the general.
   U.S. economic sanctions, including the freezing of Panamanian
funds in the United States, have also failed to move him.
   Andres Perez and Oduber said their mission could be divided into
two parts _ to achieve a dialogue between the government and the
opposition, and to resolve the confrontation between the United
States and the government controlled by Noriega.
   ``That was the object of our conversation here,'' Andres Perez
added.
   The meeting took place behind closed doors, in a lounge at the
air base a few minutes after Perez and Oduber arrived.
   Details of their mission have not been made public.
   The man regarded as Noriega's figurehead president, Eric Arturo
Delvalle, fired the general shortly after grand juries in Florida
returned the drug-related indictments in February.
   But Noriega had his hand-picked legislature fire Delvalle from
his president's job, instead, and appoint Palma Solis, the
education minister, in Delvalle's place with the title of acting
chief executive.
   Since then, Delvalle has been in hiding somewhere in Panama.
   The United States still recognizes him as Panama's legitimate
president.

<HEAD>Kennedy Family's Friends Annoyed At Plans For Dallas Exhibit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUINCY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends of the Kennedy family are upset
with plans to make a museum out of a part of the building used in
President John F. Kennedy's assassination.
   ``Being polite, I'd describe it as either morbid or disgusting
or both,'' former Kennedy aide Charles Daly said.
   The plan entails turning the floor of the former Texas School
Book Depository building from which Lee Harvey Oswald shot the
president into a museum on the assassination.
   ``To focus on that instead of a person's life just seems to me
disgusting,'' said Daly, director of the Kennedy library in Boston.
   Another family friend who asked not to be identified told The
Patriot Ledger of Quincy that Kennedy family members also were
upset. ``They really are dismayed with this. It's such a poor idea
that I just don't believe they want to discuss it.''
   Dallas officials say thousands of tourists come to the building
every year but cannot gain access to the sixth-floor because it is
closed. The rest of the building houses government offices.
   Lindalyn Adams, president of the Dallas County Historical
Society, said the museum will contain a multimedia presentation
including news clippings about the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination and
the world's reaction to it.
   ``It's a place where history was made, a sad part of history,''
Ms. Adams said.
   Conover Hunt, an organizer of the museum project, described the
planned exhibit as ``low key'' and said it will not contain
``violent or gruesome artifacts.''

   Ricky May, a leading Australian jazz

given a standing ovation at the opening night of his new show at
the Regent Hotel in Sydney.
   The New Zealand-born May, 44, walked off stage and was heading
to his room to change when he was stricken with what appeared to be
a heart attack outside the elevator, a hotel spokesman said.
   May was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital.
   May, who weighed about 280 pounds, was a tireless charity worker
and was presented with an award this year honoring his work for the

<HEAD>Businessman Arrested In Alleged Scheme to Sell Submachine Design

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of an air cargo company faces federal
charges that he participated in a $1 million scheme to sell a
submachine gun design to Iran, officials said Tuesday.
   Jerry Hyatt, president of Air Cargo Marketing in Wenham, Mass.,
was released on bail Tuesday, four days after he was arrested. In a
hearing Friday before U.S. Magistrate Patti Saris in Boston, he was
charged with conspiracy to export weapons to the Iranian government.
   Saris set bail at $50,000 cash, which Hyatt paid Tuesday, a
court official said. Hyatt was expected to go to New York City
Wednesday or Thursday to appear before a federal magistrate there.
   In a call to Hyatt's home number Tuesday, Carla Parnell, who
described herself as a friend of Hyatt's family, said she was only
answering the telephone for Air Cargo Marketing. No company
officials were available for comment, she said.
   Hyatt, 47, allegedly was present when a New England weapons
designer and a Washington arms merchant met at least twice in the
past two years to discuss the sale of the submachine gun, called a
Nomad, for production in Iran, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Herve
Gouraige in New York.
   A U.S. Customs agent posing as an arms dealer with Iranian
connections tracked the deal, Gouraige said.
   According to the criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Customs
Service, on May 28, 1987, the undercover agent received from one of
the defendants a Nomad submachine gun, a Nomad automatic pistol, a
Viper semiautomatic carbine and the technology to make them.
   These weapons were to be taken to Italy for eventual shipment to
Iran, the court document said. Hyatt also allegedly acknowledged he
would receive a commission from the undercover agent when the deal
was completed.
   The names and whereabouts of the weapons designer and merchant
were not made public.
   Customs agent Elaine Baner said Hyatt's arrest was part of an
investigation that began several years ago and is still going on.

   Actor Paul Hogan, star of the
just-released movie sequel ``Crocodile Dundee II,'' has separated
from his wife, his daughter Loren said Wednesday.
   ``Yes, there has been a split. That's all there is to it,'' she
said without elaborating.
   Hogan and wife, Nolene, were first married in 1958 and have five
children. The union foundered in 1982, but the couple reunited in
marriage.
   The 48-year-old star was in the United States for the American
release of his sequel when newspapers in Australia reported the
breakup.
   The first ``Crocodile Dundee'' movie was an international box
office smash and ``Crocodile Dundee II'' broke Australian box
office records during its first three days of release, grossing
$13.5 million (U.S.).

   A greeting card with some 10,000 signatures
is on the way to the Middle East and, the senders hope, hostage
Terry Anderson.
   Residents of Anderson's hometown of Batavia, N.Y., signed the
card and presented it to his sister, Peggy Say, on Tuesday.
   ``It will warm Terry's heart,'' Mrs. Say said.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held U.S. hostage in Lebanon.
   The beginning of Batavia radio station WBTA's effort to send
what it described as the world's larest greeting card coincided
with the third anniversary of Anderson's abduction March 16. The
station collected signatures at the community's mall and in its
schools and churches. The final names were put on the card last
week.
   It will be sent to Beirut, the Lebanese capital, where Anderson
is thought to be held, organizers said.

<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers arrested dozens of protesting
students and teachers on a university campus in Quito on Tuesday
after the government declared a state of emergency to counter a
planned nationwide strike.
   Interior Minister Heinz Moeller said troops arrested 27 people
at the National Polytechnical School, entering the school after
students threw rocks at a car carrying military personnel.
   At an evening news conference, he called the planned general
strike ``illegal and anti-constitutional.''
   Ruben Orellana, the university rector, said both students and
professors were detained. The independent station Radio Quito said
60 people were seized.
   Witnesses said troops also fired machine guns, but no casualties
were reported. Moeller did not mention any gunfire nor did he
identify those arrested.
   President Leon Febres Cordero signed a state of emergency order
that went into effect at 9 p.m. Tuesday, just hours before the
one-day, anti-government general strike was to start Wednesday.
   The strike, the seventh against the Febres Cordero government,
was called by the communist-led United Front of Laborers, Ecuador's
most powerful union.
   Fausto Durand, president of the 200,000-member union, said the
main demand is an increase in workers' wages from $31 a month to
$76.
   Labor unrest in this small Andean nation has intensified over
the past two years, because of economic woes arising largely from
depressed world prices for oil, Ecuador's main export.
   Elementary and secondary school teachers struck 11 days ago,
seeking income tax cuts and protesting public transportation fare
increases of 50 percent.
   College students have since held sporadic street demonstrations
in Quito in support of the teachers.
   The state of emergency permits the government to use troops to
maintain order, censor the news media and ban public meetings.
   During the last general strike Oct. 28, demonstrators firebombed
a Quito bank, disrupted work and transportation in several cities.
Dozens of strikers were arrested and there were several injuries in
clashes.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Oleg Cassini $16 Million in Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Designer Oleg Cassini won a $16 million award
Tuesday from a federal court jury that found in his favor against
fragrance maker Jovan Inc. in a breach of contract suit.
   The six-member civil jury took just three hours to find in
Cassini's favor against Jovan and it's former president, Richard E.
Meyer.
   Cassini, 75, who designed clothes for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
when she was first lady, claimed Jovan and Meyer violated a 1978
contract to make and market a fragrance line for men and women
under Cassini's name.
   In testimony during the four-week trial before U.S. District
Judge John F. Keenan, Cassini complained that Jovan was selling the
perfume in discount stores like K mart instead of limiting sales to
fashionable department stores like Bloomingdale's.
   Cassini sued in 1984 for $24 million, accusing Jovan _ now known
as Beecham Cosmetics Inc. _ of breach of contract. He also sued
Jovan and Meyer for fraud.
   The jury awarded Cassini $10 million on the breach of contract
claim against the company, $1 million on the fraud claim against
the company and $5 million on the fraud claim against Meyer.
   After the verdict, defense lawyers moved for a new trial but
Keenan did not immediately rule on the request.

   Boris N. Yeltsin, the ousted capital Communist
Party chief, took the unprecedented step of using Western news
media to insist that the party's No. 2 man, Yegor K. Ligachev,
resign because he is blocking reform.
   Never before has a fallen Soviet leader so sharply and publicly
criticized a high-level party official still in power.
   In interviews Monday with CBS News and the British Broadcasting

efforts to remake Soviet society are going according to plan.
   ``This is a dangerous thing to say,'' said Yeltsin, an outspoken
advocate of reform.
   He told the BBC that Ligachev should resign because he is the
main impediment to ``perestroika,'' the Russian word for
Gorbachev's restructuring.

   Most Americans favor major changes in the
selection of presidential nominees, with six in 10 saying they
would eliminate political conventions and let voters choose the
candidates directly, a Media General-Associated Press poll has
found.
   As the primary season winds down, with the final contests June
7, the survey found broad dissatisfaction with the selection
system. A majority of respondents said they did not follow the
campaigns regularly and only half believed the races provide a good
discussion of the issues.
   Sizable minorities said the best candidates generally lose their
bid for the nomination, particularly on the Democratic side.
   Fifty-two percent of the 1,204 adults in the national poll
favored major changes in the way the parties pick nominees, while
only 38 percent said the system works well enough now. Ten percent
didn't know.

   Israel's three top leaders, buoyed by a drop in
violence in the occupied lands and the first failed general strike
of the nearly six-month-old Palestinian uprising, say the unrest is
on the wane.
   Thousands of Palestinians ignored orders by underground leaders
to stay away from their jobs in Israel on Monday to attract
attention during the Moscow summit to their struggle against the
Israeli occupation of their land.
   But Jewish settlers told Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that
their security in the occupied territories is deteriorating despite
the apparent calm.
   They said the disturbances will enter a more violent phase
unless Israel cracks down more firmly on Palestinian protesters.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has cast
himself in the summit's lead role, projecting a vital image as
statesman, negotiator and presidential tour guide and giving
impromptu interviews to reporters.
   On the eve of the first press conference by a Communist Party
chief on home turf, Gorbachev on Tuesday sped through an ambitious
summit itinerary, prolonging a one-on-one session with President
Reagan, sporting him around Red Square's landmarks and overseeing
the signing of arms control protocols _ all before noon.
   He bantered with reporters before his talks with the president
in the morning, insisting that it was ``time to bang our fists on
the table'' to get negotiators moving on a strategic arms reduction
treaty.

   The chimes from Spassky Tower heralded President

ancient cobblestones of Red Square _ stones so famous that even a
reformer wouldn't think of repaving them.
   They first turned in the direction of St. Basil's Cathedral with
its multicolored facade and onion domes. Reagan gazed upward at the
15th century cathedral as Gorbachev pointed and apparently
explained some of its features.
   The square that draws millions of Russian and foreign tourists
annually had been swept clear of people, save for the single-file
line of those waiting silently to enter the Lenin mausoleum, and
eight groups of selected Soviets standing by to meet Reagan.

<HEAD>Coup-Prone Bolivia Enjoys Rare Period of Stability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER McFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a long history of revolving-door
regimes, it is a rarity for Bolivians to see the governments they
elected in the 1980s hold on for as long as they have. They are
beginning to take notice.
   No longer do they repeat the old saying: ``Be careful here in
Bolivia _ you go to sleep with one government and wake up with
another.''
   Bolivians today are seeing the longest uninterrupted period of
elected rule in more than two decades, and officials talk of a new
Bolivia.
   ``In Bolivia there is a new nation, in which a new generation
has consolidated democracy with great effort,'' Finance Minister
Juan Cariaga said in an interview.
   The country, he added, has ``achieved an important level of
maturity.''
   Since its founding in 1825, the presidency has changed hands 76
times _ an average of once every 26 months.
   From 1977 to 1982, Bolivia had 10 governments, eight of which
were led by right-wing military leaders who either seized power in
a coup or inherited it from another military ruler.
   In 1982, severe economic problems forced the armed forces to
allow elections and hand over power to Hernan Siles Zuazo, the
civilian who won the presidency.
   He was succeeded after elections in 1985 by Victor Paz
Estenssoro, 80. Paz Estenssoro's term ends in May 1989, and already
Bolivians are preparing for that election.
   The last time the country enjoyed such a lengthy period of
elected rule was 1952-64, when Paz Estenssoro also was president.
   ``The profound economic crisis led the people to remove the
military, who bear major responsibility for the country's political
and economic instability,'' said Simon Reyes, executive secretary
of the Bolivian Workers Central and first secretary of the
Communist Party.
   Siles Zuazo also was elected in 1980 but prevented from taking
office by a military coup. When he finally assumed the presidency
two years later, his left-of-center government inherited a bankrupt
economy and widespread social unrest.
   He quickly established authority over the armed forces,
discharging officers who participated in de-facto governments and
prosecuting some who were involved in cocaine trafficking.
   Labor unions, suppressed during military rule, rose up with
appeals for wage increases and improved benefits. When their
demands weren't promptly met, they staged widespread strikes,
roadblocks and protest marches.
   But despite that unrest, the citizenry rejected the notion of
another coup.
   In the middle of his term, Siles Zuazo was kidnapped by a group
of civilians backed by police and military officers. But the
takeover bid was firmly rejected by labor and political groups and
ended in failure the same day it began.
   With the economy still souring, the governing leftist coalition
agreed to move up elections under pressure from Congress and trade
unions in 1985. Reyes, whose Communist Party participated in the
coalition, said the coalition had feared military intervention.
   Paz Estenssoro, in replacing Siles Zuazo, faced widespread labor
unrest and a world-record inflation rate of 24,000 percent a year.
But he brought with him a reputation as one of South America's most
able elder statesmen and the experience of three previous terms as
president.
   He enacted a series of belt-tightening measures, including a
currency devaluation of 95 percent, a tenfold increase in gasoline
prices and the elimination of consumer price supports.
   The measures set off a general strike by the unions, but he
declared a state of siege and called out the troops, who this time
backed his elected government.
   Inflation fell to about 10 percent a year, and signs of economic
stability have quelled social unrest somewhat.
   When asked, most Bolivians say it is a strong, more deliberate
citizenry and not a weakened military that is responsible for the
country's political renaissance.
   ``There has been a learning process, about living in a
democracy,'' said Herbert Muller, an economist and former Central
Bank president under Siles Zuazo. ``With the return to democracy
there was a realization of the serious of the problems facing the
country, and of the need to find political solutions through
dialogue.''

<HEAD>New Oil and Railway Hold Promise of More Prosperity for Gabon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ROBERT WELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OWENDO, Gabon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New oil finds and a $3 billion-railway
built against the advice of Western donors hold out the promise for
even greater prosperity for this nation of just 1.2 million people,
among Africa's wealthiest.
   The railway, which has become the centerpiece of President Omar
Bongo's 20 years in office, runs 396 miles from this Atlantic port
near Libreville through the once-impenetrable Forest of Bees to a
mining center near Franceville. There it will soon begin regularly
hauling out more manganese, uranium and timber to increase Gabon's
export revenues.
   Full operation of the railroad awaits the expansion of port
facilities in Owendo.
   Adding to the prospect of increased exports are the new oil
discoveries.
   The outlook now is that Gabon, whose future not long ago had
been pictured as gloomy, will be adding to the prosperity that has
raised its annual per capita income to $3,000 _ in contrast to $790
in nearby Nigeria, $500 in neighboring Congo, $802 in Cameroon and
$310 in the Central African Republic.
   Twice in this decade, Gabon's oil reserves were reported to be
running out. But both times fresh discoveries were made.
   The second major find, the on-shore Rabi-Kounga field, ``is a
giant field ... the biggest in West Africa,'' said David Norman,
director of Tenneco's Gabon operations.
   Gabon has oil reserves estimated at 1 billion barrels, but
Norman predicted they will double.
   Production now is 176,000 to 180,000 barrels a day from offshore
fields, Norman said. Rabi-Kounga production won't begin before the
middle of 1989, when it is initially expected to provide 80,000
barrels daily.
   The fall in the price of oil early this decade had left Gabon
unable to pay its bills. But Western creditors have rescheduled
much of its $2 billion-debt until Rabi-Kounga money starts flowing.
   At the same time, Bongo slashed government spending by 50
percent and cut civil servant salaries. Private employees were
required to lend the government 3 percent of their salaries over an
18-month period.
   ``You know how the human situation is,'' said Jean Ping, Bongo's
chief of staff. ``Because we had the reputation of being the
richest country in Africa, our economic problems received much
attention. But we are still in a very, very good situation when you
compare us with others.''
   The country's minimum wage of $200 a month has attracted more
than 180,000 people from other African countries to work in Gabon,
which is about the size of Colorado.
   The United States looks favorably upon Gabon.
   ``Despite current difficulties, Gabon's oil resources, relative
prosperity, economic and political orientation, and good ties with
the United States make it an attractive partner for American
businesses,'' says the latest U.S. Embassy economic report on Gabon.
   The new railroad is seen as a boon for exports.
   Before the railway, the only transport between Libreville, the
capital, and the mining region was by air. Traveling by car or
truck could take 40 days because roads often are washed out by
heavy rains.
   The World Bank refused to finance the railway project, which
began in 1973, saying it was too difficult, too expensive and would
never pay for itself.
   Bongo pushed ahead with private financing, and it opened Dec.
31, 1986.
   Ping said some of the projects undertaken by the government can
be questioned, but not the railway.
   ``People sometimes don't understand the importance of the
railway,'' he added. ``Before independence (from France in 1960)
the country was like three separate bodies. How can you build a
nation if you don't have the feeling of belonging to a community.
Countries start with railways.''
   Bongo created a one-party state 20 years ago but Ping said the
decision was the right one.
   ``We obliged the president to create a one-party government
because we are building a nation. Our objective was national
unity,'' he said.
   Bongo was 31 years old and the vice president when he moved up
to the presidency Nov. 28, 1967, on the death of President Leon
M'Ba.
   Three months later, Bongo created the Gabon Democratic Party as
the nation's sole political party, on grounds that the previous
multiparty system had resulted in violent political campaigns and
one coup attempt that failed only after French intervention.
   The U.S. Embassy's Human Rights report on Gabon says that
although no criticism of the president is allowed and advocacy of a
multiparty state is banned, the president's power is limited by
``the diffusion of power through 45 Cabinet level officials. ...
This group of 45 includes representatives of all the country's
major ethnic groups, geographic, and political groups. Through this
mechanism, Gabon's varied interest groups are heard, given access
to political patronage, and consulted on national resource
distribution.''
   On May 3, the government television resumed a program in which
Cabinet ministers appear weekly and take questions from journalists
and telephone callers.
   During a previous run of the show, Bongo himself was known to
call in and ask questions.

burst, sending 80 billion gallons of water churning down the Upper
Snake River Valley.
   Ten years ago: The U.S. Supreme Court let stand a lower court
decision striking down a New Hampshire statutory rape law because
it named only young girls as potential victims, and therefore
discriminated against men.
   Five years ago: ``Cats'' won the best musical award and ``Torch
Song Trilogy'' was recognized as best play at the 37th annual
Antoinette Perry (Tony) Awards in New York.
   One year ago: President Reagan, in Venice for an upcoming
economic summit, called for an end to government agriculture
subsidies by the year 2000 in a televised address carried in Europe
by the United States Information Agency.
   Today's Birthdays: Actor Robert Lansing is 59. Broadcast
journalist Bill Moyers is 54.
   Thought for Today: ``Who knows whether any of us will still be

acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against
injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope ... and crossing
each other from a million different centers of energy and daring
those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest
walls of oppression and resistance.'' _ Sen. Robert F. Kennedy
(1925-1968).

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After just one season on NBC's ``L.A. Law,''
Blair Underwood has carved out a tidy niche for himself in the hit
show's ensemble cast as brash, young attorney Jonathan Rollins.
   ``I couldn't ask for anything better, and that's an
understatement,'' said Underwood. ``To be out of college three
years and to have a job and working as an actor is part of it. And
then working with scripts like the quality of `L.A. Law.' I mean
working with the cast.
   ``These actors, all of them, will give you something to play off
of, and I think that shows on camera. And then the icing on the
cake is that the public and critics alike enjoy the show.''
   Underwood, 23, was in town recently to pick up a belated fine
arts degree from Carnegie Mellon University.
   He joined the cast of the high-rated, Emmy-winning series last
season as a sophisticate fresh out of Harvard Law whose
mega-ambition occasionally pushes him across the lines of decorum
and even ethics.
   ``He's been real well received,'' said Rick Wallace, the show's
co-executive producer. ``He seemed to fit in. There didn't seem to
be any difficulty making him a part of the ensemble.''
   Underwood, looking very un-lawyerlike in a gold chain, striped
shirt and pleated trousers, said that's one of the main differences
between himself and the part he plays.
   ``The difference between someone like Jonathan Rollins and
myself is Jonathan has a type of arrogance and extreme confidence
in himself, and that's it. Period. I think it's a difference
between that and having faith and confidence that you can
accomplish what you believe in,'' he said.
   His fast track to stardom is testimony to that kind of deep
belief.
   Inspired by his older brother's interest in acting, Underwood
began performing at dinner theaters while in junior high school. He
entered Carnegie Mellon's prestigious drama department in the fall
of 1982 as a musical theater major, but dropped out midway through
his junior year.
   ``At the time, money was kind of tight. Being independent like I
am, I figured I might as well go out and try to make some money,
just take the chance,'' he said.
   Armed with publicity photos, Underwood went to New York in
January 1985. His first Monday there, he called his former dance
instructor in New Jersey, who set up a meeting that day with an
agent.
   The agent told Underwood she was looking for someone to play
Denise's boyfriend on NBC's ``The Cosby Show.'' Underwood
auditioned and two days later got the part.
   ``Wednesday was my first full day living in New York and we're
taping `The Cosby Show' on Thursday,'' he said. ``Friday was the
big shock. Here I was, I had just done `The Cosby Show.' Coming
from that high, I said what do I do now? And that's whan I started
pounding the pavement, knocking on doors.''
   Underwood quickly landed roles in the rap film ``Krush Groove''
with Sheila E. and on the ABC soap opera ``One Life to Live.'' In
1986, he was cast as a streetwise parolee in the CBS series
``Downtown.''
   The show was canceled after 13 episodes and for the first time
in his short career, Underwood was unemployed.
   Underwood did a few guest shows, then auditioned last summer for
``L.A. Law.'' The show's producers, including executive producer
Stephen Bochco, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, decided to add a black
attorney to the cast at viewers' request.
   ``I don't feel as if he is window dressing because ... they are
creating a full, fleshed-out character (who) happens to be black,''
Underwood said. ``As opposed to writing a black character who's
going to say, `Yo, Yo, Yo, we're gonna go to court now,' you know,
stereotype.''
   With the role have come attention and fame, including being
named by a popular magazine as one of America's sexiest bachelors.
   His family strives through constant contact to keep him humble,
however, said Underwood. Even though he lives in Los Angeles and
his parents are in Petersburg, Va., they're on the phone almost
daily.
   His father, Frank Sr., 56, a retired Army colonel, serves as his
manager. His brother, Frank Jr., 26, an
``artist-slash-writer-slash-actor,'' has written an
adventure-action story Underwood hopes to produce.
   ``Certainly, we see him as being a successful actor who has
gained certain heightened visibility,'' his father said. ``But we
also see him and accept him and deal with him as a family member.''
   ``In every sense,'' his son agreed, bursting into laughter.

<HEAD>Strong Tony Candidates Reflect A Better Broadway Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Will the best musical be a big British
blockbuster based on a variation of ``Beauty and the Beast,'' or a
dark fairy tale where happily ever after never comes?
   Will the best play be a savage comedy about two movie moguls in
the making, or a haunting tale about the children of slaves coming
to terms with the past or a bizarre love story involving a French
diplomat and a Chinese opera singer of indeterminate sex?
   The competition for the 1988 Tony Awards reflects the fact that
artistically this was Broadway's best season in several years. And
more importantly for the New York theater industry, all the shows
nominated for best play and best musical are still running.
   The awards show, to be televised Sunday, June 5 at 9 pm. EDT on
CBS, should be a giant advertisement for Broadway.
   There are a number of strong candidates in almost every
category, particularly musical, with ``The Phantom of the Opera,''
``Into the Woods'' and a revival of Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes''
each getting 10 nominations.
   The battle between ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' the English
extravaganza by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and ``Into the Woods,'' an
American challenger written by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine,
holds the most interest.
   The best play competition is also spirited. The nominees are
``M. Butterfly'' by David Henry Hwang, ``Speed-the-Plow'' by David
Mamet, ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' by August Wilson and ``A Walk
in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing.
   More than any other theater award, the Tony has always helped a
show where it counts _ at the box office. ``Joe Turner'' and ``A
Walk in the Woods'' are doing marginal business and will need the
prize to survive the summer. Only ``Speed-the-Plow'' has done
exceptional business and much of that has been because of one of
its co-stars, pop singer Madonna.
   ``Into the Woods'' already has picked up best musical awards
from the New York Drama Critics Circle and the Drama Desk, two
other theater organizations. But don't count ``Phantom'' out. It is
the biggest success of the season, at least in financial terms, and
Tony voters usually go for the money. The other shows up for best
musical are ``Sarafina!,'' a South African musical, and ``Romance
Romance,'' a small evening of two one-act musicals.
   If any award would appear to be a shoo-in, the prize for best
actor in a musical would seem to be locked up by Michael Crawford
who plays the title role in ``The Phantom of the Opera.'' Even
critics who panned the musical had high praise for Crawford's
portrayal of the deformed composer who lurks in the shadows of the
Paris Opera House. His competitors include Scott Bakula, ``Romance
Romance''; David Carroll of ``Chess''; and Howard McGillin,
``Anything Goes.''
   Patti LuPone, McGillin's co-star in ``Anything Goes,'' is the
favorite for the best actress in a musical award. Her biggest
competition is Joanna Gleason who plays the baker's wife in ``Into
the Woods.'' The other nominees are Alison Fraser of ``Romance
Romance'' and Judy Kuhn of ``Chess.''
   The best actor category is the most competitive in several
seasons. The category was so crowded that several promising
candidates didn't even get nominated including John Malkovich who
gave a bravura performance in Lanford Wilson's ``Burn This.''
   The choices are Ron Silver, one of those would-be film producers
in ``Speed-the-Plow''; John Lithgow, the bewildered diplomat in
``M. Butterfly''; Derek Jacobi, a tortured mathematical genius in
``Breaking the Code''; and Robert Prosky, a Soviet arms negotiator
in ``A Walk in the Woods.''
   There weren't many good roles for women on Broadway this season.
Joan Allen should win the best actress award for her portrait of a
ballet dancer in ``BurnThis.'' Others nominated are Glenda Jackson,
``Macbeth''; Blythe Danner, ``A Streetcar Named Desire''; and
Frances McDormand, ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
   ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' dominates the featured actress
category. Three of its performers _ Kimberleigh Aarn, L. Scott
Caldwell and Kimberly Scott _ were nominated in that category.
Their competition is Kate Nelligan, who appeared in the short-lived
British satire, ``Serious Money.'' The winner is a toss-up.
   B.D. Wong as the exotic opera singer in ``M. Butterfly'' is the
favorite to take the featured actor award. He goes against Michael
Gough, ``Breaking the code''; Lou Liberatore, ``Burn This''; and
Delroy Lindo, ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone.''
   ``Phantom'' is expected to dominate the technical awards for
sets, costumes and lighting. If it does, Maria Bjornson could walk
off with two Tonys, one for scenery and the other for costumes for
the lavish musical.
   Don Mischer, executive producer of the Tony Awards television
show, has vowed to keep it at two hours in length. The program will
feature scenes from all the productions nominated for best play and
best musical. It will also include a musical and dance tribute to
director and choreographer Michael Bennett who died last July.

<HEAD>Argentina Considering Shutdown of Nuclear Plant Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDALL HACKLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial shortfalls may force
Argentina, Latin America's leading user of nuclear power, to halt
construction on a third nuclear reactor and a heavy-water plant,
its top nuclear official says.
   Plans are being made to stop work on the nuclear reactor Atucha
II, which is 60 percent completed, and Arroyito, 90 percent
finished, unless financing is obtained or the government agrees to
a $800 million budget request, said Emma Perez Ferreira, president
of the National Atomic Energy Commission.
   ``We'll have to stop work on the big ones first if we don't get
enough money or obtain financing for the projects,'' Ms. Perez
Ferreira, Argentina's top-ranking female government official, said
in a recent interview.
   A shutdown could hurt Argentina's nuclear industry, which is the
most advanced in the Western Hemisphere outside the United States
and Canada, and cut into its future sales of surplus heavy water.
   Argentina has a contract to build a $100-million, 10-megawatt
nuclear reactor outside Lima, Peru. It also has contracts to build
a nuclear reactor in Algeria and to provide enriched uranium for a
small experimental nuclear reactor at Iran's Tehran University, Ms.
Perez Ferreira said.
   Argentina's nuclear technicians have mastered the entire fuel
cycle, which gives them the ability to make nuclear weapons, but
officials from President Raul Alfonsin on down deny this is in
their plans.
   At one time, the nuclear program was closely tied to the armed
forces, in particular the navy. An admiral headed the Atomic Energy
Commission until the early 1980s, and some reports at the time said
the military favored building an atomic bomb.
   Argentina mines its own uranium ore in the Andes. It prepares
its own fuel, and is capable of enriching the fuel, making fuel
elements, running nuclear reactors and reprocessing the fuel.
Enriching and reprocessing fuel are the keys to making nuclear
weapons.
   Argentina, the world's eighth-largest country geographically,
has two existing nuclear power plants. Until its economic crisis
worsened last year, it had dreams of building four power plants by
the end of the century.
   ``There's no sense in talking now even about a fourth nuclear
plant,'' Ms. Perez Ferreira said. Argentina also has an
uranium-enrichment plant, six research reactors and two
reprocessing plants.
   The nuclear program is important to Argentina, providing up to
20 percent of its electrical power, and is a source of pride to a
country whose standard of living has declined steadily since the
1950s.
   But now Argentina is the developing world's third-largest debtor
behind Brazil and Mexico, owing $55 billion. It also has a 247
percent inflation rate in addition to other severe economic
problems, including a loss of real wages for workers.
   Indeed, 22 percent of Atomic Energy Commission's 6,500-member
work force have left their jobs since 1983, many for similar posts
offering double their pay in Switzerland, Brazil and the United
States, Ms. Perez Ferreira said.
   Neighboring Brazil has a nuclear-power program but its sole
plant near Rio de Janeiro has had constant troubles. Plans to build
two other nuclear plants have been set aside for the time being.
   Ms. Perez Ferreira, a 52-year-old nuclear physicist, took over
the commission last year when her predecessor quit over budgetary
disputes with the government. As head of commission, she reports
directly to President Alfonsin.
   Although officials deny any plans for nuclear weapons, Argentina
has yet to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
   It opposes the treaty on grounds that it interferes with
national sovereignty. The other non-signatory nations with nuclear
technology are South Africa, Israel, India, Pakistan and Brazil.
   Accidents at Argentine nuclear facilities have left three
technicians dead since 1982 but experts say Argentina is not
considered unsafe. A radioactive water spill and a burst pipe also
briefly shut down Atucha I and the Embalse plant last year and in
May.
   National reliance on nuclear-generated power became apparent in
April when power shortages caused in part by temporary shutdowns of
Atucha I and Embalse forced emergency power cutoffs in Buenos
Aires, Mar del Plata and other major cities.
   Argentina's nuclear interest stems from 1950, during the first
presidency of Juan D. Peron. Its first power plant was Atucha I, a
335-megawatt facility built with West German technology in 1974.
   The second, Embalse, outside Cordoba in north-central Argentina,
was finished in 1983. Built with Canadian technology, it has 600
megawatts of power, equal to the Connecticut Yankee plant in the
United States.
   Atucha II, if it is completed, will have 745 megawatts.

<HEAD>Aug. 8 Makes '88 a Special Year in Singapore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The auspicious date rolls around only once a
century _ 8@8@88 _ and it has number-conscious couples in Singapore
flocking to get married on that day.
   Engaged couples have already booked all 90 available slots at
the Registry of Marriages on Aug. 8. The registry has had to put up
a sign telling couples it has no more openings.
   Those being turned away have the option of joining more than 100
other couples in mass nuptials at a theater-restaurant that will be
staffed by registry officials.
   At least four hotels and six restaurants are fully booked for
Chinese wedding dinners on Monday, Aug. 8.
   The date is auspicious because Cantonese-speaking Chinese
pronounce the number eight ``paat,'' which sounds like ``faat,''
which means prosperity.
   Hence the belief that a date made up of all eights bodes well
for the future.
   Many of those who can't marry on Aug. 8 seek propitious
alternatives.
   The Registry of Marriages, which usually averages 43 marriages a
day, reports that Aug. 1 and 2 are proving popular as second
choices.
   The local usage of numerical dates places the day first followed
by month and year. So Aug. 1 appears 1@8@88. It is pronounced ``yat
paat paat paat,'' which sounds like once prosperous always
prosperous.
   Aug. 2, or 2@8@88, is pronounced ``yee paat paat paat'' _ easy
to be prosperous.
   Some of the betrothed want to cover two special dates. They plan
to marry on Aug. 8 but delay the wedding dinner until Sept. 18,
which in the lunar year, coincides with the eighth day of the
eighth moon.
   ``Sept. 18 was fully booked in November last year,'' said
Jessica Eng of the Cathay Restaurant.
   Millions in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and other
parts of Asia hold a deep respect for what they perceive as the
power of certain numbers, particularly older people whose beliefs
are strongly influenced by the traditions of China.
   While 13 is unlucky to Westerners, the number four, alone or in
a combination such as 24 or 44, is bad news for many Chinese
because in Cantonese it sounds like the word for dying.
   Numbers affect many things. Municipal officials say they receive
about 10 written and many oral requests each year from people who
want to change house numbers because the ones they have are unlucky.
   Applicants get a standard reply: no change is possible ``as this
will result in a haphazard system, abuse and impropriety.''
   Real estate agents say that if Chinese have a choice when buying
or renting property, they generally shun houses or apartments with
the number four. Some developers offer discounts when selling
condominiums with unlucky numbers, especially if the market is
sluggish.
   The auctioning of license plates with lucky numbers fetched the
equivalent of about $1 million in Singapore dollars in the last
three years for the Registry of Vehicles. Plates with multiple
number eights are special favorites.
   If Aug. 8, 1988 was not auspicious enough, this is also the year
of the dragon in the Chinese astrological cycle. Following a rabbit
year in the 12-year zodiac, the dragon is considered a mighty
creature that bestows blessings.
   A spokesman for the Population Planning Unit said it expects an
increase in births this year, children who will be known as dragon
seeds.
   Not everyone agrees that popular dates have much to do with
custom or traditional belief.
   ``The couples have departed completely from the Chinese almanac
in choosing these dates,'' said Lee Siow Mong, a retired educator
and president of the China Society. ``The traditional way is to
pick the proper date and time according to the almanac,''
   ``Personally, I think all this talk about 8@8@88 being lucky is
very stupid and baseless,'' Lee said in an interview with The
Straits Times newspaper.
   Nevertheless, Maggie Tay, who was told that all the Registry of
Marriage slots were taken on Aug. 8, still wants to go by the
numbers.
   ``It is a special day that comes along only once in a hundred
years,'' she said, adding that she was considering New Year's Day
as an alternative.
   ``Yat yat paat kow'' (1@1@89) sounds like ``everyday prosper
forever.''

<HEAD>Undocumented Workers Still Taking Risks for Jobs in U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``They keep crossing the river,'' said
Mario Trejo in Ciudad Juarez on the Rio Grande.
   He was talking about Mexican laborers and how the new U.S.
immigration law wasn't stopping them from illegally crossing the
border to work in the United States.
   ``And people still are coming from the central and south of
Mexico hoping to go to the other side,'' Trejo said on the
telephone. He is the press chief for Mayor Jaime Bermudez in Ciudad
Juarez, on the other side of the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas.
   He and other Mexican authorities believe the unwritten law of
supply and demand is winning out over the 1986 U.S. Immigration
Reform and Control Act, also known as the Simpson-Rodino law, even
though jobs are going begging in Northern Mexico.
   ``The undocumented migrants continue entering the United States
as if there never had been a Simpson-Rodino law,'' Jorge
Bustamante, director of the Tijuana-based Northern Border College
and a leading critic of the immigration law, wrote in a recent
newspaper column.
   The law's supporters say its intent is to help the United
States, ``regain control of its borders.''
   U.S. Ambassador Charles Pilliod Jr. said in mid-May, however,
that the ``law was not conceived to eliminate the movement of
Mexican workers to the United States.''
   ``The United States needs these workers _ not only in the farm
area, but also in the many service sectors such as food outlets,
hotels, etc.,'' Pilliod said in a speech to the American Chamber of
Commerce in Mexico City.
   The law gave legal status to aliens who were able to prove they
have lived in the United States at least since 1982. In doing so,
the alients ensured themselves of such rights as a minimum wage,
health care, and education.
   Those who entered the United States after 1982 without legal
documentation remain subject to deportation.
   Pilliod said, however, that predictions of mass deportations are
unfair.
   ``Granted, the Border Patrol will continue to apprehend and
return undocumented aliens to their home countries as always, but
there are no plans for mass roundups,'' he said.
   Bustamante and others contend that the United States cannot
reverse a 40-year trend with a law, because working in the United
States, without documents if necessary, has become part of the
lifestyle of thousands of Mexican families.
   Mexicans who go to work in the United States, even those taking
the most menial jobs, can earn five to 10 times what they earn at
home, where the minimum wage is the equivalent of about $3.45 a day.
   The Northern Border College estimates Mexicans working in the
United States generate about $1 billion in foreign income for
Mexico.
   The Simpson-Rodino law gave illegal aliens who met certain
requirements until May 4 to apply for legal status in the United
States. The majority of the more than 1.6 million people who
applied are Mexican.
   But U.S. immigration officials estimate that half or more of the
6 million to 7 million illegal aliens in the United States are
Mexican.
   And nobody is reporting either a mass exodus or mass
deportations of Mexicans since the May 4 deadline passed.
   ``Just as we predicted, based on investigations we do at the
Northern Border College, nothing extraordinary has happened since
May 5,'' Bustamante wrote in Excelsior of Mexico City.
   Northern Border College offices from Tijuana to Matamoros have
been studying undocumented workers for three years.
   ``For them, the main factor that determines their willingness to
run the risks is the labor market,'' Bustamante wrote. ``As long as
they keep hiring, they will continue entering.''
   A key intent of the Simpson-Rodino law is to stop the hiring of
illegal aliens by U.S. employers.
   In the toughest provision of the law, employers who knowingly
hire undocumented workers can receive stiff fines and other
sanctions. Agricultural employers have until Dec. 1 before
sanctioning begins.
   Meanwhile, the crossings continue.
   ``The majority of those who cross here are farm workers and
they've been given special considerations,'' said Mayor Ernesto
Gomez Lira of Reynosa, south of McAllen, Texas.
   Trejo and Gomez said their city governments have programs to
help returning undocumented migrants find work and housing but so
far the program have not been necessary.
   ``There's a tremendous need for workers in Juarez,'' Trejo said,
referring to the booming foreign-owned assembly operations that
have created a demand for workers.
   ``There's a real war going on. One company offers a 50 percent
discount on cafeteria food and another offers to feed them for
free,'' Trejo said.
   ``We want people to come so they can go to work.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Want to buy a lion? A zebra. A rhea bird? A trio
of bear cubs. No problem. Demand for wilder wildlife is sizeable
and the suppliers ever ready. That pleases animal dealers and
customers who, for benign and not so benign reasons, go for exotic
animals, even on a dinner plate. The trend bothers the increasingly
active animal rights groups and others who are disposed to raise
moral as well as ecological issues.

   A classified ad in a Pittsburgh newspaper:
``Celebese Ape, 14-week-old baby, diaper-trained, sucks finger;
also cougar & bobcat babies & other exotic animals.''
   The man placing the ad says he had plenty of animals to sell,
and what he didn't have at the time, he could get.
   ``There's nothing God put breath into I can't get,'' said Jim
Ledbetter, who until recently ran an exotic animal business in
Uniontown, Pa. ``If you want a zebra, elephant or whatever, no
problem.''
   Ledbetter went on to say he could get a black panther, an
endangered animal, for $2,000, but added they don't make good pets.
``In Florida, there's a guy who sells them for $6,000 a pop,'' he
says.
   Young elephants go for $20,000 each, old ones about $15,000, he
says. White tigers are about $50,000 each, $90,000 for a pair.
Cougars are $975, bobcats, $875.
   ``Everything I sell is cheap,'' he says.
   In the United States, the world's largest consumer of wildlife,
trading in exotic animals is entirely legal, as is ownership in
most places, subject to some state and local restrictions. That has
spurred animal rights groups into intensifying efforts to regulate
the industry.
   David Herbet, captive wildlife specialist for the Humane Society
of the United States in Washington, believes private ownership is a
``total misuse of wild animals.''
   About 90 percent of all wild animals die within the first two
years of captivity, regardless of whether they were captively bred,
he says.
   ``Wild animals should be ... left in the wild,'' echoes Doug
Inkley of the National Wildlife Federation in Washington.
   Faced with increasingly vocal criticism and the hostility of
animal rights groups, dealers generally have become wary of
publicity. At a recent auction in western Ohio, a sign prohibited
use of cameras and recording equipment and a non-uniformed guard
carrying a holstered gun searched one visitor's handbag. People
with cameras were escorted off the grounds.
   The exotic animal business is booming, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
   An estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people in this country own, breed,
exhibit or sell wild and exotic animals, says Pat Hoctor of Prairie
Creek, Ind., publisher of the Animal Finders' Guide, one of the
largest publications in the country devoted to the trade.
   ``The vast majority are people who have them as a hobby,'' he
says. Of that number, about 300 could be considered professional
animal dealers, many of whom sell their wares through guides like
Hoctor's or at several auctions held regularly throughout the
country, particularly the Midwest.
   Among their customers:
   _A Minnesota couple that keep a chimpanzee, lion and tiger in
their basement, a boa constrictor in the bathroom and a baby skunk
in their living room.
   _A private game ranch in Wallisville, Texas, where would-be
big-game hunters who don't have the time or money to travel to
Africa can stalk captive-bred lions for $3,500 a crack _ ``a better
trophy at half the price,'' says owner Larry Wilburn.
   _A processing plant in Warren, Mich., and meat wholesaler in San
Bruno, Calif., which sell big-game meat, including lions,
hippopotamus, reindeer and eland, to restaurants eager to satisfy
the latest national fad for low-cholesterol, not to mention exotic,
meats.
   _A Florida farm that raises ostrich, emu and rhea for hides _
the latest trend in cowboy-boot leather.
   _A roadside menagerie in Pennsylvania where children can pet
everything from mice to elephants.
   _A tavern in Ohio where the owner's pet chimpanzee smokes
cigarettes and swigs six-packs of beer to the delight of patrons.
   In many places, a private owner is free to lead a lion on a
leash or keep a baboon in his back yard. He also is free to treat,
feed and house the animal as he pleases.
   Certain groups feel such practices should be outlawed because
many species pose a danger to public safety and the environment.
   They also cite the case of a lioness called Abby, crippled at 6
months because her Ohio owners fed her improperly, to make a point
that too few people know enough to properly care for an exotic
animal.
   Animals that have to be taken from an owner because of abuse or
neglect or that grow too big or unmanageable face an uncertain
future.
   ``The problem with those animals is that when they do become
mean and can't be handled, the first thing people do is call the
zoo to donate it,'' says Charles Wickenhauser, director of the
Pittsburgh Zoo. ``We certainly don't want an animal like that. They
have psychological problems and need special treatment to get them
back into a particular group of animals.''
   Hoctor gets upset on hearing about people abusing their animals,
either willfully or from ignorance. But he says the follies of some
shouldn't tarnish the entire group of owners and breeders who truly
enjoy their animals and know more about them and care for them
better than many zoos.
   ``Just because zoos are the commonly accepted places for animals
doesn't mean they're the authorities. Zoos are living museums.
Breeders know what animals need,'' he says.
   ``People see us holding things in cages. They misconceive that
we are raping the wild. We are actually the experts on the wild,''
says Hoctor, who raises lions, tigers, waterfowl and assorted other
animals and birds. ``While do-gooders are making a big stink about
how they love the wild, we're actually saving the wild'' through
breeding efforts.
   Animal dealer Bob Troumbly of Grand Rapids, Minn., concedes
there are considerable abuses and few safeguards.
   ``A lot of people buy this stuff for macho stuff,'' says
Troumbly, 31, who operates Northland Wildlife. ``This is America.
There are a lot of injustices in this world and that's just one of
them. There's always somebody out there willing to sell to somebody
they may not feel is qualified.

   For dinner tonight, how about gingered
alligator ribs, rattlesnake cacciatore, or, for the truly
adventurous, escallops of lion on a bed of fiddlehead ferns?
   Those are some of the dishes offered on a fairly regular basis
at the Mad Batter Restaurant in the seaside resort town of Cape
May, N.J.
   The Mad Batter is one of dozens of gourmet restaurants
throughout the country that have shucked chicken cordon bleu and
filet mignon for the likes of marinated grilled camel, roasted
hippopotamus and kangaroo chili, the cheapest on the menu at $15.75.
   The most expensive dish at the Mad Batter is Eye of Buffalo,
filet mignon with wild mushroom sauce, $19.50. Escallops of lion
cost $19, with rattlesnake cacciatore going for $18.
   Even some supermarkets are getting into the exotic act,
supplying meat to curious customers eager to test their culinary
skills.
   The trend bothers animal welfare agencies.
   ``The desire of some people to eat exotic wild animals is a sign
of decadence in our society. These people seem to have ethical
blinders on when it comes to their palate,'' says Craig Van Note,
vice president of Monitor Consortium, which represents 35
conservation and animal welfare groups.
   ``It puts an increased demand upon these wild animals, and
therefore it increases the removal of them from the wild,'' he
says. ``There's enough pressure on these animals as it is. They
don't need to become valuable as a human food source.''
   Those in the exotic meat business say there's no difference
between shooting a cow and shooting a lion, particularly a lion
that's raised in captivity on ranches and farms.
   Many people want meat that is leaner and lower in cholesterol
than pork chops or steak, and they say wild and exotic game often
fits the bill nicely.
   ``It's a skyrocketing business,'' says Gerald Prolman of Night
Bird Game and Poultry in San Bruno, Calif., which wholesales
everything from mouflon and beaver to reindeer and springbok.
``This business was started in 1979, and it has grown as fast as
people have found out the products were available.''
   Don Francis of Butcher Boy Products in Warren, Mich., has
processed and wholesaled conventional wild gae for 27 years. Now
he's hurrying to get into the exotic business.
   ``I saw there was a market for it and I wanted to get in while
the getting's good,'' says Francis, who sells full carcasses of
bear and exotic deer to restaurants. ``I just wish I'd been in it
earlier.''
   At the Mad Batter, Chef Danny Mellman says many patrons often
sample exotic meat dishes out of curiosity.
   ``A lot of it is shock factor,'' he says. ``They see wildebeest
and say, `I've got to eat wildebeest just to see what it's like and
to tell my friends I had it.'''
   But he says there are plenty of customers hankering for big game
meals on a regular basis.
   ``There are people who call every week and say, `What are you
running this week,''' he says.
   Mellman has also fielded calls from people who are offended by
his exotic fare or worry that the curried bear on their plate is
``the same bear they saw in the Philadelphia zoo.''
   Exotic meats are not zoos' castoffs. Mellman gets much of his
meat from abroad _ lion from East Africa and red deer from
Scotland, for instance. But many of those animals also are raised
on farms and ranches in this country.
   ``It started about 10 years ago, and it's growing,'' says George
Mazur of World Safari Inc. of Washington, a wild game wholesaler.
``A lot of these farms are springing up all over the place.''
   Some people, though, have trouble swallowing the new fad _ no
matter how tasty or healthy it is.
   Bob Troumbly of Northland Wildlife in Grand Rapids, Minn., sells
animals to public zoos and similar facilities. But he says he
couldn't bring himself to sell them to someone who wants to roast,
pickle, fry or boil them.
   ``My feelings get involved,'' he says. ``My bleeding heart gets
involved.''

   As a flock of Canada geese fly northward on
their annual spring migration, their honking cries arouse dozens of
their kind held in wire cages and orange crates under a tent at a
western Ohio auction.
   The tent also shelters badgers, wood ducks, black bears, swans,
foxes, prairie dogs, cougars and a large female lion, who growls
when someone gets too close.
   Beyond, in several newly built stalls and pens, is a veritable
Noah's ark of animals from all parts of the globe with
foreign-sounding names such as aoudad, binturong, colobus, emu,
ibex, guanacos, muntjac, oryx, rhea, watusi and zebu.
   Within hours, the fate of all will be set by an auctioneer's
gavel, their destinations determined by the highest bidder.
   Woods & Waters Auction, held twice a year on the outskirts of
this quiet little farm town, bills itself as the largest animal
auction east of the Mississippi River.
   At its three-day sale in April, up to 8,000 animals, including
birds and reptiles were sold to breeders, animal dealers, owners of
game ranches, meat dealers and hobbyists with a penchant for a
particular species, says Woods & Waters' owner Dick Osting.
   For the most part, the customers were a reticent lot who shunned
publicity and people trying to photograph animals were escorted off
the premises by a security guard.
   Osting complains that the media have ``distorted'' their
business by only photographing animals that are injured, kept in
undersized cages or left in pens without food and water.
   ``The media want to stir up a story...to shock readers,'' says
Osting, 37, who's operated the family-run auction for five years.
``The only thing the media do when they print this gory stuff is to
upset the humane society and the government, which is two people we
don't want upset at us.''
   Osting says auctions help the wild and exotic animal industry
because they bring the business of buying and selling animals out
into public view.
   ``The intention of the auction is to clean up the business,'' he
says. ``We're stepping out into the open, inviting regulation.
We're saying, `As long as you don't regulate us out of the
business, regulate us.'''
   Animal welfare people contend there are abuses. Anne Maroukis,
co-founder of Guardians of the Earth, an Ohio-based animal welfare
rights group, says some cages were inadequate, as in the case of
three bear cubs brought to the auction in a cardboard box, or too
small. An adult black bear, she says, had cuts above his eyes from
hitting his head against exposed metal edges when he'd try to
stand, and some cages lacked food and water.
   Osting says some injuries do occur in the transport of animals
to the auction. He adds, ``I've heard about foxes in too small a
cage. He's at a three-day auction. He probably just came from real
nice facilities and he'll probably go back to real nice facilities.
After all, the animal is here for just three days. I think they
make way too big an issue of it.''
   Maroukis says, ``We've tried to work with the Department of
Agriculture. They keep saying they have no jurisdiction, but if
they don't, who does?''
   Don Castner, an inspector with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, says he saw some injuries, but none appeared
life-threatening.
   Auctions are not regulated by the federal government, so
inspectors for the USDA, which oversees the transportation of
animals, can only cite dealers or breeders whose animals appear to
have been injured in transit, he says. The USDA has no control over
privately owned animals.
   When asked about a flock of ostrich-like birds called rheas with
bloodied legs, which Osting said probably were injured during
transport, Castner replied that the USDA also doesn't regulate
birds or reptiles.
   ``We can't do what we can't do. We only regulate the
transportation of animals owned by dealers. That's it.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's a seasoned practitioner of a relatively
new, steadily booming and widely mistrusted profession in America.
David Sawyer, political consultant, didn't have an entry in the
recent presidential primaries, but he has some definite views on
why the winners won and the losers lost.

   David Sawyer sat on the sidelines during the
presidential primaries just ended, an unusual place for him in a
hot election campaign. But there he sat, like a maestro in the
audience, enjoying it, making notes.
   ``Dole,'' he says, reflecting on the campaign that one writer
likened to a demolition derby, ``made some errors that hurt him,
ruined him. So he lost, Bush won. Bush made few errors. Dukakis, on
the other side, made few errors and Dukakis won.''
   David Sawyer is a political consultant.
   He is a Democrat and works only for Democrats. He also is a
seasoned practitioner of a relatively new, steadily booming and
widely mistrusted profession in America.
   One popular perception of a political consultant is that of a
modern-day Machiavelli who knows how to use electronic guile to
manipulate a benighted electorate into mistaking form for substance.
   ``Nonsense,'' says Sawyer, but it is obvious that he feels some
of the skills that good political consultants do bring to a
campaign were lacking in some of the races this spring.
   Robert Dole's, for instance. The Republican senator, in Sawyer's
view, ``failed badly in organizing his campaign and developing his
strategy. He didn't appoint a strong team. He tried to run it all
himself, and you can't do that.'' Dole, he feels, would have made a
more formidable opponent for Dukakis.
   ``George Bush, on the other hand, put together a superb
organization. The campaign carried the candidate. People who run a
good campaign have the edge.
   `` Michael Dukakis? Dukakis enters the fall campaign much less
damaged than Walter Mondale was when he entered the '84 campaign.
Dukakis is beholden to none of the special interest groups that
Mondale was identified with. Dukakis ran a simply fine campaign and
it paid off.''
   That, in short, Sawyer explains, is the job of the consultant:
to give his candidate the edge.
   David Sawyer is 52, trim, with thinning gray hair and gray eyes.
Whatever it is that he and his partner, Scott Miller, do to gain
that edge they are apparently financially successful at it. Their
well-appointed suite of offices overlook Central Park in one of
Manhattan's classiest midtown neighborhoods.
   In the past five years the Sawyer-Miller Group has doubled in
size from 20 to 40, reflecting the meteoric rise in America of the
political consulting trade.
   They even have a trade association, and it has grown from 75
members 10 years ago to 650 today. Its president, Brad O'Leary,
estimates that as many as 3,000 professionals in America may be
considered political consultants.
   Sawyer also represents a certain coming of age in the state of
the art.
   The consulting fraternity had its origins in the advertising
agencies summoned off Madison Avenue by politicians, a practice
roundly criticized in the 1968 book, ``The Selling of the
President.''
   In an ironic turnaround, Sawyer has expanded into the commercial
field using techniques learned in political campaigns. He
represents political candidates but also Coca-Cola, Apple Computer
and a dozen or so others, mainly those dealing with unexpected
market changes and stiff competition.
   Political campaigns require his company's complete attention,
Sawyer says, and mainly for that reason he sat out the primaries.
``We felt we wouldn't be able to give our commercial work all it
deserves. If we do any political work this year it will be in the
general election campaign.''
   This election year an estimated $1.8 billion will be spent on
politics with $500 million going for TV ads and $100 million for
political consultants. For that kind of money, politicians must
consider a consultants' service as something more than that of a
debating coach.
   True, says Sawyer, but hardly more sinister.
   ``A political campaign is like a war,'' says Sawyer. ``In a
limited period of time you have to seize certain territory and hold
it. It involves strategy and tactics. I work on both levels.
   ``The strategic team, about 10 people, are experts in various
categories who determine how the candidate positions himself, how
he contrasts himself with his opponents, which issues in the array
of issues he believes in should be the key issues of the campaign.''
   It was on the strategic level that Albert Gore stumbled,
according to Sawyer.

   ``Although he was very attractive, he began to be seen as
opportunistic, changing his strategy. He ran as a defense
candidate, then as a Southern candidate, then as a Jewish
candidate, then as an economic populist candidate.
   ``It is very important to develop a single-minded, clear
strategy. Gore ended up with four or five different strategies
which made it difficult for any one of them to be heard.''
   Dukakis, for his part, Sawyer says, ``had such great strength in
terms of money, credibility as a sitting governor, and such a
first-rate campaign organization it was tough to compete against
him.'' Of all the contending Democrats, Dukakis emerged in Sawyer's
view as the most electable in November.
   The tactical team's job, says Sawyer, is to figure out how to
communicate a candidate's complex agenda, often in 30-second bites.
   ``Not just for TV spots; the nightly news is done in 30-second
bites as well, or less. It's the nature of the business nowadays
and it isn't all bad. You can express your position on some pretty
complex issues in 30 seconds.
   ``For example, `I oppose any further aid to the Contras.' Three
seconds. `If elected, I would ask Congress to raise taxes 10
percent across the board to pay off our deficit.' Five seconds.
   ``The reasoning, the subtleties, come out in the formal debates
and the print media. The electorate, in my opinion, has never been
better informed about the position of the candidates on any issue
and on his or her character.''
   The tacticians' techniques, helped along by advanced technology
including instant polling, videotape and Federal Express, are where
consultants show their battlefield savvy.
   ``You have to be able to take advantage of every opportunity,
change your strategy on a moment's notice. Often it's a matter of
timing.''
   Sawyer demonstrated this last year in the Kentucky Democratic
primary. Sawyer's firm, like nearly all consultant firms,
represents candidates of only one party. That race put him up
against two others with similar reputations as heavy hitters among
Democrats _ Bob Squier, representing former Gov. John Y. Brown, the
early favorite; and David Doak and Robert Shrum, representing
then-Lt. Gov. Steve Beshear, the leading challenger.
   Sawyer's candidate was Wallace Wilkinson, a political unknown
who registered only about 5 percent in the polls and was given
little chance to improve.
   Little chance, that is, until the last two weeks of the campaign.
   ``Our two opponents began attacking each other with spots
accusing each other of all sorts of things, and both advocated a
tax increase.
   ``We discovered, through polls, that the voters disapproved of
the negative campaigns they were waging against each other. So we
moved in quickly. We said in effect that they were both right in
their accusations, and we pushed for a lottery that we had
advocated all along instead of new taxes.
   ``We had the overall strategy but we needed an opening to
execute it and that gave us the opening. We exploited it. Call it
guerrilla tactics.''
   Whatever you call it, Wallace Wilkinson is now governor of
Kentucky.
   Could any campaign consultant's tactics have saved Gary Hart?
   ``Absolutely not. Hart was doomed as soon as the Donna Rice
episode came out. The most important thing people need to have is
trust in their leader, trust in his judgement and his character.
Hart sacrificed any trust the people could have had in him.''
   Sawyer was lured into politics from a career as a producer of
documentary films in 1970 when he was asked to do some film work
for a candidate for governor of Illinois. By 1974, he was into
political consulting with both feet.
   His batting average has stayed at about .750, good enough for
the big leagues (clients include four sitting senators and six
governors) and for an expanding foreign trade as well. His clients
also include Corazon Aquino, president of the Philippines, and
Israel's foreign minister, Shimon Peres.
   He has taken advantage of every technological advance, as have
his colleagues, but in his view the most important electioneering
change in the past decade has been not in sophisticated technology
but the ever-growing sophistication of voters.
   ``Americans are exposed to commercial advertising more
aggressive than ever before, to expanded news coverage because of
satellite transmissions, and you just don't manipulate them. You
can't.
   ``TV is like an X-ray machine. Voters can see through false
statements or sloganeering instead of substantive debate.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ If you want to indulge your passion for fly
fishing without roughing it _ or go to faraway places _ there are
fishing ``camps'' that will accommodate you. Bring money. And that
side of the sport is booming too, as this report on angling for the
well-heeled shows. Last of a series.

   Against a backdrop of jagged mountains,
a columbine-blue sky, and summer meadows bursting with wild
flowers, a flash of blinding light.
   Myrna Rubelman's diamonds had trapped the sun.
   Dressed in a casual T-shirt, baseball cap, fly-fishing vest and
slacks, Mrs. Rubelman wore her jewels as she cast an artificial fly
into a classic Colorado trout stream.
   Along with her husband, Pete, a periodontist, and two other
couples from Islamorada, Fla., Mrs. Rubelman was on her first
fly-fishing expedition.
   ``I love it!'' she said, as a professional guide coached her
about the proper grip on her fly rod and cautioned her not to flick
her wrist.
   Mrs. Rubelman, like the other financially well-off, physically
active, middle-aged vacationers scattered along the crystal-clear
stream, had no intention of roughing it in the wilderness.
Attentive staff members at Elktrout Lodge hovered nearby to make
sure she didn't have to.
   The Rubelmans and their friends, Julian and Polly Unger, and
Hank and Joy Brown, are among a growing number of affluent
Americans on the lookout for superb fly fishing.
   It doesn't matter whether they are beginners or experts. They
want to catch plenty of fish in a beautiful setting. (Trout,
salmon, and steelhead don't live in ugly places.) They want to eat
well and sleep well while they're doing it. Their hosts must
provide all, perhaps more than, the comforts of home.
   That was the idea behind Elktrout when Andy Shepard, a Santa
Rosa, Calif., banking executive, and some of his friends pooled
resources and built an elegant lodge on the banks of the Colorado
River in 1982.
   At first, the dozen investors intended Elktrout to be a private
haven just for them, their families, and their friends. They
started buying river frontage along the Colorado and several
smaller streams near the farming town of Kremmling, located two
hours northwest of Denver on the western slope of the Continental
Divide.
   Today Elktrout is a luxurious log compound which accommodates up
to 20 guests willing to pay $1,375 for five days of some of the
finest fly fishing in the world.
   For their money, anglers cast into more privately owned fishing
water than they can find at any other lodge in the American West.
   Elktrout's holdings include five miles of blue-ribbon Colorado
River water, three miles of gold medal water on the Blue River,
nine lakes, and numerous creeks with names like Cataract and
Troublesome.
   Trout that lunge at the guests' artificial flies are commonly 16
to 24 inches long, weigh up to 5 pounds, and fight like the wild
creatures they are. Nearly all the fish caught by Elktrout anglers,
except trout kept in special ``dinner'' ponds, are released.
Exceptions are trophy fish.
   A day's fishing is pleasantly interrupted by a gourmet picnic
lunch at tables set beside the stream, an evening gathering around
the huge rock fireplace, and afterward a candlelight dinner.
   ``Probably less than 10 percent of our guests know anything
technical about fly fishing,'' says Steve Herter, Elktrout's
resident manager. ``We provide instruction and let them discover
the sport on their own. We have all the equipment they need right
here in our Orvis store, and we will talk fly fishing to them for
as long as they'll listen.''
   Elktrout also offers three-day intensive Orvis fly-fishing
clinics run by The Flyfisher, Inc., a Denver dealer, for $475 per
person.
   Herter said Elktrout's bookings are growing ``by leaps and
bounds. We're getting a very good cross section of clientele in the
40-to-60-year range. Some are older, wealthy couples, a lot are
up-and-coming professionals who are intrigued by the sport, and a
lot more women are interested in learning about fly fishing. We
even have one lady from Texas who comes here to fish while her
husband sits on the bank and reads books.''
   Another devoted fly fisherwoman is Susie Fitzgerald, co-owner
with her husband, Mike, of a specialty travel company in Wexford,
Pa.
   ``Frontiers'' is a 20-year-old firm that caters to wealthy
outdoorsmen and women who want to experience fishing, hunting, and
photography...``from the pristine trout waters of New Zealand to
the historic chalk streams of England and Normandy...
   ``From the prolific bonefish flats of Christmas Island and the
Caribbean to the Atlantic salmon rivers of Iceland...
   ``From the big trout of Tierra del Fuego and alpine Patagonia to
the best waters of Alaska and the American West...''
   Prices per person can run into thousands of dollars. Last year
more than 4,000 customers used Frontiers' services to arrange
fly-fishing vacations around the globe.
   ``The demand just keeps increasing,'' says Mrs. Fitzgerald. ``We
are always exploring new areas because interest in the sport is
constantly growing, particularly in salt water fly fishing, where
we've seen the biggest jump in our business.''

   Mrs. Fitzgerald says Frontiers guide Chris Child is
investigating fishing opportunities in a remote Chinese province,
where recently she caught a fish the scientists haven't even
identified yet. ``It looks like brown trout, but isn't,'' she says.
   Frontiers also has teamed with Trout Unlimited to open up Soviet
fishing to Western anglers under a new agreement signed by American
and Soviet sportsmen.
   ``We are committed to making this happen and we're looking at
inaugurating it in the '89 season,'' Mrs. Fitzgerald says. ``We are
focusing on rivers in the Soviet Union which come into the White
Sea. There are fantastic Atlantic salmon in them, and we have about
500 people just waiting to sign up for the first trips.''
   Mrs. Fitzgerald has fished on four continents and a multitude of
islands. After a recent trip to Christmas Island in the Pacific,
where she relentlessly hauled in 8-pound bonefish for a week, she
wrote in the Orvis News:
   ``...that silver shadow, swimming nose down and tail visible in
10 to 20 inches of sparkling water, makes your heart stand
still...when I connect, it's dynamite. You can't imagine a more
thrilling five to 15 minutes...''
   If merely visiting some of the world's best fishing holes isn't
enough, there are investment opportunities available in all the
``hot spots'' for fanatics who can afford them.
   In Montana, a buyer can get nearly two miles of Ruby River
frontage, a 3,000-square-foot log home, and a guest house for
$550,000.
   In Alaska, a luxurious fly-in fishing lodge which can
accommodate 20 guests in the King Salmon area is listed for about
$2 million.
   Mike George of Polar Realty in Anchorage, after joking that
``anything's for sale in Alaska in these hard economic times,''
adds that there are many smaller lodges for sale, starting at
$150,000.
   ``We've had substantial inquiries and even some purchases from
foreign investors who want to get into the Alaska recreation
market,'' George says.
   A recent ad in Fly Fisherman Magazine spotlighted a property in
Quebec which boasted a six-bedroom, furnished estate, caretaker's
house, 330 acres, ``Atlantic salmon and trout river. Duck marsh and
game hunting.'' Mere dreamers need not apply: the ad warns
``serious inquiries only.''
   In the British Isles there is almost no public sports-fishing
water left. The resale value of fishing rights is based on the
number of fish expected to be caught in a year along that
particular stretch of river. A 10-year average catch is used as a
benchmark.
   Thirty years ago the average sale price was $100 to $300 per
Atlantic salmon per year. Today the rate can top $7,000 per salmon
on such famous Scottish rivers as the Tweed or the Spey and the Dee.
   Each section of private ownership is called a ``beat.''
Individual beats average 200 to 300 yards. In recent years the
popularity of fly fishing has prompted beat owners to divide them
up into time shares, just like condominiums on the Costa del Sol
and the French Riviera.
   If a fisherman expects to catch 20 fish during his annual week
on a popular river, he may pay as much as $150,000 for his time
share. That adds up to $6,500 per fish.
   Renting the same rights for a one-time, one-week fling can cost
as much as $50 for every fish the angler expects to catch, based on
the river's past performance.
   That doesn't match the value the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
placed on one of its trout this year _ Goldie, a prized 4-year-old
albino that vanished last Christmas from the Ennis, Mont., National
Fish Hatchery.
   In a WANTED bulletin, federal biologists said that when Goldie
disappeared from their visitor display pond ``she weighed more than
20 pounds and was distinguished by her golden yellow color.''
   The feds put up a $2,500 reward for information leading to her
recovery, dead or alive. Her frozen body was found in February in a
snowbank near Steamboat Springs, Colo.
   Federal wildlife agents say two men stole Goldie and two other
fish from the government's pond, first took her to a bar in
Bozeman, Mont., then weighed her in a Milner, Colo., grocery store
(23 pounds). They finally got rid of the victim when they heard
authorities were searching for her.
   A tip from Montana and from someone who saw the fish in the
grocery store helped agents track down the suspects. The government
is now seeking to determine who earned the reward and may
prosecute, depending on the outcome of the FWS investigation.
   Goldie's remains today are on ice in the Denver FWS office.
   ``Once she's no longer needed for evidence, we plan to preserve
Goldie, then display her at the Ennis hatchery with a sign telling
about the Great Fish Saga,'' says Jack Hallowell, FWS assistant
regional director for public affairs.
   Now THAT's a fish story. As Hallowell put it, ``Goldie became
the most sought-after fish since Moby Dick.''

   Four world-class trout rivers flow
almost by the door of tiny R.L. Winston Rod Co., whose fly rods are
recognized as among the best by hard-core equipment zealots.
   Money is no object for fly fishermen who seek out the Winston
factory in this western Montana ranching town to test cast and
maybe buy a $305 gossamer-tipped graphite wand or a $900 objet
d'art in bamboo.
   ``It's a fact that fishermen sometimes get starry looks when
they first touch one of our rods. It's affection,'' says Tom
Morgan, who bought the established San Francisco rod maker in 1973
and moved it to Montana.
   ``A rod communicates with you,'' Morgan says. ``When you wiggle
a Winston rod it talks back to you with a good message.''
   He implied there's little back talk from a mass-produced rod
retailing for $19.99 in a discount store.
   ``Our goal isn't to provide everyone with a Winston rod, and
everyone can't afford them,'' Morgan says. So the factory makes fly
rods at an artistic snail's pace of about 2,000 a year.
   Morgan doubts his 59-year-old company will ever produce more
than 3,000 rods a year.
   Morgan and the other Winston employees don't blink an eye if an
angler wants to cast half a dozen fly rods on the lawn across the
street, or buy one and substitute zebra wood for the standard
walnut reel seat.
   Morgan, who guided for 14 years and fishes all over the world,
might even accompany an eager angler to one of the nearby
blue-ribbon trout rivers, the Big Hole, Beaverhead, Ruby or
Jefferson.
   He might even rig his favorite Winston, an 8-foot, 4-weight
graphite. ``I like to fish small, dry flies. It's just perfect for
that,'' Morgan said.
   Winston has no fixed working days or hours for its five regular
and seven part-time employees.
   ``If one of the trout streams beckons, they are free to go,''
Morgan says. ``This provides them with the artistic freedom and
inspiration they need to accomplish outstanding work.''
   Winston's graphite rods are considered among the world's best.
They are coated with a translucent kelly-green finish, and guides
are wrapped with matching green thread.
   Winston won't wind a rod with different color thread for a
customer or do anything else that ``makes no aesthetic sense or
technical sense,'' Morgan says.
   There are 89 models of Winston fly rods in 11 line sizes, three
actions, three materials, from 5{ feet to 10 feet long.
   Once an angler buys a basic Winston, there's an enticing array
of accouterments _ maybe a scrimshaw reel seat lovingly carved with
a kingfisher, German silver reel banks, your name engraved on the
rod.
   ``Our average customer has three to five of our rods and I've
talked to people with a dozen,'' Morgan says.
   Almost all of Winston's rods are graphite. The bamboo operation,
supervised by partner Glenn Brackett, may turn out only 75 rods
this year.
   Tonkin cane for the beautifully finished, classic rods comes
from mainland China. Anglers may have to wait four to eight months
for each custom-built rod, whose blemish-free bamboo strips are cut
within a tolerance of one-thousandth of an inch.
   ``Only 5 percent of the bamboo we get goes into our rods,''
Brackett says ``We reject the rest.''
   There are a lot of other good, expensive fly rods on the market
from companies like Sage, Powell, Scott, Teton, Thomas & Thomas, G.
Loomis and Orvis. In fact, Winston's graphite rod blanks are made
on its own tapers by G. Loomis, a larger rod maker.
   Some fly rod companies offer ``futuristic materials,''
``superior tapers,'' ``parabolic action,'' the latest
``breakthrough'' materials. Morgan says a rod's design is more
important than the material. ``It has to work for the type of
fishing you do. At Winston, we don't jump on every new material
that comes along.''
   Morgan says that ``a lot of the people who build fly rods don't
fish enough. You can't make great fly rods if you don't use them a
lot.''
   He himself fishes a great deal, in part because ``you almost
always fish in a place where you can rebuild your spirit. When I'm
steelheading at times I almost wish a fish wouldn't come to my
hook.''
   When it comes to hooking trout, he believes in catching and
releasing them. ``For the marvelous sport they give us,'' he says,
``they deserve our best treatment. You can turn the fish loose, not
like hunting when you kill the animal.''

   A fly fisherman doesn't have to wear
designer labels or own expensive gear to land the big ones. A trout
with a brain the size of a pea doesn't discriminate between L. L.
Bean and Levi's.
   But serious anglers nearly all agree that collecting gadgets,
perusing catalogs, and spending a snowy winter's day inside a
fishing equipment store is part of the ritual.
   Like one great beauty surreptitiously ogling another's jewels,
fly fishermen check out each other's tackle with discriminating
eyes.
   There's a genteel snobbery in showing up on opening day along
the Beaver Kill River in New York sporting an antique Hiram Leonard
split Tonkin bamboo rod, a Wheatley fly box, a few Irresistibles
tied by Harry or Elsie Darbee, and a faded but much-beloved red
shirt that's survived being stuffed into duffles from Ireland to
New Zealand, and back again by way of Patagonia and Venezuela.
   In spite of sneaking suspicions that fish get spooked by red,
fly fishermen love the color. Big Boy tomato red, American Beauty
red, Fourth of July firecracker red. They wear it in crimson felt
hats crimped at the brim, in scarlet shirts with elaborate flies
embroidered on the pocket, in cherry bandanas tied around sunburned
necks on hot days.
   To many, a splash of red is a talisman.
   ``CHOOSE ME!'' it says to the submerged fish with poor eyesight.
``See my bright hat? My bright suspenders? Of all the men mucking
about in your watery world, I'm the one who will honor you the most.
   ``You, the big one there, if you pick me I will hang you over my
fireplace, display you next to my office bar, maybe just let you go
after I take your picture.''
   Amid the brown, beige and khaki in a fly fisherman's kit bag
there is usually a treasured piece of red.
   But an angler who wants the works will need a lot of green.
   If an emperor with no clothes walked into Jack Dennis' Outdoor
Shop in Jackson, Wyo., and got outfitted in time to be on the Snake
River for lunch, this is what it could cost him:
   _Insulated waders, $100.
   _Leather boots, $85.
   _Boot liner, $30.
   _Fancy shirt, $44.95.
   _Hat (preferably red), $17.
   _Fly fisherman's vest, $60.
   _Graphite fly rod and reel, $80 to $200 and up.
   _Aluminum fly rod case, $40.
   _Leader material, $18 to $32.
   _Floating line, $10 to $30.
   _Clippers, $4.
   _Flies, $1.35 to $2.50 (need at least a dozen).
   _Fly box, $14.
   _Net (for optimists), $14 to $30.
   _Bamboo creel, $40.
   Then there are lessons: Jack Dennis' instructors charge $40 to
teach two people for two hours, while an all-day guided session on
the Snake runs $200 for two, lunch included.
   If the novice fisherman is really hooked, dreams of bonefishing
at Christmas Island begin to dance in his head. That adventure
costs $1,700, not counting air fare to Honolulu.
   Meanwhile, fish are waiting in the Laxa I Laxadalur River in
Iceland, the King Salmon River in Alaska, the Spey, the Dee, and
the Tweed Rivers in Scotland, the Bow River of Canada...

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For moviegoers and readers around the world,
Marcel Pagnol sketched a peasants' France, an unchanging world
where the past shaped the future. The present, however, has muscled
in. The peasant is vanishing from the French scene with small farms
disappearing at a dramatic rate.

   CUGES-LES-PINS, France (AP) _ In the hills where Jean de
Florette struggled to raise rabbit food, farming is now small
potatoes. The major local asset is a theme park called ``O.K.
Corral.''
   This cobblestoned town in Provence, where people still remember
what Victor Hugo had for lunch on a stagecoach stop, is where
Claude Berry made two films about peasants from the pages of Marcel
Pagnol.
   But the sort of taciturn, hardscrabble peasants portrayed in
``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon des Sources'' are already history.
   ``Of the thousand or so residents in Cuges, two, maybe three
peasants remain,'' says Vice Mayor Giles Aicardi, who defines a
peasant as one who survives only by what he grows and sells.
   Cuges reflects a crisis in Western Europe, and especially
France. There is too much food. And big producers, who track their
subsidies on computers, are pushing small farms out of existence.
   Seven percent of French workers are farmers, three times the
level of West Germany or Britain. But more than half are over 50.
And 50 percent of that group has no heirs expected to stay on the
land.
   The problem is partly social. Spurred by television, with good
roads into town, many young Frenchmen reject country life. It is a
matter of keeping them down on the farm after they've seen Paris.
   But few of those who want to stay have the choice.
   ``My kids are not in this business,'' says Yves Cornille, 50,
one of Cuges' last peasants. ``That was my decision. It is a
wonderful life, independent, not too hard. You just can't survive.''
   Cornille, with pressed slacks and a new Renault, is no Pagnol
peasant. ``Oh, life has changed since then,'' he laughs.
   ``Once you could make it with 250 acres'' he says. ``Now you
need 2,500. If I were 25 or 30, I'd quit tomorrow.''
   Many, like Cornille, fault the European Economic Community for
opening borders among its 12 members and applying complex subsidies
and quotas. In 1992, borders are to open yet wider.
   The Common Market, set up first for iron and steel, threatens to
collapse over beef and butter. Two-thirds of its budget goes to
subsidize or store food and wine, much of which goes to waste.
   European governments reject American urgings to end farm
subsidies, citing a duty to preserve ways of life dating back 2,000
years. But they also discourage production they cannot sell.
   Cornille grows wine grapes, more lucrative than food crops.
Modern farmers stick with a single crop, or just a few. Their
wives, instead of churning butter or putting up jam, look for jobs.
   At the O.K. Corral, a version of Le Far West done with ample
poetic license, a son of peasants swaggered down a dusty street.
Asked his name, he replied in Maurice-Chevalier English, ``Bronco.''
   Far to the west, the town of Ampus plans to use 500 acres of
farmland for a space research center and country club, with
laboratories and an old-style bistro set inside giant golf balls.
   ``Like so many places, we can no longer live by agriculture,''
says Mayor Roger Casanova, a geology professor in Nice, an hour
away. ``We must find other ways to make our community viable.''
   Casanova has found Norwegian-Lebanese interests to invest part
of the $40 million needed for a 27-hole golf course around a
futuristic campus, designed to attract a range of thinkers.
   Young people will learn the techniques of space research,
aeronautics, advanced computer sciences and environmental science,
he says. ``Half the town thinks I'm loony,'' he says.
   Rene Aicard, 32, is sticking to farming. He squeaks by on his
150 acres, raising strawberries, potatoes, lettuce and rapeseed for
oil. His wife, Denise, hauls it to market in a battered little van.
   ``It's so sad,'' says Denise, shaking her head. ``Farming is the
most beautiful profession in the world, and you work the hardest.
But it just doesn't pay anymore.''
   In Paris, Yves Van Haecke, chief adviser to the Ministry of
Agriculture, acknowledged that the government had an uphill fight
to encourage young people to hold onto family farms.
   ``The drop has become dramatic in the last 10 years,'' he says.
``Farms disappear now at a rate of 3 percent a year, and the rate
is increasing. No question, they're on their way out.''
   As small farms go, hundreds of rural communities alter their
centuries-old character.
   Ampus is not changing fast. The cubbyhole newspaper-dry goods
store displays a tattered advertising poster on the door:
``Canadian Rat Poison. Their Last Supper.''
   A clutch of old men in cloth caps by the fountain seem not to
have moved since the last king clattered by in a carriage.
   In Cuges, on a wide road to Marseille, stylish hairdressers and
shops full of electronic gadgets have replaced blacksmiths and
cracker-barrel grocers.
   ``There is plenty of the closed peasant mentality left,'' says
Andree Chikitou, who decided against putting up a sign in her
restaurant saying, ``The Jean de Florette cast ate here.''
   With only three years in residence, she found parking tickets on
her car if she left it on the little plaza outside. Hometown people
parked with impunity.
   Still, she says, it was better than the last small French town
she lived in. She recalls:
   ``One day the butcher woman said, `Well, you've been here 10
years, you sort of belong. I'll tell you what happened this
morning.'''
   But Martin Santoro, the aging town priest who played the priest
in the films, sees Pagnol's France as having evaporated. ``They're
not interested in that way any more,'' he says. ``Kids are
leaving.''
   Berry wanted to film around Pagnol's hometown of Aubagne, but he
found that to be a semi-urban sprawl.
   Outdoor scenes were no problem. He located an old farm in the
hilltop municipality and commune of Riboud, which has a restaurant,
a post office, a town hall and a total population of five.
   The village scenes for ``Manon des Sources'' were not so easy.
   Finally Berry settled on Mirabeau, farther north in the
Vaucluse. But he had to pay the town to put off installing parking
meters and painting white lines around the fountain that gave no
water..

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In an affluent town on the Connecticut River, a
new subdivision features antique homes that have been dismantled,
rebuilt, and equipped with today's conveniences, such as burglar
alarms and air conditioning. The price tag: $800,000 to $1.2
million.

   An 18th century tavern with trees sprouting
through the floorboards seemed destined to be razed in a
firefighting drill until it was rescued by a couple of Connecticut
developers who look to the past to find fancy homes for the future.
   Now it will be restored, with modern conveniences added, and
become one of the dozen or so antique homes in an unusual 33-acre
subdivision in this affluent town on the Connecticut River.
   Developers Harry P. Broom Jr. and William Oberg are scouring the
countryside for other vintage homes for the subdivision they call
Sterling Meadows. The homes, when finished, will carry a modern
price tag of $800,000 to $1.2 million. Broom and Oberg say they
haven't tried to sell any yet.
   The former owner of the old tavern, they said, sold it to them
rather than to the Salem fire department, which was going to burn
it down for a firefighting drill.
   ``The problem is most old houses are accidents of geography,''
says Oberg, 32, of Essex, who left a career in finance more than
two years ago to become a developer.
   ``What used to be a convenient location on the main road is now
a busy commercial district with a lot of traffic going by and they
end up being torn down for a new office building, a new apartment
building or one thing or another.''
   Oberg says the partnership has purchased five buildings for its
subdivision and is still looking for others to fill the seven other
lots. Four buildings are now being reconstructed at the site. A
concrete foundation is ready for a federal-style home from
Massachusetts that dates to around 1800.
   They expect to complete the development in about three years.
   The first step is saving the buildings, a painstaking task. The
partnership has paid $5,000 to $20,000 for the relics and spends
five to six weeks dismantling them.
   With a crew of carpenters supplied by Broom's other business,
H.B. Broom Housewright Inc., a restoration company, nearly
everything is saved from frame and windows to mantels and
floorboards.
   Broom and Oberg remain true to each building's original design _
which means, for example, rebuilding six fireplaces in the former
Salem tavern _ but the structures are outfitted with modern
conveniences such as burglar alarm systems and central air
conditioning.
   ``When we rebuild these houses, we're using all the original
features and restoring the house as best we can, but we're not
building museums,'' says Broom, 44, of Lyme, whose office is in a
building built in 1770 to serve as a general store for steamships
on the Connecticut River and the ferry that to this day shuttles
between Chester and Hadlyme.
   ``We're building houses that are practical to live in.''
   The interiors are slightly modified with ells to accommodate the
modern trappings of kitchens and bathrooms. Otherwise the homes are
original, right down to the slightly off-center front doors on some.
   They plan to pave the winding road leading to the development
and line it with sugar maples, stone walls and picket fences.
Antique lampposts will be re-created, based on a design borrowed
from Deerfield, Mass.
   ``We're trying to create the perfect New England environment,''
Oberg says. ``We try not to change the details at all and take
small liberties with the ells.''
   Oberg is quick to dispel notions that the developers are trying
to imitate Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts or Williamsburg in
Connecticut. He says they confine their efforts to homes built
between 1700 and 1815 and lean toward those in formal styles, such
as federal or Georgian.
   Similar but smaller subdivisions of five relocated historic
homes each are located in rural Killingworth, Conn., and in
Waitsfield, Vt.
   Oberg criticizes the so-called ``purist'' approach to
restoration, which is light on modern conveniences and heavy on
dark interior colors.
   ``The result when a so-called purist restores a house is that
the houses tend to be dark and use dark colors and that is not
quite what everybody would like,'' he says.
   The Sterling Meadows development has met the approval of town
officials, who are committed to 2- and 3-acre zoning in order to
preserve the town's atmosphere.
   About 1,910 people live in Lyme's 33 square miles. Homeowners
include former New York City Mayor John Lindsay and Brooklyn, N.Y.,
District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman.
   ``If you're gonna have development of that nature, you could do
no better than Skip Broom,'' says Lyme First Selectman John F.
Yeomans, referring to Broom by his nickname. ``They're as good as
any and better than most.''
   Oberg and Broom formed their partnership 2{ years ago after
Oberg bought a tract of land alongside a 12-acre parcel Broom
already owned. Oberg says he has had a lifelong interest in antique
homes while Broom quit a job as an analyst with Shell Oil Co. about
15 years ago to start his restoration business.
   ``I had a piece of land I bought as a investment and I always
wanted to put antique houses on it,'' says Broom, whose company has
restored about 80 homes. ``Oddly enough, he wanted to do the same
thing.''

   British classical actor Patrick Stewart
credits Shakespeare with putting him on the bridge of the Starship
Enterprise.
   A year ago, Stewart, who stars as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on
``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' was more familiar with Richard
III and Paduans than Mr. Spock and Klingons. ``Beam me up,
Scotty,'' was virtually a mystery.
   ``The role has made me part of the `Star Trek' legend, and it's
because of the actor's adage that you never know who's out there,''
he says.
   A friend asked Stewart to read some dramatic extracts at a
literary lecture at UCLA, and in the audience was Robert Justman,
who had been a producer of the original ``Star Trek'' television
series and was casting Paramount Television's new syndicated series.
   ``Allegedly, he turned to his wife and said, `We have just found
our captain,''' Stewart says. ``Well, it took six months before I
got the role. I went back to London and was hoping to take a
revival of `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' into the West End. If I
had, I wouldn't be here today. I returned to Los Angeles to read
and got an offer.
   ``It surprised me more than any other offer I've had. I thought
it unusual for an English actor to be involved in an American TV
series. Certainly one with a large cult-like following like `Star
Trek.'''
   Stewart was vaguely familiar with ``Star Trek.'' He sometimes
watched it with his children between matinee and evening
performances at the Royal Shakespeare Theater.
   The new ``Star Trek'' series, launched last September, blasted
into orbit in the ratings. It's the third-highest rated syndicated
show, behind ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy.'' The original
series, which ran three years on NBC in the 1960s, is frequently
the highest-rated off-network syndicated show. The four ``Star
Trek'' movies have taken in nearly $350 million. Nearly four
million videocassettes of the series episodes and the movies have
been sold.
   Stewart says it took some time for him to realize that by being
cast in the show he had become ``an American icon.''
   ``I was unaware of the huge, huge audience waiting for this
show,'' he says. ``So, I didn't share the apprehension some had.''
   On a recent visit to a television festival in Cannes, France, he
learned the show's power. ``I was entirely unknown in the city,''
he says. ``But one night I went with many others to visit the
American aircraft carrier Eisenhower. I was immediately recognized
by a young officer. I was soon surrounded by crewmen. They had all
seen the show in Virginia and their families sent them tapes. It
was an overwhelming experience.''
   Prior to ``Star Trek,'' Stewart was relatively unknown in this
country. He was in the movies ``Excalibur'' and ``Dune'' and the TV
miniseries ``I, Claudius.'' He played Karla, the head of the KGB in
the miniseries based on two John LeCarre novels, ``Smiley's
People'' and ``Tinker, Tailor, Spy.'' Most of his acting
experience, however, has been on the stage. He is particularly
associated with the Royal Shakespeare Co.
   He also teaches at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
   ``I was worried about this role because of the number of years
involved,'' he says. ``I've always moved around from role to role
and area to area. The fear was I wouldn't be able to do that. I'm
not sure I can focus my career on one thing for such a long time.''
   Stewart's wife, Sheila Falconer, is a choreographer who staged
``The Wizard of Oz'' in London. A son is a student at the
California Institute for the Arts. A daughter is in school in
England.
   He grew up in Yorkshire, in a town called Mirfield, which
supports 12 drama clubs with a population of 11,000.
   ``It was a typical mill town with weaving sheds in the bottom
and sheep on the hills,'' he says. ``When I was 12 I started
spending my evenings rehearsing and performing. Nobody thought it
unusual. It didn't become unusual until I turned professional.''
   After he was cast as the captain of the new Enterprise, a lot of
discussion went into how he should sound. He experimented with
various accents, finally settling on a standard English accent.
``We continue to have disagreements about how certain words are
pronounced,'' he says.
   ``I'm the director of a teaching group at Santa Barbara and I
frequently hear student actors say they should use a British accent
for Shakespeare. I point out that in Shakespeare's time the accent
was close to today's American accent.''

   More than any other American actress,
Colleen Dewhurst is associated with the plays of Eugene O'Neill.
   From Josie Hogan, the big-hearted farm woman in ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' to the sensual Abbie Putman in ``Desire Under the
Elms,'' to the murderous Christine Mannon in ``Mourning Becomes
Electra,'' she has left her mark on some of O'Neill's most
memorable characters.
   Now Broadway is getting a double dose of Dewhurst and O'Neill.
Dewhurst currently is appearing in two of O'Neill's best plays _
``Long Day's Journey into Night,'' considered his masterpiece, and
``Ah, Wilderness!,'' the author's only comedy, a gentle, genial
tale of innocence lost. The plays, which also star Jason Robards,
are running in repertory at the Neil Simon Theater as part of the
First New York International Festival of the Arts.
   ``I always say that I am not an O'Neill expert,'' the actress
explained recently before a performance here where the two Yale
Repertory Theater productions were polished before moving to New
York. ``I feel all I really know are his women.''
   And Dewhurst gets to play one of O'Neill's greatest in ``Long
Day's Journey into Night,'' the playwright's exorcism of his own
devastating family life. It is directed by another O'Neill master,
Jose Quintero. She stars as Mary Tyrone, a tragic, drug-addled
woman who was modeled after O'Neill's own mother.
   ``O'Neill's women have great passion, a passion for life,'' she
says. ``Nothing is done half-way. It's not little tiny things that
happen to them. These plays are not about the day you cracked up
the car and didn't know how to explain it.
   ``Literally, what these women do affects everything around them.
What they do cannot be taken back. It can't be erased or not
remembered. In each one of his plays, it changes life's course.''
   For Dewhurst, what changed her career and forever stamped her as
an O`Neill actress was the 1973 revival of ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' which also starred Robards and also was directed by
Quintero. It was a production that almost didn't happen.
   ``We were all busted,'' she recalls. ``Jason had just come out
of an auto accident. I had no money, and Jose had just risen up
sober. Someone said, `Put something together and go out and do
summer stock,' thinking we would do a comedy.''
   Quintero suggested ``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' a play he and
Dewhurst first did 15 years earlier at the Spoleto Festival in
Italy.
   The only producer who would take them was Marshall Migatz who
ran a small summer theater at a Catholic girls' college in Lake
Forest, Ill. Just before the contracts were signed, Migatz was
struck by a car and killed.
   ``It was on the point of being canceled, but his board came
forward and said they would pay us if we would go into rehearsal,''
Dewhurst said.
   The result was the most memorable O'Neill production of the
decade.
   When the play came to Broadway the following December, it was
cheered by critics and audiences. And Dewhurst won a best-actress
Tony for her portrait of Josie Hogan.
   ``I said at the time that I wasn't going to do any more
O`Neill,'' she says. Dewhurst didn't want to be labeled as an
actress who only did O'Neill plays.
   ``Compounding it was my doing `My Gene,''' she says, referring
to her one-woman show, written by Barbara Gelb, about the life of
Carlotta Monterey, O'Neill's exotic wife. ``I thought, `Well, that
covers them all. What more can I do?'''
   The idea for these latest productions was born 10 years ago,
when a group of actors, writers and producers got together at Monte
Cristo Cottage, O'Neill's boyhood home in New London, Conn. The
actors, including Dewhurst, Robards and Geraldine Fitzgerald, read
excerpts from O'Neill plays. It was agreed to mount a production of
``Long Day's Journey into Night'' in 1988, the 100th anniversary of
O'Neill's birth.
   ``My mentality is that I'm lucky if I know what I'm doing
tomorrow,'' Dewhurst laughs. ``So forget 10 years from now. But it
came.''
   It was Quintero _ again _ who had the idea of alternating
performances of ``Long Day's Journey'' and ``Ah, Wilderness!''
   ``We were going to show the two sides of O'Neill, the dream
family and the real family,'' Dewhurst says. ``The way to view the
plays is to see `Long Day's Journey' first and `Ah, Wilderness!'
second. Then you understand the second play. Although it's a comedy
and sweet and beautifully written, it is given an added depth and
becomes very touching.''
   For Dewhurst, the two O`Neill plays are only part of her
professional life. She also is president of Actors Equity, the
actors union. It's a job she has held since 1985 and now is running
unopposed for re-election.
   Ellen Burstyn, a former president, had talked her into running
for the Actors Equity council. When Burstyn left the presidency,
she persuaded Dewhurst to run for the top office.
   ``I really have a great affection for actors as a group,''
Dewhurst says. ``I find them very courageous. It's a profession of
rejection.''
   Dewhurst embraced the union job like she did acting on stage _
wholeheartedly.
   ``I'm not an office person and yet I didn't want to be a
figurehead,'' says the woman who also serves on countless other
boards and committees including the Actors Fund of America and Save
the Theaters, which works for the preservation of Broadway
playhouses.
   Dewhurst has been able to separate her numerous jobs, even when
she is doing a play as difficult, dark and demanding as ``Long
Day's Journey into Night.''
   ``I have no feeling about dragging shows behind me like
chains,'' Dewhurst says. ``If a heavy show goes well, you come off
stage feeling terrific. I do. I've gotten rid of all the horrors
that are around for the day, the week, the year, the life. They
have just been dropped out there. They're now the audience's.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: Laughing Joe Piscopo Is Riding High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Piscopo's beginnings on the comedy trail
may well have started when his father took him to see Jerry Lewis
in ``The Nutty Professor'' at a New Jersey movie house.
   ``I remember the theater, the seat, everything,'' he says.
``Boy, I just thought that it was the greatest movie ever made. It
may very well have been; I still feel that way when I watch it on
videotape.
   ``I remember me and my dad and my brother watching the movie and
seeing Jerry go into his character which I'm sure influenced me in
later comedy years,'' said Piscopo as he did a Lewis imitation.
   ``Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Jerry directed that, too.''
   Twenty-five years later, Piscopo is riding high: television
specials, concerts (``The Momentary Madness Tour''), a book (``The
Piscopo Tapes''), constant exposure on commercials (Miller Lite)
and movies.
   The latest is ``Dead Heat,'' in which he and Treat Williams do
battle with a gang of thugs who won't die. You might think that the
intense Williams and the loose Piscopo would make an incongruous
couple both on and off the screen.
   ``Treat was great,'' the comedian said. ``Treat's got as sick a
sense of humor as I do, and it was wild. Between takes and
everything, we had a great time. Treat worked very hard on this
film; he had a lot of makeup he had to get in _ eight hours of
makeup for certain scenes.
   ``For some reason we both did silly things _ like Jerry Lewis
impressions throughout the movie. When we got punchy, we started
doing Jerry back and forth; it kept us going. It's very important
to be on the same wave length on a picture like this.''
   ``Dead Heat'' has had a lukewarm reception from both critics and
audiences, and it appears that Piscopo hasn't quite found himself
in films. Oddly, his first three roles have been crime-oriented: a
wacky hit man in the gangster spoof, ``Johnny Dangerously'' which
starred Michael Keaton; a mob errand boy with Danny DeVito ``Wise
Guys.'' Neither lighted up the box-office charts.
   Piscopo observed that graduates of ``Saturday Night Live''
follow two courses in their film careers: they either arrive with a
bang such as the late John Belushi and comedian Eddie Murphy; or,
they have a slow buildup to the top such as Dan Aykroyd and Chevy
Chase. Piscopo figures he's in the latter category.
   The Piscopo story began 36 years ago in Passaic, N.J., where his
father was a lawyer. The comic majored in surfing throughout much
of his school life, but managed to earn a degree in broadcasting at
Jones College in Jacksonville, Fla. He worked as a disc jockey and
dinner theater actor, but his comedy career really began when he
started performing at the Improvisation in New York.
   The ``Saturday Night Live'' producers liked his stuff and signed
him in 1980.
   ``It was pretty devastating,'' Piscopo recalled. ``I had been
doing very well at the Improv and with television commercials. On
`Saturday Night Live' we had to replace Bill Murray and Danny
Aykroyd and Gilda Radner, and it was an impossible task. The show
in its first year was an abomination, real bad.
   ``Then it started to get exciting, when I realized we were doing
stuff that was good as ever.''
   The turning point may have come at a cast meeting when a
producer with spray paint emblazoned ``Danger'' on a blank wall.
Piscopo followed the instruction, stretching his own talent, and
sometimes good taste, to the utmost.
   He has portrayed so many characters that you wonder if the real
Joe Piscopo will ever stand out. He admitted that such portrayals
may constitute a device: ``Not liking one's self, being insecure.
It's true. I feel the most comfortable doing characters, like in
the beer commercials.
   ``I liked `Dead Heat' because I was myself for the first time,''
he said. ``And I found myself feeling feeling comfortable. Lately
I've been working out and staying physically fit, and I feel more
confidence with myself.''
   Seeing him portray the late martial arts king Bruce Lee in the
commercials, you might think he's wearing a body suit. Those
muscles are all Piscopo's.
   ``A lot of people thought I was wearing prosthetics,'' he said.
``I've been working for 2{ years. I do it for my head. The muscles
are a residual result.
   ``I want to do it for three or four more years, and then I'll
just be one of those guys who swims every day.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ```Crocodile' Dundee II''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ```Crocodile' Dundee II'' is that rare bird: a sequel that
excels the original. Mind you, the new film will not have the
impact of ```Crocodile' Dundee I,'' which introduced us to one of
the great character creations of film history.
   Paul Hogan's Mick Dundee was a masterpiece, more credible than
Indiana Jones, more charming than James Bond, funnier than Rambo.
   The second coming of Dundee finds him shacked up with Sue
Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) in a New York penthouse, enjoying his
leisure. Not for long. Before he is murdered in Colombia, Sue's
former husband (Dennis Boutsikaris) sends her photographs
incriminating a drug baron (Hechter Ubarry). The powerful dopester
and his vicious lieutenant (Juan Fernandez) kidnap Sue and attempt
to recover the photos.
   Dundee to the rescue, accompanied by various street types. The
siege of the Colombian's New York castle is Capra corn of the best
vintage.
   To escape their pursuers, Dundee and Sue flee to his homeland
enjoying a reunion with his pub pals. The hoods follow, of course,
kidnaping bumbling Walter Reilly (John Meillon) and gathering some
local toughs to track down Mick and Sue. But the villains are no
match for the wilderness-wise Dundee.
   Only in the latter stages does the filmmakers' imagination
falter. Our hero's devices seem a bit labored, especially in the
assault of the bats.
   Paul Hogan remains true to the ``Crocodile'' image, which is
expectable since he wrote the script with his son, Brett. Happily
they reversed the locales, and the New York portion comes first,
Australia last. In the first movie, the Australian sequences were
far more interesting than the familiar plot of a hick in the big
city.
   Hogan's longtime partner, John Cornell, directed ```Crocodile'
Dundee II'' and produced with Jane Scott. He draws good
performances from the cast, especially the heavies Ubarry and
Fernandez, who are delightfully evil, and Meillon, a kind of down
under Smiley Burnette.
   Kozlowski has little to do but be supportive and frightened, and
she does both with great skill.
   It is both sorrowful and heartening to learn that Hogan plans to
retire Dundee forever. He will be sorely missed. But do we really
need to see ```Crocodile' Dundee Goes to Las Vegas,'' etc.?
   The Paramount release is rated PG, with not much content that
would harm children. Running time: 111 minutes.

   Academy Award-winning actress Jane Fonda
cornered the home exercise market six years ago with the video
version of her best-selling book, ``Jane Fonda's Workout.'' As of
January, it has made $37.8 million.
   She has seven other exercise videos out, four in the Top 10
selling videocassettes, according to Billboard magazine. All are
released by Lorimar Home Video and have turned flab into fat city
for Fonda and friends.
   Fonda may be the home video exercise empress, but she's not the
only game in town.
   Also in the top selling exercise videos are MCA's
``Callanetics,'' Fox Hills' ``Kathy Smith's Winning Workout'' and
``Kathy Smith's Starting Workout,'' and JCI's ``Kathy Smith's
Ultimate Video Workout.''
   And ``The MS Workout,'' a new video produced by the New York
chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society features
exercises for people with multiple sclerosis and other neurological
problems.
   Led by dancer Wendy Amos and featuring MS victims including
Jimmie Heuga, the video is divided into three sections: a warm-up
of slow neck, back, leg and arm stretches; easy calisthenics; a
slow cool-down to relax the body.
   Some of the participants sit on chairs or stools while they
exercise. A ballet barre is handy for extra support.
   ``The program was designed with the assistance of an advisory
committee which was eager to see to it that the video was sensitive
to the broad spectrum of needs of ambulatory persons with MS and
other neurological diseases, and they selected exercises that
contribute to the improvement of balance and coordination,'' said
Carol Kurzig, executive director of the New York chapter.
   MS is a chronic, often crippling disease of the central nervous
system. Its symptoms can include numbness, sexual dysfunction,
difficulty with coordination, loss of balance and weakness.
   ``The MS Workout'' cost $15 and can be ordered from the New York
MS chapter.
   Fonda exercise tapes are available in most video retail outlets.
According to Lorimar they include ``Start Up With Jane Fonda,''
which was released in March and has sold 781,659 copies; ``Jane
Fonda's Low Impact Aerobic Workout,'' with $23.3 million in sales;
``Jane Fonda's New Workout,'' with $25.2 million in sales; ``Jane
Fonda's Easy Going Workout,'' $11.1 in sales; and ``Jane Fonda's
Workout With Weights,'' ``Jane Fonda's Pregnancy, Birth and
Recovery'' and ``Jane Fonda's Workout Challenge.''

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``The
Principal.''
   
   ``Fatal Attraction'' (Paramount Home Video; VHS, $89.95; Beat,
$29.95; Rated R)
   
   Consummate yuppie Dan Gallagher has it all: beautiful wife,
adorable daughter, upward mobility, Volvo station wagon. He's not
looking for a one-night stand, but when it presents itself in the
person of sultry publishing exec Alex Forrest, he can't resist.
   How could he know that under those tousled blond locks and
Maybelline eyes lurks the collective anger, frustration and
vengeance of every woman who has ever been done and dumped? Tsk,
tsk, Dan. Should've kept your pants on.
   Played with schizophrenic aplomb by Glenn Close, Alex answers
Dan's rejection with a series of cruel, creepy antics designed to
make your teeth hurt right up to the last second.
   Michael Douglas' Dan elicits little sympathy; there's a distinct
feeling he deserves some of what he's getting. Anne Archer as Dan's
wife is so sweetly unknowing that the audience actually ends up
feeling guilty on behalf of her adulterous, egocentric cad of a
husband.
   Director Adrian ``Flashdance'' Lyne knows how to create and
build tension: no surprise that this slick production was last
year's second-highest grossing movie.
   As the ``R'' rating indicates, there's a little too much sex,
flesh and violence for the kiddies. Otherwise, ``Fatal Attraction''
is a peach of a psychological thriller that could make even the
most dedicated couch potato squirm.

   ``The Principal'' (RCA@Columbia Home Video; VHS@Beta, $89.95;
Rated R)
   
   In ``The Principal,'' James Belushi plays a Rambo-like high
school teacher who drinks too much, smashes Porsches with baseball
bats and generally ticks off his bosses at the stuffy old board of
education.
   Instead of firing him, they decide to ``reward'' him with a
principalship. Trouble is, it's at Brandel High School, the
low-down dirtiest, most crime-infested, drug-ridden school on the
planet.
   The film misses no opportunity for gratuitous violence. The kids
don't just taunt or ignore him _ they beat him to a bloody pulp.
The teachers are assaulted. And in finest spaghetti Western
fashion, Belushi, riding his motorcycle into the very halls of
Brandel, is going to tame this here school, pard-ner.
   There is a climactic chase scene and showdown in the girl's
shower _ this film's ludicrous version of the OK Corral.
   Even a graduate of Brandel could predict the outcome of this
absurd, boring, exploitative movie.
   And even a better actor than Belushi could have done little with
such pea-brained dialogue as this sample when he tries to inspire
downtrodden teachers:
   ``Aw, come on, you people,'' says he, his voice rising
Patton-like. ``You can't pick and choose your students.''
   The film also features Louis Gossett, Jr., muttering
unintelligible cynicisms as the school's security guard.
   Tough schools lately seem to have caught Hollywood's fancy.
Unfortunately, it is only the rare film, such as the excellent
``Stand and Deliver,'' that manages not to succumb to sexploitation
or racist, blackboard jungle caricatures.
   ``The Principal,'' rated ``R,'' contains the foul,
street-language you'd expect in a film such as this. But not to
worry. The rest of the dialogue will probably put you to sleep.

   ``Jacknifed'' (Columbia) _ Jean Beauvoir
   
   In his 26 years, Jean Beauvoir has packed wildly diverse
experiences onto his musical resume, including stints with the
doo-wop Flamingoes, shock punkers Plasmatics and Little Steven's
political Disciples of Soul.
   Even Beauvoir's appearance paints him as a musical maverick with
the wild, white Mohawk he's sported for many years.
   This personal history hardly prepares a listener for the musical
conservatism of ``Jacknifed,'' Beauvoir's second solo album.
   ``Jacknifed'' is a soulful contemporary dance album, probably
the first to be influenced by the success of Terence Trent D'Arby.
The keyboards and guitars simmer but don't sizzle, leaving room for
Beauvoir's songs to stretch and breathe.
   Both lyrically and musically, Beauvoir has the smarts to avoid
tired cliches. He also avoids anything distinctive that will get
his songs noticed. ``Jacknifed'' is the type of record that would
float by on the radio without causing any real reaction.
   Many of the songs, such as ``Standing on My Own Two Feet'' and
``Find My Way Home'' tread familiar themes of a solitary man trying
to find his way in a hostile world.
   Beauvoir, who wrote and produced the album along with playing
most of the instruments, has obvious talent. He's still looking for
the best way to show the world.

   ``The Story of the Clash, Vol. 1'' (Epic) _ The Clash
   
   They once advertised themselves as ``the only band that
matters.'' One member of the group was fired for political reasons.
The band's first hit single wasn't even listed on the cover of the
``London Calling'' album.
   Who are the Clash?
   This once-important band dropped so quickly from the public
consciousness it almost seems like they've become a trivia
question. The time is ripe for a retrospective, and Epic Records
has obliged with the two-record ``The Story of the Clash, Vol. 1.''
   Liking or hating the Clash during their brief prime in the late
1970s and early '80s was almost a political statement in itself.
Punk rock set up two hostile camps, one that loved the brash young
toughs challenging the musical establishment, the other threatened
by them. The band's aggressive working-class politics also left
little room for neutrality.
   This often obscured the simple fact the Clash was a terrific
rock band, one that quickly grew past the limitations of primitive
punk but never lost the creative spark that went with it.
   The retrospective, while put together rather haphazardly, makes
that point abundantly clear.
   The set cuts a wide swath through the glorious trash rock of
``Should I Stay or Should I Go,'' the Motown tribute ``Train in
Vain,'' the mainstream rock crunch of ``London Calling,'' the
inspirational near ballad ``Stay Free'' and the adrenalin kick of
``Janie Jones.''
   Oddly, the record only includes two cuts from the sprawling
three-record ``Sandinista.'' Cuts such as the title track or
``Charlie Don't Surf'' would have been better than the subpar
``Straight to Hell'' included here from ``Combat Rock.''
   The record doesn't run chronologically. Side 3 is a tribute to
the Clash's infancy and side one sounds like a prototype for Mick
Jones' subsequent Big Audio Dynamite group, but the sequencing
often seems random. If not, it would have been preferable to hear
the band explain it through retrospective liner notes, instead of
the rambling reminiscence of a roadie included here.
   Still, this is an illuminating trip through a time capsule and
would make an especially worthy purchase for those who missed the
Clash the first time around.

   Growing up in Washington in the 1920s, Laughlin
Phillips had the paintings of Pierre Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas,
Claude Monet, Paul Cezanne and many more for company.
   ``My father so much wanted other people to enjoy them that
already in 1921, three years before I was born, he opened two rooms
to the public,'' Phillips recalled.
   ``That was how our house became the first museum of modern art
in America.''
   The Phillips Collection is still on public display in the home
his parents owned on 21st Street near Dupont Circle until it got so
big that they had to leave their art work and move.
   The outstanding assembly of mostly late 19th century and 20th
century paintings was acquired by Duncan Phillips, who inherited
wealth from banking and steel, and his wife Marjorie, who was a
well-known landscape and still-life painter.
   Their son, Laughlin, 63, a tall, quiet-spoken retired diplomat,
is director of the collection, which now belongs to a foundation.
   Seventy-six of the 2,000 paintings are at London's Hayward
Gallery through Aug. 14, and then go to Frankfurt and Madrid in the
collection's first European show after having exhibitions in
Australia and Japan.
   The highlight is Renoir's large, colorful ``The Luncheon of the
Boating Party,'' painted in 1881 after a good lunch at a river
restaurant, with convivial chatter and pretty women.
   ``It's Renoir's masterpiece, the finest thing he ever did,''
said exhibition organizer Catherine Lampert, a Washingtonian who
now lives in London. She was about 2 years old when her father
first took her to see the Phillips Collection.
   The dazzling London show starts with El Greco in the 16th
century and ends with modern abstracts by Sean Scully, Frank Stella
and John Walker.
   There are van Goghs, a ``Blue Period'' Pablo Picasso and works
by Pierre Bonnard, Edward Hopper, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee,
Amedeo Modigliani, Piet Mondrian and Winslow Homer.
   The trustees still acquire pictures but focus mainly on
conservation, improving the museum buildings and education, helped
by exhibition fees.
   Phillips said his father became interested in art at college.
   ``He wrote about the history of art and tried to interpret what
artists say on their canvases. He gave that up later, I think
because of the difficulty of talking about abstract art,'' Phillips
said.
   They would bring new paintings home to ``test'' them, and would
send them back if they decided against them, he recalled. If they
decided against them, they would go back to the dealers.
   ``My parents had remarkable taste and discernment and my father
didn't follow any fashion and often paid just a few hundred dollars
for a painting.''
   Artists visited the family. Phillips remembers meeting the
photographer Alfred Stieglitz, ``a fierce-looking man with hair
growing from his ears and huge eyebrows and steel glasses. He
expanded my father's taste.''
   Duncan Phillips' taste shifted and evolved, but he was
particularly fond of one painting now at the London show _ Honore
Daumier's ``The Uprising,'' showing a young man, arm outflung in a
crowd.
   It may have been inspired by the 1848 revolution in Paris.
Phillips said his father ``saw it as a symbol of man's aspirations
and discontent.''
   ``My father didn't have great wealth, but he felt he had
inherited a lot and was going to give it back through his museum.''
   His father also painted for a while.
   ``He went into rages when he couldn't get the color mix he could
see in his mind. He put oil paints on top of each other and they
turned to mud,'' he recalled.
   ``Dad would take mother to baseball, to the Washington Senators
_ he watched and she sketched. One of her famous paintings is of a
baseball game.''
   Phillips said likes the way the Hayward has blended American and
French pictures.
   ``My father loved that,'' he said. ``He said there should be no
national boundaries in art. Art was independent of nationality.
Artists were kindred spirits who spoke to each other, not only
across national boundaries but from century to century.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Brian Setzer Wants His Fans Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brian Setzer is sure people will like his new
record. But he's not sure how many will hear it.
   Setzer was the guitarist for the Stray Cats, a rockabilly trio
that had a number of hits in the early part of the decade. But his
first solo album, ``This Knife Feels Like Justice,'' released in
1986, sold poorly despite good reviews.
   ``It would have been a platinum album for someone else,'' Setzer
said. ``I was really trying to get way from being a Stray Cat. I
don't think I left enough of me in there.''
   With the release of ``Live Nude Guitars,'' Setzer is hoping to
win back some old fans and make some new ones.
   ``I don't think I've found my own audience yet,'' he said. ``I
think I've got to play on the road a lot and develop. I'm going to
get some crossover people who are just fans of the Stray Cats and
kids who are curious.
   ``I think this new record is really focusing in on who I am. If
I just get out there and play and show them a great show, I'll get
a following.''
   Chris Thomas, known for his work with the Pretenders and the Sex
Pistols, and Dave Stewart of Eurythmics each produced songs on the
album. Fans of such Pretenders songs as ``Brass in Pocket'' and
``Talk of the Town'' will recognize the guitar sound on ``Every
Tear That Falls.''
   ``It is very `Pretendersy,''' said Setzer. ``He (Thomas) layers
on guitars after guitars and gets a big sound out of it.''
   ``Every Tear That Falls'' was written with the Everly Brothers
in mind but Setzer decided to record it himself.
   ``I kind of had this riff and I thought, `Oh boy, wouldn't it be
great to write this song for the Everly Brothers, that kind of
harmony thing,''' Setzer said. ``I know (Paul) McCartney wrote one
(`Wings of a Nightingale') for them. So I came up with this but I
liked it so much I kept it.''
   Stewart produced ``Rockability,'' Setzer's favorite song on the
album.
   ``It's sort of a year-2000 rockabilly song,'' Setzer said. ``I
want to make a `pyschobilly' album with lots of echo and
distortion.''
   Setzer was happy with both Thomas and Stewart, although he found
their styles very different.
   ``Working with Dave Stewart is instant,'' Setzer said. ``He
hears something he likes, knows it's good and just cuts it and it's
done. Working with Chris Thomas takes a long time but the end
result is equally as pleasing.
   ``I like working with both of them but I'm doing the next record
with Dave Stewart.''
   Stewart also produced ``The Rain Washed Everything Away,'' a big
ballad in the tradition of Gene Pitney or the Righteous Brothers.
The song was co-written by Stewart and Setzer at Stewart's house.
   ``Dave says, `Let's write one of those ballads. Let's go out on
the porch, that will give us a title,''' Setzer said. ``We get out
on the porch and he says, `Oh, it's a beautiful night,' and I say,
`Yeah, the rain washed everything away,' and he says, `There's the
title.'
   ``The Righteous Brothers would clean this up.''
   Although the 28-year-old Setzer was born after the first wave of
rock 'n' roll hit in the 1950s, he has always preferred the music
of that period.
   ``When I was going to high school, even though it was the '70s,
it was still the leftover of the '60s. It was hippie; the flower
thing,'' Setzer recalled. ``I never connected with it. I had long
hair but when I was about 15, I just cut it all off.
   ``I wanted to look like Eddie Cochran rather than Jim Morrison.''
   Setzer still idolizes Cochran, who was killed in a car crash in
1960: ``Everything about Eddie spoke rock 'n' roll to me.''
   He covers a Cochran hit, ``Nervous Breakdown,'' on the new album
and portrayed him last year in the hit movie, ``La Bamba,'' the
story of Ritchie Valens, another early rock star who died in a
plane crash in 1959 with Buddy Holly and J.P. ``Big Bopper''
Richardson.
   ``I got a good feeling like I was the only one who could do
it,'' Setzer said. ``I was just me in the role.''
   But Setzer has no intentions of pursuing a film career.
   ``I don't enjoy acting. People strive their whole lives to be
actors. I don't think someone should fall into it,'' Setzer said.
``I liked playing my hero but I just don't feel I deserve to be an
actor.''
   Setzer wants to introduce a new generation to Cochran and other
rockers from the '50s.
   ``Most kids just turn on MTV (Music Television) and they see
what they like,'' he said. ``Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Buddy
Holly, they're not around any more. That's why I'm here. Those
people can't speak to those kids. I have to.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Eclectic Margaret Atwood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Writer Margaret Atwood's interests range far and
wide, from history to Siamese twins to former TV evangelists Jim
and Tammy Bakker.
   So extensive and eclectic is her knowledge that she can talk
about literature in the years following the American Revolution and
also tell you which states have the highest populations of
porcupines.
   Although best known for her highly acclaimed novel, ``The
Handmaid's Tale,'' Atwood first gained recognition for her poetry.
Her ``Selected Poems II: Poems Selected and New 1976-86'' has just
been released by Houghton Mifflin Paperbacks.
   There are poems about love and Siamese twins, and poems about
poets.
   ``There's a perception of their social role,'' she said about
her fellow poets. ``It wasn't always that way but now people think
you can't be a poet without being drunk. Women poets are expected
to commit suicide. Someone once asked me when, not if, I would
commit suicide.
   ``I prefer to live, thank you very much.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From ``The Words Continue Their Journey,'' a selection from
1984's ``Interlunar'':
   ``Do poets really suffer more
   ``than other people? Isn't it only
   ``that they get their pictures taken
   ``and are seen to do it?
   ``The loony bins are full of those
   ``who never wrote a poem.
   ``Most suicides are not
   ``poets: a good statistic.''

   Atwood was born in 1939 in Ottawa. Although one of her aunts
claims that she announced her intentions to become a writer at the
age of five, Atwood said she did not seriously begin writing until
she was 16.
   She was 19 when her first poem was accepted for publication. Her
first volume of poetry, ``Persephone,'' was published in 1961. In
1966, a collection of poems entitled ``The Circle Game'' won the
Governor General's Award as the year's best book of poetry. ``The
Circle Game'' sold 10,000 copies, a then unheard of total in Canada
for works of poetry.
   ``In 1960, in English Canada, there were five novels published.
You were doing very well to sell 1,000 novels,'' Atwood said.
``When my first poems were published, they told me they had
overprinted _ 450 copies instead of 400.''
   She has written several novels besides ``The Handmaid's Tale,''
including ``Surfacing,'' ``Lady Oracle'' and ``Life Before Man.''
She has released two collections of short stories, two children's
books and several works of criticism, notably 1972's ``Survival,''
an analysis of Canadian literature. She is currently completing a
new novel, ``Cat's Eye.''
   Atwood, who lives in Toronto, travels frequently and credits
this with helping her writing.
   ``Traveling takes me out of my environment,'' she said. ``It
gives me clear time. It's not the same as being in the office with
the phone ringing all day. It also gives me context for my own
country.''
   Some parts of the world are more conducive for her writing than
others. ``England in the winter is a great place to write. Hawaii
on the beach is not.''
   Atwood became more politically involved in the 1970s. Her work
displayed her interest in power _ how it works, how people use it,
how people react to it.
   In the poem ``Marrying the Hangman,'' from her 1978 collection,
``Two-Headed Poems,'' she tells the story of a woman who is
condemned to death by hanging for stealing her employer's clothes
and can only escape her fate by marrying the hangman:
   ``She has been condemned to death by hanging. A man may escape
this
   ``death by becoming the hangman, a woman by marrying the hangman.
   ``But at the present time there is no hangman; thus there is no
escape.
   ``There is only a death, indefinitely postponed. This is not
fantasy, it is history.''
   The poem is about the choices people must make when confronting
an unjust system.
   ``It depends on the circumstances. Sometimes you have no
options; other times you have more,'' she said. ``A woman
undergoing sexual harassment at work has more options than the
woman who must marry the hangman.
   ``In the best of all possible worlds, you wouldn't have to make
these choices, but it's not the best of all possible worlds.''
   While Atwood has been involved in a number of causes, her
greatest concern is the environment.
   ``Forests are being cut down. If the forests are all gone, we
will choke to death,'' she said. ``The ozone layer is being
destroyed. This stuff is scary for everybody.''
   Atwood is critical of American writers who fail to integrate the
political world into their work, although she cites E.L. Doctorow
and Marge Piercy as notable exceptions.
   ``In the United States, writing is an individual thing,'' she
said. ``It's the only country where people believe that. It's
natural for American writers _ a habit of mind.''
   However, she does see this changing.
   ``They live in a secure country. I predict, mark my words, as
the United States feels less secure, you'll see more integration in
the writing,'' she said.
   ``A young person who wanted to become a writer asked me for
suggestions on how to suffer,'' Atwood said. ``Everybody suffers.
You don't have to find ways to suffer. Just live, you'll suffer.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Mickey Gilley Reflects On `Urban Cowboy'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Mickey Gilley, whose earthy Texas
nightclub was the focus of the movie ``Urban Cowboy,'' hasn't set
foot in the honky-tonk for two years.
   And he hasn't regularly worn a cowboy hat for three years.
   Eight years after John Travolta and co-star Debra Winger
launched a fad known as ``cowboy chic,'' Gilley has broken the ties
that symbolized him as the country music singer most associated
with the craze.
   The 52-year-old performer is in litigation over the nightclub in
Pasadena, Texas, where most of the 1980 movie was filmed. He claims
an associate has let the cavernous club get run down.
   ``I drive by the club all the time, but I've not been in it for
two years,'' Gilley said in a telephone interview. ``The business
has practically died. The parking lot used to be full; now you can
count the cars. I think it's just a matter of time until it goes
under.''
   And his cowboy hat, part of the Western attire that became
fashionable because of the popularity of the movie, has seen its
last roundup.
   ``I've got hair; there's nothing to cover up,'' Gilley said. ``I
don't feel like a cowboy hat is something that's going to make or
break my career. People had fun with that era and I did too. People
wonder where's my hat, but I haven't worn one now for three years.
People just haven't seen me as much.''
   As one of the country music stars who sang in the movie, Gilley
shot to the top in show business on the tails of ``cowboy chic.''
   He appeared in ``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' ``The Fall Guy,''
``Hollywood Squares'' and ``Fantasy Island.''
   His concert fee rose from $5,000 to $25,000. One night he was
paid $50,000 for 90 minutes to perform at Billy Bob's nightclub in
Fort Worth, Texas, a club that has since closed as the fad tailed
off.
   Gilley had six straight No. 1 country hits in the early 1980s
when the movement peaked. His hits included ``Stand by Me,'' ``True
Love Ways'' and ``Don't the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing
Time.''
   Now, the era is a memory just like the mechanical bulls featured
in the movie.
   ``Everything has its day,'' he said, reflecting on the ``cowboy
chic'' heyday. ``Nothing lasts forever. People don't realize that
the `urban cowboy' fad had gone on in Texas for years and years.
   ``People had fun with it. When `Urban Cowboy' hit, it affected
the whole world. Travolta brought everything to front and center.
It was like a billboard going up.
   ``Had it not been for him playing that part, it would not have
had the impact. He had done `Saturday Night Fever,' and this was
`country night fever.' It was a different lifestyle, and it worked.
   ``Everyone became a cowboy or cowgirl. It was like when the
Beatles came over and everyone grew their hair long and shook their
heads. Everyone wanted to be part of what was happening. I'll
remember it forever.''
   In the movie, Travolta learned how to ride a mechanical bull at
the nightclub in order to win the favor of Winger, who was then a
relatively unknown actress.
   Today, Gilley is not sure the devices were such a good idea.
They were contraptions, ridden as one would a bull, whose gyrating
was controlled by an operator.
   ``It was a rodeo training device and should never have been put
in an entertainment establishment in the first place,'' Gilley
said. ``We still have suits pending over it.''
   Nevertheless, nightclubs such as Gilley's sprang up across the
country, many of them with mechanical bulls. Some were converted
discos and were patronized by customers in snappy cowboy hats,
shiny cowboy boots and stylish Western wear.
   ``I probably remember the impact on country attire the most,''
Gilley said. ``It was the first time you could walk into a casino
in Las Vegas or Reno or Lake Tahoe or Atlantic City and see guys in
cowboy hats. It changedthe mood. It had its flash in the pan.''
   Gilley, whose cousins are rock 'n' roll star Jerry Lee Lewis and
the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart, has had 17 No. 1 records in a 14-year
career.
   He's on the road 115 days a year, down sharply from his peak era.
   ``I got to the point I wouldn't do golf tourneys,'' he recalled.
``Back then, it was money, money, money; I was playing every place
they threw in front of me.
   ``I wish I had cut in half what I did. I wanted to make as much
money as quickly as I could. It was like a dragon: You feed it to
keep it. The fire was coming out of his mouth,'' he said.
   ``I'm happier with my performing now because I'm working less
and ending up with more money than during `Urban Cowboy' because
I'm able to do it with less people.
   ``Back then, I had a lifestyle of airplanes and buses and
trucks. I did stupid things. I prostituted myself for the money.''

<HEAD>Too Often, Elementary Science is Just `The Pursuit of The Known'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<HEAD>By LEE MITGANG</HEAD>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a glimpse of elementary science the way it
should be taught, but seldom is, turn right after the sea lions at
the Bronx Zoo.
   There, in makeshift classrooms ripe with the sounds and smells
of ferrets, falcons, porcupines and snakes, 30,000 New York City
elementary schoolchildren a year get a few hours to experience
science the way scientists do: by touching, observing and
experimenting.
   Instead of reading about it in some lifeless textbook, second
graders from P.S. 205 actually saw a ferret demonstrate its natural
defense: spinal flexibility that enables it to turn its long,
slender body completely around in a narrow plastic tube and face
potential danger.
   ``First we learned how the animals moved. Then we learned about
their colors,'' said Gary Beckles, a first-grader at P.S. 205. ``We
saw a owl and a fire-bellied toad and we even touched a boa
constrictor.''
   Visitors from P.S. 29, another elementary school in the Bronx,
felt the slimy back of a bullfrog for the first time in their lives
_ after some coaxing from zoo instructor Nikki Schulak _ and
learned about natural camouflage by studying the black and orange
hide of a salamander.
   The classes, conducted by the Bronx Zoo, are among 13 local
science education programs cited as exemplary in a new U.S.
Department of Education publication, ``Science Education Programs
That Work.'' For about $300 to $400 per class, the program offers
science training and materials for teachers, and three to six class
visits to the zoo for students in grades Kindergarten through 6.
   But the program is a rare bright spot in an otherwise dismal
landscape of elementary school science around the country.
   Critics from U.S. Education Secretary William J. Bennett on down
say science as taught in many U.S. elementary schools manages to
replace children's innate fascination with nature's wonders with
mind-deadening facts and predictable textbook exercises
masquerading as ``experiments.''
   Experts cite several problems: elementary teacher training that
often bypasses or plays down science, school systems that stress
reading and math scores and consider science a frill by comparison,
failure by schools to make use of resources like planetariums and
zoos, and overreliance on textbooks that rarely offer genuine
experimentation or grounding in scientific method.
   The sorry state of elementary science instruction is the often
overlooked reason that U.S. students do so poorly in science later
on in school compared with students in other industrialized
countries.
   U.S. elementary and high school students, especially girls, know
less about science than their counterparts did in 1970, according
to a study released this year by the International Association for
the Evaluation of Educational Achievement of how students in 24
nations perform in science.
   For example, more than eight out of 10 U.S. 5th graders in 1970
correctly answered a multiple choice question on how long it takes
to travel to the moon. In 1986, only 47 percent of the 5th graders
chose the correct answer: ``A few days.''
   In an otherwise laudatory report on elementary education in
1986, Bennett singled out science instruction as a weak spot.
   The report, ``First Lessons,'' said the average fourth grader is
lucky to get 30 minutes a day of science instruction. And rarely
does it include a taste of genuine lab work or experimentation.
   ``We need a revolution in elementary school science,'' said the
Bennett report. ``There is probably no other subject whose teaching
is so at odds with its true nature.
   ``We have come to think of science as a grab-bag of esoteric
facts and stunts _ the periodic table, the innards of frogs, the
way to make little hot plates out of tin cans and wires.''
   Across the street from the Bronx Zoo, at P.S. 205, teachers and
administrators have struggled to include more science in the
curriculum, especially ``hands-on'' lessons featuring
experimentation and visual demonstrations.
   The elementary school's teachers, bored with the standard
science curriculum handed down by the central school board, got
together about three years ago and devised their own enriched
curriculum which pooled their knowledge and downplayed the role of
standard textbooks.
   ``I remember that we were scared about science as teachers. We
were not science mavens,'' said Rosanne Turits, head early
childhood teacher at P.S. 205.
   But the school has no lab, and science coordinator Maryanne
Delgado must make do with a budget of just $250 for equipment like
thermometers and magnifying glasses. As a result, ``hands-on''
science sometimes means a few minutes at the end of a lesson
looking at light through a prism. Or the old perennial: growing
lima bean plants.
   According to a little-publicized report funded by the National
Science Foundation last November:
   _the nation's Kindergarten-through-third graders spend an
average of 19 minutes per day on science, increasing to 38 minutes
in grades 4-6;
   _69 percent of Kindergarten-through-third grade teachers rely on
textbooks, rising to 89 percent by grades 4-6.
   _three-quarters of Kindergarten-through-third grade classes get
science lectures, 87 percent have discussions, but only half use
hands-on materials or participate in lab work. Yet two-thirds of
science teachers ``agree'' or ``strongly agree'' that lab classes
are more effective.
   _while 87 percent of elementary teachers took ``methods''
courses in teaching elementary science, only three out of 10 took
college level chemistry, 17 percent took physics, 58 percent took
biology.
   And in a recent critique of nine commonly used elementary
science texts, David L. Elliott and Kathleen Carter Nagel,
co-directors of Educational Materials Associates, private textbook
consultants in Berkeley, Calif., concluded that science programs
relying on such texts ``teach students to think of science mainly
as a collection of conclusions to be memorized.''
   Such texts, the critique said, hardly mention, much less
explain, ``the fundamental canons and methods of scientific
inquiry, the attitude of objectivity, or the sometimes tedious
pursuit of all leads _ inevitably including dead ends _ in
scientific investigations.''
   Real experimentation lays open many possible alternatives and
answers.
   But typically, such texts offer recipes in place of genuine lab
activity. They lay out the goal, state the materials needed, give
instructions, and then provide the ``correct answer,'' _ what's
supposed to happen.
   ``School science,'' the Elliott and Nagel concluded, ``is too
often simply the pursuit of the known.''

   A glowing, green two-inch-high stick
figure reproducing the long jump or triple jump form of a Carl
Lewis or Willie Banks is helping America's elite athletes go to
great lengths.
   The figure on the screen in James Hay's biomechanics laboratory
at the University of Iowa is a digital representation of movie film
shot at 100 frames per second. It is a computerized projection of
horizontal and vertical acceleration, angle of takeoff and body
position in the air.
   ``We're trying to find the answers to some basic questions about
jumping,'' Hay said. ``We do a lengthy series of statistical
analyses of the data. Out of that we put together a 40- to 50-page
report with a summary of findings and what we think the athlete
needs in terms of practice, what the coach and athlete might direct
their attention to.''
   For example, a 45-page book prepared for triple jumper Mike
Conley with data from TAC championship meets in 1983, 1985, 1986
and 1987, is crammed with data describing factors including
``velocity changes of center of gravity from touchdown to takeoff
of the hop phase.''
   The athletes like to see the stick figure representations,
though.
   ``These stick figures do tell them where they are in a
particular part of the jump,'' said Dean Hayes, 1988 U.S. Olympic
long and triple jump coach, and a coach at Middle Tennessee State
University for 23 years.
   Hayes said Hay's research, funded by the U.S. Olympic
Committee's elite athlete project, is highly prized by jumpers.
   ``They have confidence in him,'' the Olympic coach said.
``Before, we gathered all this data but didn't know what to do with
it. We're now giving the athlete and coach direct feedback. Hay's
really done a good job of that.''
   Coach Tom Tellez, who has worked with Olympian Carl Lewis and
his sister Carol at the University of Houston, said Hay's analyses
are valuable even when they only back up what the coach and jumper
have been doing.
   ``With Carl and Carol, he's done some good work,'' Tellez said.
``He's reinforced for me a lot of the things I've been doing. For
some other coaches and athletes he may have been even more
valuable.''
   Hay isn't out to replace coaches with his statistics and stick
figures.
   ``We're only seeing one side of this from the films and
analysis,'' he said. ``The coach sees this every day from many
different angles.''
   He also won't take credit for improving any individual's
performance.
   ``If we work with an athlete and he or she improves dramatically
later that year, it may be because of what we said or it may be in
spite of what we said. There's no way of telling.
   ``The only indication is what the athletes and coaches tell us.
What they tell us in general is that it's very, very helpful.
   ``They keep coming back.''

<HEAD>Electrical Disturbances In Heart Blamed For Cocaine-Induced Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seemingly healthy cocaine users who drop
dead may be victims of the drug's interference with the heart's
electrical activity.
   Researchers Edward Avakian and Mark Bracken at the University of
the Pacific injected rats and rabbits dosages equivalent to a
160-pound chronic abuser who smokes or injects 1.5 grams or
``snorts'' 3 grams of cocaine a day.
   Their studies suggest that cocaine causes sudden cardiac death
by triggering abnormal heart rhythms, said Avakian, a
physiologist-pharmacologist. Many cocaine-induced arrhythmias are
temporary but others, called ventricular arrhythmias, kill because
they halt the heart's ability to pump.
   The findings also suggest that while long-term daily cocaine
users develop tolerance to the drug's effects on the heart, they
are particularly susceptible to sudden death if they stop taking it
and then resume.
   ``Cocaine is not always available, so one might not take it for
one or two days,'' Avakian said. ``A brief withdrawal of one or two
days can put a user at much more risk, especially during a stress
situation like exercise.''
   The risk of death from injecting cocaine or smoking its
``free-base'' or ``crack'' forms is particularly high because much
more is absorbed into blood, where it can directly affect the
heart, he said.
   Avakian, Bracken, a physiologist, and colleagues set out to
explain such deaths as those in 1986 of University of Maryland
basketball star Len Bias and Cleveland Browns football player Don
Rogers. As of early 1987, there had been eight such deaths among 49
documented cases of cocaine-induced heart trouble, according to
research by Dr. Jeffrey Isner of New England Medical Center.
   Avakian and Bracken, who outlined their work at a Federation of
American Societies for Experimental Biology meeting last month,
used 40 rabbits and 300 rats. Some received no cocaine; others got
daily doses for eight weeks.
   Some of the animals were killed 30 minutes after the last
injection. Others were killed two days later to simulate withdrawal
from cocaine.
   The hearts were removed and kept pumping in laboratory
containers filled with a blood substitute while researchers
monitored heart electrical activity, blood flow through coronary
arteries, and heart rate, rhythm and contractions.
   Then the researchers added cocaine alone or cocaine and
adrenalin to the blood substitute bathing the hearts. Adrenalin
normally is produced by the body during exercise or other physical
or emotional stress.
   Hearts from animals that got cocaine before they were killed
showed more disruption of electrical impulse transmission, probably
because cocaine acts as a local anesthetic, Avakian said.
   The studies also showed chronic cocaine use, when combined with
adrenalin, constricts coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the
heart. The combination of cocaine-induced arrythmias and the
decreased blood flow increases the odds of sudden death, he said.
Hearts from animals withdrawn from cocaine for two days were
supersensitive to adrenalin and cocaine, suggesting sudden death is
more likely in chronic abusers who stop and start again,
particularly if they exercise or are otherwise stressed.

   For a glimpse of elementary science the way it
should be taught, but seldom is, turn right after the sea lions at
the Bronx Zoo.
   There, in makeshift classrooms ripe with the sounds and smells
of ferrets, falcons, porcupines and snakes, 30,000 New York City
elementary schoolchildren a year get a few hours to experience
science the way scientists do: by touching, observing and
experimenting.
   The classes, conducted by the zoo, are among 13 local science
education programs cited as exemplary in a new U.S. Department of
Education publication, ``Science Education Programs That Work.''
For about $300 to $400 per class, the program offers science
training and materials for teachers, and three to six class visits
to the zoo for students in grades Kindergarten through 6.
   But the program is a rare bright spot in an otherwise dismal
landscape of elementary school science around the country.
   Critics from U.S. Education Secretary William J. Bennett down
say science as taught in many elementary schools replaces
children's innate fascination with nature's wonders with
mind-deadening facts and predictable textbook exercises
masquerading as ``experiments.''
   Experts cite several problems: teacher training that often
bypasses or plays down science, school systems that stress reading
and math scores and consider science a frill by comparison, failure
by schools to make use of local resources like planetariums and
zoos, and overreliance on textbooks that rarely offer genuine
experimentation or grounding in scientific method.
   The sorry state of elementary science instruction is the often
overlooked reason that U.S. students do so poorly in science later
on in school compared with students in other industrialized
countries.
   U.S. elementary and high school students, especially girls, know
less about science than their counterparts did in 1970, according
to a study released this year by the International Association for
the Evaluation of Educational Achievement of how students in 24
nations perform in science.
   According to a report funded by the National Science Foundation
last November, the nation's Kindergarten-through-third graders
spend an average of 19 minutes per day on science, increasing to 38
minutes in grades 4-6, and only half the Kindergarten-through-third
graders get hands-on materials or lab work.
   And in a recent critique of nine commonly used elementary
science texts, David L. Elliott and Kathleen Carter Nagel of
Educational Materials Associates, private textbook consultants in
Berkeley, Calif., concluded that programs relying on such texts
``teach students to think of science mainly as a collection of
conclusions to be memorized.''

<HEAD>Many Smokers Sabotage Benefit of Ultra-Low-Tar Cigarettes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If your ultra-low-tar cigarette tastes better
than you expect, you may not be smoking it right _ and may be
getting higher doses of tar _ say researchers who studied discarded
cigarette butts.
   Fifty-eight percent of 135 cigarette filters found in ash trays
at a shopping mall showed evidence that smokers had at least
partially blocked the cigarette's air vents with their lips or
fingers, the researchers report.
   Ultra-low-tar cigarettes depend on those vents to dilute
cigarette smoke and reduce the yield of tar. Blocking them raises
the tar a smoker consumes, the researchers wrote in June's American
Journal of Public Health.
   ``Smokers block vents to enhance smoking satisfaction. Some do
not realize that better taste means increased tar, nicotine and
carbon monoxide, thinking that there are special low-tar tobaccos
in the cigarette; other smokers are unaware of blocking the
vents,'' they wrote, citing previous research.
   ``Smokers of low-tar cigarettes ... need to be told that, if
they do not miss their high-yield cigarette smoke, it may not
really have gone away,'' wrote Lynn Kozlowski, Marilyn Pope and
Joann Lux of the Addiction Research Foundation in Toronto, and the
University of Toronto.
   Their study focused on characteristic tar stains created by
vent-blocking. Evidence of extreme blocking appeared in 19 percent,
with lesser blockage in 39 percent.

<HEAD>40 Percent of Women In Study Said No to Sex But Meant Yes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 40 percent of college coeds in a study
report they had said ``no'' to sex when they meant ``yes,'' but
researchers say that since most of the women meant what they said,
men shouldn't ignore such refusals.
   About a third of the women said they had offered this token
resistance only once, and 46 percent had used it only two to five
times.
   But since most women reported never offering such resistance,
the result ``does not mean that men can safely ignore women's
refusals. When a woman says no, chances are that she means it ...
(and) regardless of the incidence of token resistance, if the woman
means no and the man persists, it is rape,'' wrote Texas A&M
University researchers Charlene Muehlenhard and Lisa Hollabaugh.
   They gave an anonymous questionnaire to 610 female students,
average age 19, at their school. Results appear in the May issue of
the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
   Twenty-three percent of the 240 coeds who offred token
resistance said manipulative reasons, such as game-playing, anger
with the man or desire to be in control, were at least moderately
important reasons for resisting. About an equal percentage cited
such reasons as fear of appearing promiscuous, fear of catching
disease, or uncertainty about their partner's feelings.

<HEAD>Anti-parasite Drug Being Tested In Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suramin, a drug long used to treat parasite
infections, is being tested for the first time as a way to attack
cancer.
   Doctors from the American Cancer Society used it on 10 people
with advanced, spreading cases of cancer of the adrenal gland.
Although it did not cure their disease, suramin seemed to slow the
cancer by blocking body chemicals known as growth factors.
   Tumors need these substances to promote their own growth.
   ``We believe that suramin is the first of a class of growth
factor-inhibiting drugs,'' said Dr. Cy A. Stein. ``Even if it is
not the ideal drug, it is helping us to learn what scheme is
necessary to stop tumors from growing by inhibiting their growth
factors.''
   In two of the patients, tumors were reduced by more than 50
percent, while those in two others decreased by 25 to 50 percent.
The disease remained stable in three while progressing in three.
   Stein said that once the drug was stopped, the cancer recurred
rapidly. Doctors are now considering trying suramin on other forms
of cancer and combining it with standard chemotherapy drugs.
   The most serious side effect was nerve damage, which doctors
said may limit how long people can stay on suramin.
   The results were reported at a recent meeting of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology.

<HEAD>Drug-Coated Beads Slow Liver Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tiny beads coated with cancer-killing drugs
are being tested to slow progression of liver cancer, a uniformly
fatal disease.
   The treatment, called chemoembolization, uses beads of starch
that have been treated with chemotherapy medicines to temporarily
dam up the hepatic artery, the major artery that supplies the liver.
   This deprives the tumor of blood while putting it in contact
with drugs. Doctors say the combination can stop the growth of the
tumor and sometimes shrink it.
   In a few days, the starch is absorbed into the body, and blood
flow resumes. During the temporary blockade, the liver continues to
receive blood through the portal vein.
   Among 30 patients who received the experimental treatment at the
University of California, San Francisco, two had dramatic
responses. One had no recurrence of the tumor for 16 months and the
other for over two years. In about three-quarters, the tumor shrank
significantly or temporarily stopped growing.
   Dr. Alan Venook, who outlined the results at a recent American
Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, said the new treatment
provides temporary relief from the spread of the disease but is not
a cure.
   ``It is better than anything else around,'' he said. ``Some
patients have shown remarkable improvement, but the therapy needs
further development.''

<HEAD>New Law Gets Mixed Review, Some Fear Big INS Crackdown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At Hyatt Hotel Corp. in Chicago, executives are
basking in government praise of their model compliance with the new
immigration law, which makes it illegal to knowingly hire
undocumented aliens.
   But on the Texas border, a Mexican fast-food chain fears
possible raids by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   And in Southern California, a waterbed-frame factory is
challenging what it calls abusive and arbitrary INS inspection
tactics, in the first significant court test of the new law's
sweeping employer-sanction provisions.
   As the Wednesday deadline looms for enforcement of those
sanctions, employers and immigration lawyers are giving the law and
the INS a mixed review.
   Many say the agency has shown extraordinary tolerance and the
new documentation requirements for employees are only a minor
nuisance. Others contend immigration officers have failed to
educate a large number of businesses and the paperwork is
horrendously confusing.
   ``My sense is that many employers aren't complying with the
law,'' said Ilene F. Lainer, immigration specialist at the law firm
of Grotta, Glassman & Hoffman in Roseland, N.J. ``A lot of
companies fell through the cracks.''
   Stuart H. Bompey, immigration lawyer at the New York firm of
Baer Marks & Upham, said large employers are complying because they
are more sophisticated than smaller businesses and have the
resources to efficiently keep records.
   ``The little guy who runs the small garment shop or something
like that, probably isn't in compliance and won't be in
compliance,'' he said. ``It's the same as non-compliance with
overtime laws, until somebody knocks on his door.''
   Some predict the INS will stage zealous enforcement raids after
the Wednesday expiration of the 11-month phase-in period, during
which it only issued warnings to first offenders and stressed
voluntary compliance.
   ``My impression is there will be a lot happening after June 1,''
said H. Ronald Klasko, president-elect of the American Immigration
Lawyers Association and co-author of an employers guide to
compliance with the new law.
   The November 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act requires
the nation's 8 million employers to document the legal status of
employees hired after the law was signed, with a new form called
the I-9. Employers must fire those who cannot prove work
eligibility.
   Employer penalties range from $250 to $2,000 per worker for
first offenses, to $10,000 per worker and 6 months in jail for
repeated violations. Failure to do the paperwork can result in
fines ranging from $100 to $1,000 per violation.
   INS spokesman Duke Austin said visits to employers nationwide
suggest that about 90 percent are in compliance or nearly so.
   ``We're encouraged by that, because we know the only way this
law is going to work will be to have compliance,'' Austin said.
``We don't have the resources to visit 8 million employers.''
   He declined to characterize the post-Wednesday policing effort
as a crackdown, but said that ``I think you're going to see more
enforcement.''
   Despite earlier grumblings about an additional bureaucratic
nuisance, some large employers are now praising the INS for
explaining how the law works.
   The INS, in turn, has sought to establish good relationships
with many businesses and publicly compliments model followers of
the new law.
   For example at Hyatt, which like other big hotel chains
historically has attracted undocumented aliens for low-pay
positions, there was some initial fear about its ability to employ
qualified workers. But the company asked for INS assistance to
comply and received an award from the agency.
   Some smaller businesses also have found it relatively easy to
comply after initial complaints.
   Murray Rosenzweig, president of Linden Maintenance Corp., a taxi
company in New York, predicted last year that the new law would be
a ``nightmare'' because of his constantly changing work force. But
he changed his mind.
   ``It hasn't developed into a major problem anymore,'' he said.
``It's become more of a routine, not a burden as I see it.''
   But fear toward the new law and the INS prevail along the
southern U.S. border, where most illegals enter the country.
   At El Pato Mexican Food Enterprises in McAllen, Texas, manager
Ralph Nunez worries about surprise inspections at the fast food
chain.
   ``We've been trying our darndest to comply with the law,'' he
said. ``But what if they come in unannounced while a recently hired
person is working for us and we still don't have the proper
documentation in our office? If they're going to pounce on us, then
we're in trouble.''
   INS tactics have been the focus of a court case in which Mester
Manufacturing, a 70-worker waterbed-frame maker in El Cajon,
Calif., challenged the agency's determination that it knowingly and
repeatedly hired illegals.
   Arguments before an administrative law judge revealed that INS
officers who searched the factory might have abused their authority
and ignored earlier company requests for help in complying with the
law.
   ``The judge was pretty disgusted with a lot of this stuff,''
said attorney Peter Larrabee. ``They're trying to stick it to
employers. It takes an employer like my client that gets incensed
to fight big brother.''
   Under a special provision for farmers who employ migrant
laborers, full enforcement will not begin until late this year. But
there is widespread fear among many growers that the law will make
it hard to find harvesting help.
   In eastern Oregon, for example, strawberry farmers have planted
only one third the usual acreage this year, fearing they can no
longer rely on the large numbers of illegal Mexican migrants who
have come every season.
   Roy Malensky, head of Oregon Berry Packing Co., said:
``Everyone's concerned that if we plant 'em, who's going to pick
'em?''

   The government today urged leading corporations to
boost imports of manufactured goods in an effort to reduce Japan's
massive trade surplus.
   In a meeting with representatives of 151 firms, Minister of
International Trade and Industry Hajime Tamura requested the
companies ``make further efforts to expand the increase of foreign
imports,'' said Atsushi Kawashima, director of the import division
of MITI's International Trade Administration Bureau.
   Japan's trading partners have called on the country to curtail
exports and promote imports in an effort to slash its heavy global
trade surplus.
   Kawashima said imports of manufactured goods rose from $55.2
billion in fiscal 1986 to $73.9 billion in fiscal 1987, fueled
mainly by the rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen.
   Since September 1985, the yen has risen by more than 100 percent
against the U.S. dollar. The higher value of the yen has made
Japanese products more expensive overseas, but has tended to
increase the import purchasing power of Japanese.
   The companies should ``take advantage of the ... yen's
appreciation to the greatest extent,'' Kawashima quoted Tamura as
telling the firms' representatives during the one-hour meeting at
the ministry.
   According to Finance Ministry figures, Japan's trade surplus
last fiscal year totaled $76.01 billion, down from $89.74 billion
in fiscal 1986. The decrease was the first in six years.
   Kawashima said the government hopes to reduce the trade surplus
by another $11 billion this fiscal year, which ends next March 31.
   He said the call for more imports also was made by ministry
officials to 151 other firms for a total of 302 companies which
represent the core of the Japanese economy.
   The corporations, including big trading houses such as Mitsui
and Co., Sumitomo Corp., and C. Itoh and Co., were responsible for
60 percent of the total fiscal 1987 import figure, he said. The
companies as a group increased their imports last year by 38
percent and hope to increase them by a further 17 percent in fiscal
1988, he said.
   Kawashima said Tamura also requested the companies to report at
the end of the first half of fiscal 1988 on the results of their
import expansion programs.

   Stock prices opened higher in active dealings
today as traders returned from the three-day Memorial holiday
weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell more
than 10 points on Friday, was up 9.06 at 1,965.50 after 30 minutes
of trading.
   Gainers took a lead of nearly 2 to 1 over losers among issues
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, with 561 issues up, 311
issues down and 430 issues unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 64.20 million shares as of 10 a.m. on
Wall Street.
   The pace of trading has been slow in recent weeks as traders
have demonstrated little conviction about the implications of
continuing strength in the economy.
   While a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits,
some observers worry that an expanding economy could also reignite
inflation.
   Nearly two-thirds of the early activity today was in two stocks,
Public Service Enterprise Group was unchanged at 23 with and Ohio
Edison was unchanged at 18|. Nearly 19 million shares of each
company's stock were traded.
   Also on the NYSE active list, Navistar was up [ at 6, Texaco was

   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States increased by 13 this week to total 905, Baker Hughes
Inc. reports.
   The rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling
activity, totaled 758 a year ago.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, announced Tuesday, reflects the number
of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the
number of rigs producing oil.
   A week ago, the count increased by nine to total 892.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas saw the most drastic
change by losing 16 rigs, followed by Louisiana, six; North Dakota,
three; and Ohio, two.
   Those states gaining rigs include California and Oklahoma, eight
each; New Mexico, four; Colorado, three; Pennsylvania, two; and
Michigan and Wyoming, one each.
   Kansas' rig count remained unchanged from last week.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of new, single-family homes rose 4
percent in April to the highest level in a year, the government
said today.
   In a joint release, the departments of Commerce and of Housing
and Urban Development said new single-family homes were sold at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of of 679,000 last month, up from
the March pace of 653,000.
   It was the third consecutive monthly increase and the highest
level since new homes were sold at a rate of 728,000 in April 1987.
   Despite the recent increases, sales for the first four months of
this year are still 9 percent below the same period of 1987, when
mortgage interest rates hit nine-year lows.
   The April climb came atop a modest 1.2 percent rise in March and
a whopping 11.4 percent rise in February. However, the increases
followed three consecutive declines _ in November, December and
January _ which analysts at the time said were caused by the
October stock market crash.
   Some economists had feared that the downturn in housing sales
signaled a recession, but since then the economy has proved to be
robust and the housing sector has more than recovered.
   Most analysts, though, believe that sales levels of the last few
months will drop by the fall as rising mortgage interest rates push
up the monthly cost of owning a home and discourage buyers.
   Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conventional mortgages averaged
10.58 percent last week, more than half a percentage point higher
than levels in February and March.
   The increase in sales of new homes was accompanied by a rise in
prices. The median, or mid-point, price of new homes was $110,500
in April, up 3.3 percent from March. The average price of a new
home rose 4.2 percent in April.
   However, the increases came after two consecutive monthly price
declines, which analysts had said reflected the re-entry into the
market of first-time home buyers, who normally purchase less
expensive homes.
   Sales increased in all regions of the country in April. They
were up 5.9 percent in the Midwest, 5.5 percent in the West, 2.9
percent in the South and 2.8 percent in the Northeast.
   In a separate report last week, the National Association of
Realtors said sales of existing homes increased 4.5 percent in
April after identical increases of 2.5 percent in March and
February.

   The Stop & Shop Cos. said Tuesday it plans to sell
the southern division of its Bradlees department stores, which
operates 58 stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, Virginia
and North Carolina.
   Stop & Shop said the stores were strong performers but that the
company, the target of a recent takeover attempt, wanted to
concentrate both its supermarket and department store operations in
the Northeast.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. has been retained to manage the
sale, Stop & Shop said in a statement. The 58 stores for sale
generated revenues of $635 million in the last fiscal year, the
company said.
   Stop & Shop has 133 supermarkets in Connecticut, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island and New York. If the 58 Bradlees stores are sold, the
company still would own 110 Bradlees in Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Mew Jersey and New York.

   the summit would be a success, Petrovsky said in remarks quoted by
the news agency Tass.
   ``The American action of this kind is hardly aimed at improving
understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States,'' he
said.
   In Washington six months ago, Gorbachev reacted heatedly when he
was pressed by newspaper editors on his stand on human rights.
Soviet officials have long told Americans to mind their own
business on the issue.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, signed autographs during the session
at which a few children roamed around the large dining room.
   ``We are not so used to hearing such human words without any
political statement,'' said Yuri Zieman, a former computer
scientist who lost his job when he applied for an exit visa 11
years ago.
   Zieman said there was no telling whether the session with Reagan
would expedite emigration. ``How do we know?''

   The stock market surged today as trading resumed
after the three-day Memorial holiday weekend.
   Volume was fairly strong, but more than half of the shares
traded on the New York Stock Exchange involved the stocks of two
utility companies whose dividend eligibility dates are approaching.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 10.31
points on Friday, was up 29.51 at 1,985.95 after 90 minutes of
trading.
   Gainers held a lead of nearly 3 to 1 over losers among issues
traded on the NYSE, with 874 up, 336 down and 416 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 132.38 million shares as of 11 a.m. on

   The pace of trading has been slow in recent weeks as traders

   While a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits,
some observers worry that an expanding economy could also reignite
inflation.
   Larry Wachtel, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said today's advance may reflect some relief that the Federal
Reserve failed to boost its discount rate after the markets closed
last week, as some traders had feared. The discount rate is the
central bank's charge on loans to financial institutions.
   Wachtel said stock prices were also helped by relative stability
in the bond market.
   More than half of the early activity today was in two stocks.
Ohio Edison was up [ at 18} on volume of 53.2 million shares, while

   Soybean futures prices rocketed up the
30-cents-a-bushel limit for daily trading today on the Chicago
Board of Trade following a long, hot, dry weekend in the Midwest.
Grain futures also opened higher.
   ``It's all based on the weather,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader for the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It was
dry over the weekend and there's not much rain in the forecast.''
   Soybean prices came down slightly from their opening highs as
traders took profits. But with meteorologists predicting little
precipitation in the Corn Belt until later this week, prices were
expected to continue at four-year highs.
   As soybean planting approaching completion, fears are
intensifying that a dry summer could lead to tight supplies next
year, analysts said.
   Most soybean contracts were trading this morning above $8 a
bushel, a price not seen since the spring of 1984.
   In early trading, wheat was 11 cents to 13 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.50{ a bushel; corn was 8 cents
to 9{ cents higher with July at $2.24{ a bushel; soybeans were 6\
cents to 6} cents higher with July at $1.79{ a bushel; soybeans
were 7 cents to 30 cents higher with July at $7.97 cents a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were substantially
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .13 cent to .65 cent higher with June at 72.05

August at 76 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent to .95 cent higher
with June at 54.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .70 cent
to 1.38 cent higher with July at 55.70 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled lower on Friday while pork futures

   Stock traders came back from the three-day
Memorial holiday weekend in a good mood, pushing prices broadly
higher in active dealings today. Analysts said the market was
cheered by the ability of the bond market to shrug off a rise in
commodity prices today.
   Volume was strong, but more than half of the shares traded on
the New York Stock Exchange involved the stocks of two utility
companies whose dividend eligibility dates are approaching.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 10.31
points on Friday, was up 25.25 at 1,981.69 at noon on Wall Street.
   Gainers outpaced losers by a margin of more than 2 to 1 among
issues traded on the NYSE, with 895 up, 366 down and 468 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 157.37 million shares as of noontime,
compared with 88.35 million shares at the same point in Friday's
session.
   The pace of trading has been slow in recent weeks as traders
have demonstrated little conviction about the implications of
continuing strength in the economy.
   While a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits,
some observers worry that an expanding economy could also reignite
inflation.
   Charles Jensen, a technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.,
said the Commodity Research Bureau's index of selected commodity
prices was up about 5 points at midday, a relatively strong advance
that might normally stir inflation fears.
   But he said when the bond market declined only slightly, traders
who had sold borrowed stocks in anticipation that they could buy
them later at lower prices ``panicked and bought stocks.''
   ``Some people saw that as a good sign _ that the market failed
to respond to bad news,'' he said.
   Eldon A. Grimm, a senior vice president at the brokerage Birr,
Wilson Securities Inc., said there is ``an enormous amount of cash
around out of the market'' due to wariness in the wake of last
October's crash.
   ``But every time we get a little rally going, people think they
will miss the boat and buy something,'' he said.
   More than half of the early activity today was in two stocks.
Ohio Edison was unchanged at 18| on volume of 55.2 million shares,

   Koppers Co. Inc. and Beazer PLC said today
their top executives conducted talks toward a merger agreement
during the Memorial Day weekend.
   ``Such negotiations are expected to continue although there can
be no assurance that such negotiations will result in a mutually
acceptable agreement,'' the companies said.
   Beazer has offered to pay $60 per share, or a total of $1.7
billion, for Koppers.
   The companies' announcement said the talks would allow Beazer's
affiliate, BNS Inc., to acquire the Pittsburgh-based Koppers. In
the meantime, BNS extended the deadline for its tender offer until
midnight Wednesday.
   Earlier, Beazer said a federal appeals court in California had
lifted one of the roadblocks to BNS' hostile takeover bid of
Koppers.
   Beazer said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday
BNS may proceed with its attempt to acquire Koppers' stock once a
trustee is appointed to control Koppers' Sunny-Miller Contracting
Co. road materials subsidiary in Irwindale, Calif.
   Koppers spokesman Robert O'Gara said the decision imposes
further delays on the attempted takeover bid.
   A hearing is scheduled on the issue Wednesday before Chief U.S.
District Court Judge Manuel Real in Los Angeles, according to
O'Gara.

<HEAD>Keeping the House Instead of Moving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During the 1960s it was common for young couples
to buy a relatively low-priced ``first house,'' which was a subtle
way of letting you know they really aspired to much better things.
   A few years later, having acquired some equity, they moved to a
more commodious dwelling in what they considered a better
neighborhood, one they felt was more in keeping with their view of
themselves.
   While the motive was snobbish, the results often were quite
practical. The better house in a better neighborhood might rise
sharply in value, as many of them did during the inflated 1970s.
Smart move.
   Now something quite different is taking place. Rather than
moving, many young couples are staying put, fixing up the old house
to suit their needs, and in the process saving themselves a lot of
headaches and dollars.
   Look around the old neighborhood and you'll see the evidence:
new rooms, decks, energy-efficient doors and windows, swimming
pools. In some instances small houses are almost encased by
additions twice the size.
   And once again, the reasons for so doing make sense.
   Two big factors are at work:
   1. Many families prefer to stay put for financial and
social-cultural reasons.
   By remaining, they save various closing costs, taxes, legal
fees, moving expenses and the like. They are able to retain ties to
churches, schools and other organizations. And the home might be
more convenient to work.
   2. A percentage of families that once might have sought new
homes in new developments, as in the 1960s, might be more inclined
now to move into homes in existing neighborhoods, fixing up to meet
their specific needs.
   Influencing such behavior might be the surge in new-home prices,
contrasted with bargain prices that sometimes can be found for
fix-up houses in older but still desirable neighborhoods.
   Whatever the reasons, expenditures for residential remodeling in
the past three years have exceeded $270 billion, and about $200
billion is expected to be added to that total by the end of 1989.
   Last year, according to a preliminary estimate by the Census
Bureau, $94.1 billion was spent on alterations and repairs. While
this was only 3.1 percent higher than in 1986, it was triple the
amount spent 10 years earlier.
   Martin Azola, chairman of the of the National Association of
Realtors' remodeling council, believes the pace will quicken to $98
billion this year and to more than $100 billion in 1989.
   Of 77 million people born during the post-World War II baby
boom, about half own their homes, Azola says. He observes that
while many have been trading up, ``others are staying put and
upgrading.''
   The upgrading trend doesn't seem to be a reflection of a tougher
housing market, as some market analysts contend. It appears not to
be solely, if at all, a consequence of couples being unable to make
any other choice.
   In fact, the remodeling splurge might even be related to the
strong sales that have persisted during the past five years.
   Azola, for example, cites a study by the Joint Center for
Housing Studies at Harvard University which found that half of all
remodeling expenditures are by people who have moved during the
previous five years.
   ``When people move into an existing home, they often want to
make alterations,'' Azola says, adding: ``So when an existing home
is sold, there is a good chance that a remodeling job will occur in
the near future.''

   Computer assembly might seem unlikely in
the middle of the nation's largest national forest, but the
Southeast Alaska village of Angoon has programmed its future in
microchips.
   The village Native corporation, Kootznoowoo Inc., rented an
empty building in town, trained a dozen new employees and went to
work this spring building IBM-compatible computers from imported
components.
   Almost 50 units have been produced at the plant, which has totem
poles in front and high-tech electronic gear inside. Federal
agencies and corporations have been the main customers, but a
retail shop two blocks from the state Capitol also offers the
computers to the public.
   ``The Kootznoowoo board of directors has had a policy of trying
to promote economic development in Angoon,'' said Ron Hawk,
controller of the corporation's computer subsidiary. ``Electronics
immediately came to the top of the list.''
   ``The electronics industry is an industry you can add a lot of
value to and not pay a lot of freight,'' Hawk said.
   Electronic parts don't weigh much and that holds down freight
costs for the company's operation on an island more than 800 miles
north of Seattle. Environmental concerns also played a part in the
decision. ``Anything having to do with electronics is a clean
industry,'' Hawk said.
   Angoon, a village of about 600 people on Admiralty Island in the
Tongass National Forest, is 60 miles south of the state capital at
Juneau. Freight from the Lower 48 must come first to Juneau and
then move by barge, boat or plane to Angoon.
   Kootznoowoo Inc. was established under the 1971 Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act, which distributed money and land to Alaska
Natives to settle claims against the federal government. The act
established 13 regional and about 200 village corporations to
manage the property.
   Kootznoowoo's nearly 700 shareholders are Tlingit Indians,
two-thirds of whom still live on Admiralty, an island almost 80
times the size of Manhattan. The corporation's assets totaled $33
million as of the end of the past fiscal year.
   Kootznoowoo is the Tlingit word for Admiralty. It translates to
``Fortress of the Bears,'' in reference to the island's large
population of brown bear.
   Alaska Native corporations have gone into construction, mining,
timber, seafood, real estate and oil exploration services, but this
is the first venture into computers, Hawk said.
   As far as he has been able to determine from federal officials,
Kootznoowoo is the first Indian corporation in the country to
assemble computers. The Bureau of Indian Affairs has purchased
several of the computers, and an order is expected soon from the
U.S. Public Health Service.
   Timber is the company's only other business, Hawk said, although
the board is looking at entering the tourism and seafood processing
industries.
   The corporation a year ago established Kootznoowoo Government
Services Inc. as a subsidiary to develop new businesses and jobs
for its shareholders. As its first venture, KGS this winter leased
an empty 1,800-square-foot building from the city for use as a
computer assembly plant.
   The building was put up six years ago for use as a museum, but
the city never had money to operate it and it sat empty for five
years.
   ``If we had to factor in the cost of building a plant, we
probably never would have considered the idea,'' Hawk said. The
building was constructed with humidity, temperature and dust
controls to protect artifacts _ making it perfect for electronics
work.
   KGS President Ed Gamble said 30 people applied when the company
advertised in the village for computer assembly jobs. A dozen
people were hired and trained, the building remodeled, and the
first 12 computers were built, all for a start-up cost of a little
over $20,000, Gamble said.
   Kootznoowoo Inc. provided $50,000 as an initial line of credit
for its subsidiary, Gamble said. Additional money was contributed
later.
   ``Memory chips are getting very expensive,'' Hawk said. A
worldwide microchip shortage has driven up prices, and although
Kootznoowoo is physically isolated from Silicon Valley, it faces
the same market pressures as the rest of the industry.
   The company offers two models, marketed under the names KGS
Wolf-AT and Wolf-386.
   The computers are named in honor of the late corporation
president, Ivan Gamble Sr., who died last year in a traffic
accident. He was a member of the Wolf clan and his Indian name
meant ``Wolf who cries in the wilderness.''
   Although KGS employees assemble the computers, the monitors and
keyboards are purchased intact. Hawk said the company could
assemble those items, too, if it had enough sales volume to justify
the expansion.
   The KGS building has room for 20 work stations. ``It is designed
so that one person does all the assembly of the machine,'' Hawk
said, rather than operating as an assembly line.
   If expectations of federal contracts, corporate purchases and
increased retail sales come true, the company hopes for sales of
100 units a month by the end of the year. ``Our main focus has been
government offices in the Lower 48,'' he said.
   Production of 100 units a month would result in annual revenues
exceeding $2 million _ not even a nick out of IBM's blue chip
stock, but big business for a village of 600 people.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that the bulk of
so-called ``gray market'' goods are legal, giving a green light to
a big part of a multi-billion-dollar business that allows consumers
to buy costly, brand-name imports at steep discounts.
   In another case, the court ruled that states sometimes may
execute convicted murderers even if theirright to a
lawyer's help was violated.
   In  constitutional splintered voting, the justices upheld parts of
U.S. Customs
Service regulations that permit gray market products into the
country without approval from trademark owners.
   The court also struck down part of the Customs Service rules,
thereby limiting somewhat the availability of the discount goods.
But some justices said those rules only apply to a small part of
the dispute decided today.
   The exact size of the gray market is unclear. Estimates have
ranged from $5 billion to $10 billion a year.
   The declining value of the dollar, reducing its purchasing power
abroad, may have dampened the market. But the business still
appears to be thriving.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, said a keyersity
of Georgia's College of Veterinary
Medicine. Nettles helped write the USDA report and is formulating
regulations to use as a model for state governments.
   ``There are disease implications. There are human safety
implications, which make the headlines read big _ a kid gets eaten
by a polar bear in New York. And there's the escape factor, which
from a naturalist point of view is very important.''
   But the debate between exotic animal dealers and animal rights
activists rages most fiercely over the moral issue. Is is right or
wrong to put wild animals in a cage? And does captivity ensure a
species' survival or hasten its death?
   ``I believe animals are here for our use, but not our abuse,''
says Hoctor. ``There's nothing wrong with owning a pair of ostrich
boots if we're culling ostrich males. However, if in our smug
admiration of ourselves we rape nature and make those animals
endangered so we can have a pair of ostrich boots, that's wrong.''
   Others believe there is no reason to exploit a wild animal when
there are plenty of domestic animals that already provide
companionship, food and warmth.
   ``That type of thinking _ justifying the exploitation of animals
by juding them as an economic resource _ is going to lead to more
and more species becoming endangered,'' says Herbet. ``Animals have
an intrinsic value and ecological value. You shouldn't have to put
a dollar value on it to ensure its survival.''

   The stock market pushed vigorously ahead today,
as traders appeared to take a more optimistic view of interest rate
prospects.
   Volume was strong as traders returned from a three-day holiday
weekend, but about half of it involved the stocks of two utility
companies whose dividend eligibility dates are approaching.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 10.31
points on Friday, was up 35.56 at 1,992.00 with two hours left in
the session.
   Gainers outpaced losers by a margin of 5 to 2 among issues
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, with 980 up, 403 down and
464 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 183.21 million shares as of 2 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   The pace of trading has been slow in recent weeks as traders
have demonstrated little conviction about the implications of
continuing strength in the economy.
   While a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits,
some investors worry that an expanding economy could also reignite
inflation.
   But some analysts said traders were cheered by the Federal
Reserve's failure to raise its discount rate _ the interest it
charges on loans to financial institutions _ last week after the
market closed for the holiday.
   They said foreign traders led a surge of buying as trading
resumed today, and the market drifted even higher this afternoon.
   The analysts said the market's performance was remarkable in
view of a rise in commodity prices, which might normally stir
inflation fears.
   Jack Baker, head of block trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., said a spate of buying in utility stocks may also signal that
some investors feel the market ``may be closer to a top in interest
rates than we are to another extension of rates or a round of
interest rate hikes.''
   About half of the activity today was in two stocks. Ohio Edison
was unchanged at 18| on volume of 55.4 million shares, while Public
Service Enterprise Group was up | at 23| on volume of 36.4 million
shares.
   Macmillan fell 1\ to 71\ after proposing to split its
information services and publishing interests into separate
companies and pay a special dividend.
   Essex Chemical rose 10 to 27[ after receiving an offer of $24 a
share for 61 percent of its stock from a Eyuroepan firm.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 1.88 at 145.54. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite
index rose 1.92 to 292.42.

   Soybean futures prices soared the
30-cents-a-bushel limit allowed for daily trading Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in response to the Midwest's hot, dry
weekend and predictions for more of the same.
   Grain futures also closed sharply higher.
   ``Weather's the story, that's the whole ball game,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago
   As soybean planting nears completion, fears are intensifying
that a drier-than-normal summer could lead to tight supplies next
year, analysts said. The spring planting season has been unusually
dry.
   Wheat, corn and oat crops also would suffer during a summer of
little rain, but the rapid depletion of soybean stockpiles has made
that market particularly sensitive to growing conditions.
   Tuesday's gains brought the near-month soybean contract, for
delivery in July, to within easy striking range of $8 a bushel for
the first time since the spring of 1984.
   Eight of the nine soybean contracts were up the limit, as was
the contract for March 1989 delivery of corn, which carries a
10-cents-a-bushel limit. Some oat futures traded up their 10-cent
limit during the session but closed below those highs.
   At the close, wheat was 9{ cents to 15{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.51 a bushel; corn was 7} cents
to 10 cents higher with July at $2.24{ a bushel; oats were 9\ cents

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracting for new construction projects
declined 6 percent in April from the previous month, extending a
downward slide that began last fall, a report released Tuesday said.
   The survey, by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill
Information Systems Co., estimated the annualized value of all
newly started construction projects in April at $226.97 billion,
compared with $242.38 billion in March.
   F.W. Dodge said its seasonally adjusted index of construction
contracting fell to 144 in April from 154 in March, a three-month
low. The index is based on a level of 100 for 1982.
   The April drop was the latest in a series of industrywide
setbacks that began early last fall, when building activity was 20
percent above its current level.
   George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist for F.W.
Dodge, said high vacancy rates in commercial properties,
particularly offices and apartments, were responsible in reversing
the industry's five-year upswing.
   He said the situation was not expected to improve in the near
term.
   ``The export boom which is pumping up the 1988 economy isn't
much help to the construction industry, and could even prove
troublesome,'' Christie said. ``As economic activity heats up,
rising interest rates imply still lower building later in the
year.''
   Contracting for residential buildings slid 7 percent in April to
an annualized value of $109.4 billion, due largely to a decline in
apartment construciton, according to the report.
   April contracts for non-residential building was off 5 percent
to $76.8 billion from $80.86 billion. The value of non-building
contracts, which include public works and utility projects, fell 6
percent to $40.81 billion from $43.59 billion, the report said.

   USAir's schedules were disrupted again Tuesday
as some flight attendants continued to refuse to work overtime in
apparent protest of an impasse in contract negotiations.
   The airline, based in Arlington, Va., canceled 24 flights in its
first eight hours of operation Tuesday, said spokesman Dave Shipley.
   ``It's a very, very small percentage of the total,'' Shipley
said. ``There's not chaos at the airports.''
   USAir schedules about 1,600 flights daily, Shipley said.
   He said USAir canceled one flight Saturday, 81 flights Sunday
and 61 flights Monday.
   An impasse in contract negotiations between USAir and the
Association of Flight Attendants apparently prompted the airline's
flight attendants to decline overtime.
   USAir has yet to complete an agreement for a new contract and
seniority list with its flight attendants and those employed by
Pacific Southwest Airlines, which was acquired by USAir last year
and merged into USAir's system April 9.
   ``Apparently there is (a protest), but it's not a
union-organized protest. I think it's a spontaneous protest. I was
as surprised as anyone else,'' said Juliette Lenoir, vice president
of the Washington, D.C.-based union and a USAir flight attendant.
   ``My best sense is that flight attendants are just very upset at
this whole issue of pay parity for the former PSA flight
attendants. That may have been the straw that broke the camel's
back,'' she said.
   Ms. Lenoir said USAir also has been asking attendants to do more
work, such as serving travelers before takeoff, without a raise in
pay since at least 1985.
   Shipley said most passengers booked for the canceled flights
were accommodated on USAir flights or on other airlines. He said
two classes of about 40 new flight attendants each were assigned to
flights to help.
   Shipley said flight attendants' overtime is governed by federal
regulations which limit them to 85 hours per month. He said flight
attendants may fly five extra hours per month as overtime at the
request of airlines, but they are not required to do so.

<BYLINE>By F. ALAN BOYCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new pasteurizing process that gives
liquid eggs a three-month shelf life may provide a cheap
alternative to conventional eggs and the frozen variety, officials
said Tuesday.
   Richard Olson, president and chief executive officer of Michael
Foods Inc. of Minneapolis, called the process developed at North
Carolina State University a breakthrough in the handling of egg
products.
   Under an agreement with N.C. State, patents for the
ultra-pasteurization and aseptic packaging process are licensed to
Morning Glory Eggs Inc. of Richfield, a subsidiary of Michael
Foods. N.C. State received a $100,000 royalty check Tuesday and
will get 2 percent of royalties from future sales.
   Douglas Ford, vice president for Morning Glory Eggs, said the
new product should be available within 12 months.
   Liquid eggs would be far superior to frozen products currently
on the market, because producing, shipping and storing liquid eggs
is nine times more efficient than with frozen eggs, Ford said.
   ``I don't know whether the entire savings will translate into
lower costs, but it should certainly provide a significant
savings,'' he said.
   In order to extend a shelf life of seven to 10 days, N.C. State
researchers developed a way to heat the eggs ``on the run'' through
tubes, said Kenneth Swartzel, associate professor of food science.
The heat kills disease-causing and spoilage bacteria without
coagulating the egg.
   The egg mixture is then packaged in sterile containers ranging
from small, easy-pour cartons to huge bags for commercial bakeries
and fast-food restaurants.
   For restaurants now using eggs in the shell, ``switching from
using shell eggs would provide an added layer of protection from
possible contamination from shells or packaging materials,'' said
Hershell Ball Jr., professor of food science. For those using
frozen eggs, the new product will be more convenient while
consuming less energy.
   Swartzel said Michael Foods is working with researchers to
remove cholesterol from eggs either by changing the diets of hens
or through a chemical process.
   ``When that technology becomes commercially available, we will
be in a position to protect the integrity of that product all the
way to the shelf,'' he said.
   Olson said the technology could help an industry hurt by health
concerns over cholesterol's influence on heart disease.
   ``We're turning what most people in the egg industry regarded as
a problem into an opportunity,'' said Olson.
   Harold Ford, president of the Georgia-based Southeastern Poultry
and Egg Association, praised the process, saying, ``It will benefit
the middleman and provide labor savings for the food service
industry. ... It's as close to being sterile as any egg product
that's available.''
   Michael Foods is spending $4.3 million to expand a Minnesota
plant to accommodate the new process and may spend another $2
million to $4 million for similar work at a Nebraska plant, Olson
said.

   The stock market posted one of its strongest
advances of the year today as traders went on a post-Memorial
holiday buying spree.
   Analysts said there was no single piece of economic news to
account for the surge, but said traders appeared to be betting that
interest rates are approaching a peak for the time being.
   The pace of trading has been slow in recent weeks as traders
have demonstrated little conviction about the implications of
continuing strength in the economy.
   While a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits,
some investors worried that an expanding economy could also
reignite inflation.
   But analysts said the market was heartened that the Federal
Reserve had failed to raise its discount rate _ the interest on its
loans to financial institutions _ last week after the markets had
closed.
   Some of the buying in today's session, they said, came from
traders who had speculated that the Fed would push interest rates
yet higher and had sold borrowed stocks last week in anticipation
that they could buy them back later at cheaper prices.
   Once stock prices began rising today, analysts said some of
these traders bought stocks to cover those positions and other
investors climbed aboard.
   The analysts said the market's performance was remarkable in
view of a rise in commodity futures prices, which might normally
stir inflation fears.

   Stock prices shot up Tuesday in a post-holiday
weekend buying spree that pushed up the Dow Jones industrial
average nearly 75 points.
   Analysts could not point to any specific developments to account
for the rally, but they said sentiment seemed to have grown that
interest rates are near a peak for the time being. Anxiety over
rising interest rates had weighed heavily on the market in recent
weeks.
   Prices began rising as soon as trading resumed after the
three-day break for the Memorial Day holiday and gathered momentum
as the day wore on.
   The Dow industrials rose 74.68 points to close at 2,031.12. That
was the widely followed barometer's best gain since a 76.42 rise on
Jan. 4 and the sixth biggest increase ever.
   Four stocks rose in price for every one that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The pace of trading has slowed in recent weeks as investors have
shown little conviction on the implications of continuing strength
in the economy. While a strong economy could be a boon for
corporate profits, some investors have worried that the expanding
economy could also reignite inflation.
   But analysts said Tuesday that traders were heartened the
Federal Reserve had not increased the interest rate it charges on
loans to financial institutions. There had been speculation it
would do so after the markets closed Friday.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bank of Boston said Tuesday it has suspended
three employees and launched an investigation of record-keeping in
its corporate trusts division.
   Bank spokesman Wayne Taylor said the investigation began about
two weeks ago after a new management team took over the division,
which administers interests payments for corporate and municipal
bonds.
   ``To preserve the independence of that review, the bank last
week suspended three members of the corporate trust division
management team,'' Taylor said.
   Taylor said new managers in the division noticed problems in
bookkeeping when they took over recently. However, he said, there
was no evidence of impropriety or wrongdoing.
   Taylor said the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal
Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have been
notified of the review, which is looking into the accuracy of
account information and other operations in the division.
   He said the review is expected to take several weeks.
   The three employees, who were suspended without pay for two
weeks, were not identified.
   The probe is being conducted by members of the bank staff and
its auditing firm, Cooper and Lybrand of Boston.
   The Bank of Boston, which owns banks in Massachusetts, Maine,
Rhode Island and Connecticut, reported first quarter assets in
excess of $33 billion.

<HEAD>Dollar's Strength Builds, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened in foreign exchange
trading Tuesday amid a rally on Wall Street and speculation by
investors that interest rates were approaching a short-term peak.
   Gold prices also rose. Republic National Bank said gold bullion
was bid at $454.30 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EDT, up from $451 late
Friday.
   Traders in the currency markets, returning from a long weekend,
said the dollar was drawing its strength from firm interest rates
in the credit markets. Although rumors of an imminent move to
tighten credit by the Federal Reserve did not materialize, traders
remained encouraged by the U.S. interest rate environment.
   The federal funds rate, representing the charge for overnight
loans between banks, traded at 7| percent, up from 7\ late Friday.
   ``The general sense of the market is that while interest rates
are firm, the dollar will put in a better performance,'' said James
T. McGroarty, a vice president with Discount Corp.
   The dollar proved resilient enough to withstand an early move by
the West German central bank to sell dollars to keep it in line
with other currencies, traders noted. The Bundesbank sold $7.4
million as the dollar moved above the psychologically important
level of 1.72 West German marks.
   Some investors had been counting on the Fed to push interest
rates higher at the end of last week by raising its discount loan
rate to member banks. When that didn't happen after the close of
the financial markets Friday, some traders became convinced
interest rates might be peaking. The result was a post-Memorial Day
rally in stock prices and the dollar.
   The moves were unusual, traders said, because they came against
a backdrop of rising commodity prices, including gold, and a drop
in the yield of long-term government bonds.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 124.80 Japanese yen, down from
Monday's 124.98 yen. In later London trading it rose to 125.50 yen,
and in New York, it was quoted at 125.235 yen, up from 124.925 late
Friday.
   The dollar also gained against the British pound in London,
where it was quoted late Tuesday at $1.8385, compared with $1.8478
in Europe on Monday and $1.8570 in London late Friday. London
financial markets also were closed Monday for a national holiday.
   In New York, the pound fetched $1.8353 Tuesday, compared with
$1.85735 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.73265 West German marks, up from 1.7178; 1.44525 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4358; 5.8300 French francs, up from 5.7770;
1,284.00 Italian lire, up from 1,273.13; and 1.2333 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.23915.
   Late dollar rates in London, compared with late Monday's rates,
included: 1.7292 West German marks, up from 1.7270; 1.4437 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4415; 5.8215 French francs, up from 5.8025;
1.9333 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9335; 1,279.95 Italian lire,
down from 1,280.00; and 1.2357 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2378.
   Gold prices around the world got a boost from big gains in the
platinum market. The late bid price in London was $454.80 a troy
ounce, up from late Friday's $452. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid
$455, up from late Monday's $452.50.
   Earlier, gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $455.80, up from
$454.31.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery was quoted at $455 a troy ounce, up from $450.80 late
Friday.
   Silver bullion traded in London late Monday at a bid $6.65 a
troy ounce, up from $6.59 in London late Friday and $6.57 in Zurich
on Monday.
   On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery was quoted at
$6.600 a troy ounce, up from $6.530 late Friday.

<HEAD>Broad Surge In Futures Prices May Signal Change In Markets:
Analysts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodity prices surged broadly Tuesday, propelling a key
inflation indicator to a three-year high and suggesting the
nation's financial markets have reached a crossroads, analysts said.
   Advances in prices for future delivery of soybeans, corn, oats,
hogs, pork bellies and platinum spurred the Commodity Research
Bureau's index of 21 commodities to a 5.50-point gain. The index
settled at 248.39, its highest mark since February 1985, said
Stuart Shinbein, senior technical analyst for the private, New
York-based advisory service for commodities traders.
   Futures on wheat, hogs, cattle, oil, gold, silver, stocks and
bonds also moved higher.
   A concurrent rise in stock-index and U.S. Treasury bond futures
is unusual. Such occurrences historically mark turning points in
the financial markets, Shinbein said.
   ``My feeling is that stocks are coming out of an oversold
condition and commodities are moving into an overbought
condition,'' he said. Such a scenario would call eventually for a
sharp drop in commodities prices.
   Analysts could cite no single reason behind Tuesday's sharp
gains but the the buying surges appeared to hit the markets in
domino fashion, beginning with grains and soybeans.
   Soybean futures opened and closed up the 30-cents-a-bushel limit
allowed for daily trading on the Chicago Board of Trade in response
to the Midwest's hot, dry weekend and predictions for more of the
same.
   ``Weather's the story, that's the whole ball game,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in New York.
   The Agriculture Department reported soybean planting was about
74 percent finished as of Sunday. Traders fear a drier-than-normal
summer could lead to tight supplies next year, analysts said.
   Wheat, corn and oat crops also would suffer during a summer of
little rain, but the rapid depletion of soybean stockpiles has made
that market particularly sensitive to growing conditions.
   Tuesday's gains brought the near-month soybean contract, for
delivery in July, to within easy striking range of $8 a bushel for
the first time since the spring of 1984.
   Eight of the nine soybean contracts finished limit up, as did
the contracts for September and December delivery of oats and March
delivery of corn, both of which carry a 10-cents-a-bushel limit.
   Wheat settled 9{ cents to 15{ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.51{ a bushel; corn was 7} cents to 10 cents
higher with July at $2.24\ a bushel; oats were 9} cents to 10 cents
higher with July at $1.82{ a bushel; soybeans were 18{ cents to 30
cents higher with July at $7.98 a bushel.
   The soaring grain markets supported livestock and meat futures
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said Philip Stanley, an analyst
in Chicago with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Unseasonably warm weather lent additional support to the pork
bellies, which are sliced to make bacon and often end up in
summertime bacon-lettuce-and-tomato sandwiches, Stanley said.
   ``The BLT season is probably what's got everybody pumped up
about the bellies,'' he said.
   Live cattle settled .23 cent to .72 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in June at 72.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .08 cent to .43 cent higher with August at 76.35 cents a
pound; hogs settled .40 cent to the limit 1.50 cents higher with
June at 54.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were up the
2-cents-a-pound limit across the board with July at 56.32 cents a
pound.
   The higher agricultural commodity prices _ often perceived as an
inflationary signal _ prompted hedge-type buying of gold and silver
futures on New York's Commodity Exchange and heavy buying of
platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange, analysts said.
   The dollar's relative weakness against foreign currencies has
made platinum particularly attractive to Japanese and European
investors, said Richard Maseri, senior trader for JCC Inc., a
Miami-based commodities brokerage.
   Platinum settled $25 to $33.70 higher with July at $610.90 a
troy ounce. Gold was $3.50 to $4.20 higher with June at $455 a troy
ounce; silver was 7 cents to 10 cents higher with June at $6.60 a
troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures jumped sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 9.45 points higher at 262.95.
   Oil prices rose in light trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange but dealers were reluctant to take new positions in
advance of OPEC's June 8 meeting in Vienna, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 8
cents higher with July at $17.51 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent
to .45 cent higher with June at 48.23 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .04 cent to .40 cent higher with June at 52.95 cents a
gallon.

   Stock traders celebrated their return from the
three-day Memorial holiday on Tuesday with a buying spree that
pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to its second biggest gain
of the year.
   Analysts said there was no single piece of news to account for
the surge, which came on the heaviest daily volume since late
January, but they said the market's pessimism had grown so
pervasive that a rebound was inevitable.
   ``Sometimes it's better just to enjoy and not analyze things
like this,'' said John L. Manley Jr., a portfolio strategist for
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``It's been a bad May.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 10.31 points
last Friday, climbed 74.68 to 2,031.12, its highest level since it
closed at 2,036.31 on May 4.
   It was the biggest one-day advance in the market's most
widely-followed index since a 76.42-point gain on Jan. 4, the first
trading day of the year, and the sixth biggest rise ever.
   The gain in the Dow Jones industrials was so strong that a
voluntary limit on computerized program trading was triggered when
the Dow's rise swept past 50 points in the last hour of trading.
   But even after the so-called ``collar'' went into effect for the
rest of the day, the blue-chip average extended its gain. It was
the third time the collar had gone into effect since it was adopted
in the aftermath of the Oct. 19 market crash in a bid to curb
market volatility.
   Gainers outpaced losers by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,211 up, 333 down
and 401 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 247.61 million shares,
up from 133.59 million in the previous session and the highest
since 275.25 million shares were traded there on Jan. 25.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 271.55 million shares.
   The pace of trading has been slow in recent weeks as traders
weighed the implications of continuing strength in the economy.
While a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits, some
investors worried that an expanding economy could also reignite
inflation.
   While analysts were unable to pinpoint why the market surged
Tuesday, they said several factors may have contributed to the big
gain.
   They cited stability in the dollar and the bond market's
resilience in the face of a new surge in commodity futures prices.
   They also cited relief that the Federal Reserve Board had failed
to boost its discount rate _ its interest charge on loans to
financial institutions _ as some feared it would after the markets
closed last week.
   Eldon A. Grimm, a senior vice president at the brokerage Birr,
Wilson Securities Inc., said there is ``an enormous amount of cash
around out of the market'' due to wariness in the wake of last
October's crash.
   ``But every time we get a little rally going, people think they
will miss the boat and buy something,'' he said.
   Peter DaPuzzo, manager of retail equity trading for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., said the warm weather over the holiday may have
prompted investors to reevaluate the market's prospects and put
some cash to work.
   ``You've got to start a summer rally sometime, and Memorial Day
is usually the threshold to the summer,'' he said.
   Two utility stocks that have a deadline soon for dividend
eligibility accounted for more than a third of the trading activity
on the NYSE.
   Ohio Edison was up [ at 18} on volume of 55.7 million shares,
while Public Service Enterprise Group rose ~ to 23~ on volume of
36.8 million shares.
   Among the blue chip issues, American Telephone & Telegraph rose
1[ to 27[, General Electric rose 2 to 42, International Business
Machines rose 4{ to 112{ and Eastman Kodak rose 1{ to 42.
   Macmillan fell 2\ to 70\ after proposing to spin off its
information services company and pay a special dividend to its
shareholders.
   Essex Chemical rose 10} to 27~ after receiving an offer of $24 a
share for 61 percent of its stock from a unit of Gurit-Heberlein AG.
   According to Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively-traded stocks, the market rose $69.66 billion, or 2.75
percent, in value.
   The NYSE index rose 4.38 to 148.04.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 10.12 to 302.67, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 8.74 at 262.16.

<HEAD>Similarities Between Far Eastern, Aloha Planes Only Coincidence,
Boeing Says</HEAD>

   It is only coincidence that a Taiwanese Boeing
737 that disintegrated and crashed in 1981 and an Aloha Airlines
737 that lost part of its fuselage over Hawaii in April were built
one after the other, Boeing officials said Tuesday.
   On April 28, a 20-foot section of the Aloha jet's forward upper
fuselage ripped away at 24,000 feet. A flight attendant fell to her
death and 61 passengers were injured, but the flight crew landed
the plane safely.
   The Aloha plane was the 152nd 737-200 produced by Boeing. Plane
No. 151 was a Far Eastern Air Transport jet that disintegrated and
exploded at 22,000 feet over central Taiwan on Aug. 22, 1981,
killing all 110 people on board.
   The cause of the Aloha accident is still under investigation.
However, the Federal Aviation Administration has ordered U.S.
airlines flying older 737s to reinspect the aircraft.
   Boeing believes the Far Eastern crash was caused by maintenance
problems, spokesman Jack Gamble of Boeing Commercial Airplanes
said. Any similarities between that crash and the Aloha accident
are ``a series of coincidences,'' Gamble said.
   At the time of the planes' manufacture in 1969, Boeing was
turning out between two and three 737s a month, Gamble said. He
said he knew of no other problems involving 737s made around that
time.
   In an article Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal, Benjamin
Cosgrove, Boeing Commercial Airplanes vice president and general
manager for engineering, also said the consecutive aircraft numbers
were coincidence. Cosgrove said that while both accidents involved
a section of the fuselage that Boeing refers to as ``Section 43,''
there was nothing inherently wrong with that portion of the
aircraft.
   Cosgrove told the Journal the Far Eastern 737 repeatedly was
used to ship fish in open containers, and corrosive salt water may
have gotten into the cargo hold. The newspaper said Far Eastern
officials denied that charge and said fish were shipped only in
non-leaking containers.
   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Michael Benson in
Washington, D.C., said Tuesday NTSB investigators also believe
leaking salt water from fish shipments was the cause of the Far
Eastern jet's corrosion.
   Gamble said Boeing had issued a series of service bulletins on
older 737s, including one in March 1978 recommending aircraft
owners make additional inspections of fuselage skins for possible
corrosion. On July 1, 1981, the FAA issued an airworthiness
directive requiring U.S. carriers to inspect older 737s.
   Boeing had supplied kits to airlines to allow them to replace
corroded skin on planes, Gamble said.
   A kit was delivered to Far Eastern in April 1980, ``which means
they had those in their spare parts inventory considerably before
that crash,'' but apparently was never used on the plane, he said.
   Cosgrove was in Washington, D.C., to attend a conference on
problems with aging aircraft and was not available for comment
Tuesday, Gamble said. The three-day conference was called by the
FAA after the Aloha incident to study safety issues involving older
aircraft.
   T. Craig Martin, director of public relations for Boeing
Commercial Airplanes, noted the FAA also issued an airworthiness
directive following the Far Eastern crash requiring inspections of
737 cargo holds.
   Milton Goto, spokesman for Aloha Airlines, said that as a result
of the directive, Aloha made extensive repairs in 1983 to the 737
subsequently involved in the April incident. He said the work done
on the wings and lower portion of the plane might have helped it
stay together long enough to land.
   The twin-engine 737, which entered service in 1968, is the
world's most popular commercial aircraft, with more than 2,000
ordered in five different models.
   One of the FAA airworthiness directives issued after the Aloha
accident focuses on early models of 737s in which Boeing used a
cold-bonding process, in which structural parts of the fuselage
were laminated together using an adhesive that cured at room
temperature.
   Martin said he found a number of differences between the two
accidents. The Far Eastern plane, for example, was 12 years old and
had approximately 33,000 landings, while the Aloha jet was 20 years
old and had about 90,000 landings.
   ``As best we know,'' the Far Eastern accident was caused by
corrosion in the plane's cargo hold, while the Aloha accident
involved the top of the plane, he said.
   ``But again, the appropriate thing is to see what the NTSB and
the FAA conclude before drawing all these analogies and
comparisons,'' Martin said.
   Martin said Boeing issues service bulletins on its aircraft to
customers whenever it learns of a problem or the potential for one.
The FAA and other appropriate regulatory agencies also are
notified, he said.
   He said the NTSB believes the issues presented in the Far
Eastern case ``were known and addressed and adequately so'' by the
FAA airworthiness directive.

<HEAD>Freddie Mac Announces Big Jump in Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said
Tuesday that earnings rose 50 percent to a record $93 million in
the first three months of this year.
   The corporation, known as Freddie Mac, buys mortgages and
repackages them into securities for sales to investors. Corporation
officials attributed the earnings increase to a widening in the
difference between what it pays to the investors and what it
receives from the mortgages.
   Also, income taxes were reported at a lower rate because of a
drop in the corporate tax rate.
   For the first quarter, net income was $93 million, or $5.65 per
share of preferred stock and $83.06 per share of common stock, up
from $62 billion, or $3.81 per share of preferred stock and $52.31
per share of common stock, for the same period in 1987.
   Freddie Mac was created by Congress in 1970 to increase the
amount of money available for mortgages. Its preferred stock is
owned by 3,000 savings institutions who are members of the 12
Federal Home Loan Banks. Its common stock is owned by the home loan
banks.

   Delta Air Lines is going after kiddie flyers,
announcing Tuesday an expanded youth fare program for the summer to
go along with a previously announced prize program for children to
fly along with ``Delta Air Lion.''
   The reduced fare will be in effect systemwide, Delta said, more
than doubling the number of markets in which the fare is available.
Delta already had matched youth fares announced May 16 by Eastern,
Continental and United airlines in areas where it competed with the
three.
   Delta, the nation's fourth largest airline, said the youth fares
and a ``Fantastic Flyer'' program take effect Wednesday.
   The fares give children ages 2 through 17 who travel through
Sept. 11 a special price when accompanied by adults who have
purchased a non-refundable fare. One child may accompany each
adult, following the same advance purchase and minimum stay rules
in force with the adult's fare.
   The airline, which already has a marketing tie-in with Walt
Disney World near Orlan, Fla., expects most of the fares to include
Florida. For example, round-trip fares from cities east of the
Mississippi River to Florida will be $97 on weekends and $77 for
midweek travel.
   For travel from cities west of the Mississippi to Florida, or
between two cities outside the state of Florida, the fares will be
limited to midweek and are based of a mileage formula ranging from
$58 to $198.
   Under the Fantastic Flyer program announced last week, Delta
will give prizes and other rewards to children between 2 and 12
years old.
   Calling Delta ``The Official Airline for Kids,'' Delta senior
vice president Whit Hawkins said, ``On every Delta flight, children
will receive a complimentary Mickey Mouse visor ... a copy of the
Fantastic Flyer Magazine featuring games, puzzles, stories and
prizes created just for them.''
   Delta spokesman Jim Lundy said the airline is after two groups
of travelers, with its lower fares and Fantastic Flyer gambits:
vacationers making trips with their children and unaccompanied
children.

   Two veteran executives with Federated
Department Stores Inc. have been hired to head the combined
operations of Federated and Allied Stores, Campeau Corp. announced
Tuesday.
   John W. Burden III will serve as chairman and chief executive
officer of Federated and Allied and James M. Zimmerman as president
and chief operating officer, Campeau chairman Robert Campeau said
in a statement.
   Allied and Federated will be run as one operation, but it is not
yet known if the assets of the two will be merged after Campeau
completes his acquisition of Federated.
   The operations and top Allied-Federated executives will be based
in Cincinnati, company spokeswoman Carol Sanger said.
   Robert Campeau has served as chairman of Allied and Federated
since his company acquired control of Federated in early May as the
result of a $6.6 billion buyout. Campeau now becomes chairman of
the combined corporation's executive committee, the company
announced.
   Campeau Corp. bought Allied Stores Corp. in December 1986.
   Burden, 51, formerly served as a vice chairman of Federated, a
position he held from February 1985 until recently resigning with
other top Federated executives when Campeau took control. Burden
was elected to Federated's board of directors in July 1985.
   Zimmerman, 44, has served as chairman of Federated's
Atlanta-based Rich's department store division since January 1984.
Prior to that, he was president of the division since March 1980.
   Burden's appointment fills the vacancy created when veteran
retail executive Robert Morosky resigned, four days after Campeau
took control of Federated. Morosky reportedly resigned over
differences he had with Campeau.

<HEAD>Icahn Charges Texaco Managers `Blundered'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Carl C. Icahn, whose bid for Texaco
Inc. was rejected last week, on Tuesday charged the oil giant
``engaged in a continuing series of damaging managerial blunders.''
   In an amended counterclaim in response to a lawsuit filed by
Texaco, Icahn contends Texaco ``deliberately concealed information
(and) made false and misleading statements to its stockholders.''
   Texaco said in a statement from its White Plains, N.Y.,
headquarters that the counterclaim was ``utterly groundless.'' The
company said it would respond in detail through the normal
litigation process.
   Icahn, who offered to acquire Texaco for $60 a share in a bid
that values the company at $14.6 billion, complained that the
company did not tell shareholders it offered him greenmail, which
he has said he rejected. He also charged that Texaco condoned the
misuse of corporate assets in a California real estate venture.
   Icahn said Texaco approached him with a third-party buyer
willing to pay $50 a share for his stake in the oil giant, and said
he rejected the offer because it ``smacked of greenmail.''
   In the original counterclaim, Icahn and his affiliates claimed
that Texaco and four directors made misleading statements in proxy
material distributed to shareholders.
   The counterclaim charges the acts are ``part of a management
scheme to entrench itself to the detriment of the stockholders.''
   Icahn has launched his own proxy fight in an attempt to win five
seats on Texaco's board of directors and has extended his tender
offer until Texaco's annual meeting on June 17.
   Texaco President and Chief Executive Officer James Kinnear, who
is cited in Icahn's counterclaim along with three others, has been
skeptical of Icahn's ability to finance the buyout.
   As Texaco's largest shareholder, Icahn controls 14.8 percent of
the oil giant's outstanding shares.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission said
Tuesday it would conduct an internal investigation in the wake of a
federal judge's finding of sexual harassment at the agency's
regional office here.
   Chairman David Ruder ordered the agency to hire two outside
counsel: one to investigate possible disciplinary action against
SEC officials involved in the case and another to review the
agency's equal employment procedures, said spokeswoman Mary McCue.
   The agency, meanwhile, is trying to reach a settlement with
staff attorney Catherine Broderick, who won favorable judgment last
month from U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt on her sexual
harassment suit.
   Pratt found that Ms. Broderick was forced to work in a
``sexually hostile'' atmosphere where male supervisors had romantic
relationships with seceretaries, who received promotions and
bonuses.
   The judge also ruled that Ms. Broderick was passed over for
promotions and given a negative evaluation after she complained.
   Emphasizing that the agency still has not decided whether to
appeal Pratt's decision, Ms. McCue said SEC lawyers are negotiating
with Ms. Broderick's attorneys over how to resolve the case.
   Pratt ordered both sides to submit proposals for compensating
Ms. Broderick, remedies which could promotions and back pay.
   A hearing, which was scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed
until June 16 to give both sides more time to discuss a way to
resolve the case, Ms. McCue said.
   Following the ruling, Ruder, who became chairman last year, said
he was distressed by the judge's decision.
   The events covered by the lawsuit occurred during the tenure of
John S.R. Shad, Ruder's predecessor who is now U.S. ambassador to
the Netherlands. Pratt found that Shad and the agency's executive
director, George Kundahl, were aware of Ms. Broderick's allegations
in early 1984.
   A 1986 investigation by the SEC's equal employment opportunity
office found ``no nexus between (Ms. Broderick's) complaint and the
other activities that were going on in the office.''
   Pratt concluded that two officials of the Washington regional
office in Arlington, Va., made sexually suggestive remarks to Ms.
Broderick.
   He also concluded that the testimony of several officials was
``deserving little credence'' and in the case of one was was ``in
material respects false and incredible.''

   The complex procedures by which Congress
approves spending and tax plans are badly in need of reform
including adoption of a two-year budget cycle, witnesses told a
national commission Tuesday.
   The National Economic Commission, created by Congress to
recommend ways to solve the government's budget woes, heard a
variety of recommendations ranging from decreasing the number of
congressional committees involved in budget writing to giving the
president authority to refuse to spend money appropriated by
Congress.
   But all of the witnesses cautioned the commission against
spending too much time looking into the budget process, saying this
was not the main flaw which has led to record federal deficits
during the Reagan years.
   ``Creation of the deficit was the result of a series of policy
mistakes and miscalculations, both economic and political, that
process changes probably would not have prevented,'' said Alice
Rivlin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office.
   ``Fixing the deficit requires having the political courage to
face up to the problem and agree on a package of spending cuts
and-or tax increases that will correct it,'' she said.
   The 12-member commission, headed by Washington attorney Robert
Strauss and former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis, was holding
its second public hearing with a goal of coming up with a set of
recommendations for the new president and Congress by Dec. 21.
   The witnesses Tuesday all recommended switching from the current
annual budgets, which have tied up Congress in unending debate, to
a two-year budget cycle.
   ``A two-year budget approved in the first year of each
congressional term would substantially reduce the current burden of
preparing and approving budgets in both the administration and
Congress,'' said William Niskanen, former member of President
Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers.
   Niskanen also suggested that Congress had gone too far in
restricting presidential power when it passed the Impoundment
Control Act of 1974. That law prevented President Nixon and his
successors from simply refusing to spend money appropriated by
Congress. Any such ``impoundment'' of funds would have to be
specifically approved by a positive vote in both the House and the
Senate.
   ``In effect, appropriations are now both a ceiling and a floor
on spending and there is no way to run a complex organization under
these constraints,'' Niskanen said. ``The restrictions on
impoundment authority should be recognized as an overreaction to
the abuses of presidential authority during the Watergate era.''
   Stephen Bell, former executive director of the Senate Budget
Committee, said he believed the government would have a
``substantially smaller deficit'' currently if the president still
had authority to refuse to spend appropriated money.
   Bell said that any reforms should seek to make the process more
understandable to the general public.
   ``The present process has descended into almost a cult of
mysteries, reminiscent of the pagan cults of 2,000 years ago,'' he
said. ``We need to change that so that more Americans can
participate intelligently in this critical debate on fiscal policy
and national priorities.''
   Bell recommended combining many of the budgeting functions now
shared by numerous congressional committees, restricting the types
of amendments that can be offered to budget bills in the Senate and
giving the president the ability to veto individual items in a
spending bill, a proposal long sought by President Reagan.
   Ms. Rivlin suggested that the administration should consider
consolidating its own budget functions now scattered between the
Office of Management and Budget, the Treasury Department and the
Council of Economic Advisers into a single Cabinet agency
responsible to the president for overall economic policy-making.
   ``The creaky, over-burdened budget process badly needs
simplification,'' Ms. Rivlin said. ``The commission could do a
major national service by emphasizing this fact and pointing the
parties in a constructive direction.''

<HEAD>Nelson Bunker Hunt Tells His Story</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Bunker Hunt testified Tuesday that
inflation and world political events _ and not a plot by him and
his brothers to corner the world silver market _ led prices to
rocket in the late 1970s.
   In his first day of testimony in a multi-million dollar civil
trial at federal court, Hunt essentially repeated assertions made
by defense lawyers in their opening statements last February.
   Hunt, 62, his brothers William Herbert Hunt, 58, and Lamar Hunt,
55, are being sued by a South American silver concern that claims
the Dallas, Tex. brothers conspired to corner the world silver
market between September 1979 and January 1980.
   Lawyers for Minpeco SA, a mineral marketing company owned by the
Peruvian government, claim the Hunts and several co-defendants were
responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about $9 an
ounce to more than $50 an ounce.
   Minpeco claims the skyrocketing prices caused it to lose more
than $100 million when the world silver market collapsed in March
1980, with prices falling back to about $10 an ounce.
   But the rotund elder Hunt brother claimed he began investing in
silver bullion and silver futures because of ``continuing inflation
and certain political events.''
   Hunt, who said he began investing in silver in 1973, said that
by the fall of 1979 he was still telling people that ``silver was
an overall good investment.''
   But 1979 was ``a very unsettling year politically,'' said Hunt,
in a low Texas drawl, noting the Iranian revolution that ousted the
shah and took American diplomats hostage in Teheran; a continuing
increase in oil prices; the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the
seizure of the Grand Mosque at Mecca by Islamic radicals.
   Hunt, whose legendary father, H.L. Hunt, made the family fortune
in oil, said as oil prices began climbing _ to about $30 a barrel
in late 1979 _ he bought more and more silver.
   But he claimed new commodity exchange rules limiting the number
of futures contracts that could be held as well as increasing the
amount to be put down on margin accounts ``was a difficult thing
for the market.''

<TEXT>
   President Jose Sarney announced
Tuesday the discovery of a massive oil deposit in Brazil's far
northern region that he said could be as large as Europe's North
Sea reserves.
   ``We are certain we have found a region as rich in oil as
Britain and Norway's North Sea,'' Sarney told journalists late
Tuesday. He did not give figures about the actual amount of oil
thought to be in the zone.
   The remaining proven reserves of oil in the British continental
shelf amount to 750 million metric tons, while the total remaining
reserves could be as high as 4.12 billion metric tons, according to
the Central Office of Information in London.
   Brazil's state-run Petrobras oil company and, under a risk
contract, Texaco Oil of the United States, have been exploring the
Marajo Island region in Para state, near the mouth of the Amazon
River.
   However, little more than one month ago Brazil announced it had
suspended its risk contract with Texaco, which nevertheless has
continued to drill in the region.
   In the 1970s, major offshore finds were made off the coast of
Rio de Janeiro state, bringing up Brazil's domestic oil production
to 60 percent of consumption.
   Current production is around 600,000 barrels a day and Brazil
has cut its oil-import bill by billions of dollars annually.
   The newest oil find is 2,277 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
Because of the late hour of the announcement there was no one at
Petrobras to comment.

<TEXT>
   Striking scriptwriters and television and
film producers failed to reach an agreement Tuesday to end the
11-week work stoppage that has shut down most Hollywood production,
but they agreed to meet again Wednesday.
   A negotiating session with a federal mediator present began at 9
a.m. and ended shortly before 7:30 p.m., said to Cheryl Rhoden, a
spokeswoman for the 9,000-member Writers Guild of America.
   Ms. Rhoden declined to characterize the session.
   ``We had sidebar sessions and caucuses, but there was no full
committee negotiations _ although everyone was present,'' Ms.
Rhoden said. The WGA spokeswoman had said earlier that full
committee bargaining had been expected to begin Tuesday afternoon.
Both sides agreed to resume their meeting at 3 p.m. Wednesday.
   Ms. Rhoden added that picketing in the strike that opened March
7 would resume Wednesday morning at the Paramount studios in
Hollywood.
   The sessions are being conducted under the auspices of
Commissioner Leonard Farrell of the Federal Mediation Service at
the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
headquarters in suburban Sherman Oaks, 20 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles.
   The talks followed a Memorial Day holiday weekend break during
which both sides studied the impact of last week's overwhelming WGA
ratification of a model contract with 73 independent producers.
   The talks followed a Memorial Day holiday weekend break during
which both sides studied the impact of last week's overwhelming
ratification by the writers' guild of a model contract with 73
independent producers.
   The independent contract, which permits immediate employment of
an estimated 400 writers, covers such programs as ``The Cosby
Show,'' and ``The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.''
   The three-year waiver contracts grant the writers' key demand:
retention of the present formula for the residual payments that
writers get for syndication of one-hour television shows.
   The union touted a split in management ranks, but alliance
spokesman Herb Steinberg said the 73 independent contracts cover
only a few guild members and none of the concerns involved were
major companies.
