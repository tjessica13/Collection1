<HEAD>Once in a Blue Moon: Moment Arrives</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If you've been waiting for something that only
happens once in a blue moon: it's time.
   The second full moon in the same month, known in folklore as a
``Blue Moon,'' will occur at 6:53 a.m. EDT Tuesday, according to
the experts at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington. A full
moon also occurred May 1.
   The term is applied because of the rarity of the situation. The
moon does not necessarily appear blue.
   As seen from Earth, the time between one full moon and the next
is 29{ days, a span called the moon's synodic period.
   This means that, technically, two full moons could occur in any
month except February. The occasion happens rarely, however, only
about once every two to three years.
   Some folks, including meteorologists, contend that the term
``Blue Moon'' should apply to occasions when the moon takes on a
blue coloration. This can happen when small particles in the
atmosphere inferfere with light, causing the bluish tint.
   The particles can come from such sources as forest fires and
volcanic eruptions. This, too, is a rare happening _ about once in
a blue moon.

<HEAD>Refusenik Family Waited In Vain For Reagans' Visit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Twelve-year-old Vera Zeiman, an Orphan Annie
look-alike with cherubic cheeks and frizzy curls, has been waiting
nearly all her life to leave the Soviet Union. On Sunday, she
waited in vain for President Reagan.
   Reagan had considered a private visit to Vera and her Jewish
refusenik parents, but U.S. sources said the drop-in was scrubbed
after word filtered to White House planners it could hurt the
Zeimans' chance to emigrate.
   Knowing they had no guarantee but unaware things had changed,
the Zeimans prepared for a presidential visit. Vera and her mother,
Tanya, put on their best dresses, baked a honey cake and tidied
their tiny, three-room apartment.
   Outside, about 300 local residents gaped at a swarm of Soviet
police presence, the fresh paint on the Zeimans' apartment house
and newly raked flower beds nearby. They waited around, since
something unusual certainly seemed in the offing.
   ``When we started to apply to emigrate, I thought it would not
be easy for us,'' sighed Tanya as she gazed at the crowd on the
street. ``The one thing I didn't want to attract is publicity, the
mob, like this.''
   A U.S. official who asked not to be identified said White House
planners scrubbed consideration of a Zieman visit after the Soviets
passed word that the Ziemans would never leave the country if
Reagan went to their home.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied Sunday there ever
were definite plans for the Zieman visit, saying only that a number
of sites were scouted for potential Reagan trips.
   The Ziemans, Moscow Jews who first sought to emigrate in 1977,
are among the refuseniks invited to meet Reagan Monday afternoon at
Spaso House, the U.S. ambassador's residence, where he is staying
while in Moscow.
   The president and his wife Nancy reportedly have taken a special
interest in their case since Vera, who calls herself ``a lifelong
refusenik,'' wrote to the Reagans April 4 asking for help.
   A White House official, Roman Popadiuk, told reporters that
Reagan on Sunday gave Gorbachev a list of 14 cases of refuseniks,
divided spouses and consular matters the United States wants
resolved. The presentation of such lists has become a regular part
of high-level meetings between U.S. and Soviet officials.
   Several dozen Jews known as ``refuseniks'' because they have
been refused permission to emigrate and thousands of newer Jewish,
German and Armenian emigres have received exit visas in recent
months.
   But U.S. officials say at least 2,000 Soviet Jews still have
applications pending, and human rights issues in general remain a
contentious issue for the five-day summit between Reagan and
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Like many other refuseniks, the Ziemans are denied permission to
emigrate on grounds of alleged danger to state security.
   After the Ziemans applied to emigrate, Tanya lost her job as an
English professor and Yuri lost his as an advanced computer
specialist, working as a hospital plumber until ill health forced
him to stop last fall.
   Their elder daughter Galya got out of the Soviet Union last
year, apparently because authorities did not realize from her
married name of Khatutsky that she was a member of the Zieman
family. She now lives in Boston, Mass., campaigning for her
family's emigration.
   Yuri has been suffering from hepatitis and an undiagnosed
condition that gives him double vision _ and knows a cure.
   ``The best medicine I need now is a visa,'' he joked Sunday.
``It will treat me and it will be the greatest achievement of
Soviet medicine.''
   The first hint of a Reagan visit to the Ziemans came when U.S.
scouting officials visited their home last week.
   A few days later, the Soviets apparently got wind of the
tentative plan and started cleaning up the Ziemans' neighborhood.
   But the people hoping to catch a glimpse of the first American
president to visit Moscow since 1972 were skeptical nothing would
happen, even when a police car drove past, blaring ``Nothing will
happen here today'' from a loudspeaker.
   ``That's perestroika for you,'' yelled one local, referring to
Gorbachev's restructuring reforms. ``They don`t tell you anything.''

<HEAD>Little Hope To Stop Epidemic That Has Killed 300 Seals In A Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYLT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German officials say they do not
think a remedy will quickly be found for a viral infection that has
killed more than 300 North Sea seals this month.
   The seals have been infected by what some scientists think is a
herpes virus. Since the beginning of May, 306 seals were found dead
on the Danish coast and another 30 on this North Sea island.
   Scientists from Denmark, West Germany and the Netherlands plan
to meet this week in Kiel, West Germany, to attempt to determine
what is killing the seals.
   Several West German scientists who have examined the remains of
some seals said on national television that the animals died of
apparent pneumonia.
   Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer visited Sylt on Sunday and
told reporters there is little authorities can now do to save the
seals. He said that whatever is killing the seals does not seem to
stem directly from the growing amount of industrial waste in the
North Sea.

<HEAD>White House Downplays Soviet Threat of Ending Pullout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   A White House spokesman said he expects the Red
Army to complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan despite Soviet
warnings that the continued shipment of U.S.-bought weapons to
anti-communist guerrillas there jeopardizes the pullout.
   For three days, the Soviets have been complaining that the
United States and Pakistan have been sending aid to the
anti-communist Mujahedeen guerrillas of Afghanistan in violation of
the Geneva accords under which the Red Army is being withdrawn.
   ``It's our attitude that the agreement was signed and the Soviet
Union entered into it and said it would pull its troops out,''
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told a news conference on Sunday, the
opening day of the Moscow summit.
   Said Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman:
``According to a treaty signed between Pakistan and Afghanistan,
both these countries have taken upon themselves the commitment not
to interfere in the other's internal affairs...''
   ``But (from) the last facts we know that massive transportation
_ transfer of armaments from Pakistan to Afghanistan, of course,
brings us concern,'' said Gerasimov, appearing at the same news
conference as Fitzwater after Sunday's summit meeting between
President Reagan and Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Earlier, the Kremlin hinted that the arms shipments might slow
the withdrawal of the estimated 105,500 Soviet troops remaining in
Afghanistan.
   A statement from the Soviet Ministry, carried by the Tass news
agency on Saturday and the newspaper Pravda on Sunday, said Moscow
``would draw pertinent conclusions with respect to the timetable of
the troops withdrawal and take concrete steps called for by the
illicit actions of Islamabad,'' the capital of Pakistan.
   The Foreign Ministry statement did not mention the United States
by name. However, on Saturday, and aide to Gorbachev leveled the
accusation directly at Washington.
   Yevgeny Primakov, who is head of the Institute on World Economy
and International Relations and has advised Gorbachev on
Afghanistan, told a pre-summit news conference on Friday that the
Americans were ``arming quite openly those who wish to go on in the
civil war.''
   Fitzwater said that the Soviet pull-out has started and ``I
assume that everyone knew the rules at the signing of the agreement
and that the pull-out will continue.''
   Besides the main Geneva accord, signed by the Afghan and
Pakistan governments, the United States and Soviet Union exchanged
letters saying that they would continue sending aid to their Afghan
allies as long as the other did the same.
   The Soviets reportedly have turned over to the Afghan regime
massive caches of arms as well as entire military bases as the Red
Army withdraws.
   The United States reportedly sends the Afghan guerrillas arms
and aid worth about $500 million a year, but American officials do
not discuss the program openly.

<DATELINE>EL AYOUN, Western Sahara (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 12 years as a guerrilla
fighter, Cherif Hassana put his turban on the end of his rifle and
surrendered to Moroccan soldiers. Bachir Hammed slipped away from a
guerrilla-sponsored soccer team during an overseas tour.
   With the declining fortunes of the Marxist-led Polisario
independence movement in the Western Sahara, more and more
guerrillas are deserting the movement and drifting back across the
desert to join the Moroccan side.
   Moroccan officials say the deserters are arriving at an average
rate of about 10 a week.
   A group of foreign reporters met many of them on a recent
government-sponsored tour of the Moroccan-annexed Western Sahara.
   Usually talking in the presence of Moroccan officials, they
painted a grim picture of conditions in refugee and guerrilla camps
in the Polisario Front's Algerian sanctuaries.
   The Algerian-backed Polisario Front claims that more than
165,000 refugees are living in tent camps around the Algerian oasis
of Tindouf after fleeing ``Moroccan oppression.'' The Moroccans say
about two-thirds of the refugees are not even from the disputed
territory.
   All deserters interviewed had fled before May 16, when Algeria
and Morocco made their surprise announcement of resumed diplomatic
relations after hovering on the brink of war over the Sahara for
more than 12 years.
   Several said the Polisario must have felt the announcement like
a ``stab in the back'' from Algeria.
   ``It must have been a terrible shock,'' said Cherif Hassana, 35,
who fought in the Polisario's ranks for 12 years, rising to the
rank of major and deputy company commander among the estimated
8,000 guerrillas.
   ``For all these years, the Algerians promised they would never
establish relations with Morocco until the Sahara had become
independent.''
   Like many other deserters, Hassana claimed he was recruited by
force in 1975, at the end of Spanish colonial rule in the Western
Sahara. He previously served as an enlisted man in the Spanish
colonial army.
   ``I was on leave in my family's tent in the desert,'' he said.
``Polisario men came in Land-Rovers and grabbed me.''
   He said he gradually became disillusioned and began looking for
opportunities to escape.
   ``It was not easy,'' he said. ``We were all under constant
supervision, even the officers. Many who tried to escape were
killed by their own units or by the mines in the desert.''
   He said he managed to get away in a vehicle while on patrol near
Morocco's 1,500-mile defensive wall.
   ``I put my turban on the end of my rifle as a sign of
surrender,'' Hassana said.
   Bachir Hammed, 23, was sent to France as captain of a Polisario
soccer team purporting to represent Hawza, a desert settlement 100
miles inside the Moroccan wall.
   Hawza has been under Moroccan control for more than five years,
but the team was welcomed to French cities with Communist-led city
councils eager to promote the Polisario, Hammed said.
   He slipped away while passing through Paris and took a taxi to
the Moroccan Embassy.
   ``Most of us realized long ago that Polisario is losing the
war,'' said Abderrahman Kharbouch, 32, a guerrilla platoon
commander who fled across the desert. ``But everyone is afraid and
tends to keep his feelings to himself.''
   The highest ranking deserter to reach Moroccan lines thus far is
Mohamed Ramdan, 34, former deputy chief of the Polisario diplomatic
mission to the Organization of African Unity. The OAU has
recognized the Polisario as a full-ranking member.
   Fadli Rguibi, 38, walked across the Moroccan border near Figuig
under cover of darkness. Now a Moroccan soldier, his only regret is
that he had to leave his wife and daughter behind in Algeria. The
wife, he said, will probably be forced to marry someone else.
   ``The Polisario leadership insists that all men must have two or
three wives because so many men got killed and they want to keep up
the birthrate,'' he said.
   Numerous deserters claimed that wives of deserters or men killed
in battle were forcibly married to other Polisario men.
   Boucheiba Buchara, 38, said he had to leave his wife and two
sons in the camps.
   ``God know what happened to them,'' he said. ``I'm sure if I
ever meet my wife again, she will be married to someone else.''
   In Paris, Polisario's chief representative in Europe, Mohamed
Sidati, said such claims are ``a monstrous lie of Moroccan
propaganda.''
   But he said Islamic law allows a deserted wife to take a new
husband after a waiting period of four months.

<HEAD>Jackson Says `Life Goes On' After the Campaign</HEAD>

   With little more than a week remaining in
the Democratic primary season, Jesse Jackson was urging followers
to ``never forget this campaign'' _ and reminding them that ``life
goes on'' when the race is over.
   Jackson was campaigning Sunday in New Jersey, where polls
indicate he trails Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis in next
week's primary race. Jackson also lags far behind in the national
delegate count.
   But Jackson said his campaign themes have become part of the
national agenda, and that he is helping to chart the course of the
Democratic Party. He also said the other candidates _ both Dukakis
and Republican George Bush _ had incorporated his ideas into their
own campaigns.
   ``When Bush is fighting against drugs ...Jesse Jackson is
winning every day,'' he said.
   California, Montana and New Mexico hold primaries on June 7,
along with New Jersey. As he campaigned here, Jackson was already
looking beyond the outcome of those races.
   ``When the race is over June 7, life goes on June 8,'' Jackson
said. ``We should never forget this campaign.''
   At a labor rally at John F. Kennedy High School, Jackson drew a
crowd of 1,500 who packed a stuffy auditorium where the
temperatures were well into the 90s. Jackson renewed his call for a
higher minimum wage and equal compensation for women workers.
   ``Something has gone awry. Profits are up, wages are down.
Plants are closing. Workers are working more and more and making
less and less,'' he said to cheers.
   At a news conference in Paterson, N.J., Jackson said his staff
had been frequently conferring with the Dukakis campaign.
   ``Both of us have certainly earned the right to each other's
consideration,'' Jackson said. ``And we're doing that with
enthusiasm. Together we're gonna win.''
   In recent days, Jackson has been making foreign policy and
domestic policy statements, indicating he hopes to see them become
part of the Democratic platform. Last week in California, he
released a five-year budget plan calling for a freeze in military
spending.
   Also in California, he sought to persuade Dukakis to agree that
South Africa should be declared a terrorist state. Dukakis,
however, has said economic sanctions should be a first step against
the apartheid regime.

<TEXT>
   The Most Rev. James A. Hickey, archbishop of
the nation's capital, says he was ``truly honored, very humbled and
deeply grateful'' to be named a cardinal in the Roman Catholic
Church.
   Hickey and Detroit Archbishop Edmund C. Szoka were among 25
church leaders the Vatican announced Sunday would be added to the
College of Cardinals. They are to be installed on June 29. Hickey
will remain leader of the Washington-area diocese.
   ``In the years remaining for me, I shall strive to be a caring
pastor, a faithful teacher, a loving father and brother, and a true
servant of the people of God in the District of Columbia and the
five counties of Maryland,'' Hickey said.
   ``I am truly honored, very humbled and deeply grateful that our
Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, has chosen me to serve as a
cardinal of the church,'' he said in a prepared statement.
   Hickey, 67, has become a key figure in dealing with the U.S.
government on issues affecting the church in Central America. Two
of four nuns murdered in El Salvador in 1980 had been under his
jurisdiction as bishop of Cleveland.
   He had earlier ridden in the van in which they were murdered.
Also in 1980, he attended the tumultuous funeral of his friend,
assassinated Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero.
   Hickey was described by the Washington magazine ``Regardie's''
in 1985 as Washington's ``most unlikely power broker'' and one of a
few Catholic churchmen who are determined to make their church more
a part of the real world.
   The magazine said Hickey has lobbied for increased spending to
aid the poor, tried to convince members of Congress to stop giving
aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, and pushed for Catholic bishops to
take strong stands in favor of nuclear disarmament and against
increased military spending.
   Hickey is often described as a conservative on church issues,
but publicly expressed compassion last year when a Catholic priest
in his diocese died of AIDS.
   Hickey said he encouraged the Rev. Michael R. Peterson to
disclose the nature of his illness but never asked the priest how
he contracted the disease, which is transmitted through intimate
sexual contact, infected needles used in illegal drug use or
contaminated blood transfusions.
   The archbishop said he wanted to demonstrate that compassion for
AIDS patients is as much a part of church teaching as its rejection
of homosexual relations.
   Hickey, born in Midland, Mich., was ordained a priest in Saginaw
in 1946 and organized a ministry to Spanish-speaking migrants who
came to Michigan to work each year.
   He also has had extensive church experience in Rome, earning a
doctorate in canon law at Pontifical Lateran University and a
doctorate in theology at Pontifical Angelicum University, before
returning to work as secretary to the bishop of Saginaw for nine
years.
   He became a bishop in 1967 and rector of the Pontifical North
American College in Rome in 1969 and was also president of the
Association of Roman Seminary Rectors.
   Hickey became bishop of Cleveland in 1974, participating with
other religious leaders in a demonstration supporting court-ordered
busing of black students to achieve racial balance in public
schools.
   Hickey has been bishop of Washington for eight years. The
archdiocese includes 131 Catholic parishes with about 400,000
church members in the District of Columbia and Montgomery, Prince
George's, Calvert, Charles and St. Mary's counties in Maryland.
   As Washington archbishop, Hickey is also chancellor of the
Catholic University of America and chairman of the board of
trustees of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in
Washington.
   Since 1979, he has been chairman of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops Committee on doctrine.

   A furniture store owner who had wanted
to hear the sound of a piano dropped from a helicopter left money
in his will allowing 300 people to hear an English upright's thud,
crash, kapow, bang and boom.
   ``It's the kind of thing he loved,'' said Jerry Reed, who
described himself as John ``J.C.'' Cameron Young's drinking buddy.
``I think he would have thought it was wild. Life was a crazy
experience for him, and he had his foot to the floorboard.''
   Young died of under unexplained circumstances three years ago at
age 44. He was found in his car at the bottom of a ravine. His will
specified that $15,000 from his $800,000 estate go for a party for
his friends. It cost $2,000 to arrange the piano plunge Saturday.
   ``It seemed like a good way to spend his money,'' said party
planner Len Nordeman, of San Francisco.
   Repeating a stunt that Young helped arrange more than 20 years
ago while a student at the University of Washington, a 300-pound
English upright was dropped 200 feet from a helicopter so Young's
friends could relish the sound in his honor.
   Onlookers surged forward to collect ivory keys and splinters as
souvenirs of the outrageous memorial. A big party was thrown
afterward for the 300 people who showed up.
   Jill Wesstrom flew in from Dallas to watch the stunt.
   ``I loved him,'' she said. ``He was a very special individual.
Introspective. I don't know, sensitive.''

<HEAD>Boisjoly Finally Free Of Guilt Over Challenger Disaster</HEAD>

   A former Morton Thiokol engineer who
argued against launching the space shuttle Challenger says he has
stopped blaming himself for the explosion that killed its seven
astronauts and is ready to go back to work.
   After two years of therapy and ``the positive catharsis'' of
lectures on the disaster, Roger Boisjoly is seeking to reclaim the
career that was shattered when the Challenger blew up.
   ``For a long time, I bore the burden of guilt because I hadn't
done more to stop it,'' he said last week. ``But I've resolved it
now. I did everything I could.''
   Like several other engineers with rocket manufacturer Morton
Thiokol, Boisjoly argued fiercely the night before the Jan. 28,
1986, launch that temperatures of 53 degrees Fahrenheit or lower
could result in a failure of a rocket joint seal, endangering the
shuttle and crew.
   But after a second caucus with officials of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, Boisjoly said, company
managers ``perceived pressure from NASA. ... I felt the pressure,
others felt the pressure.''
   Boisjoly and others at Morton Thiokol's Utah plant watched on
television as the shuttle, rising above Cape Canaveral after a
night of freezing temperatures, blew apart 73 seconds after liftoff.
   After testifying before the presidential commission that
investigated the disaster, he felt ostracized by Morton Thiokol. On
July 21, 1986, Boisjoly took disability leave. He quit the
following September.
   He was diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress
syndrome.
   With his disability benefits from Morton Thiokol due to run out
by year's end, Boisjoly plans to use his remaining time and income
``to get my life back together.''
   Because he's 50 and unemployed, Boisjoly said, getting a new job
is ``not going to be a cakewalk.''
   Boisjoly said he probably will return to engineering, although
not in the aerospace business. A Tampa company tentatively offered
a job after a lecture at the University of Southern Florida.
   He declined to talk about the therapy he underwent. Instead,
Boisjoly spoke about his recent series of lectures at colleges and
professional societies, where he recounts Challenger-related events
from Jan. 25, 1986, until now.
   ``I dwell on the final chart, the decision-making chart that
came out of the caucus. There's not a single statement on the chart
that supports the launch,'' he said. ``That's when my audience just
looks horrified. They can't believe anybody would launch.''
   A mechanical engineer, Boisjoly had been in aerospace for 27
years, six at Morton Thiokol, before resigning.
   ``I saw the industry get broken over 20 years. We've gone from
companies considering employees as an asset to considering them
replaceable parts ... based on the bottom line of maximum
short-term profits,'' he said. ``It's the forced-march approach to
management. It simply doesn't work. It leads to decisions based on
money and schedules.''
   Boisjoly has little faith in the redesigned rocket booster to be
used in the launch of the shuttle Discovery, scheduled for August.
   ``I think the pressures are worse now,'' he said. ``They give
the appearance of returning to safe flight, but they're still
trying to return to schedule, and that's coming from top
management.''
   Morton Thiokol officials declined comment on Boisjoly's
assertions.
   Still pending is a pair of lawsuits Boisjoly filed against
Morton Thiokol.
   One seeks $1 billion for the seven astronauts' deaths and $1
million in compensatory damages for his own health and career. The
other, filed on behalf of U.S. taxpayers, seeks $2.075 billion and
alleges that Morton Thiokol knowingly provided NASA with defective
solid rocket motors.
   The lawsuits, said his attorney, Robert Levin, are Boisjoly's
way of ``trying to make sense of and extract some good from a
terrible tragedy. It's very important to him that the right lessons
be learned from what happened with Challenger.''
   Said Boisjoly: ``I'm asked in my talks if I'd do it again. I'd
do it again in a minute. What's right is right, and this was a
clear-cut case of what's wrong.''

   A scientist detected electrical changes in
the ground before a killer earthquake jolted Los Angeles last year,
but he and other researchers remain skeptical that such phenomena
can be used to predict temblors.
   The electrical signals measured by Massachusetts Institute of
Technology geophysicist Theodore Madden are smaller than those
detected in Greece by scientists who claimed they used their
measurements to successfully predict strong earthquakes beneath the
Ionian Sea on May 18 and 22.
   Many seismologists have been skeptical of the Greek claims and
of any link between quakes and variations in underground electrical
voltages.
   But Madden is highly respected, and his findings will spur
scientists to consider carefully the usefulness of electrical
changes in predicting quakes, said Don Anderson, seismology
laboratory director at the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena.
   ``The technique is unproven, but I'm not going to naysay
anything Ted Madden does,'' said Allan Lindh, a U.S. Geological
Survey scientist researching earthquake prediction. ``Madden is one
of the smartest guys I've ever met in my life. Electrical
experiments done by Madden are in a different class than those by
anyone else in the world.''
   Madden remains unconvinced by his own observations. He said it
may be pure coincidence that there were changes in underground
electrical signals starting about two months before the
5.9-magnitude Whittier Narrows quake rocked the Los Angeles area
last Oct. 1. Measured on the Richter scale, the quake was just
under the 6-point mark considered a severe shock.
   Madden said the changes peaked one week after the quake, which,
with its aftershocks, killed eight people, injured more than 200
and caused $358 million in damage.
   ``At the moment, I don't know if it will prove to be of any
significance for earthquake prediction,'' he said last week by
phone from Cambridge, Mass.
   Madden, to measure electrical changes, rented six Pacific Bell
telephone lines, up to 30 miles long, on both sides of the San
Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles.
   He attached copper pipes to the ends of the lines and buried the
pipes, making the lines into antennas that detected two kinds of
electrical changes in the ground before the October quake.
   The first, more significant change was in the Earth's
``self-potential'' _ a voltage that scientists believe is generated
when underground water is squeezed out of pores in rocks. Changes
in underground stresses before a quake may cause such squeezing,
Madden said.
   The other, much more subtle change occurred in ``resistivity,''
which indicates how resistant rock is to the movement of electrical
currents created naturally by Earth's magnetic field. Scientists
theorize that stresses leading to quakes cause changes in
resistivity.
   ``Although the data were analyzed after the fact and were not
certain enough to have predicted the earthquake, the correlation
was tantalizing,'' said an article in the May issue of Spectrum,
published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   Madden's findings are ``very intriguing,'' yet he is cautious
about claiming the method might be used to predict quakes because
``he's probably been one of his own strongest critics,'' said
geophysicist Stephen Park, a former Madden student now working at
the University of California, Riverside.
   Park said he is using a similar method to watch for electrical
changes along the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield, where the USGS
predicts a quake measuring about 6 on the Richter scale is likely
to occur by early 1993.
   Such quakes rock Parkfield roughly every 22 years, so scientists
have installed hundreds of instruments in an attempt to predict the
next jolt a few days before it occurs, said Lindh, who heads the
project.
   Madden is skeptical of his findings because he detected the
electrical changes near Palmdale, Castaic, Placerita Canyon,
Sunland and Azusa _ places 15 to 50 miles north of the epicenter of
the October quake. He used phone lines only in those locations
because he was watching for electrical changes along the San
Andreas, not along the unmapped fault that caused the October jolt.
   Madden said it is possible the electrical variations were caused
by changes in groundwater runoff from the nearby San Gabriel
Mountains and not by pre-quake stresses in the Earth.
   But Anderson said a respected Japanese geophysicist, S. Uyeda,
also has studied the possibility of predicting quakes based on
electrical voltage changes and ``is convinced there is some merit
in the method.''

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Edmund C. Szoka, named to the college of
cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church, says his promotion reflects
more favorably on the Archdiocese of Detroit than on himself.
   Szoka, 60, the son of Polish immigrant parents, has headed the
nation's fifth-largest archdiocese since 1981. He was among 25
church leaders promoted Sunday by Pope John Paul II. They will be
formally elevated during ceremonies June 28 at the Vatican.
   The archbishop said during a news conference at his home on
Sunday that he learned of his promotion May 21 by telephone from
Archbishop Pio Laghi, the pope's representative in the United
States. He later received a formal letter signed by the pope, whose
U.S. tour last fall ended in Detroit.
   ``I am deeply moved and honored by the Holy Father's decision,''
Szoka said in a prepared statement. ``I am most grateful to His
Holiness for the trust and confidence reflected by his decision to
elevate me to the college of cardinals.
   ``At the same time, I recognize that this honor goes far beyond
any personal accomplishments on my part,'' he added. ``It is
clearly rooted in the position I hold as the archbishop of Detroit.
... The honor given to me as a cardinal of the church is meant to
honor this entire metropolis.''
   Szoka said his new duties would not affect his administration of
the Detroit archdiocese, which has 1.49 million members and nearly
1,000 priests in 331 parishes in six counties of southeast Michigan.
   ``It'll be the same ministry. I'll carry on the same functions
whether I'm cardinal or not,'' he said. ``The fact that I may have
greater visibility may help the church. All of you (reporters)
being here today gives the church a little more exposure, and that
helps.''
   Szoka becomes the third consecutive head of the Detroit
archdiocese to be made a cardinal. The Rev. Edward Mooney,
archbishop from 1939-58, and the Rev. John Dearden, archbishop from
1959-81, preceded him.
   The other American archbishop promoted Sunday was the Rev. James
Hickey of Washington.
   Cardinals serve on the boards of at least one of about a dozen
departments within the Vatican, said the Rev. John Zenz, Szoka's
administrative secretary. They also serve as priests of individual
parishes in Rome. Zenz said he did not know which specific
assignments Szoka would receive.
   Szoka was born in Grand Rapids of immigrant parents who divorced
when he was 2{. He was ordained in 1954 in Marquette and served 17
years as a priest there. Szoka also served for 10 years as bishop
of the Gaylord diocese in northern Michigan before succeeding
Dearden in Detroit.
   The appointments bring membership in the college of cardinals to
161, of whom 120 are under the age of 80 and eligible to vote to
elect a new pope. The number of cardinals in the United States rose
to nine with the promotions of Szoka and Hickey.
   The other three active Cardinals are Joseph Bernardin of
Chicago, John O'Connor of New York and Bernard Law of Boston.
   Those past the age limit are John Carberry, 83, of St. Louis and
Dearden, who is 80. Retired but under 80 are John Krol of
Philadelphia, 77, and Timothy Manning of Los Angeles, 78.
   In addition, three other U.S. citizens are cardinals: former
Washington Archbishop William Baum, prefect for the Vatican's
Congregation for Catholic Education; Luis Aponte Martinez,
archbishop of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Rome-based Ukrainian
Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky.

<HEAD>Teamsters Hierarchy Split by Trucking Contract, Ill Health of
Chief</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Discontent with a new nationwide trucking
contract and Teamster President Jackie Presser's worsening health
are cutting a deep fissure in the hierarchy of the country's
largest union.
   The official reaction to questions about Presser, about the
jockeying for position on who might succeed him and about the new
National Master Freight Agreement is that the union is functioning
smoothly under Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis.
   ``Everybody hopes and is operating on the expectation Jackie
will be back,'' Duke Zeller, the union's chief spokesman, said last
week. ``We all know his recuperative powers. For a power struggle
to be going on, it's awfully quiet around here.''
   However, insiders acknowledge that many of the 16 Teamster vice
presidents on the 1.6 million-member union's executive board
disagree sharply over Mathis' stewardship while Presser has been
undergoing operations and extensive chemotherapy and radiation
treatments for cancer during the past 18 months.
   The divisiveness has flared in recent weeks with the Teamsters'
acceptance of a new trucking contract covering about 200,000 of its
members despite a nearly 2-to-1 rank-and-file vote against it.
   Only half of the vice presidents showed up two weeks ago at a
resort near Scottsdale, Ariz., and some of those absent openly
opposed the new three-year labor pact with the trucking industry.
   The leader of the boycott was 70-year-old Joseph Trerotola of
New York, the ranking and possibly most influential member on the
Teamsters' board who directs the union's affairs in its biggest
stronghold, New York and New Jersey.
   An irony is that many of the board members who prevailed upon
Mathis to convene the meeting are the same ones who boycotted it.
   ``What's amazing is that this infighting has all sloshed out
into the open,'' says Ken Paff, an organizer for a dissident
faction, Teamsters for a Democratic Union. ``In the past, it's all
been kept in the family.''
   Paff's organization, which has close ties to consumer activist
Ralph Nader, filed suit on behalf of five union members in U.S.
District Court in Washington last week seeking to overturn the
trucking contract on charges of ballot fraud in the ratification
vote.
   Mathis called the claims ``ridiculous'' and accused the
plaintiffs in the suit of trying to destroy the accord and the
standards that ``the Teamsters have fought long and hard for our
members to preserve.''
   Until the union's constitution was changed two years ago,
Trerotola rather than Mathis, a friendly, 62-year-old unionist who
started his career as a business agent in an Atlanta local,
automatically would have received the nod as interim head of the
union in Presser's absence.
   Some Teamster insiders insisted last week that the
little-noticed constitutional change at the union's 1986 convention
had nothing to do with the personalities of the two men or other
top union officials.
   Instead, they described it has a housecleaning measure agreed
upon after Presser underwent a heart bypass operation in late 1983
to assure that control of the union remained with officials at its
international headquarters in Washington.
   But they and officials in other unions with close ties to the
Teamsters say the change reflects Presser's gradual and cautious
moves in the past five years to shift the balance of power in the
union from its secretive ``old guard'' to a new, more
image-conscious generation of trade unionists.
   Presser, 61, won the top post in the union in 1983 largely on
his own public relations efforts, which included serving on
President Reagan's transition team and promoting a higher Teamster
profile on Capitol Hill and in the press to counter longstanding
charges of corruption.
   Three of the past six Teamster Presidents _ David Beck, Jimmy
Hoffa and Roy Williams _ have been removed from office after being
sentenced to prison on tax evasion, jury tampering or bribery
convictions.
   However, the government has largely thwarted Presser's campaign
to improve the Teamsters' image. In late 1985, a White House
commission alleged that both Presser and his predecessor, Williams,
were handpicked for the union's presidency by organized crime
figures.
   Six months later, a federal grand jury indicted Presser on
charges of helping embezzle $700,000 from a Cleveland local, which
he also heads, through a ghost employees payroll padding scheme.
   And Mathis told the AFL-CIO's executive council two weeks ago
that the Teamsters have every reason to believe the government
still intends to file a civil suit seeking to oust all of the
union's top officials on a claim the Teamsters' leadership is
dominated by racketeers.
   Leaks from government officials about the anticipated suit last
year prompted a mutual aid pact between the Teamsters and the
AFL-CIO, which feared the precedent that a government victory might
set for other unions.
   Bitter rivals for 30 years, they re-established formal ties in
October, with the Teamsters being welcomed back into the 90-union
federation.
   The two Teamster officials most responsible for making the
reaffiliation work have been Mathis and Walter Shea, a veteran
Washington insider whose demeanor and image is more that of a State
Department diplomat than a labor leader.
   Shea, a Teamsters vice president since 1982, is believed to be
Trerotola's top choice as a challenger to Mathis to succeed Presser.
   Other possible challengers include Joseph Morgan of Hallandale,
Fla., and Donald Peters of Chicago _ both sought the job when
Williams was sentenced to prison in 1983 _ and Arnie Weinmeister of
Seattle, director of the union's Western Conference.
   ``Mathis has the inside track, but it's certainly not a smooth
one,'' says Paff of the Teamsters for a Democratic Union.
   Others closer to the Teamster leadership also expect a serious
challenge to Mathis should Presser not return following a 120-day
leave of absence after undergoing surgery to remove a pair of
cancer tumors from his brain.
   Asked if Mathis' critics could unite behind a single challenger
to deny Mathis the Teamsters' presidency, one insider said,
``That's the big question.''

<HEAD>Pope Seeks To Expand Church Influence in Soviet Union, China</HEAD>

   In naming a new batch of cardinals, Pope
John Paul II seeks to expand his church's influence in the Soviet
Union and China. But U.S. Roman Catholics may be disappointed in
their share of the 25 new red hats.
   Two new American cardinals are on the list of new ``princes''
from 18 countries announced by the pope on Sunday: Archbishops
Edmund C. Szoka, 60, of Detroit and James A. Hickey, 67, of
Washington, D.C.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the passing over of Los
Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony, 52, was the ``great exclusion''
among other possible American candidates.
   He said Mahony was bypassed because of his relative youth and is
likely to become a cardinal at a later time.
   The appointment of Szoka and Hickey will bring to five the
number of active U.S. cardinals. The others are Bernard Law of
Boston, Joseph Bernardin of Chicago and John O'Connor of New York.
   The new cardinals will be installed at a June 28 Vatican session
and bring to 161 the membership in the College of Cardinals, the
church's most important governing body. Cardinals under age 80 _
now 120 _ elect a pope's successor.
   John Paul, making the announcement during a Mass in St. Peter's
Basilica, said his choice of new cardinals underlines the
universality of the church: ``In fact, among the new cardinals
there are prelates from every continent.'' Navarro said the
Polish-born pope was seeking to bolster church influence by naming
cardinals from Lithuania, the Roman Catholic stronghold in the
Soviet Union, and Hong Kong, the British colony that passes to
Chinese Communist rule in 1997.
   ``These are not symbolic choices but they are options for the
future,'' Navarro told reporters.
   The Lithuanian prelate, Vincentas Sladkevicius, 68, was
``impeded'' by Soviet authorities from performing his religious
duties and held under virtual house arrest from 1963 to 1982, the
Vatican says.
   Sladkevicius is an historic choice, the first publicly named
cardinal from Lithuania, which was an independent republic before
World War II. At least 2 million of Lithuania's 3.5 million people
are Roman Catholics.
   There has been widespread speculation that another Lithuanian is
the cardinal the pope chose ``in pectore'' _ in his heart _ in 1979.
   Sladkevicius will be just the second residient cardinal in the
Soviet Union, following the elevation of Julijans Vaivods of Latvia
in 1985.
   John Paul has publicly disclosed that on at least two occasions
he has been refused permission to visit Lithuania.
   But there have been signs of a recent thaw in Vatican-Soviet
relations with permission given to a large Vatican delegation to
visit Moscow next month for celebrations marking the millenium of
Christianity in Russia.
   Looking toward China, the other Communist giant, the pope named
as cardinal the 63-year-old bishop of Hong Kong, John Baptist Wu
Cheng-Chung.
   There has been no resident cardinal in China since the
Communists took over after World War II.
   The last Chinese cardinal was Paul Yu Pin, archbishop of
Nanking, who was expelled after the Communist takeover and named a
cardinal in 1969. He died in Rome in 1978.
   The Hong Kong bishop recently named a committee to map church
strategy when the British colony reverts to China.
   China has given assurances about maintaining the status quo on
Hong Kong but church leaders have expressed some uncertainty about
possible change.
   China cut ties with the Vatican in 1957 and established its own
breakaway Catholic church, which now claims 3 million members. An
unknown number of other Catholics remain secretly loyal to the
pope, and several are still being held in prison for their
religious practices.
   The pope also named the first cardinal in Mozambique, a Marxist
country the pope will visit when he makes his fourth tour of Africa
in September.
   The new cardinals also include four Italians, two each from
Brazil, Spain and India, and one each from Canada, Colombia,
Australia, Hungary, Cameroon, Austria, France, West Germany,
Mauritius and Switzerland.
   In addition to voting to elect a pope, cardinals act as advisers
to the pope, serve on special Vatican commissions and often act as
de facto spokesmen for the church in their countries.

   A rowdy party erupted into a rock- and
bottle-throwing melee involving 2,000 people that ended early
Sunday with three police officers injured and 23 people under
arrest, authorities said.
   Isla Vista officers were called to a home in the area about
12:30 a.m. by reports of a large, noisy party and asked the
revelers to disperse, Santa Barbara County deputy L. Hess said.
   ``They failed to do so, in a big way,'' he said.
   Party-goers, apparently joined by other people in the area, set
fire to trash bins and hurled debris that damaged two sheriff's
cars.
   A deputy, a highway patrol officer and another law enforcement
officer were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and 23
people were arrested on various charges, Hess said.
   It took more than three hours to quell the brawl near the
University of California, Santa Barbara, and sheriff's deputies had
to call in more deputies, campus police and the California Highway
Patrol, authorities said.

   Gov. Ray Mabus, elected on a pledge that
Mississippi never again would be last, came away from his first
legislative session with less than half of his reform package
approved but his optimism undiminished.
   For November's election, the 39-year-old Harvard-educated lawyer
and former state auditor built a coalition of blacks, urban
professionals and those pushing for change to fend off the
strongest challenge by a Republican gubernatorial candidate this
century.
   He pledged to end the longstanding reign of ``good ol' boy''
politics, public corruption, a poor education system and widespread
illiteracy, high unemployment and low-paying jobs.
   To that end, Mabus took a four-point program to lawmakers in
January calling for government reorganization; increased spending
for education, including a hefty pay raise for teachers; county
government reorganization and constitutional reform.
   In the session ended May 7, the Legislature approved a
scaled-back plan to raise teacher salaries to the current Southeast
average by phasing in an average raise of $3,800 during two years,
costing $180 million.
   Mabus also got agreement on a 25-member commission to look at
reorganization. The governor wants to reduce what he regards as a
bloated bureaucracy by slashing the number of state agencies from
more than 160 to as few as 15, ``potentially one of the most
far-reaching things we can do,'' he said.
   But he got nothing from lawmakers on amending or rewriting the
state's 98-year-old Constitution or county government reform.
   ``I think we were successful,'' Mabus said in a recent
interview. ``I think if you get everything you asked for, you
probably didn't ask for enough.''
   Above all, Mabus believes Mississippi, which ranks last or near
the bottom among states in such categories as per capita income and
first in school dropouts, is headed in the right direction.
   ``We got Mississippi moving down the road to what we're going to
have to do,'' he said. ``If we don't get down to some of these
structural things, like the budget, like reorganization, like
county unit, we're going to doom Mississippi to the bottom tier
economically for a long time to come, and I don't think anybody
wants that.''
   As part of his agenda, Mabus wants to require all counties to
adopt county-wide purchasing, receiving, personnel management and
road construction and maintenance policies. In 60 of the state's 82
counties, each of five county supervisors directly oversees
operations in the district from which he or she is elected.
   As state auditor for the four years before he was elected
governor, Mabus assisted the FBI in its ``Operation Pretense''
investigation into corrupt county purchasing. It resulted in the
arrests of 52 supervisors in 24 counties, of which 43 were
convicted or pleaded guilty and 23 received prison sentences.
   The House and Senate passed differing versions of a so-called
county unit bill, but negotiators never reached a compromise.
   Mabus subsequently vetoed a 20 percent pay hike for supervisors
and has promised to call a special session for lawmakers to deal
with county unit legislation.
   ``I'm confident we're going to get county unit passed through
both houses of the Legislature,'' Mabus said. ``Once people go home
and listen to their constituents, it will happen.''
   Mabus also remained determined on constitutional reform, and
said that even though a reform measure died at the end of the
session, ``we got farther than anyone else ever has.''
   Last November, voters approved 10 constitutional amendments,
including one that removes nearly a century-old ban on interracial
marriage. Critics say some provisions of the 1890 Constitution
remain racist. It includes a poll tax and literacy requirement for
voting, although they have been struck down by federal courts.
Other provisions discourage economic development and efficient
government, critics say.
   The governor wanted the Legislature to allow voters in November
to approve a constitutional convention that would rewrite the
Constitution.
   Despite the measure's failure, he insisted the issue won't go
away.
   ``At some point the people of Mississippi are going to vote on
it,'' he said.

   While President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev meet this week, dozens of young musicians in the
United States and the Soviet Union are tuning up for a musical
summit this summer.
   The 110-member American-Soviet Youth Orchestra makes its debut
in August, the start of a month-long concert swing through five
U.S. cities and three in the Soviet Union.
   ``It's such a great opportunity to make music and travel in the
United States and travel in Russia,'' says Caroline Coade, 20, of
San Diego.
   Ms. Coade, who plays the viola and graduates Monday from Oberlin
College, is one of 58 Americans and 52 Soviets, ages 17 to 23,
selected for the orchestra. Twelve participants are from Oberlin
College.
   The orchestra will assemble at Oberlin's campus July 16 for
rehearsals and workshops to acquaint them with each other's social
and cultural traditions.
   After that, the orchestra will have its premiere Aug. 5 at the
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington under the
baton of Zubin Mehta, music director of the New York Philharmonic.
   The orchestra's repertoire includes works by American and
Russian composers. The New York performance also will feature the
world premiere of a piece by Soviet composer Edison Denisov.
   The inspiration behind the orchestra came from a luncheon
attended by Oberlin President S. Frederick Starr, an expert on
Soviet affairs, and officials of AFS Intercultural Programs, an
international exchange group based in New York, said Grace Kennan
Warnecke, the orchestra's executive director.
   She raised the idea with the Soviet Ministry of Culture last
year and found ``it was greeted with far more enthusiasm on both
sides than anticipated ... which is not to say it still isn't
hard.''
   Ms. Warnecke said a joint orchestra wouldn't have been possible
before glasnost, Gorbachev's policy of openness, although separate
tours have been permitted.
   ``What's different about this is we're creating a brand new
institution from scratch,'' said Ms. Warneke, who lived in the
Soviet Union periodically as a child and attended fifth-grade in a
Soviet school while her father, George F. Kennan, was U.S.
ambassador.
   She said the orchestra could be ongoing, but efforts are
concentrated on this year's program.
   ``If glasnost becomes a complete success, increasing openness to
the point that we don't need a Soviet-American orchestra ...
(we'll) put ourselves out of business and that's all the better,''
she said.
   The American musicians from 24 states were chosen from 500 who
auditioned either in person or with tapes. Their expenses will be
paid and they'll receive a small allowance. Negotiations are
continuing, but most of the money to cover costs in the United
States is coming from foundations, Ms. Warneke said.
   In the Soviet Union, the orchestra will be sponsored by the
Ministry of Culture and Gosconsert.
   The trip to the Soviet Union will be especially important for
Claudia Lasareff-Mironoff, 23, who is studying for a master's
degree in viola at Northwestern University. Her parents left the
Soviet Union as children and emmigrated to the United States after
World War II.
   ``I think it's really important that we share musical ideas,''
said Ms. Lasareff-Mironoff, who speaks Russian.
   Calvin Lewis, who studies the violin at the Cleveland Institute
of Music, doesn't know any Russian.
   ``Music is a language in itself. I don't think there'll be a
problem,'' said Lewis, 18, of Hephzibah, Ga.
   During the orchestra's 2{ weeks here, the musicians will
rehearse with Larry Rachleff, Oberlin conductor and music director,
and Leonid Nikolaev for the Moscow Conservatory of Music.
   After the opening concert, the musicians will perform in New
York City on Aug. 7; Milwaukee, Aug. 9; San Francisco, Aug. 11 and
Trenton, N.J., Aug. 14. The Soviet tour will open and close with
concerts in Moscow, with four concerts in two other cities in
between.

who was tying the knot for the first time.
   In fact, the airplane buffs were 2,000 feet off the ground when
they exchanged wedding vows Saturday in a Piper 310.
   ``I'm a student pilot, and we wanted to get off on a flying
start,'' Clark said, adding that his new wife, Renee, came up with
the idea.
   The couple took off from Linden Airport, where Clark has been
taking flying lessons for several months.
   They landed after being married by Newark police officer and
part-time minister Leslie Jones, Jr. Jones has known Clark, a
15-year police veteran, since they went through the police academy.
   The newlyweds came down to Earth for their wedding reception
with family and friends in Irvington.

   It's a dog's work chasing hogs, but
Angie the ``hog dog'' never fails to get the bite on the porkers on
Elmer Crane's farm.
   Angie, a 40-pound Australian cattle dog, contends with sows
weighing up to 600 pounds as she gets hogs moving for Crane's
daughter, Ruby West.
   ``Their natural instinct is to work stock,'' says Ms. West, who
got Angie from an Indiana breeder four years ago. ``And, they do
that by biting at them.''
   ``Angie minds me. If I whistle, or if I call `Sooey,' she knows
that I'm moving pigs and she comes running from wherever she is.''
   Angie stands motionless near the hog lot _ her eyes fixed in a
menacing ``gunfighter squint.'' She waits for a signal from Ms.
West to spring into action.
   ``She can tell by what I have in my hand what she's going to
have to do,'' Ms. West says. ``If I walk into the lot with a
syringe (to inject medicine), she won't move _ she knows I don't
want the pigs moving around then.
   ``But, if I've got a stick or prod in my hand, she's ready to
move pigs.''
   Angie thinks fast on her feet to stay out of harm's way, Ms.
West says.
   ``Sows can get pretty rough,'' she says. ``That (nipping) will
make them pretty mad once in awhile, and they try to bite her. Sows
can move fast, but Angie's faster. She can jump or climb out of the
way when they come after her.''
   Angie doesn't always get the last bite, however.
   During a temporary lull in the activity on the hog lot recently,
Angie settled in for a nap against a shed wall. A curious porker
approached her from behind, bent its head toward the sleeping dog,
and administered a healthy root.
   Angie sprang to her feet in a moment of confusion.
   The hog, obviously satisfied with its minor victory, made a
speedy and wise retreat around the corner of the shed.

<HEAD>Crime Still Hits One in Four Homes Per Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Theft or violent crime struck one out of every
four American homes in 1987, with black and Hispanic homes being
hit at higher than the average rate, the Justice Department says.
   The Bureau of Justice Statistics said Sunday the national crime
rate against homes was 24 percent, about the same rate recorded in
the previous two years.
   The bureau said 23.9 percent of white homes, 27.8 percent of
black homes and 30.1 percent of Hispanic homes were hit last year
by some sort of crime.
   Homes in the Northeast were the least affected, 19 percent,
while those in the West were the most vulnerable, at 29 percent.
The rates were 25 percent in the Midwest and 24 percent in the
South.
   Since the bureau began collecting crime data on a household
basis in 1975, when crime struck one in three homes, the rates have
never shown a year-to-year increase and dropped substantially over
the longer term.
   Bureau Director Steven R. Schlesinger noted that there was
greater improvement among white households than among black ones.
From 1975 to 1987, the rate dropped 25 percent for white homes,
whereas the decline for black homes was 15 percent.
   The difference was due primarily to the fact that thefts from
black homes failed to decline, while the reduction in other types
of crimes was about the same for both white homes and black homes.
   The household rates are derived from the National Crime Survey,
which has interviewed about 99,000 people of age 12 or older from a
sample of 49,000 homes around the nation.

   Folk-rock singer Richie Havens says his
songs of protest were never directed against soldiers fighting in
Vietnam, and now is trying to raise money to benefit veterans.
   ``At the time we were protesting the war, the media tried to
make it look like we were against the soldiers,'' Havens said in an
interview with the Sunday Star-Ledger.
   ``But we were never against the soldiers, we were just against
what they were being ordered to do. So I don't see any
contradiction in trying to help veterans' causes now.''
   Havens is the national spokesman for a Salute to Vietnam
Veterans Concert, originally scheduled for today at the Meadowlands
in East Rutherford. The concert was postponed until July 30.
   The concert will feature recording artists including The
Spinners, The Association, the Mamas & the Papas, Rare Earth and
Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits. Money raised will benefit the New
Jersey Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

   Shirley Temple Black says a woman once
tried to kill her and a producer attempted to seduce her during her
years as a child actress.
   Mrs. Black, a former ambassador to Ghana, spoke to a news
conference Sunday at the American Booksellers Association
convention. Her autobiography, ``Child Star,'' will be published in
October by McGraw-Hill.
   The seduction attempt occurred when she was 12, shortly after
she switched from 20th-Century Fox to MGM, Mrs. Black said.
   She said she was alone in the office of a producer, whom she did
not name.
   ``He seemed to be rearranging his clothing with a certain amount
of flourish,'' Mrs. Black recounted.
   ``I had thought he was a producer but what he really was an
exhibitor. The only person I had ever seen naked was me, and I
thought he was pretty funny-looking so I laughed until I had tears
in my eyes.''
   She was ordered out of the office, she said.
   The attempt on her life occurred when she was 10, when a woman
``pulled out a rather big gun and started to point it'' at her
while she sang during a live radio appearance at CBS in Hollywood.
   Police grabbed the woman and removed her from the studio, Mrs.
Black recalled.

   Soul singer James Brown has decided to
end his third marriage of four years even though he says he still
loves his wife, a newspaper reported.
   ``I'm going to divorce her. I love her very much, but I just
want to be by myself,'' Brown was quoted as saying in Sunday's
Spartanburg Herald-Journal. ``It will be done as soon as the papers
go through.''
   Brown, 55, and his 38-year-old wife, Adrienne, have recently
been involved in a series of highly publicized fights.
   ``I just need a lot of girls,'' Brown was quoted as saying. The
newspaper said he did not say if he was interested in another woman.
   The singer would not say why he and his wife, who live in Aiken,
have fought recently, and would not discuss other charges filed
against him in recent months.
   Brown was arrested in April and charged with assault with intent
to kill for an incident in which he allegedly beat his wife with a
pipe and shot into her car.
   Earlier this month, Brown was arrested after a car chase near
his home and charged with possession of the hallucinogen PCP, which
he said belonged to his wife.
   Mrs. Brown has been charged three times in recent months with
possessing the hallucinogen PCP. She also has been charged with
setting fire to Brown's hotel room in Bedford, N.H., on May 10.

   Garrison Keillor's ``Prairie Home
Companion,'' public radio's popular show, will return to the air
Saturday in a live broadcast from New York's Radio City Music Hall.
   And the one-time special, which made its debut last weekend at
Middlebury College, reflects Keillor's move from Minnesota to New
York.
   The show finds the endless cornfields shadowed by skyscrapers
and all those bachelor farmers rubbing elbows with the homeless.
   One year after it ended its 13-year run, Keillor's show will be
broadcast nationally Saturday night on the American Public Radio
Network and the Disney television channel.
   And while the new show finds Keillor still fantasizing about
Lake Wobegon, his little town that time forgot, it reflects his
fascination with his new home, New York City.

   At the Indy 500, it was ``Gentlemen, start your engines,'' but
for many other Americans the cry on Memorial Day weekend was,
``Start your summer,'' with everything from barbecues to beach
parties under way.
   There were also solemn remembrances of the nation's war dead,
including the placing of flags on thousands of graves at Los
Angeles National Cemetery and a service held at a replica of the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
   With temperatures in the 80s in many areas after weeks of
unseasonably cool, rainy weather, beaches from Massachusetts to
South Carolina were packed, and hundreds of thousands watched the
72nd running of the Indianapolis 500.
   While drivers at the Indy were putting the pedal to the metal,
police stepped up patrols for speeders and drunken drivers.
   The resort of Ocean City, Md., had a deadly Saturday. Police
said a man drowned about 90 minutes before lifeguards went on duty
for the first time this season, a teenager swimmer was missing, and
a boating accident left two people dead, two missing and presumed
dead, and five injured.
   In Indianapolis, a man was killed early Sunday when he fell out
a pickup truck. About 100 fans were arrested in pre-race revelry,
police said. A crowd estimated at 350,000 to 450,000 watched the
start of the fabled race Sunday.
   ``The people, so many in one place, it's unbelievable,'' said
Jamie Payne, 36, of Madison, Wis. ``And the start of the race, it
just sends goose bumps up my spine.''
   Longtime racer Rick Mears, 36, overcame an early one-lap deficit
to win the race for the third time in his career.
   Amid the celebrating, there was sorrow for those who fell
fighting for the country.
   A replica of 14 panels of the Vietnam War Memorial was displayed
at Eternal Valley Cemetery in Newhall, Calif., through the weekend.
The replica, a prop used in the TV movie ``To Heal A Nation,'' was
the site of a memorial service.
   About 1,200 Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Brownies and Cub Scouts
placed flags on all 78,200 graves at Los Angeles National Cemetery.
   ``You can see all those who fought, but it's sad because they
all died,'' said 9-year-old Andrew Marek.
   On Attu Island, Alaska, Americans and Japanese erected a
monument that will be dedicated Monday to the thousands of soldiers
from both sides of the Pacific who died there _ the site of the
only World War II battle fought on North American soil.
   Elsewhere, solemn thoughts were far away. Tens of thousands of
people jammed New Jersey's beaches, while others headed to its Six
Flags Great Adventure amusement park in Jackson Township, which
reported a steady stream of customers.
   Roads to Massachusetts' Cape Cod and South Shore beaches were
jammed. Amtrak trains on the Northeast corridor were standing-room
only. ``All the beaches are filled. It's a zoo. The place is
mobbed,'' Yarmouth, Mass., police dispatcher Randolph Jenkins said.
   An estimated 100,000 people partied on New York City's beaches
Sunday, said Parks Department spokesman Gary Zarr. In Manhattan,
attractions included a street fair, square dancing in Central Park,
and the annual Cuban Day parade.
   Along the 60-mile stretch in South Carolina known as the Grand
Strand, hotel room occupancy was expected to run about 90 percent
of the 55,000 rooms for rent, said Doug Bell of the Myrtle Beach
Area Chamber of Commerce.
   The South Carolina Highway Patrol was out in force, said Brian
Ellison of the state Department of Highways and Public
Transportation. In Boston, speeding by water was a problem. Police
in fan-propelled craft issued at least 25 citations to boaters on
the Charles River.
   The National Safety Council estimated that the long weekend
would claim 380 to 480 lives on the nation's highways. Last year,
416 people died, the council said. A non-holiday, three-day weekend
this time of year would probably see about 390 deaths.

<HEAD>Venereal Disease Reported on The Rise In China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venereal disease, once virtually eliminated in
China, is once again a problem and has in one year increased
three-fold in a province relatively open to foreigners, a Ministry
of Public Health official said today.
   Cao Qing, deputy director of the ministry's department of
epidemic prevention, told a news conference that cases of sexually
transmitted disease have increased in recent years as China
implements its open-door policy.
   In 1987, authorities in Guandong province, which borders Hong
Kong and is one of China's most open areas, recorded 5,600 cases of
venereal disease, three times more than the previous year, he said.
   Cao said he believes the actual figure to be much higher because
those who contract the disease do not voluntarily come forward.
   He said the ministry does not have national figures.
   The Chinese media have reported frequently that cases of
sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise, but this was the
first time statistics were given.
   After the Communist takeover in 1949, campaigns were waged
against many so-called capitalist vices, including prostitution.
   Chinese authorities for years claimed that venereal disease had
been virtually wiped out.

   An 81-year-old woman says she and her
sister lived alone quietly and happily until they were ``yanked out
of our home like animals'' by a county commission decision.
   Glenna Ashby, a retired hairdresser, cannot comprehend how she
and her sister were removed from their Huntington home last March
without the benefit of a court hearing, or a lawyer to protect them.
   Ashby said she was unaware her competency even was under
question until the day the sheriff's department took her away.
   ``I don't understand it all. They took hold of my arm and said,
`Come with me.'
   ``We were yanked out of our home like animals,'' Ashby said in a
telephone interview Sunday from the Morris Memorial Convalescent
and Nursing Home in Milton. ``I'm 100 percent and I am capable and
I don't need anybody to care for me.
   ``Now, I've been just about out of my mind. I feel so helpless.
I'm just so worried _ I felt like a prisoner.''
   In March, the three-member Cabell County Commission ruled that
Ashby and her 82-year-old sister, Jo Ann Gillette, were mentally
incompetent and ordered them removed from their home in Huntingdon,
80 miles west of here. The women were put in the custody of the
sheriff, who put them in the nursing home.
   The women say they do not know who instigated the proceedings.
Sheriff Robert Bailey Jr. said the 20th Street Bank sought the
incompetency ruling, saying the sisters were unable to manage their
business affairs and could not care for themselves.
   Bank officials could not be reached for comment on Sunday.
   Ashby said her sister closed her account with that bank several
years ago and transferred the money to another Huntington bank.
   County officials said David Pancake, a private lawyer appointed
to investigate the sisters' mental health, recommended that they be
put away. Pancake did not return calls by The Associated Press to
his Huntington house Sunday.
   The sisters said they didn't know he was their attorney.
   ``I didn't know anything like that could happen in the United
States,'' Ashby said.
   Under state law, the county commission rules on mental
competence cases and will receive 5 percent of the sisters' estate.
   ``Of course they want to go back home. Everybody wants to go
back home,'' said Gladys Jordan, appointed by the county to oversee
the women's affairs as their guardians.
   Jordan said the sisters were living in ``horrible conditions.''
   ``It was filthy and inhumane conditions at the least,'' Jordan
said. ``I don't think they had had a bath for years and years. It
looked like they had been living in their beds. There wasn't even a
chair. Their hair was matted together _ like a dog's _ hanging in
their faces.''
   ``That's damn lies,'' said Ashby.
   Jordan said the women ate only once a day Monday through Friday,
and that the house was rat-infested and had a natural gas leak. She
said workers removed 280 bags of newspapers and debris from one
room alone, and found $33,700 in cash in the house.
   Assistant nursing home administrator Rose Greene corroborated
Jordan's account of Ashby's and Gillette's condition when they were
brought in. ``The smell ... it was deplorable,'' she said.
   However, she said she is unqualified to say if the women belong
in a full care nursing home ``or maybe just need someone to check
on them once a day to make sure they wash themselves.''
   Dr. Samuel Henson, a 20-year employee of the nursing home where
Ashby and Gillette are being kept, said Friday the women don't
belong there.
   ``In my opinion, they belong at home,'' he said. ``This simply
goes against everything we attempt to practice in this country.''
   County commissioner Forest Underwood defends his decision
declaring the women incompetent, but said he is willing to
reconsider.
   Underwood said ``there's no certain criteria'' for judging
incompetence.
   ``It's a matter of sitting there, gauging and judging what you
think they're capable of handling,'' he said.
   A 1987 series by The Associated Press examined guardianship laws
in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia and found a
network of overburdened courts that routinely fail to monitor wards
under their jurisdiction. The system often opened the door to
physical and financial mistreatment, according to the series,
``Guardians of the Elderly: An Ailing System.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Soviet Economy Woes Led to Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis
says Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is holding another summit
with President Reagan because the Soviet Union is having economic
problems and he recognizes ``Communism is a failure.''
   ``I think that is the driving force behind this, the recognition
on his part that they're falling further and further behind,'' the
front-runner for the Democratic nomination said in an interview
broadcast Sunday by the BBC.
   Gorbachev, he said, is probably the first Kremlin leader ``to
recognize that Communism is a failure, at least the way it's been
practiced in the Soviet Union.''
   Dukakis said, ``most thoughtful observers agree that it is the
very serious condition of the Soviet domestic situation that has
been largely responsible'' for Gorbachev's involvement in the
summit.
   ``Unless the Soviet Union begins to devote significantly more
resources to its domestic economy ... and less to the military,
than they're going to become a third-rate economic power,'' he said.

   Howard Baker said Sunday that Reagan still has confidence in
Meese, although he ``certainly doesn't have a closed mind'' about
the attorney general's troubles.
   ``It would take an extraordinary event to shake that confidence
that the president still has in the attorney general,'' Baker said
on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
   Asked if Reagan shares Baker's judgement that Meese's woes could
hurt Bush politically, Baker said: ``Oh, I think so _ for the
moment and to some degree. But I think that he too would urge you
to wait and see how all this unfolds and develops.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Seeks Commitment From Alabama Demo Delegates Backing Gore</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Southern liaison for the
presidential campaign of front-runner Michael Dukakis says the next
few weeks will be devoted to wooing convention delegates of
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   ``It's obvious who's going to be the nominee, it's just a matter
of when and where it happens,'' said Mike Ross of Little Rock, Ark.
``I've heard Governor Dukakis say on many occasions, `We can't win
without the South.'''
   The goal is to break the delegates away by June 7, the day of
the California primary, Ross said during a visit to Birmingham.
   ``Unfortunately, there aren't any more primaries after
California so what we're doing is meeting with super delegates and
Senator Gore's delegates,'' Ross said.
   ``If Senator Gore was still actively campaigning, we wouldn't be
talking to his delegates. For all practical purposes, he's out of
the race, and people (delegates) aren't bound (to vote for him) on
the first ballot in 1988,'' he said.

   A small plane crashed into a house Sunday,
killing the pilot and three people picnicking by a backyard
swimming pool, authorities said.
   Firefighters found the body of 10-year-old Jennifer Lynn
Pedersen near the pool, and the bodies of two adult guests of
Jennifer's parents and the female pilot tangled in the wreckage of
the single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza, authorities said.
   Four other picknickers, including a 9-year-old girl who was in
the pool, were injured by debris or flames and two houses were
destroyed, fire department spokesman Collin DeWitt said.
   ``I saw it go down behind trees ... I didn't hear the impact,
but then I saw the smoke right away,'' said David Terrace, an
aviation buff who lives in the palm-shaded neighborhood. ``The last
I saw it, the plane was going in at about a 45-degree angle.''
   The pilot had flown the plane from Farmington, N.M., to Sedona,
about 90 miles north of here before backtracking to Sky Harbor
International Airport to drop off passengers, said police Sgt. Andy
Anderson.
   DeWitt said the injured included Jennifer's parents, David
Pedersen, 38, his wife, Susan, 30; the 9-year-old, Amy Doerschlag;
and John Bass, a neighbor in his 30s who tried to assist in a
rescue and suffered smoke inhalation and burns.
   Amy was a weekend house guest of the Pedersens while her parents
attended a funeral in California, Anderson said.
   DeWitt said the crash, reported at 5:40 p.m., triggered a
two-alarm fire that firefighters put out about an hour later.
   He said the 9-year-old and the neighbor were taken to Good
Samaritan Medical Center, Pederson was hospitalized at Maricopa
County Medical Center, and Mrs. Pederson was at St. Joseph's
Hospital and Medical Center.
   THe names of the others killed were not released.

   Jennifer Dresser attended her high school's
final proms with five dates.
   Southwestern High School is one of eight Flint schools that will
close this summer because of declining enrollment and revenue.
   ``It's our last Southwestern senior prom,'' said Matt Taylor,
one of Dresser's escorts. ``It has to be special.''
   Dresser, 17, and her classmates had planned to go without dates
to Saturday night's event, said escort Tom Witucki. After
reflecting on the prom theme, ``Ever Changing Times,'' they decided
to go as a group.
   ``She's just a good friend ... we all get along,'' said Randy
Hudson, who also joined Dresser's entourage along with Witucki,
Taylor, Doug Wilson and Hannu Puhakka, an exchange student from
Finland.
   Dresser's only complaint was a sore finger repeatedly pricked
while attaching five boutonnieres to as many lapels.

<HEAD>Newport Swim Shop Uses Computer To Design, Sew Suits to Fit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIMBERLY M. SHEARIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The owners of a swimsuit shop traded in
their measuring tape for a high-tech computer system to make
perfect-fitting suits for imperfect physiques. Now the retailers
say they have their profits sewn up.
   Kathleen O'Connor and Michael Pellegrini, of Suit Systems, say
they expect to sell 3,000 suits and gross $250,000 in their first
year in the custom-made swimsuit business.
   The venture began last year when the two went to Singer Island,
Fla., and visited a shop called Second Skin, whose owner uses a
computer to measure its cutomers.
   After O'Connor bought a suit, she and Pellegrini decided to open
a similar business in this tourist haven visited by thousands each
year.
   They spent about $26,000 for training and a license required to
operate the patented computer system.
   When they first opened, they expected business to be slow. It
was, after all, December. But instead of selling one or two suits a
week, they sold about 25.
   Now, Suit Systems sells 50 to 60 swim suits a week to their
women customers. The suits range from $58 to $130.
   ``The most common customers are those with the most common
figure problems,'' said O'Connor.
   ``I've had a handful of customers with figure deformities,'' she
said, including one woman with a surgical diagonal scar across her
back and under the bust area. A suit with extra-wide straps covered
up the problem, she said.
   On a busy day, the shop is filled with women trying on the plain
black suits that are used for taking measurements, standing against
a back wall and being filmed by the computer.
   Once the filming is finished, O'Connor rewinds the tape and
stops at various parts of the woman's body to take measurements.
The process takes 10 minutes.
   It then takes the shop's seamstresses about 20 minutes to make a
tank suit, an hour for more complex designs.
   Choosing a fabric may take the most time. The walls of the shop
and downstairs sewing room are lined with more than 300 fabrics
made of lycra-nylon and lycra-cotton blends.
   The Newport store is the sixth to be licensed by Michele Deziel,
owner of Second Skin. She discovered a patented computer program
for measuring in California about 3{ years ago.
   ``I purchased it and had a store open in 30 days,'' Deziel said.
   Deziel said she grossed about $230,000 last year in the retail
portion of her business. She declined to say what she earned from
computer training and licensing.
   The training sessions usually take 10 days in Florida and
another 10 at the proposed shop site. Once store owners pay the
$26,000 fee for training and the license, they are no longer
financially obligated to Deziel.
   Deziel also promises not to sell a license for the computer
system to anyone else in the new store's territory for a year or
more.
   Besides Newport and Singer Island, there are similar shops in
Long Island, N.Y., Philadelphia, Detroit, Ocean City, Md., and
Myrtle Beach, S.C.

   Here are some comments from the presidential
campaign trail.
   
   JESSE JACKSON, speaking Sunday of what his role will be if
front-runner Michael Dukakis gets the nomination: ``It's going to

and Dukakis. ``Together, we're gonna win.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, after taking a charter boat off the polluted
coast of New Jersey: ``It's going to take a president and the
Congress and an Environmental Protection Agency that understands
what the law is and takes its job seriously to make a difference.''
   
   HOWARD BAKER, White House chief of staff, asked if President
Reagan agrees that Attorney General Ed Meese's legal problems could
harm George Bush politically: ``Oh, I think so _ for the moment and

<TEXT>
   Dick Joyce, a sports writer for The Associated
Press for nearly 20 years, died of complications following a
stroke. He was 53.
   Joyce, who specialized in horse racing, also covered college
basketball and worked as supervising editor on the sports desk.
   He died Sunday at South Nassau Communities Hospital in
Oceanside, where he had been confined since suffering a massive
stroke at his Rockville Centre home May 12.
   His most recent assignment had been at the Kentucky Derby and
his absence at the Preakness a week after his stroke prompted
hundreds of get-well cards and he received special mention at the
pre-race breakfast.
   Joyce, who stood 6-foot-5 and weighed nearly 300 pounds, was
known for a gentleness that belied his size. His soft-spoken humor
made him a topic of stories wherever sports writers gathered.
   ``Dick was great comfort on the desk,'' General Sports Editor
Darrell Christian said. ``His wry wit always put things into
perspective even under the most difficult circumstances. His
professional dedication was a steadying influence. He will be
greatly missed.''
   Joyce, a graduate of St. Bonaventure University, joined the AP
as a sports writer in the Broadcast department in July 1968 and
moved to the Sports department less than a year later. Previously,
he had worked for United Press International, NBC and the New York
World-Telegram and Sun.
   He is survived by his wife, Bea, and five children.
   The funeral will be Wednesday at 10 a.m. at St. Agnes Cathedral
in Rockville Centre.

have embraced: deep cuts in the superpowers' arsenals of their
nuclear bombers and missiles. Verification issues appeared
insurmountable.

   _Reagan, the first American president to visit the Soviet Union
since 1974 and only the fourth president here ever, arrived to an
honor ceremony at Vnukovo Airport, where a Soviet military band
flawlessly played the U.S. national anthem. The Soviet and American
national emblems were posted on every light pole along Reagan's
motorcade route.

   _An unannounced Reagan walking excursion at the Soviet version
of a pedestrian mall was marred by roughneck tactics of KGB
security agents, who pushed, punched and shoved through the dense
crowd to clear a path for the American first couple. The Reagans
seemed stunned at the tumultuous scene and appeared at times to be
jostled themselves.

   _DEMONSTRATIONS=
   _Two dozen Soviet Jews waving posters and yellow Stars of David
outside the Kremlin walls backed Reagan's appeals to relax curbs on
Jewish emigration. And Armenian demonstrators sought to call
Reagan's attention to their demands for control over land in a
neighboring republic _ an ethnic dispute that dogs Gorbachev's
policy of openness.

<HEAD>FIRST LADIES</HEAD>

   _Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev joined forces to combat the
rumors lingering from their earlier meetings that their personal
chemistry is bad. Mrs. Gorbachev called the reports ``rumors.''
Mrs. Reagan said that every time they've met, ``We've gotten along
very well.''
   On a tour of the onion-domed Cathedral of the Assumption, the
first ladies were also often shoulder-to-shoulder, discussing the
religious paintings that adorned the its ancient walls.

East-West relations in the past three years, allowing his staunch

   A woman says her wedding to a former
refusenik after more than eight years of waiting has ties to the
last two summit meetings between President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Elizabeth Condon for years was denied visas to visit the Soviet
Union and Victor Novikov was not allowed to emigrate. But the
couple learned five days before the December summit in Washington
that Novikov could come to this country. They were re-united in New
York City on March 26.
   They wed Saturday on the eve of the current Reagan-Gorbachev
summit.
   ``They resolved us at the last one,'' Condon said, ``and we're
sort of resolving ourselves at the beginning of this one.''
   Condon, who teaches Russian and French in the Woburn public
schools, said ``it's rather nice'' the wedding in Lynnfield
coincided with the summit in Moscow.
   The two were married by a justice of the peace before 40 of
Condon's friends and relatives at the home of her aunt. None of
Novikov's family were able to attend.
   Condon, 45, of Lynn and Nokikov, 56, an unemployed research
chemist from Moscow, had planned to marry in the Soviet Union in
1979, but Soviet officials blocked the wedding.
   ``I am very happy that finally our long effort to see each other
again has been finalized in our getting married,'' Novikov said in
Russian translated by his bride.
   They met two decades ago on one of Condon's then-frequent visits
to the Soviet Union.
   When Novikov arrived in the United States on a three-month visa,
he wanted to marry Condon right away. However, she wanted time to
assess their relationship. Earlier this month, Condon said, they
decided to marry.
   After a honeymoon in New York, Condon said, Novikov plans to
begin learning English and find work.
   Both said they would like to have children.
   During their separation, Condon was active in the Divided
Spouses Coalition, formed before the 1985 Geneva summit to draw
attention to the plight of married and engaged couples kept apart
by the Soviet government.
   Although many of those cases have been resolved, U.S. officials
carried with them to Moscow a list that included the names of five
couples whose marriages have been blocked and three pairs of
spouses who are still separated, a State Department spokesman said.

   The mournful sound of buglers playing taps and the cadence of
marchers in Memorial Day parades helped Americans remember those
who died fighting for their country, while beaches and parks were
packed with holiday revelers.
   A sea of fluttering American flags marked the 72,000 graves at
Willamette National Cemetery in Portland, Ore. Officials planned
ceremonies of remembrance today at Arlington National Cemetery in
Virginia and at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington.
   In Gettysburg, Pa., Gen. William Westmoreland, commander of U.S.
troops in Vietnam during the war, planned to speak after a parade
honoring soldiers who died in the Civil War battle 125 years ago
this summer.
   In Omaha, Neb., a brass band today planned to wend its way
through a pioneer cemetery to salute a 19th century madam called
``the hooker with a heart of gold.''
   And on Attu Island, Alaska, Americans and Japanese erected a
monument that was to be dedicated to the thousands of soldiers from
both sides of the Pacific who died there _ the site of the only
World War II battle fought on North American soil.
   A snowstorm in the Southwest stranded some campers in Cedar
Breaks National Monument in Utah and whipped up waves that sank an
unoccupied 60-foot houseboat on Lake Powell, authorities said.
   Temperatures in the 80s lured hundreds of thousands of
sunbathers to beaches from Massachusetts to South Carolina.
   ``It's like the people are saying, `Welcome to summer,''' said
police Sgt. William Selig of Rockport, Mass. ``It's like this until
the cold weather comes. In a few months we'll be looking forward to
fall.''
   In Ocean City, Md., a swimmer drowned in the ocean 90 minutes
before lifeguards went on duty Saturday for the first time in the
season, police said.
   An estimated 100,000 people headed to New York City beaches on
Sunday to enjoy sun and sand on the opening weekend of the summer
beach season.
   Lifeguards were on duty for the first time this year at the
city's Jones Beach State Park, but there wasn't much for them to do
because of the cold water.
   ``Most people are just sunbathing,'' said Joseph Lescinski, park
superintendent.
   About 10,000 people, mostly bikers, ended their two-day American
Motorcycle Jamboree on Sunday in Cobleskill, 30 miles west of
Albany, N.Y.
   ``I didn't see a single wheelie,'' Mayor Nicholas Iorio said.
   The pace was quicker in Indiana, where an estimated 350,000 to
450,000 people watched Sunday's 72nd running of the Indianapolis
500. About 100 people were arrested in prerace revelry, and one man
died after falling out of a pickup truck, police said.
   Rick Mears, 36, overcame an early one-lap deficit to win the
race for the third time in his career.
   The Prospect Hill Preservation Brass Band planned its
eighth-annual Memorial Day tribute to Anna Wilson, who ran Omaha's
highest-priced house of ill repute for 30 years before donating it
to the city as a hospital shortly before her death in 1911.
   In Menands, N.Y., a veterans group took time out from the
weekend sun and fun to honor President Chester A. Arthur, who is
buried in the Albany Rural Cemetery.
   ``Nobody else had opted in an official capacity to do anything
for this former president,'' said Martin O'Connell, organizer of
the memorial service for the nation's 21st president, who served
from 1881-1885. ``I think it's shameful that the federal government
should ignore the grave of a former commander-in-chief on Memorial
Day weekend.''
   In Hackensack, N.J., submarine veterans Sunday held their 15th
annual ceremony in memory of the 52 submarines lost in World War II
and peace time.
   A wreath was tossed into Boston Harbor from the 190-year-old USS
Constitution, the nation's oldest commissioned warship.
   And about 1,200 Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Brownies and Cub Scouts
placed flags on all 78,200 graves at Los Angeles National Cemetery.
   ``You can see all those who fought, but it's sad because they
all died,'' said 9-year-old Andrew Marek.

   Experts will still have their opinions of why
the stock market goes up or down, but listeners of one radio
station won't hear them, starting Tuesday.
   Warren Bodow, president of WQXR-FM and AM in New York, said he
has decided to drop the experts' explanations from the daily stock
market reports because they often ``confuse rather than inform.
   ``One week we say the market is down because the U.S. is
importing more than it's exporting, and a few weeks later we
broadcast reports the market is down because we are beginning to
export more than we're importing,'' he said in a statement
announcing the change. ``What value are these opinions?''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of anti-government students
marched through the city today yelling ``Yankee go home'' and
burned a huge American flag before police broke up the
demonstration with tear gas.
   Once the giant U.S. flag was set ablaze, police fired tear gas
from armored vans and hundreds of riot troops in green combat
fatigues and visored helmets charged protesters in front of Seoul's
central railway station.
   About 10,000 protesters had gathered outside the station after
marching with the coffin of a student who set himself on fire in an
earlier anti-government protest. Police did not intervene during
the peaceful four-mile march.
   South Korea has during the past two weeks been hit by a wave of
violent anti-government and anti-U.S. protests by radical students
who are calling for the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo and
removal of the 42,000 U.S. troops on their soil.
   Roh, a former general who took office in February after winning
an election two months earlier, ordered a crackdown Friday to halt
protests. He said the radicals were threatening the Olympic Games
to be held in Seoul in September.
   In a speech today to the opening session of the National
Assembly, Roh appealed to opposition parties to work with him to
ensure full democracy and stability.
   He called for an end to political violence and peace on college
campuses.
   In April 26 elections, the governing party lost its majority in
the National Assembly for the first time ever.
   Today's march, like other recent protests in which U.S.
diplomatic offices were attacked, was vehemently anti-American.
Radicals claim the United States enforces military rule in South
Korea and enforces partition of the Korean peninsula.
   ``Drive out the Yankees who block unification of our
fatherland,'' said one speaker.
   Marchers yelled anti-American slogans as they walked past a U.S.
Army housing compound where a line of armed U.S. military police
stood guard, but there were no incidents.
   The radical protesters screamed ``drive out the Yankee
imperialists'' and cheered as the American flag burned. They tossed
firebombs at it to further fuel the blaze.
   A handful of students also hurled firebombs at attacking police,
but most protesters and hundreds of commuters and onlookers ran for
cover as authorities chased them.
   Police seized some protesters and dragged them away, but police
officials declined to give arrest figures. Officers tossed tear-gas
grenades at bystanders who complained about the police attack.
   There were no immediate reports of injury.
   Lines of riot police with interlocked shields swept the square
in front of the train station clean. Other officers hunted in the
station for hiding students and smashed scores of unused firebombs
abandoned by protesters.
   Choi Duk-soo, for whom the funeral march was held, died Thursday.
   He had set himself on fire May 18 to protest the holding of a
student spring festival on the anniversary of a 1980
anti-government uprising in the southern city of Kwangju.
   The coffin, escorted by hundreds of students in buses, left the
station to travel to Kwangju for burial just before police attacked.
   During the earlier funeral march through the city, protesters
carried hundreds of placards bearing portraits of Choi. Musicians
in white mourning clothes beat drums and singers performed haunting
funeral songs.
   The coffin was carried at the head of the column behind a giant
South Korean flag. A large portrait of Choi surrounded by orange
flames followed on a truck draped in black.
   ``Down with military dictatorship'' and ``Fight to the end,''
read slogans on a sea of 30-foot-high green, black, and white silk
banners carried by marchers.
   Choi's was the second political suicide by a radical student in
a month. Cho Sung-man stabbed himself and jumped off a building May
15.
   Ritual suicide is a traditional form of protest to shame the
government.
   Today's speakers blamed Roh and the United States for the bloody
suppression of the Kwangju uprising, in which at least 191 people
were killed.
   The recent demonstrations have failed to draw much public
support, and they have been confined mainly to radical college
students, a small but powerful minority. Major riots last summer
had strong support and prompted the government to accept elections.

   Stock prices gained nearly across the board today
while the U.S. dollar remained steady after opening higher against
the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's key index, gained 260.60 points or 0.27 percent, closing
the day at 27,223.10.
   The dollar closed at 124.98 yen, up 0.34 yen from Friday's

slow trading.
   On the stock market, Hisamichi Sawa of Prudential Bache said
institutional investors stayed on the sidelines following recent
disappointing showings by blue-chip issues. Individual investors,
who prefer smaller, speculative stocks, were fueling the Nikkei's

   At least 23 people died of sunstroke in
northern and central India over the weekend as the region sweltered
under the worst summer heat in 20 years, news reports said today.
   Seven of the victims died at a temple at Goverdhan town, 90
miles south of New Delhi, the United News of India news agency
reported. The victims were walking the circumference of the temple,
a necessary ritual in the Hindu religion before entering a shrine.
   UNI quoted Ramesh Yadav, a government official, as saying that
four other people also died of sunstroke near Goverdhan.
   Further south, at least seven people died in Nagpur town, the
Press Trust of India news agency said. The central town recorded a
maximum temperature of 115.2 degrees on Sunday.
   PTI also reported that five people died of sunstroke Saturday in
Vijaywada town, 870 miles south of New Delhi.
   Meterologists say the current heat wave is the worst to hit
India in two decades. Temperatures have risen to 118.4 degrees in
some towns.

   Rick Mears overcame an early one-lap deficit
to win his third victory at the Indianapolis 500 in a race plagued
by confusion over the second-place finisher, accidents and a record
14 yellow caution flags.
   Spectators initially were told that Jim Crawford finished second
in Sunday's race. Then, they were told that defending champion Al
Unser was second. Finally, three hours later, Emerson Fittipaldi
was declared the second-place finisher.
   Stewards originally had listed him as finishing seventh after
penalizing him two laps for passing during a caution flag, but the
penalty was dismissed.
   Unser, the defending champion and Mears' teammate, finished
third. Michael Andretti, the son of 1969 Indy 500 winner Mario
Andretti, finished fourth.
   ``They say the first one is always the best, and maybe that's
so,'' said Mears, 36, who won in 1979 and 1984. ``But I know the
second felt better than the first, and this one felt better than
the second.''
   Mears, racing in a Chevrolet-powered PC17, took control of the
$4.5 million race after taking the lead on lap 123 of the 200-lap
event. The race took three hours, 27 minutes, 10.2 seconds, with
Mears averaging 144.809 mph.
   The amount won will be announced tonight.
   The crowd of more than 400,000 booed as the last lap started
under the race's 14th yellow flag. Drivers are not allowed to pass
one another when a caution flag is in effect.
   Ten of the first 12 dropouts in the race were crash victims, but
there were no serious injuries on the track. Off the track, a man
was killed after falling off a pickup truck and 100 people were
arrested for rowdiness before the race.

<HEAD>Communist Laos Expands Ties Beyond Soviet Orbit</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This nation with one of the world's
lowest per capita incomes is expanding ties with the non-communist
world and China, eager for economic development and perhaps less
dependence on neighboring Vietnam.
   ``If you are isolated, you cannot grow,'' economic planner
Somphavanh Ithavong said of Laos, a sparsely populated, landlocked
nation of 3.9 million people.
   Several Western nations and international agencies have
responded to Vientiane's periodic requests for emergency food aid
as well as long-term assistance in developing roads, communications
and other infrastructure.
   ``When donors and politicians view Indochina as a whole, Laos
looks relatively attractive,'' says one Vientiane-based Western
diplomat. ``It certainly isn't the pariah Vietnam and Cambodia have
become.''
   The nation's per capita income is about $150 a year.
   In the political sphere, Laos recently appointed an ambasssador
to China and says a border trade treaty will be concluded by year's
end. Relations with Beijing had been downgraded when Vietnam-led
Indochina squared off against its one-time communist ally to the
north in the late 1970s.
   Half or more of the 40,000-50,000 Vietnamese troops stationed in
Laos were quietly withdrawn beginning in mid-1987, according to
Laotian officials and diplomats here.
   This reduction is not only bound to improve relations with
China, but it may alter one persistent perception of Laos as a
satellite of Hanoi.
   Vietnam, along with the Soviet Union, is officially lauded as a
fraternal ally, and there is little indication Laos could suddenly
veer off on a political course independent from Hanoi's.
   But some Laotian officials privately talk about ``useless''
Vietnamese aid projects; a know-it-all arrogance of Vietnamese
``experts,'' and they take pride in an economic performance
superior to that of their supposed mentors.
   ``We tell our Vietnamese brothers that they should go home to
take care of their many problems,'' said one Vientiane ministry
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Soviet bloc, including Vietnam, has provided the bulk of aid
to Laos. But non-communist nations now account for more than half
the $100 million to $150 million that Laos receives annually in
economic assistance. The bulk of students sent abroad in the past
have headed for the Soviet bloc, but some will now be studying in
Australia, Japan, France and possibly the United States.
   A recently passed foreign investment code appears designed to
attract capitalist-style enterprises. It includes liberal
provisions on repatriation of profits and foreign equity in
businesses.
   A large influx of private foreign capital is not generally
expected. But even the United States, with only an annual $1
million two-way trade and shaky political relations, has voiced
some optimism.
   The U.S. Embassy's most recent survey notes that ongoing
economic reforms ``do seem to present an opportunity to U.S.
business which did not exist in the past.''
   The biggest non-communist aid donors are Japan, Sweden and
Australia, and the World Bank and Asian Development Bank are key
agency backers. Some aid officials believe Laos, which has a small
managerial pool, is straining its capacity to absorb outside
assistance.
   Thailand exerts the greatest effect on the day-to-day economy as
consumer goods pour across the Mekong River frontier across three
official trading points and dozens of smuggling routes.
   Even while Thailand and Laos fought a bloody battle over
disputed territory early this year, unofficial trade was barely
affected. Those within reach of Thai television kept up with their
favorite soap operas.
   Although the potential for close ties is probably there,
suspicion of Thai motives and those of some other Western nations
remain.
   Most diplomats and other foreigners must seek permission to
travel beyond about four miles of the capital. Non-official contact
between Laotians and foreigners is discouraged.
   Vientiane has accused Thailand and the United States of aiding
anti-communist insurgents along the Thai-Laotian border. And bitter
memories of the war between U.S.-backed and communist forces linger.
   Laos also resents private American forays in search of the 555
U.S. servicemen still missing in action from the Vietnam War.
   Vientiane recently permitted the third official U.S-Laotian
excavation of an MIA crash site, but Vice Foreign Minister Soubanh
Srithirath bluntly told Western newsmen here recently there would
be no further searches until Washington came up with some
humanitarian aid for his country.

   President Reagan and Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev probably will sign at Wednesday's summit session two arms
control agreements that had appeared to be shelved only last week,
a senior U.S. official said today.
   One provides for pre-notification of missile test launches. The
other sets the ground rules for joint experiments to monitor
underground nuclear tests.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Soviets had initially demanded a broader pre-notification
arrangement, but accepted the initial U.S. proposal when their
demand was turned down.
   The agreement on monitoring tests also appeared to be
sidetracked until senior U.S. and Soviet arms control specialists
met Sunday night.
   On Saturday, Reagan administration officials said they did not
expect to have those agreements ready for the signatures of the
leaders during the summit.
   ``Things have changed,'' the official said.
   Under the pre-notification agreement, which was negotiated as
part of the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, each side
would notify the other in advance of the time, place and intended
target of ballistic missile test launches.
   ``We had proposed just lifting that section out of START,'' the
official said. But the Soviets objected, and wanted to include what
they called other ``confidence-building measures,'' including
notification of tests involving air-launched cruise missiles and
other weapons.
   The other likely agreement is a protocol for a Joint
Verification Experiment to test a new means of monitoring
compliannce with the Threshhold Test Ban Treaty, which was signed
on Oct. 7, 1974, but never ratified by the Senate.
   The administration has accused the Soviets of ``likely''
exceeding the treaty's ceiling of 150 kiloton for nuclear test
explosions, a charge the Soviets deny. And the administration has
insisted that the Soviets allow use of a new technology known as
CORRTEX to supplement existing seismic measuring devices.
   Signing of the protocol would clear the way for tests scheduled
this summer at U.S. and Soviet sites, and would virtually guarantee
completion of a related pact, the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions
Treaty, signed on May 28, 1976, barring the two sides from peaceful
explosions of more than 150 kilotons.
   Reagan and Gorbachev were meeting to assess whether face-to-face
diplomacy can remove some of the stumbling blocks that have kept
the superpowers from agreeing on the START treaty to sharply reduce
their arsenals of nuclear weapons.
   A major breakthrough was unlikely, but a joint team of senior
U.S. and Soviet negotiators went to work Sunday night to discuss
verification issues, among the most difficult in the search for an
accord.
   When Reagan and Gorbachev started their series of summit
meetings, of which Moscow is the fourth, the hope developed that
they might agree on sharp cuts _ from 30 to as much as 50 percent _
in the superpowers' stockpiles of their biggest weapons.
   So far, chiefly because of verification and the issue of Star
Wars testing, an agreement has been elusive.
   Gorbachev made it clear in his statement greeting Reagan on
Sunday that he was determined to ``preserve'' the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty which restrains testing for the Star
Wars missile defense program.
   Still, Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman,
said his government was willing to join in a mutual pledge to
adhere to the treaty for a specified period.
   Gorbachev said, however, another summit with Reagan was ``quite
possible'' if the treaty could be completed during the less than
eight months remaining in the Reagan administration.
   Not having that accord in hand, Reagan and Gorbachev on
Wednesday will have a ceremonial exchange of a more limited treaty
to abolish their land-based missiles in the range of 300 to 3,400
miles.
   The treaty was signed at the summit meeting in Washington last
December, but the Senate held up ratification until several
verification procedures were clarified.
   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, said that U.S. and
Soviet working groups convened Sunday night after the meeting
between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, which lasted from 7:30 p.m. to
9:30 p.m.
   Paul Nitze was the chairman of the U.S. team negotiating arms
control issues, and Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway
was heading the American teams discussing human rights, regional
and bilateral issues.
   The Soviet arms control team is headed by Marshal Sergei
Akhromeyev, the Soviet Chief of Staff and deputy minister of
defense, said Gerasimov. Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, the deputy foreign
minister, was heading the Soviet team discussing other issues, he
said.

<HEAD>Autopsy: Cocaine Led to 10-Year-Old's Drowning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOLIET, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocaine led to the drowning death of a
10-year-old boy, an autopsy found, but his grandmother won't
believe it.
   ``I'll go to my grave and they'll never convince me that my
grandson used drugs,'' said Geraldine Baker, who raised Andrew
Baker for the first nine years of his life.
   But the Will County coroner's office said it found evidence of
cocaine in his bloodsteam, the Chicago Tribune reported Sunday.
   ``You wouldn't even expect this in Chicago. Why it happened
here, how it happened here, we don't know,'' said Charles Connor,
mayor of this town of 77,000 people, 30 miles southwest of Chicago.
   The county coroner's office determined the 4th-grader drowned in
a YMCA swimming pool April 16 because cocaine in his blood caused
him to lose consciousness.
   The pathologist who performed an autopsy found a cluster of
fungus in the boy's heart _ evidence the boy had been injected
previously with a dirty hypodermic needle or impure drugs, said
Chief Deputy Coroner William Ferguson.
   The fungus, combined with the cocaine in Andrew's blood, caused
an inflammation of the heart, the autopsy showed. The heart beat
irregularly while he was swimming, and the boy lost consciousness
and drowned.
   ``The findings suggest that the deceased used cocaine on more
than one occasion, including shortly before death, and that both
respiratory and intravenous routes of administration were used,''
the report states.
   Sheriff's deputies said they have few clues about who supplied
the cocaine that killed Andrew.
   Andrew moved in with his mother, Jolene Williams, about a year
ago. She said she also does not believe the lab results.
   ``Where did he get it? How did he afford it?'' said Ms.
Williams, 30.
   Ferguson said he initially had trouble believing the autopsy
report.
   ``I sympathize with the family in thinking that we somehow made
a mistake,'' Ferguson said. ``But the lab has run the sample many
times at my request. They feel confident that their results were
accurate.''

   Separate small plane crashes killed eight people, including four
who died when a plane smashed into a Phoenix, Ariz., house and a
stunt pilot who slammed into the ground before thousands of
spectators at an airshow in Texas.
   A family and friends were picnicking by a backyard swimming pool
Sunday when a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza crashed into the
house, killing the female pilot, a 10-year-old girl and two adult
guests of the youngster's parents, authorities said.
   Four other picnickers, including a 9-year-old girl who was in
the pool, were injured by debris or flames, and two houses were
destroyed, Phoenix fire department spokesman Collin DeWitt said.
   ``I saw it go down behind trees ... I didn't hear the impact,
but then I saw the smoke right away,'' said David Terrace, an
aviation buff who lives in the palm-shaded neighborhood near
downtown. ``The last I saw it, the plane was going in at about a
45-degree angle.''
   The pilot had flown the plane from Farmington, N.M., to Sedona,
about 90 miles north of Phoenix before backtracking to Sky Harbor
International Airport to drop off passengers, police Sgt. Andy
Anderson said.
   The crash, reported at 5:40 p.m., triggered a two-alarm fire
that firefighters put out about an hour later, DeWitt said.
   Firefighters found the body of Jennifer Lynn Pedersen, 10, near
the pool. Authorities withheld the names of the other victims.
   Near Horizon City, Texas, stunt pilot Jerry Lynn Fowler, 29, was
killed Sunday when his Pitts S-25 biplane failed to pull out of a
loop, crashed into the ground and skidded into a lake, authorities
said.
   At least 2,000 people at Mountain Shadow Lakes witnessed the
accident, which happened about a mile from where spectators were
assembled for a balloon festival and air show.
   Many people weren't aware at first that the plane had crashed.
Hundreds gathered at water's edge to try to see what happened, but
saw only a cloud of dust where the plane hit the ground and skidded
into the water across the lake.
   On Saturday, three people were killed when a single-engine plane
crashed in rugged terrain west of Jamestown, Colo., Boulder County
sheriff's officials said.
   The victims, from Lakewood, Colo., were identified as Rory Lee
Brown, 38; JoJean Marie McCoy, 26; and Christopher Lee Gonzales,
16. Brown was identified as the pilot of the 1957 Mooney,
authorities said Sunday.
   Officials of the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the cause
of the crash.
   In Meriden, Conn., a flight instructor and a student were
injured Sunday when the twin-engine Beechcraft 180 they were in
slammed into the back of a house just seconds after takeoff from
Meriden Airport, officials said.
   Three people in the home at the time of the crash escaped
serious injury, Assistant Fire Chief John A. Francis said.

<TEXT>
   In a battle of lightning-fast minds, a team from
North Carolina State prevailed as students from 16 universities
tested their memories in the national College Bowl championship.
   ``One might think of College Bowl players as eggheads, but
eggheads are the worst College Bowl players,'' said Don Reid, who
created the game 35 years ago.
   ``The best players in a College Bowl game will eventually be the
players in the game of life,'' said Reid, who attended the weekend
event.
   Dan Petrus, a 24-year-old veterinary student at N.C. State,
helped his team capture the victory by answering this question:
``In a February 1988 poll of its readers by Rolling Stone, he was
voted worst male singer and worst dressed, and creator of the worst
album and worst single _ in other words, really and truly Bad.''
   The answer: ``Michael Jackson.''
   One of the questions in the final match between N.C. State and
Emory University was: ``On Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, he
works from 9 to 5; on Wednesdays, from 9 to 1; and on Fridays until
early afternoon. During working hours, he often takes two or three
hours to read and answer his fan mail.''
   Emory's Mike Barkin, a 25-year-old law school graduate, pushed
his buzzer and yelled, ``President Reagan,'' before the moderator
finished reading the question.
   That was right, according to journalist Bob Woodward's recent
book about former CIA chief William Casey. But it wasn't good
enough to win the national College Bowl title.
   Other questions during the two-day event held at the Chicago
campus of the University of Illinois dealt with subjects ranging
from chemistry to the ``Wizard of Oz.''
   Petrus, a rugby player, said he's good at the game because, ``I
remember a lot of facts and I'm able to recall them quickly.''
   But Petrus said it takes practice to perform well in the College
Bowl, so his team trains four hours a week.
   The College Bowl started on national radio in 1953, and then
became a regular television show in 1959. The game is still shown
periodically on U.S. television and is broadcast in 12 foreign
countries, Reid said.
   Reid, a former basketball star, said he thought up the game
because he felt, ``there has to be some way to have fun with a
sport of the mind.''
   The championships began Saturday with four-man teams from 16
colleges answering a moderator's questions with various point
values in a series of rounds. Each team was paired with another and
had to accumulate more points than the other to win the round and
eliminate the loser from the competition.
   No prizes were awarded to participants, but Petrus said the
reward of beating teams from colleges such as Princeton University,
the University of Chicago, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and Cornell University ``is knowing that you've been able to think
faster and out-think the others _ it's an ego thing.''

   A mother of nine was holding her month-old baby
when she was shot by gunmen firing into her home, and screamed,
``Lord help me!'' just before she died, a witness says.
   Maxine Peterson, a 43-year-old nurse, was shot Saturday night by
four gunman who ran by her home in the Queens borough, firing 18 to
20 bullets into the house, said police Lt. Eugene Dunbar.
   The four may have been looking for someone who had visited the
house, and Mrs. Peterson apparently was an innocent bystander,
police said.
   Mrs. Peterson had just wrapped her baby, Tabietha, in a blanket
and was preparing to take the infant outside, said Michelle Regean,
who lives with the Petersons and was watching television in the
living room.
   Mrs. Peterson left the living room, entered the kitchen and had
just answered the telephone when the shots rang out, said Miss
Regean.
   The wounded woman screamed ``Lord help me!'' and fell to the
floor with her child, Miss Regean said. Her only other words before
dying were to her husband, who was not at home at the time.
   ``She said, `Johnny, take care of the children,' and then she
died,'' said Miss Regean.
   Mrs. Peterson was shot once in the head and once in the chest
and was pronounced dead at the scene, Dunbar said Sunday.
   The infant was not injured and landed atop her mother's chest
when Mrs. Peterson fell to the ground, said Miss Regean, who is 18
and the girlfriend of Mrs. Peterson's 17-year-old son, Stephen.
   Dunbar said police had no motive in the shooting.
   Less than 30 minutes before the shooting, Miss Regean said, she
and her boyfriend heard five or six shots fired about two blocks
aways. Neighbors also heard the shots, and reported seeing a man
running down an alley behind the Peterson home, according to Miss
Regean.
   She said Mrs. Peterson's relatives, along with neighbors, told

   The four ran by firing 9mm automatics into the windows before

<HEAD>Paul Newman, Oprah Winfrey Among Honorary Degree Recipients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor, director and philanthropist Paul
Newman was among nine people being awarded honorary degrees at Yale
University's 287th commencement.
   Newman, who attended the Yale School of Drama in 1951, was to
receive a doctor of humane letters in recognition of his artistry
and his philanthropy.
   ``In the midst of a demanding career you dedicate a large
portion of your great gifts to the service of others,'' said the
citation to be read today by Yale President Benno C. Schmidt Jr.
   Newman will soon dedicate a summer camp for seriously ill
children. It's being funded in large part by proceeds from his food
company, Newman's Own Inc. The Connecticut company gives all its
profits to charity.
   The citation honoring Newman said the camp will provide ``an
exciting haven of adventure and humane care.''

   Television talk show host Oprah Winfrey
was awarded an honorary doctorate from Meharry Medical College,
prompting her to exclaim, ``It's now the Dr. Oprah Winfrey Show.''
   Ms. Winfrey, a former Nashville resident and Kosciusko, Miss.,
native, told 166 graduates at the predominantly black school that
they have a special role in the medical community.
   ``It's important to realize that it's not the `D' in front of or
behind your name that makes you somebody. It's what you do with
it,'' she told the 113th commencement Sunday.
   ``In 1988, the burden has not gotten any lighter. ... You are
not fixing a body, you are fixing a nation,'' said Ms. Winfrey
   Also at the commencement was Eppie Lederer, better known as
advice columnist Ann Landers. Lederer is on Meharry's Board of
Trustees.

   Writer, editor and teacher William
Zinsser urged Wesleyan University graduates to strive for fresh
thinking in seeking new careers.
   Zinsser, author of the book ``On Writing Well,'' was the main
speaker at Wesleyan's 156th commencement on Sunday.
   ``America has more than enough college graduates every year who
are willing to go through life being someone else's precise fit,''
Zinsser told the crowd.
   ``What we need are men and women who will dare to break the mold
of tired thinking and take us to new frontiers _ who just won't buy
somebody telling them, `We've always done it this way. This way is
good enough.'''
   With Colin G. Campbell conferring degrees for the final time as
Wesleyan's 13th president, the university awarded honorary degrees
to Zinsser and five others. Campbell becomes president of the
Rockerfeller Brothers Funds in September.
   The awards included 581 with bachelor of arts degrees; 108
masters of arts and 12 doctorates.

   Cornell University's president warned
graduating students that the commencement ceremony has its dangers.
   ``If I had one thing to do, I'd put a label on your diplomas
that would read, `The president has determined that graduation may
be dangerous for your health,''' Frank H.T. Rhodes told the 4,000
degree recipients on Sunday.
   ``Because graduation has been the grand objective for the last
four years. It has been your lodestar ... so what replaces all of
this now? I mean not just a first job, but what lodestar, what new
over-arching goal?''
   The second reason graduation is a danger ``has to do with the
academic style,'' said Rhodes, who because of Cornell tradition was
the only speaker at the commencement ceremony.
   ``Its results are abstraction, detachment, moral abstention. ...
It can substitute criticism for creativity, analysis for
affirmation, removing all the mystery, all the subtle intangible
qualities that give deeper meaning to our existence,'' he said.
   But there is an antidote to the dangers of graduation, Rhodes
said, quoting Albert Schweitzer.
   ``I don't know what your destiny will be, but one thing I know:
The only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have
sought and found how to serve,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Whip Through Plains; Snow Blankets Mountains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms today pelted the Plains with large hail and
several inches of rain, while snow dusted mountains in the West and
strong winds overturned boats in California and Utah.
   Thunderstorms were reported this morning in South Dakota,
Nebraska and southern Florida.
   Showers were scattered from southwest Montana, across northeast
Arizona and northwest New Mexico, turning to snow in the higher
elevations.
   In Texas, hail the size of golf balls pummeled McGregor Sunday
night while winds gusted to near 50 mph at Austin.
   Rain deluged an area near the Canyon Dam on the Guadalupe River
in Texas, with 5 inches of rain reported. The heavy rain caused a
10- to 15-foot rise on the river from the Canyon Dam to New
Braunfels.
   Advisories remained in effect for strong, gusty wind this
morning through much of Southern California.
   The high winds and rough surf kicked up by the storm battered
holiday boaters in California on Sunday, overturning boats,
uprooting anchors and leaving two boaters missing, officials said.
   While snow snarled traffic in the mountains throughout the
state, a series of wind-whipped grassland blazes plagued Southern
California firefighters, although there were no reports of
fire-related injuries or serious property damage.
   The fierce wind also lowered temperatures in the central
Rockies. Winds gusted to 51 mph at Grand Junction, Colo., causing
the temperature to plummet 14 degrees in one hour.
   A snow advisory was posted this morning over eastern Nevada and
the higher mountains of Utah. Also, a freeze warning was posted
over extreme western Nevada. Austin, Nev., reported a 9-inch snow
cover at midnight.
   In southern Utah, 50 mph winds whipped up 3- to 4-foot waves on
Lake Powell, sinking a 60-foot houseboat and damaging a number of
other boats, authorities say.
   Today's forecast called for showers in the northern
Appalachians; showers and occasional thunderstorms across southern
Florida; showers and thunderstorms from the Texas and Oklahoma
panhandles, across the western two-thirds of the Central Plains,
western South Dakota, the upper Missouri Valley and eastern
Wyoming; showers over the Rockies, becoming snow in the higher
elevations.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 50s and 60s from the
Rockies across the northern and central Pacific coast; in the upper
80s and low 90s from the Carolinas across the Tennessee Valley, the
lower Ohio Valley, much of the Mississippi Valley, southern
Michigan, southern Wisconsin and North Dakota; near 90 degrees
along the Gulf of Mexico coast; in the 70s to the mid 80s for the
rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Ely, Nev., to 79 degrees at Laredo, Texas.

   The first California condor conceived in
captivity has been moved to larger quarters so it can grow up in
contact with other members of its nearly extinct species, San Diego
Wild Animal Park officials say.
   The chick, named Molloko, weighed 6} ounces when it hatched
April 29. It weighed 3 pounds, 12 ounces when it was moved Saturday
from an ``infant isolette'' to a sand-floor pen in the park's
``condorminium,'' spokesman Tom Hanscom said.
   The chick is in excellent health and ``has become very active,
performing a behavior called hop-flapping which causes it to bounce
around in the isolette a bit,'' Hanscom said.
   ``We're seeing behavioral development which would indicate a
perfectly healthy bird both mentally and physically,'' he said.
``We're very happy with its condition. It continues to eat
voraciously, 50 skinned mice per day.''

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Najib opened a multi-party
national Parliament with a call to rebels to abandon their
eight-year war and join the government.
   Also Sunday, a guerrilla leader claimed anti-government forces
control 90 percent of the Afghan countryside.
   During talks in Peshawar, Pakistan, rebel alliance spokesman
Gulbadin Hekmatyar urged the U.N. official overseeing Afghan
refugees to work with reconstruction and resettlement commissions
already set up by the guerrillas.
   In Kabul, meanwhile, Najib said he would not concede any
territory to the guerrillas, who have been fighting his
Soviet-backed government for a decade.
   In a 20-minute speech interrupted seven times by applause from
members of Parliament, Najib continued his efforts to portray
himself as no longer the leader of a one-party state.
   The Parliament, the first in 15 years, was elected April 14 as
part of a government effort to widen its base. It consists of the
House of Representatives and a 158-member Senate and replaces the
Revolutionary Council as Afghanistan's law-making body.
   The guerrilla groups called the elections a farce.
   Foreign observers say virtually all the seats in the House not
occupied by members of Najib's People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan are held by groups or individuals with ties to the
government.
   Two former guerrillas hold what the government calls
``opposition'' seats.
   There are 50 vacant seats that Najib says have been left open
for the guerrillas if they stop fighting.
   ``We are ready to listen to the views of the opposition,'' Najib
said. ``We are ready to receive them in Kabul.''
   The session was held as rebel forces have been mounting attacks
in and around Kabul.
   Najib said the signing of an accord last month providing for the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan ``opened new doors for
peace in Afghanistan,'' but he said it ``does not mean overnight
peace.''
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have not halted their battle despite
the start of the Soviet withdrawal May 15, and they say they'll
keep fighting as long as Najib, a former secret police commander,
remains in power.
   Rocket attacks by the guerrillas have grown more frequent since
Soviet troops started withdrawing. The Kabul Times reported that
five people were killed in rocket attacks Friday.
   In the frontier city of Peshawar, U.N. refugee commissioner
Sadaruddin Agha Khan held talks with rebel leaders and refugees.
   He is charged with overseeing repatriation of refugees, who
number about 3 million in Pakistan and 2 million in Iran.
   Hekmatyar said guerrilla forces now hold 90 percent of the
Afghan countryside and told Agha Khan that he expects few Afghan
refugees to return this year.
   However, he said most will resettle within a few months after
all Soviet troops pull out. Final withdrawal is scheduled for Feb.
15, 1989.
   During his meeting with the seven-party rebel Afghan Alliance,
Agha Khan said, ``I made it clear to the people in Kabul we have to
have access to all regions everywhere in all provinces of
Afghanistan.''
   The Afghan government was told that ``help would never be
channeled through one particular source and be used as a weapon, ''
he said.
   Hekmatyar said millions of mines littering Afghanistan have to
be defused before refugees can return.
   ``It is the duty of the U.N. and its coordinator to ask and
persuade the Russians to de-mine all of Afghanistan and take back
all that they have planted,'' he said.

   A small group of sign-waving protesters

Saturday night.
   The concert, the first permitted at the 66-year-old stadium at
Ohio State University, drew about 62,000 fans. One man collapsed
while waiting to enter the stadium, but there were no reports of
serious injury.
   More than 160 Franklin County sheriff's deputies and university
and city police officers were on hand to control the crowd.
Security officers checked concert-goers to prevent them from taking
alcohol inside the stadium.

   Two dozen volunteers trying to save a
beached 28-foot gray whale shielded it from the sun and poured
water on it to prevent dehydration, but the whale died after a few
hours.
   The whale was discovered thrashing in the surf on an ocean beach
Friday afternoon by Naomi Leonardo, a youngster from Kirkland who
notified police.
   When Lyle Moss, a nearby resident, saw it was still on the beach
Saturday morning, he called Grays Harbor County sheriff's deputies.
Other residents and high school students also responded.
   Volunteers erected a shelter to keep the sun off the whale,
while others poured water over it.
   ``Those kids that came out, they really did a job,'' Moss said.
   Volunteers considered trying to free the whale at high tide
Saturday morning, but the water wasn't high enough, Moss said. The
whale died Saturday night.
   Gray whales can survive only a few hours ashore on their side
because internal organs become damaged, said Larry Waldron, a
Hoquiam resident who has worked to rehabilitate wildlife. The
volunteers knew the whale probably wouldn't survive but wanted to
ease its suffering, he said.
   The whale had fresh bite wounds that could have come from killer
whales off the coast. Killer whales that prey on seals in the area
probably drove the gray whale ashore, he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Firmer In Thin Late-Morning European Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in thin late-morning European
trading today. Gold prices were slightly higher.
   Traders said activity was quiet with New York, London and
Singapore markets closed for national holidays and few commercial
orders being made.
   Dealer in Milan and Frankfurt said the market was veering toward
a more bullish position on the dollar, due to rising U.S. interest
rates, signs of a narrowing trend in the U.S. trade deficit and the
absence of indications of a slump in U.S. economic performance.
   A poll of senior foreign exchange traders taken at a convention
in Hawaii last week showed many of them expecting the dollar to
move higher by the end of the year, dealers in Frankfurt said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.34 yen to a closing 124.98. Later, in
Europe, it was quoted slightly higher at 125.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's
rates:
   _ 1.72345 West German marks, up from 1.7140
   _ 1.4389 Swiss francs, up from 1.4305
   _ 5.78825 French francs, up from 5.7660

   _ 1,276.75 Italian lire, up from 1,270.75
   _ 1.2385 Canadian dollars, down from 1.24017
   In Europe, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.8515 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8570 in London late
Friday.
   In Zurich, gold was selling at a bid price of $453.00 a troy
ounce, up from $452.50 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.94 to close at a bid $454.31.
   Silver was quoted in Zurich today at a bid price of $6.58 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's late bid of $6.59 in London.

<HEAD>Palestinian Strike Only Partially Successful</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to CHANGE byline, UPDATE with partial strike,

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian general strike only partially
paralyzed the occupied lands today. It was the first time such a
protest faltered since the uprising against Israeli occupation
began in December.
   The underground United National Leadership had called for the
strike to keep attention focused on the protest during a
U.S.-Soviet summit. However, most of the Gaza Strip remained open,
and transport was running in some parts of the West Bank.
   Israeli leaders and some Palestinians have said support for
strikes and protests is waning.
   However, in the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp today, a
protest broke out after a 28-year-old Palestinian woman was shot
and her 9-month-old daughter lost an eye from a rubber bullet
during a clash with Israeli soldiers.
   Arab officials at Shifa Hospital said the woman, Najah Ahmed
Masoud, was shot in the left arm and her daughter, Huda, lost sight
in her left eye.
   Arab reports said the injuries came during a melee as Ms. Masoud
tried to block soldiers from arresting her brother. The army said
it was investigating the report.
   The uprising's underground leaders called for today's strike and
urged their compatriots to fly the outlawed Palestinian flag this
week as President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet in Moscow.
   ``A complete general strike, more confrontations on the occasion
of the Gorbachev-Reagan summit,'' said a leaflet issued Friday.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering told a meeting in Jersusalem on
Sunday that the Arab-Israeli conflict would be ``right on the top
of the list'' of regional issues discussed at the Moscow summit.
   Palestinian activists have said drawing attention of the
superpowers to their plight was one victory of the uprising. But
some also admit that support for strikes and street protests is now
diminishing.
   In the Gaza Strip today, shops were open, transit was running
and many people were out on the streets. The uprising had the most
devastating effect in that area until today.
   Arab reporters said the uprising leaders' leaflet calling for
today's general strike did not reach the Gaza Strip. Israel radio
also reported that few Palestinians saw the leaflet.
   Most businesses were closed in West Bank towns and cities and in
east Jerusalem. But many workers were reported going to jobs in
Israel and transport was running in some areas.
   Palestinian flags were flying in Nablus, the West Bank's largest
city, and in Jenin. In Bethlehem, new graffiti on walls warned
merchants not to open during the strike.
   ``We are going to burn everybody who will break the strike,''
one slogan said.
   On Sunday, the army said Israeli soldiers shot and wounded nine
Palestinians in scattered clashes with stone-throwing youths in
both Gaza and the West Bank. Arab newspapers said an Arab woman was
shot to death Sunday in the West Bank village of Jaba, where
protesters set up roadblocks to keep out Israeli soldiers.
   The army said seven protesters were shot after youths threw
stones at soldiers and that it was investigating the report of the
woman's death.
   An army spokeswoman said today that soldiers sealed four houses
in the West Bank and demolished one house in Gaza's Rafa refugee
camp in an effort to punish Palestinians who attacked Israeli
soldiers.
   By U.N. count, 198 Palestinians have died during the six-month
uprising in the lands Israel seized during the 1967 Middle East
war. Two Israelis also have been killed.
   Today's strike followed claims by Israeli leaders that the
uprising was fading.
   Shmuel Goren, the Israeli coordinator for the occupied lands,
said in an interview published today that the uprising has made no
political gains but that Israel still has not quelled the anger
that fueled the violent protests.
   ``There's still a way to go before we significantly undermine
the motivation,'' he told The Jersualem Post.
   Goren said the protests broke out spontaneously, not on orders
from the Palestine Liberation Organization, and that it surprised
even many Palestinians.
   He said the movement was failing because ``no alternative
instiutions have been created, even though this was one of the main
goals of the uprising.''
   On Sunday, junior high schools were opened for 70,000 West Bank
youngsters in the second stage of a program to resume classes in
1,200 schools shut nearly four months ago because of the uprising.
   Army officials reported no major trouble as 320 junior highs
reopened. It plans to resume classes in high schools on Sunday.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 20,000 Hyundai Motor Co. workers
walked out in a salary dispute today, halting production at the
nation's leading automaker, company officials said.
   Meanwhile, Hyundai Precision and Industry Co., a subsidiary of
the giant Hyundai group, remained closed for a fourth day in a
continuing labor dispute. Company officials said union members were
holding about 10 executives virtual hostages in offices inside a
plant.
   Hyundai Motor's assembly line in Ulsan on the southeastern coast
was shut down after more than 80 percent of union members voted for
a strike to press their demand for wage increases, the officials
said. The vote was taken on Saturday after seven rounds of
management-union talks had failed to solve the dispute, which began
May 18.
   The union sought an increase of 48 percent or $183 in monthly
earnings excluding bonuses, while management offered a 25 percent
hike or $106, the officials said. They said Hyundai auto workers
with five to six years of experience now earn about $821 a month,
including bonuses and other allowances.
   The officials said the strike would cost Hyundai, which sells
vehicles in the United States, an estimated $19 billion in daily
sales.
   About 2,000 workers at Hyundai Precision and Industry Co. on the
south coast continued a strike for a fourth day on Monday,
demanding higher wages and improved working conditions.
   Hyundai Precision officials said the striking workers were
holding about 10 company executives, including Chairman Chung
Mong-ku and President Yoo Ki-chul, virtual hostage and blocking
them from leaving their offices inside the plant.
   A union leader speaking on condition of anonymity told The
Associated Press by telephone, however, that the company executives
``remain here of their own will to solve the dispute.''
   Repeated efforts to connect telephone calls to the executives
failed.
   ``We don't know when the dispute would be solved. There are no
signs that the management would offer new talks today,'' a union
leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Workers at Hyundai Precision, a major manufacturer of train
cars, went on strike Friday. The dispute was aggravated when two
company officials were beaten unconsious by some striking workers
as they tried to leave the plant on Friday night.
   One official remained in critical condition at a hospital after
brain surgery. The other official was in serious condition with
head injuries.

   Nancy Reagan defended American students and their
study habits today when she got a grilling during a mini-press
conference with Soviet children at a prestigious middle school.
   ``Do American children learn Russian?'' queried one child in
Russian as Mrs. Reagan fielded questions during an hour-long visit
to School No. 29.
   All children at the school, which caters primarily to the
children of high officials and Soviet intelligentsia, begin to
study English at the age of 8.
   Mrs. Reagan, clearly aware most Russian language studies in the
U.S. are on the high school and college level, and that she was
among the children of many privileged people, responded, ``No, they
don't.''
   But then she parried, ``Do all the Soviet children in every
school here study English?''
   The children immediately broke out in loud argument, many
insisting that, indeed, all Soviet children do learn English.
   Mrs. Reagan, who holds no press conferences and prefers to deal
more informally with the press, was seated at the head of the class
as one child after another asked questions, some in English, some
in Russian, about whether U.S. children wear school uniforms, play
football and baseball and have a game like ``hide and seek.''
   The first lady, who finally remembered with a chuckle that she
had learned several Russian words, responded ``Yes, yes, I mean,
da, da,'' at one point.
   But she flunked a pronunciation test when the children tried to
get her to say the Russian words for peace, earth and sun _ mir,
zemlya and solnsa _ and she was able to get one out of three, at
one point throwing up her hands in exasperation.
   The 35 children from the first-grade English class at the school
entertained the first lady by singing such favorites as ``Yankee
Doodle,'' ``Do Re Mi,'' and ``School Days,'' as she awaited the
second round of summit talks between President Reagan and Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   ``I'm very impressed _ spacibo _ thank you,'' Mrs. Reagan said
as she accepted a box of pictures painted by the students.
   The first lady apparently made a favorable impression, said some
of the youngsters gathered outside the school, and many noted that
the authorities had spent two weeks cleaning and painting in
preparation for the visit.
   ``She has a very good smile, that is very important,'' said Ann
Kaslovskaya, a 15-year-old student at the school.
   After the school visit, Mrs. Reagan was driven about 15 miles
outside town to the wooded retreat Peredelkino, where she paid a
brief visit to the grave of famous Soviet poet Boris Pasternak.
Reporters were not allowed to view Mrs. Reagan's visit, which came
on the 28th anniversary of Pasternak's death.
   The author of ``Dr. Zhivago,'' Pasternak was awarded the Nobel
Prize for Literature in 1958, but his fame provoked a bitter
official campaign against him. He was forced to reject the award,
and returned to his dacha in Peredelkino where he died in 1960.
   The first lady remained in the wooded suburb to have lunch with
the Soviet poet Andrei Voznesensky, an official poet who is widely
published in the Soviet Union.
   Voznesensky, who spoke with reporters, said he was pleased to
have the first lady at his home so that she can have an
understanding of Soviet culture and ``something strange _ the
Slavic soul.''
   Mrs. Reagan's visit to the suburb came on the second day of her
visit.
   On Sunday, she met with Raisa Gorbachev and toured the Kremlin
and its collection of ancient churches and icons.
   Asked to explain lingering reports they dislike one another,
Mrs. Reagan shot back, ``You explain it to me.''
   Holding hands and smiling, the two women put on an elaborate
show of friendship. They dismissed the feuds as ``rumors.'' But
when the talk turned to religious activities the Soviet first lady
cut the conversation short.
   Every time they've met, Mrs. Reagan said, ``We've gotten along
very well.''
   On a tour of the ancient Russian fortress and its collection of
golden, onion-domed cathedrals, the first ladies were also often
shoulder-to-shoulder, discussing the religious paintings that
adorned the walls of the Cathedral of the Assumption as if they
were a pair of school girls.

   The rare peal of church bells rang out in Moscow
today as President Reagan visited the capital's oldest monastery
and told the monks he and other Americans prayed that perestroika
would bring religious freedom to the Soviet Union.
   ``The faith of your people has been tested and tempered in the
crucible of hardship,'' Reagan said. ``We may hope that perestroika
will be accompanied by a deeper restructuring ... and that
glasnost, which means giving voice, will also let loose a new
chorus of belief.''
   ``Our people feel it keenly when religious freedom is denied to
anyone anywhere, and hope with you that soon all the many Soviet
religious communities ... including the Ukrainian Catholic and
Orthodox Churches, will soon be able to practice their religion
freely and openly,'' he said.
   Reagan, accompanied by his wife Nancy, also quoted exiled Soviet
author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who referred to the church bells
that once sounded through Russia.
   ``In our prayers we may keep that image in mind,'' Reagan said,
``that the bells may ring again someday through Moscow and the
countryside.''
   Church chimes rarely are heard in Moscow, but rang twice for a
total of about six minutes during Reagan's visit, once when he and
his entourage arrived at the 13th century Danilov monastery, and
again when they left.
   The monastery was closed to worshipers during the visit but
several hundred Soviets crowded against police barricades near the
monastery and lined the nearby sidewalks during the 30-minute
visit, some waving at the American group.
   About 18 monks dressed in black robes and wearing gold crosses
listened to Reagan's comments and waved good-bye as he drove away.
   The monastery has been renovated in the last several years for
the celebration of the 1,000 anniversary of Christianity in Russia,
which begins next month.
   The Reagans briefly watched a monk restore a religious icon in
the Cathedral of the Holy Fathers. They were accompanied by
Metropolitan Filaret, the second highest ranking religious leader
in the Russian Orthodox Church hierarchy.
   The visit to the Danilov Monastery, the seat of the Orthodox
Chruch's patriarchate, followed Reagan's second summit session with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said the visit was planned ``to symbolize our concern for
religious freedom.''
   Reagan, who had a private conversation Sunday with Gorbachev
about human rights, has praised progress toward religious freedom
in the Soviet Union.
   In a speech on May 3, Reagan noted that some religious
dissidents have been allowed to emigrate, some new churches have
been organized and Soviet authorities have announced they will
permit the printing of 100,000 Bibles.
   Gorbachev also held an unusual meeting with leaders of the
Russian Orthodox Church on April 29 to appeal for their support. It
apparently was the first such session since 1943, when Stalin
conferred with church leaders to help rally the country against
Nazi Germany during World War II.
   It is unclear, however, whether Gorbachev's new flexibility in
dealing with the Orthodox Church signals substantially improved
conditions for other religious groups in the Soviet Union.
   The Danilov Monastery was built in the 13th century by the first
Prince of Moscow and served as part of the southern defenses of
Moscow. After a period of decline, it was rebuilt by Ivan the
Terrible in the 16th century.
   After the Russian revolution, the Soviet government took over
the monastery and turned the grounds into a factory. In May 1983,
the state returned the monastery to the church.
   Massive renovations were carried out as part of Soviet efforts
to fix up religious monuments for the millennium of Christianity in
ancient Russia.
   Unofficial estimates put the number of religious believers in
the Soviet Union at upwards of 90 million people.
   This includes 40 million to 50 million adherents of the Russian
Orthodox Church, 10 million Eastern Rite and Roman Catholics, 4
million Protestants, including Baptists and Pentecostals, 2 million
Jews and tens of millions of Moslems.

<TEXT>
   President Josip Broz Tito's widow,
involved in a dispute with the government over inheritance rights,
has filed a complaint with the Communist Party conference, the
state-run press reported today.
   The widow, Jovanka Broz, brought her petition into the
conference hall on Sunday when the meeting started, the Vecernje
Novosti daily said.
   Details of the complaint were not revealed.
   Mrs. Broz has lived in virtual seclusion since her husband died
in 1980 after ruling Yugoslavia for 35 years.
   In a letter circulated among Belgrade intellectuals two years
ago, Mrs. Broz charged that she was evicted from Tito's residence
in an exclusive Belgrade suburb soon after his death. She said she
was allowed to take what she said were only the most essential
personal effects.
   She filed a suit in 1985 to gain some of Tito's estate, mostly
paintings, furs, jewelry and furniture, but the government quashed
the move in December that year by ruling the goods were state
property.
   Mrs. Broz issued a similar complaint with the 13th Communist
Party Congress in June 1986 but she was escorted away from the hall
where the meeting was held and her demands were apparently not met.
   The reports Monday said two party officials had ``a brief
discussion'' with her after she turned in the petition and promised
that the conference would take up the matter along with other
complaints filed during the meeting.

   A powerful car bomb exploded in a
residential area of Christian east Beirut today. Police said the
blast tore off the front of eight apartment buildings, killed 15
people and wounded 68.
   No group claimed reponsibility for the car bomb, which exploded
500 yards from a branch office of President Amin Gemayel's
right-wing Phalange Party.
   Police said the explosion may indicate that Moslem and Christian
extremists have launched a new round of retaliatory car bombings in
Lebanon's civil war.
   The bombing occurred about two miles from Beirut's southern
slums, where Syrian troops deployed to stop fighting between
militant Shiite Moslems.
   Police said a blue Volvo car packed with an estimated 220 pounds
of TNT blew up in crowded Rmaeil Street in the Ashrafiyeh district
at 10:35 a.m. (4:35 a.m. EDT). Ten of the 15 bodies were charred
beyond recognition, police said.
   The explosion gouged a crater three feet deep and six feet wide
in the road. Three bulldozers were brought in to remove the debris.
   The blast gutted several shops and destroyed the fronts of eight
apartment buildings. More than 20 other buildings were badly
damaged and at least 30 cars were reduced to piles of smoldering,
twisted metal.
   Firemen battled several blazes ignited by the explosion, and
ambulances ferried casualties to hospitals. Radio stations
broadcast urgent appeals for blood donations. Severed overhead
power cables dangled onto the street and broken glass littered the
area for 300 yards around the blast scene.
   Phalangist militiamen and others from the Lebanese Forces, the
Christians' main militia, cordoned off the blast site and fired in
the air to clear paths for fire engines and ambulances through the
traffic.
   Walking past pools of blood, a jeweler picked pieces of gold
bracelets, rings and necklaces scattered outside his devastated
store.
   ``I'm still alive, that's what counts in a country like ours,''
he said, refusing to give his name.
   Zeina Ghobril, 24, a telephone switchboard operator whose home
was gutted in the blast, said: ``My father died six months ago,
leaving us only this house to live in. Now the house is gone and my
mother and I have no where to go.''
   Christian and Moslems have frequently attacked each other with
car bombs during Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war, killing hundreds
of people and wounding thousands.
   Five weeks ago, 69 people were killed and 111 wounded in the
northern port of Tripoli, a predominantly Sunni Moslem city 50
miles north of Beirut, when a car bomb exploded in a vegetable
market. Officials blamed Christians.
   Today's bombing came two days after Syrian troops deployed
throughout Beirut's southern slums to stop fighting between Shiite
Moslem militias.
   The Syrians were enforcing a cease-fire between the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal militia, who
had battled for three weeks for control of the maze of alleyways
and cement-block shanties.
   Police said 296 people were killed and 1,000 wounded in the
street battles, which left Hezbollah, or Party of God, in control
of most of the area.
   More than 130,000 people have been killed in Lebanon's civil war.

   A ferry boat carrying 172
passengers and crew ran aground off the southern Philippine island
of Mindanao, and one person aboard died, the Coast Guard said today.
   Coast Guard spokesman Cmdr. Benjamin Palafox said the 72-ton
Farida 6 developed engine trouble an hour after departing from
Pagadian City late Sunday on a voyage to Cotabato City, about 560
miles south of Manila.
   He said the vessel drifted for about five hours before running
aground 400 yards from the shore in Lanao del Norte province.
   Palafox said all passengers were safe except for a 50-year-old
woman, Felisa Abis, who died after apparently suffering a stroke or
heart attack when the vessel began to list.
   Initial unconfirmed reports said the ship sank and up to 115
people were feared drowned. But Palafox said latest reports refuted
the claim.
   Local reporters in Pagadian City said they were told early
Monday by the Coast Guard there that 115 people were feared dead.
Later, Coast Guard officials said they merely speculated on the
figure after receiving a sketchy radio report that the vessel was
in trouble and may have sunk.
   Officials said 12 of the 160 passengers were taken by helicopter
to Cotabato City and the rest were brought to Karomatan.
   Last December, the passenger ship Dona Paz collided with an oil
tanker off Mindoro island, and more than 3,000 people were believed
to have perished.

<HEAD>Sikh Governing Body Fires All High Priests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing body of the Sikh religion
today fired all five of the religion's high priests and charged
them with betraying the faith, news reports said.
   Forty-six people, mostly radicals, were killed when militant
Sikhs occupied the Golden Temple, the religion's holiest shrine,
for 10 days beginning May 9.
   The standoff ended when Indian security forces besieging the
temple in Amritsar attacked and drove out the heavily armed
terrorists.
   The priests were arrested and imprisoned after they tried to
defy a government curfew on the temple.
   The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee said today it
appointed five successors to the priests, Indian news agencies
reported. The committee met in Amritsar, the capital of Punjab
state, 260 miles north of New Delhi.
   The 160-member governing committee was quoted as saying it fired
the priests because they had betrayed the Sikh faith. It did not
elaborate.
   Those fired were Jasbir Singh Rode, the most senior Sikh priest;
Swinder Singh, leader of the Keshgarh Sahib shrine in Punjab;
Kashmir Singh, head priest of the Eternal Throne, which is the
complex housing the Golden Temple; Puran Singh, head priest of the
Golden Temple; and Jaswant Singh, head of the Damdama Sahib shrine,
also in Punjab.
   All five are in prison in Amritsar.
   The central government has been pressing the Sikh governing body
to promise in writing that it will not allow the Golden Temple to
be used again as a sanctuary by terrorists. But the committee so
far has not responded.
   Sikhism was founded about 500 years ago as an offshoot of
Hinduism that incorporates elements of the Moslem religion.
   The Sikhs are only 2 percent of India's 800 million people, but
they are a majority in Punjab. They claim discrimination by the
Hindus, who make up 80 percent of the population.
   In June 1984, the Indian army carried out a massive raid to
drive militants from the Golden Temple. More than 1,200 people were
killed.
   Five months later Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated
by two Sikh bodguards in revenge for the raid, setting off
anti-Sikh rioting in which 2,000 people died.

   An official news weekly echoed protesters'
complaints that conservatives are stacking delegates to blunt
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's push to enact reforms at a
next month's Communist Party conference.
   The magazine Ogonyok said Sunday that party bureaucrats have
squeezed reform-minded people out of seats for the June 28
conference, the first of its kind since 1941.
   The magazine reported that one such person is Moscow historian
Yuri Afanasyev, a leading proponent of Gorbachev's reforms who has
also backed an open review of dictator Josef V. Stalin's brutal
abuses of power.
   Political street demonstrations _ a rarity _ were reported in
Moscow and Leningrad on Saturday. They were said to have been
sparked by reports that midlevel party officials forced slates of
delegates through party meetings.
   The party's policy-making Central Committee approved conference
guidelines May 23 calling for limited terms of office for elected
party officials. The Central Committee also demanded that party
bureaucrats loosen central control of the government and economy.
   The deputy director of the the Central Committee's party
organizing unit, in an interview with the weekly newspaper
Arguments and Facts carried by the Tass news agency, acknowledged
problems with the selection of delegates.
   But the official, Georgy Kryuchnov, was quoted as saying, ``One
can still assert that it is the more respected members of the
party, active stalwarts of perestroika and socialist renewal, that
are being elected to go to the conference.''
   He said 3,000 delegates had been elected by May 25.
   But top officials have said the 5,000-member conference is
shaping up anyway as a showdown between reformers led by Gorbachev
and those who want to limit change and retain the perquisites of
privilege.
   Demonstrators in Leningrad and Moscow on Saturday marched in
support of the Central Committee's guidelines, participants
reported in telephone calls.
   ``We believe in the good intentions of Mikhail Sergeyevich
Gorbachev ... but we have to take perestroika into our own hands,''
said one participant in Moscow, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Perestroika'' is the term for Gorbachev's social and economic
reform program.
   In Moscow, 60 to 80 people marched from the Bolshoi Theater
across a broad square from the Kremlin to a monument of Russian
poet Alexander Pushkin.
   Moscow dissident Yuri Mitinov said Sunday that he thought the
Moscow protesters had acted, with official approval, for visiting
journalists covering this week's U.S.-Soviet summit.
   He said informal youth groups that organized the activity,
Community and Citizens' Dignity, never had shown any interest in
holding demonstrations and misinformed other groups about the
protest time.
   Mitinov is a spokesman for the Democratic Union, which advocates
an end to the Communist Party's political monopoly and was formed
this month at meetings attended by scores of people in Moscow.
   Sources in Leningrad said up to 2,500 people gathered in front
of the Kazan Cathedral under banners proclaiming ``Glasnost,
Democracy and Pluralism.'' The term ``glasnost'' is used for
Gorbachev's drive for greater openness and debate in Soviet society.
   Alexander Bogdanov, a member of Democratic Union, said
authorities confiscated posters and arrested 31 people at the
Leningrad protest.
   The Ogonyok article said party bureaucrats are ignoring
Gorbachev's call to prepare for the party conference in open
meetings.
   Officials in one party section of Moscow announced May 16 that
the selection of delegates would take place two days later, it said.
   ``It is not necessary to say that in such a short period of
time, it was impossible to carry out any kind of wide debate on the
candidates,'' Ogonyok said.
   In the Siberian city of Omsk, party officials published a list
of 37 candidates and the same day held a meeting at which the full
slate was approved, it said.
   ``There is a very difficult struggle between those who back
perestroika and those who don't,'' said economist Nikolai Shmelev
in a meeting with reporters Friday. But he said some delegates who
support Gorbachev's reforms were being selected as candidates for
the conference.

<HEAD>Unloading of Toxic Waste Delayed After Port Workers Strike</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: LEADS throughout to UPDATE</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GENOA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Port officials today delayed unloading a
freighter carring about 12,000 drums of toxic chemical wastes after
port workers went on strike to protest fumes from the ``ship of
poison.''
   The officials said the Syrian freighter Zanoobia would not be
unloaded until the chemicals are analyzed and damaged containers
are repacked, a process that could take several weeks.
   Four crewmen were treated at a hospital for nausea and stomach
pains possibly caused by months of exposure to its toxic cargo.
   For 15 months, the chemicals had roamed the seas in search of a
port that would dispose of its 2,200 tons of Italian-produced toxic
chemical wastes. Djibouti, Venezuela, Syria and Greece were tried
and refused.
   Lawyers for the ship's owner, Tabalo Shipping, say two people
have died, possibly after being contaminated by the wastes _ a boy
in Venezuela and a Zanoobia crewman during the voyage to Italy.
   The Zanoobia, the third ship to carry the chemicals, docked in
Genoa on Sunday after officials agreed to accept and incinerate the
toxic cargo. The Italian press is calling it the ``ship of poison.''
   The ship was moved today to a more isolated dock after hundreds
of port workers walked off their jobs to protest the smell. Unions
said the protest prevented the unloading of seven other freighters.
   Ahmed Tabalo, the captain of Zanoobia, said some of the drums of
unidentified chemical waste are damaged and may be leaking
chemicals.
   Three of the crewmen examined at the hospital today were
released, but one was admitted for observation, doctors at San
Martino Hospital said.
   Five crewmen were hospitalized earlier this month with symptoms
possibly caused by exposure to the wastes.
   ``The condition of my crew is very bad,'' Tabalo said after the
ship docked in Genoa. ``For three months we have not entered a
port. Now we are all nauseous and sick to the stomach.''
   The Zanoobia had been moored outside the northern Italian port
of Carrara since April 26, seeking permission to unload the cargo
orginally shipped from Carrara in February 1987.
   Francesco Rizzuto, a lawyer for Tabalo Shipping, said a group of
Italian chemical companies paid the Milan-based company Jelly Wax
about 36 cents a pound to dispose of the waste. He said the company
instead shipped the waste out of the country.
   The waste was sent first to Djibouti, in East Africa, which
refused the waste. The cargo was unloaded in Venezuela, but a young
boy died reportedly after playing near an opened drum, and the
government ordered the waste shipped out of the country, a lawyer
for the Zanoobia's owners said.
   It was sent to Syria and then on to Greece. After being refused
in both places, the ship sailed to Carrara.
   A Zanoobia crewman died during the trip from Greece to Carrara,
and lawyers for Tabalo Shipping have asked Italian prosecutors to
file charges against Jelly Wax if the death resulted from
contamination.
   Officials said the wastes will be burned at a local incinerator
at a cost of between 72 cents and $1.86 a pound.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Four Hostages May Soon Be Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three American professors and an Indian
educator kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut 16 months ago may be freed
soon, the leftist As-Safir daily reported today.
   The newspaper, which cited unidentified sources close to
President Amin Gemayel, linked the possible release to the
deployment of Syrian troops in Beirut's southern slums. The troops
were sent in to end three weeks of fighting between Shiite Moslem
factions.
   The newspaper gave no other details.
   The four men were abducted Jan. 24 last year from the campus of
the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College by gunmen posing as
policemen.
   The Americans are Robert Polhill, 53, of New York City, a
professor of business; Jesse Turner, 40, of Boise, Idaho, a
mathematics professor; and Alan Steen, 49, of Boston,
Massachussetts, a journalism professor.
   The Indian is Mithileshwar Singh, 60, a professor of finance and
a U.S. resident.
   Most of the 18 hostages in Lebanon _ including nine Americans _
are believed held in the slums of south Beirut by extremist Shiite
factions linked to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Syria on Friday sent an estimated 2,400 troops into the slums to
halt a three-week battle between its main Lebanese ally, the Amal
militia, and Hezbollah, in which 300 people were killed and 1,000
wounded. During the fighting, Hezbollah seized control of more than
90 percent of the 16-square-mile area.
   The Syrian troops have stayed away from Hezbollah's main
barracks in the Hay Madi district, where most of the hostages are
believed to be held. But a Lebanese security source said the
Syrians control all approaches to the area around the barracks.
   ``It's now difficult, if not impossible, for the kidnappers to
move the hostages anywhere else,'' said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Syria has pledged to seek their release, but said that would be
done through negotiations rather than military force.
   A four-party committee made up of representatives of Syria,
Iran, Amal and Hezbollah was meeting today to negotiate a
cease-fire between the two rival militias, followed by an exchange
of prisoners.
   A leading Shiite Moslem cleric has also pledged to work for the
release of the hostages.
   ``Although I possess no great means of pressure, I shall exert
continuous efforts to resolve the question of the hostages,''
Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of the
Hezbollah, was quoted as saying.
   ``I am viewing the hostages' issue from both humanitarian and
Islamic standpoints. It is hurting our credibility,'' the Beirut
daily Ad-Dijar quoted Fadlallah as saying in an interview published
Sunday.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian Shiite
faction of Hezbollah, claimed it had kidnapped the professors. It
has demanded the release of 400 Arab prisoners held by Israel.
   Islamic Jihad also holds at least two other American hostages.
   They are Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East Correspondent
of The Associated Press, and Thomas Sutherland, 55, dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut. Anderson,
abducted March 16, 1985, is the longest held of the foreign
hostages.

   President Reagan told Soviet dissidents and
refuseniks today the time is ripe to press for human rights because
Kremlin leaders ``appear to grasp the connection between certain
freedoms and economic growth.''
   Speaking to several dozen dissidents gathered in Spaso House in
U.S. Embassy compound after visiting a 13th century monastary,
Reagan said that while there have been ``hopeful signs'' of
improvement in the Soviet Union, ``there can be no relenting for us
now. We must work for more, always more.''
   ``I came here to give you strength, but it is you who have
strengthened me,'' the president said in a meeting that some Soviet
officials had criticized as going to far to criticize internal
affairs in the country.
   ``While we press for human lives through diplomatic channels,
you press with your very lives, day in and day out, risking your
homes, your jobs and your all,'' Reagan told the group in remarks
which brought occasional applause from his audience.
   ``We hope that one freedom will lead to another,'' the president
said, saying he hopes Soviet leaders realize that economic growth
hinges to a large degree on individual initiative.
   An individual Soviet citizen, Reagan said, must sense that the
government ``respects him enough to grant him all his human
rights.''
   During the session, interrupted from time to time by the giggles
of children, Reagan was besieged by requests to sign his autograph
on placecards.
   Several people who attended the 55-minute session praised Reagan
for meeting with them and drawing attention to their plight.
   ``I am very impressed that human rights problems have such a
high standing outside our country,'' said Judith Lurie, a refusenik
who has been denied permission to leave the Soviet Union because
she is Jewish.
   ``All of our friends who know about this meeting were very happy
about it,'' she said.
   Gleb Yakunin, a Russian Orthodox priest who spoke at the meeting
with Reagan and his wife, Nancy, said the president ``talks
directly to us about human rights. It is clear that he is sincere
as a person. He showed that this is not just a formal matter for
him.''
   Yakunin was sentenced to five years in exile in 1980, but the
Soviet government relented last year, freed him and assigned him a
parish.
   In advance of Reagan's arrival from his visit to the Danilov
monastery, roughly 100 guests had their names checked against a
list of invitees, and Soviet police let them inside the new embassy
compound. Spaso House is a half-mile ride from the entrance to the
American facility.
   U.S. officials kept secret the identity and even the number of
the guests expected to meet Reagan, apparently fearful that Soviet
authorities would interefere with dissidents invited to the
president's Moscow residence.
   At least one guest, Roald ``Alec'' Zelichonok, a Leningrad Jew
refused permission to emigrate for more than 10 years, reported
last week that Soviet security police had warned him not to travel
to Moscow to meet with Reagan.
   Moscow refuseniks have not reported any similar warnings, but
U.S. Embassy officials said they had made arrangements to pick the
guests up at a city meeting point and drive them together to Spaso
House, the U.S. Ambassador's residence where Reagan is staying.
   On Sunday, Reagan considered making a private visit to a
refusenik family, the Ziemans, but U.S. officials scrubbed the trip
after the Soviets indicated it could damage the family's chance to
emigrate after 11 years of waiting for an exit visa.
   The Ziemans said they planned to attend Monday's reception, and
Yuri Zieman said other refuseniks invited included Benjamin
Charney, who has campaigned for a visa for medical treatment in the
West, and Yuli Kosharovsky, who has been waiting for 17 years to
emigrate.
   At the White House, Reagan has received some of the most
well-known Soviet dissidents allowed to leave the country,
including Jewish activists Natan Sharansky and Yuri Orlov, a member
of the Moscow group founded to monitor Soviet compliance with the
Helsinki Act.
   Andrei Sakharov, once the Soviet Union's most well-known
dissident, did not attend the reception, but has been invited to
the Reagans' formal dinner for Gorbachev on Tuesday night.
   Sakharov, who turned 67 on May 21, has restricted his contacts
with Western diplomats and journalists since he returned to Moscow
in December 1986 from internal exile in the closed city of Gorky.
But he still speaks out on human rights issues in the Soviet Union,
calling for the release of political prisoners and the ending of
psychiatric abuse.
   Many other figures have emerged to campaign for more political
freedom in the Soviet Union and for the rights of Jews and others
seeking to emigrate, and most are thought to have been invited to
meet Reagan.
   Sergei Grigoryants, founder of an independent journal called
Glasnost, was among those at the reception. Another former
political prisoner, Lev Timofeyev, also was invited.
   Reagan's dissident meeting was preceded by a visit to Moscow's
Danilov monastery, where he greeted representatives of the
officially tolerated Russian Orthodox church.
   The church, which adheres to limits imposed by the officially
atheist state, has come into the limelight even in state-run media
recently, following a unique Kremlin meeting between Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and the head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch
Pimen.
   But religious activists like Alexander Ogorodnikov, who was
among the 300 or so political prisoners released from Soviet labor
camps last year, were to have a chance to tell Reagan about
religious activities outside the confines of the state-sanctioned
churches at Monday's reception.
   Reagan has made restrictions on religion a focus in his
statements on human rights leading up to the summit, listing them
first in a human rights speech given in Chicago May 4.
   Grigoryants, who was jailed for a week after a police raid on
his independent newspaper May 7, will give Reagan some pointers on
his second area of human rights concern, freedom of speech.

   Delegates to a national Communist
Party conference said today that party leaders should be ousted if
they fail to end the nation's economic crisis, the state-run news
agency said.
   ``The leadership will either fulfill the desire of the people or
the people will replace it...,'' Serbian Party leader Slobodan
Milosevic was quoted by the Tanjug news agency as telling the
delegates.
   He did not elaborate, but his comments appeared to refer to
members of the party's Central Committee and the ruling Politburo.
   ``Unless we carry through a complete social reform by next
autumn, it will be necessary to call a special (party) congress,''
Milosevic said, echoing similar calls from other delegates.
   The special congress, which would likely be held at the end of
the year, would study why the resolutions of a party congress held
two years ago had not been implemented.
   A party congress, which would bring together several thousand
delegates, would have substantial power to make personnel and party
rule changes. The role of a party conference is largely advisory.
   Dimitrije Kocovic, a delegate from Belgrade, attacked former and
current party leaders for not implementing economic changes
suggested at the last party congress.
   ``The greatest responsibility for this is borne by presidents of
presidiums of the Central Committee ... in this period _ Milanko
Renovica and Bosko Krunic,'' Kocovic said.
   The three-day conference began Sunday amid a growing economic
crisis that has caused widespread social unrest and provoked
unpopular austerity measures.
   The government on Saturday launched a major austerity program
that included substantial price increases, wage cuts of up to 30
percent and a 24 percent devaluation of the dinar, the national
currency.
   Yugoslavia has been saddled with 170 percent inflation, a $21
billion foreign debt and a 15 percent unemployment rate.
   The new austerity measures are expected to further erode
Yugoslavia's standard of living and set off a new wave of social
unrest following sporadic strikes in anticipation of the
belt-tightening moves.
   Party chief Krunic on Saturday said hard times would continue
and that ``social upheavals are certain to take place and may be
grave.''
   But Krunic, in his speech to 800 delegates, rejected calls for a
multi-party system to help solve the nation's political crisis.
   Krunic made it clear that the League of Communists, or Communist
Party, intended to keep one-party rule, but added that ``deeper and
more daring changes in the political system'' must be made to
regain public confidence in the party.
   During today's debate, Tanjug quoted Simeon Buncic, a delegate
of the Yugoslav armed forces, as saying that Yugoslavia faced the
``most critical stage of its socialist development.''
   Drago Subotic, a delegate from Sarajevo, in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
demanded that ``all those about whom the press negatively wrote
must leave the Central Committee and its presidium (Politburo) as
soon as possible,'' Tanjug said.
   Jovan Djordjevic, a worker from the city of Nis in Serbia, said
workers and young people are losing faith in the party.
   ``While the workers are becoming socialist paupers, there is an
increasing number of billionaires and private aircraft,''
Djordjevic was quoted as saying.
   The three-day conference follows rumors of an attempted national
military takeover to suppress dissent in Slovenia, Yugoslavia's
most advanced republic. The government denied the rumors.
   Earlier this month, Slovenia filed an unsuccessful motion in the
federal Parliament requesting the removal of Premier Branko Mikulic.
   ``A society which enters such a crisis ... cannot emerge from it
without profound changes,'' said the party chief on Sunday.
``Social upheavals are certain to take place and may be grave.''
   Compounding Yugoslavia's economic problems are unresolved ethnic
tensions in this mostly Balkan nation. Its republics range from the
southern Serbian province of Kosovo with its 85 percent Albanian
population to northern Slovenia, which borders Austria and Italy.

   Likely Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis today promised black supporters that Jesse Jackson would be
offered a major role at the party's convention and in the fall
campaign.
   Dukakis, according to participants in a breakfast meeting
attended by about 100 black supporters from across the country,
also promised an increased black presence in his national and state
campaign organizations.
   ``I think we can put together as strong a coalition that has
ever been put together in any presidential campaign,'' Dukakis told
reporters after the session, which was closed to the media.
   ``This is now the beginning of a major effort that we will be
making all across America,'' Dukakis said. He was not specific
about what role he would offer Jackson but said he expected the
civil rights leader's support.
   Former New Orleans Mayor Dutch Morial described the session as
``candid'' and said the black Dukakis supporters would work to
assure that black Jackson supporters do not defect to Bush.
   After the session, Dukakis attended a wreath-laying ceremony as
part of local Memorial Day services in Boston.
   On Sunday, Dukakis told New Jersey environmentalists mistakes he
made as governor would make him a stronger president.
   Dukakis spent the day in New Jersey, decrying ocean dumping of
trash, sludge and untreated sewage and called for national programs
to promote recycling and conservation.
   ``It's pretty disgusting,'' Dukakis said about the polluted
waters off New Jersey which he saw while aboard the S.S. Miss
Belmar, a large charter boat based in the New Jersey shore town of
Belmar.
   Dukakis called for an active federal role in the cleanup of
polluted waterways and conceded he had made a mistake by delaying
for more than a decade the cleanup of Boston Harbor, a project that
now will cost more than $3 billion.
   ``Nobody is without sin,'' Dukakis told reporters aboard the
boat. ``Let he who is without sin cast the first stone,'' he said
later when asked whether New Jersey and New York officials had
ignored pollution of waters off those states.
   Dukakis denounced President Reagan's environmental policies,
saying the president came to Washington intent on destroying the
Environmental Protection Agency and has allowed his Interior
Department secretaries to encourage ``ridiculous'' plans to drill
offshore for petroleum and natural gas.
   ``It's going to take a president and the Congress and an
Environmental Protection Agency that understands what the law is
and takes its job seriously to make a difference,'' Dukakis said.
   He said state and local governments would have to pay the bulk
of the costs of environmental programs but said an active federal
government could provide grants, loans and technical assistance.
   In his first term as governor in the mid-1970s Dukakis balked at
an early plan to clean up Boston Harbor, which the EPA ranks as the
nation's filthiest. A Reagan-appointed EPA regional director in
Washington has gone to federal court several times in the past two
years to get the Dukakis administration to hasten the pace of the
current cleanup.
   After the boat cruise Dukakis attended a barbecue in Linden.
   Twice during that appearance he said God had created a beautiful
environment that man should not destroy. Dukakis, who rarely refers
to God or religion in his speeches, is under attack from a
conservative group that claims he has exploited Greek Americans for
fund-raising but has not been a practicing member of the
Greek-Orthodox church.
   Dukakis had declined comment when asked Saturday about the
conservative effort, which includes mass mailing of a letter
calling him a pagan, and he was not available for comment after his
appearance at the barbecue.
   While in New Jersey Dukakis also attended three private
sessions, an environmental forum, a meeting with Hispanic leaders
and a reception for a Democratic state senator running for Congress.
   Dukakis was to return to New Jersey later this week for a day of
campaigning before heading to California for several days. He also
plans stops in New Mexico and Montana. Those four states hold the
final primaries on June 7, when Dukakis could pick up enough
delegates to gain a mathematical lock on the nomination.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former presidential candidate who was
kidnapped by men firing machine guns died of wounds suffered during
the abduction, a man identifying himself as one of the kidnappers
told a radio station today.
   In another development, 13 people were killed and 40 were
wounded during a clash between army troops and attackers who joined
a farmers' protest march in a small town in central Colombia.
   The government said President Virgilio Barco Vargas Barco
probably would cut short a tour of Europe and the United States and
return.
   Barco, who arrived in Spain from Portugal today, had planned to
spend two days in Spain, then meet with Pope Paul II in Rome and
President Reagan in Washington.
   Alvaro Gomez Hurtado, 69, was kidnapped on Sunday by four men
who killed his only bodyguard. Gomez, who was leaving church
services in Bogota, is a newspaper editor and the son of former
President Laureano Gomez.
   The anonymous man who called the radio station Todelar said the
kidnappers soon would tell where Gomez's body is.
   About a half hour after the kidnapping, a man who said he was a
kidnapper called Todelar. He said Gomez had been wounded and then a
voice was heard that Gomez's family later said was his.
   ``I'm wounded. I'm wounded. Oh, oh. They shot me. Twice. I'm
dying,'' the man who apparently was Gomez said.
   The voice of the man who called Todelar today appeared to be the
same voice of the man claiming to be a kidnapper in the telephone
call received on Sunday by Todelar.
   Those killed during the farmers' protest march on Sunday
included a colonel, a captain, two soldiers and nine peasants,
Mayor German Obando of the town of San Vicente said today in an
interview with the Bogota radio station Caracol. Six soldiers and
34 peasants were wounded in the fighting, he said.
   Obando said there were about 6,000 farmers in the protest. The
peasants are demanding land reform and investigation of right-wing
death squads who have killed more than 800 persons in the last
three years.
   Leftist guerrillas among the protesting farmers opened fire
first on the army troops, Gov. Eduardo Camacho of the state of
Santander said in a broadcast interview today with the Bogota radio
station RCN.
   Right-wing death squads also are active in the area and leftist
guerrillas are so strong that bus companies refuse to serve some
small towns near San Vicente, 160 miles northwest of the capital,
Bogota.
   In other violence, an army colonel, a captain and three other
soldiers were killed on Sunday in an apparent guerrilla ambush near
San Vicente, police said.
   Also Sunday, two soldiers were killed in an ambush in the
northern region of Urba, RCN quoted the national police as saying.
   On Saturday, three mayors-elect were kidnapped in towns in the
northern state of Bolivar. They are Andres Castro of Pinillos,
Antonio Morato of Rio Viejo and Henry Cosio of Barrnaco de Loba,
the police said.
   The leftist guerrilla National Liberation Army, claimed
responsibililty, police said. The mayors-elect were to have taken
office on Wednesday.

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis, launching
a drive a shore up minority support for the November election,
promised black supporters today that Jesse Jackson will be offered
a major role at both the Democratic convention and in the fall
campaign.
   The Massachusetts governor, in a breakfast meeting in Boston
with 100 black supporters from across the nation, also promised to
boost the black presence in his national and state campaign
organizations, participants said.
   On Sunday, Jackson, his only remaining rival, sent Dukakis a
reminder that ``it will take both of us to win.''
   Dukakis told reporters after the closed session with black
officials, ``I think we can put together as strong a coalition that
has ever been put together in any presidential campaign.''
   ``This is now the beginning of a major effort that we will be
making all across America,'' Dukakis said. He was not specific
about what role he has in mind for Jackson.
   Certain Republican nominee George Bush, at his summer home in
Maine, was marching in a Memorial Day parade today and continuing a
weeklong strategy session with aides and GOP officials.
   The vice president's advisers are working on ways to shore up
his standing against Dukakis, who has been consistently out-polling
Bush in public opinion surveys.
   The Bush camp indicated over the weekend that the vice president
would begin attacking the Massachusetts governor more aggressively
and moving away from President Reagan on some issues.
   With the Democratic primary season heading into its final week,
Dukakis and Jackson both campaigned Sunday in New Jersey, one of
four states staging contests on June 7. The New Jersey race, plus
primaries in California, New Mexico and Montana, offers a total of
466 delegates.
   Dukakis, with more than 1,700 delegates, is within striking
distance of the 2,081 needed to nominate, while Jackson trails with
less than 1,000 delegates.
   The Massachusetts governor expects to clinch the delegates he
needs with the final round of primaries and a continuing stream of
commitments from ``super delegates,'' who vote at the convention by
virtue of their party or elective office.
   Jackson is signalling that he knows it's almost the end of the
road for his presidential bid.
   ``When the race is over June 7, life goes on June 8,'' he said
as he campaigned in New Jersey. But his pride was evident as he
told a crowd: ``We should never forget this campaign.''
   And Jackson has been making it clear that even if the nomination
is out of reach, he expects to play a major part in shaping the
Democratic platform. He is also indicating that the massive black
support he has garnered in primary contests to date shouldn't be
taken for granted by the Democratic nominee.
   ``It's going to take the both of us to win,'' said Jackson,
referring to himself and Dukakis. ``Together, we're gonna win.''
   Dukakis took a boat cruise with environmentalists, who showed
him polluted waters off New Jersey on Sunday. Last summer, New
Jersey beaches were closed on several occasions by pollution,
including sewage and hospital waste that washed ashore.
   ``It's pretty disgusting,'' said the governor on viewing trash
and sludge in the water off Asbury Park.
   But Dukakis acknowledged that he himself had been slow in
starting a cleanup of filthy Boston Harbor. The Environmental
Protection Agency finally got a court order to speed things up.
   ``Nobody is without sin,'' the governor said.
   Dukakis' record as governor of Massachusetts has been coming
under close scrutiny, and some backers of Bush say there's plenty
of potential ammunition. New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who met
with Bush over the weekend at Kennebunkport, cited ``management
failures of the Dukakis administration'' and said those would
become campaign issues.
   Bush, in turn, has come under fire for weeks from both Jackson
and Dukakis over the administration's dealings with Panama's Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Jackson was on the attack again over the weekend, suggesting
that Reagan wanted a deal to get Noriega out of power to silence
him before the Moscow summit, which began Sunday.
   Dukakis marked the start of the summit by saying he believed the
Soviet Union's economic problems led Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to agree to arms reductions.
   ``I think that is the driving force behind this, the recognition
on his part that they're falling further and further behind,
they're losing the economic race, the technological race and that
they cannot be a great nation unless they significantly reduce the
amount of resources they're putting into the military,'' he said in
an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
   The interview was taped last week while Dukakis campaigned in
California. He was heading back to the state for more campaigning
later this week.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's legal problems continued to
dog the Bush campaign. White House chief of staff Howard Baker said
Sunday that President Reagan still has confidence in Meese but
believes Meese's legal problems could harm Bush politically ``for
the moment and to some degree.''
   ``But I think that he too would urge you to wait and see how all
this unfolds and develops,'' Baker added in the interview with
NBC's ``Meet the Press.''

   Opposition leaders said today they
might finally be able to field candidates in elections ushered in
by President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq's surprise dismissal of the
government.
   Zia on Sunday dissolved the National Assembly, fired Prime
Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo and dismissed Junejo's 33-member
Cabinet. He said they had failed to maintain law and order and
promote an Islamic society.
   The president did not elaborate on his reasons for disbanding
the government, an action he announced just minutes after Junejo
returned from a toru of China, South Korea and the Philippines.
   The official media also announced the dissolution of provincial
assemblies in Punjab, Sind, Baluchistan and North-west Frontier
Province.
   Junejo today criticized Zia for dismissing the assembly and his
Cabinet and said his party, the Pakistan Muslim League, will win
upcoming elections.
   Junejo told a news conference: ``The dissolution of the National
Assembly by the president ... is an action taken completely
arbitrarily and solely on his own. The action is against the
fundamentals of the democratic process.''
   In 1984 elections, political parties were not allowed to field
candidates, and opposition parties boycotted the voting.
   But Zia, an army general, said Sunday that new elections will be
held within 90 days in which political parties will be allowed to
propose their own candidates for Assembly seats.
   The pledge indicated that, for the first time since Zia seized
power in a bloodless 1977 coup, opposition parties might be allowed
to participate.
   The 64-year-old president was to address the nation later today
to announce a caretaker government. He said Sunday that the Senate,
the upper house of Parliament, would remain intact.
   Junejo's was the first civilian Cabinet since martial law,
imposed by Zia in 1977, was lifted eight years later.
   Benazir Bhutto, leader of the opposition Pakistan People's
Party, was quoted today in the English-language newspaper The
Muslim as saying she welcomes Zia's move but still has doubts.
   ``We will wait until the rules of the game are spelled out,''
she was quoted as saying.
   Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was a prime minister toppled by
Zia and hanged in 1979 on a murder conspiracy conviction.
   Ethnic riots in southern Sind province and the port city of
Karachi have killed hundreds of people over the past two years
since Zia lifted martial law and handed limited power over to
Junejo's Muslim League government.
   The government dismissal came less than two weeks before the
Assembly was to debate a new budget in which Zia was expected to
request substantial increases in military spending.
   In an editorial, the pro-Muslim League newspaper The Nation
wrote today that the dismissals ``came as a total surprise and as
an ironic anti-climax to Mr. Junejo's ardent speeches to foreign
audiences about how well the country was doing and democracy
thriving under him.''
   Other English-language newspapers quoted opposition leaders as
being surprised but optimistic.
   One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he was stunned by the president's moves, although he had heard
rumors the past few days of a possible government shakeup.
   Junejo, 56, his Cabinet and the National Assembly were scheduled
to remain in office until 1990. They were elected in the non-party
elections boycotted by the opposition in Dec. 1984. Junejo was
appointed prime minister in March 1985.

   A rocket launched as part of a river
festival went awry and exploded in a crowd, injuring 15 people,
fire officials said.
   Two of the injured, a 34-year-old man and a 5-year-old girl,
were hospitalized in serious condition.
   The fireworks display Sunday night was being held as part of the
annual River Fest on the banks of the Stillwater River in downtown
Dayton.
   A rocket apparently misfired and streaked toward the crowd,
hitting the bank near the river's edge and then ricocheting upward,
said Fire Chief Glenn Alexander. Spectators were sprayed with
sparks and debris.
   Officials are investigating the cause of the accident, Alexander
said.
   Jerry Cline, who was sitting on the levee just a few feet from
the explosion, said the shell bounced along the levee and ``sprayed
fire'' for about 50 yards along the bank.
   The fireworks display continued while rescue crews treated the
injured.
   San Diego Fireworks, the company hired to put on the fireworks
display, also handled pyrotechnics for Michael Jackson concerts,
Alexander said.
   The company, he said, met all the city's safety requirements,
obtained the necessary permit and posted a $1 million insurance
bond.
   Alexander said spectators were assembled at places considered a
safe distance from where the fireworks descended.

   Government troops killed six
communist rebels today during a pre-dawn battle that began when the
guerrillas attacked an army detachment on the southern island of
Mindanao, the military said.
   It also said gunmen massacred six members of a family, including
an 8-month-old girl, during a raid early today in the province of
Ilocos Norte, about 250 miles north of Manila.
   Dante Foronda, his wife Julie and four of their children died,
but two other children survived the gunshot wounds, according to
provincial commander Lt. Col. Romeo Acap.
   He said witnesses saw an undetermined number of armed men enter
the Foronda home near the town of Vintar about midnight. The motive
for the killing and the identity of the assailants were unknown,
Acap said.
   In the Mindanao province of Bukidnon, about 400 miles south of
Manila, 100 New Peoples Army guerrillas attacked a company
detachment near the town of Valencia at 4:30 a.m., said Lt. Col.
Rodolfo Lorayes, operations chief of the 4th Infantry Division.
   There were no casualties among the troops, who had been warned
of the raid and opened fire with machine guns and automatic
weapons, killing six of the communist rebels, he said.
   The soldiers recovered five M-16 rifles and one Gerand rifle
from the dead guerrillas, he said.
   The New Peoples Army has been waging a 19-year insurgency to
establish a Marxist state in the Philippines.

   A series of fights that broke out after a
concert and a fajita cookoff left one person fatally shot and at
least three others hospitalized with stab wounds, authorities said.
   Traffic backups near the Pasadena Civic Center and Fair Grounds
apparently caused tempers to flare and led to the shooting, police
said.
   Sherry Ann Longoria, 24, died late Sunday during surgery for a
gunshot wound, according to Theresa Kowpak, Hermann Hospital
administrative manager. A 17-year-old boy and a 26-year-old man
were both in serious but stable condition with stab wounds.
   At least one other person was injured, but police were unsure of
the number because they were still gathering information today.
   ``It was initiated it looks like because of traffic problems''
at the Civic Center, said Betty Parks, a spokeswoman for the
Pasadena Police Department. The center is located on the fair
grounds.
   A total of 11 people were arrested on a variety of charges;
about 20 witnesses were questioned. Seven were arrested in one
incident before the shootings and stabbings, said Ms. Parks, adding
she had no estimate how many people had attended the concert and
cookoff.
   The traffic problems were compounded by a car that went into a
ditch, she said. Afterward, she added, ``Tempers flared, one guy
pulled a gun and it got out of hand.''

   The military detonated a
remote-controlled underwater mine outside a major naval base Monday
after a warning system indicated possible foreign submarine
activity.
   Per Brissman, a defense staff spokesman, said frogmen were
searching the area outside the Musko base, about 25 miles south of
Stockholm.
   He said there had been no more indications of foreign underwater
activity since the blast early in the morning.
   A Soviet submarine ran aground outside a Swedish naval base in
1981, and the government protested a Soviet incursion in 1982.
   Each year, Sweden's armed forces stage operations against
suspected intruders, but none has been identified since 1982. The
military generally bars independent observation of its anti-sub
activities and keeps details of its own observations secret.

<HEAD>Historian Seeking Medal of Honor for Two Black War Heroes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not one Medal of Honor went to any of the 1.5
million blacks who fought in World Wars I and II, a fact historian
Leroy Ramsey wants to change.
   Ramsey has found the records of two black servicemen he says
deserve the medal: Sgt. Henry Johnson, of Albany, N.Y., and Seaman
Dorrie Miller of Waco, Texas. Johnson served in the Army during
World War I; Miller was in the Navy in the Second World War. Both
have since died.
   It was an accident that Ramsey, also of Albany, discovered no
blacks had won the nation's highest military honor for bravery
during the world wars, although blacks have won the medal for
heroic deeds in other wars. It was also a discovery born of anger.
   ``In 1984, I was watching television when they celebrated the
40th anniversary of D-Day in Europe,'' he said in a telephone
interview last week. ``The president was over there, and the whole
week was as white as a Ku Klux Klan rally.''
   A black World War II veteran himself, Ramsey got angry that his
experience of the war was not recognized, but turned that emotion
into a useful pursuit.
   ``I decided to do a book on the black American in World War II,
and when I got into my research I began to realize that no black
had received the Medal of Honor in either World War I or World War
II,'' said Ramsey, a former associate history professor at Hofstra
University on Long Island. ``So I put the book on the back burner
and took off on an effort to see if I could get that righted.''
   Ramsey looked at the records of black servicemen who had won
other high military honors, including the Distinguished Service
Cross and the French Croix de Guerre. He looked into the history of
the Navy's Medal of Honor, established by Congress in 1861, and the
Army's, established in 1862. And, he said, he read the more than
1,200 citations of the Medal of Honor since its inception, ``to
make sure I was on solid ground.''
   ``I didn't want this to be token because these guys were
black,'' he said. ``I didn't want any compromising of principle on
the Medal of Honor.''
   Ramsey discovered that Johnson, who fought with the French army,
killed four German soldiers, rescued a wounded comrade and captured
a stockpile of weapons all despite severe combat wounds. For his
actions, Johnson earned the Croix de Guerre, France's highest
military honor. He died in 1930.
   Miller served at Pearl Harbor aboard the USS West Virginia,
Ramsey said. When the Japanese attacked, Miller, a mess steward,
helped move his mortally wounded captain from the ship's bridge,
then returned to man a machine gun, according to Ramsey's research.
   Afterward, the secretary of the Navy awarded Miller a letter of
commendation, but Adm. Chester Nimitz, commander in Hawaii,
upgraded that to the Navy Cross, the second-highest award, Ramsey
said. Miller was killed in 1943 in a torpedo attack.
   Ramsey built up his case, but for two years, he couldn't get any
public official to listen. He sent copies of a 21-page letter to
every member of the New York and Texas congressional delegations,
but ``102 percent of those people ignored the hell out of me.''
   ``It would have been easier for me to get a Boy Scout merit
badge for a communist,'' he said.
   Finally, he received a letter of support from Rep. Mario Biaggi,
D-N.Y., but Biaggi became embroiled in criminal trials in New York
and Ramsey's cause languished until New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
decided it had merit.
   ``Cuomo wrote me a very long letter and he took the time to
personally write each member of the congressional delegation in
Washington and ask them to help me,'' Ramsey said.
   ``Then, as if a voice from the dark, Joe DioGuardi came through.
And the effort never stopped.''
   Last October, DioGuardi, a Republican congressman from
Westchester County, N.Y., and Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas,
cosponsored bills to waive the statute of limitations for the Medal
of Honor so both men can be considered for the award.
   In the cases of Miller and Johnson, both the Navy and Army have
opposed the bills, which are now before the House Armed Services
Committee, DioGuardi said.
   The Navy did not specify why, according to DioGuardi, but the
Army laid out several reasons in a letter to Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wisc., who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   Delbert L. Spurlock, assistant secretary of the Army for
manpower and reserve affairs, wrote that while others, including
members of Congress, had written to the Army requesting special
consideration for Johnson, ``At this late date, it would be
inappropriate to single out former Sergeant Johnson for award of
the Medal of Honor and to provide preferential treatment to him
over the thousands of other black soldiers who served so bravely in
combat.''
   Spurlock also said that Johnson's records were destroyed in a
fire in 1973 at the Army's National Personnel Records Center,
although Ramsey said he obtained certified copies from archives in
New York state.
   DioGuardi said he would not give up the fight.

<HEAD>Common Cause Complaint Boosts Gingrich's Campaign</HEAD>

   For nearly a year, Rep. Newt Gingrich battled
long odds, pitting his tart tongue and bulldog tenacity against the
raw political power of the nation's top elected Democrat.
   In a stream of letters, press conferences and close-of-business
speeches on the House floor, the Georgia conservative waged war
against the personal ethics of House Speaker Jim Wright.
   Wright rarely responded. And until last week, Gingrich had been
unable to persuade even one Republican colleague to join in his
call for a House ethics committee investigation of Wright.
   That changed suddenly when Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog
group, wrote the ethics committee May 18 asking for an
investigation to determine whether Wright had violated federal
ethics rules.
   ``Having Common Cause come out changed the whole dynamics and
legitimized the issue,'' Gingrich said in an interview last week.
   Within a week, Vice President George Bush had called for the
appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Wright's
financial dealings and Gingrich had enlisted 73 other House
Republicans, including most of the GOP leadership, to support his
formal complaint against Wright to the ethics committee.
   Wright also took notice, telling reporters his views of Gingrich
``are similar to those of a fire hydrant toward dogs.''
   Wright charged that the pressure for an investigation was part
of an orchestrated GOP effort to embarrass Democrats and to draw
attention away from the legal problems of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III and other Reagan administration officials.
   In responding to those charges, Gingrich invariably turns to his
newly acquired ``Common Cause'' defense.
   ``The most extraordinary moment of the last two weeks was the
speaker's staff's description of Common Cause as the handmaiden of
people like Newt Gingrich,'' he said. ``No one in this city takes
seriously the idea that Common Cause in engaged in a desperate
effort to take attention away from Ed Meese.''
   Common Cause officials say they're not concerned that their
request for an investigation of Wright is being used by Republicans
to deflect charges that their own campaign against Wright is
motivated by partisan politics.
   ``Our concern is the merits of the ethics issue,'' said Randy
Huwa, vice president of Common Cause. ``We felt that questions had
been raised that should be addressed by the ethics committee.
That's why we took the action that we did and others are going to
have to speak for themselves.
   ``Our role in this is not a partisan one,'' he said. ``We've got
an 18-year history of nonpartisanship. We have called for
investigations of Democrats and Republicans. That's our charter,
that's our responsiblity.''
   The committee is scheduled to meet Thursday to discuss whether
to begin a preliminary investigation. Gingrich's complaint asks for
an investigation in three areas:
   _Reports that Wright intervened with Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat in 1979 in behalf of a Texas businessman who weeks earlier
had permitted Wright to invest in a proven oil well.
   _Reports that Wright attempted to influence a Department of
Interior gas lease decision in 1979 in favor of a company in which
he owned $15,000 worth of stock.
   _Reports that Wright received unusually high 55 percent
royalties on his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' which was
published by a printing company that did $300,000 worth of work for
Wright's campaign committee in 1985-86.
   Common Cause asked for an investigation into the financial
arrangements surrounding Wright's book and into reports that he had
improperly attempted to influence federal bank regulators on behalf
of Texas constituents and Democratic contributors.
   Wright has denied any wrongdoing and has promised to cooperate
fully if the ethics committee decides to investigate him. In the
meantime, he and his Democratic allies in the House have launched a
counterattack against Gingrich.
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee charged last
week that Gingrich received $13,000 from wealthy friends in 1977
for a novel he never wrote. Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of
the DCCC, said the partnership arrangement provided Gingrich with
``a means for financial gain not available to the average
American.''
   The DCCC earlier this year complained to the Federal Election
Commission that Conservatives for Hope and Opportunity, a political
action committee headed by Gingrich, had violated federal campaign
laws. The FEC last week dismissed the complaint.

<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan got a glimpse of the Soviet Union's
``Slavic soul'' Monday by visiting the beloved woods of famed
Russian poet Boris Pasternak on the 28th anniversary of his death.
   The first lady, a long-time admirer of the Nobel-prize winner's
``Dr. Zhivago,'' said the noontime visit to the wooded Moscow
suburb of Peredelkino ``impressed me greatly. It was very, very
touching.''
   Mrs. Reagan's second day in the capital of communism included a
visit to an English class at a prestigious Moscow middle school,
where she admitted that the Russian language was a tongue-twister
for her. ``All I have been able to manage so far is spasibo (thank
you),'' she confessed.
   The first lady's U.S. limousine was accompanied about a dozen
official Soviet cars, and she was whisked down a cleared highway to
the suburb about 15 miles outside of the Soviet capital.
Peredelkino is a favorite wooded retreat sprinkled with elegant old
frame dachas provided by the state for the use of the
intelligentsia and other favored citizens.
   She was treated to a lunch of caviar, potatoes, borsht, coffee
and fresh vegetables by the official poet Andrei Voznesensky, who
invited Mrs. Reagan to his peach-colored dacha nestled among the
pine and birch trees.
   ``I think, for the American leader's wife to come to our
country, to visit the grave of Pasternak, this is very important,''
said Voznesensky, attired in a silk neck scarf, light grey pants,
white shirt, and white and grey striped jacket, came to the gate of
his home to greet the first lady.
   Voznesensky, who is a widely published author in the Soviet
Union and is a big supporter of Gorbachev's reform efforts, told
reporters it was important for Mrs. Reagan to learn the differences
between the two nations.
   Americans have computers and technology, he said, but the
Russians have ``Russian poetry and something strange _ the Slavic
soul. You learn about this with poetry.''
   He added that such poetry ``is like religion'' for the Soviets.
   Pasternak was the object of much controversy in the Soviet
Union, even years after his death in 1960. He had been awarded the
Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958, but his fame provoked a bitter
official campaign against him. He was forced to reject the award,
and returned to his dacha, where he died of cancer.
   Prior to the lunch, Mrs. Reagan walked from her limousine down a
short path to Pasternak's grave, which lies on the edge of a large,
treed cemetery across from a pair of potato fields. U.S. officials
said a dirt road near the site had apparently been covered in
asphalt for the visit.
   Reporters were not allowed to view her at the gravesite, but her
spokeswoman Elaine Crispen said the first lady placed flowers on
the fenced-in grave as Pasternak's son, Yevgeniy, stood by and
softly hummed a requiem.
   Mrs. Reagan toured School No. 29 and Peredelkino while President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev continued their
summit talks in the Kremlin. On Monday, Mrs. Reagan had toured the
ancient fortress and its icon-filled churches in the company of
Raisa Gorbachev and on Tuesday she planned to spend the day touring
the Baltic capital of Peter the Great, Leningrad.
   At the school, Mrs. Reagan defended U.S. students and their
study habits when she got a grilling at a mini-press conference
with Soviet children.
   ``Do American children learn Russian?'' queried one child in
Russian as Mrs. Reagan fielded questions during an hour-long visit
to School No. 29.
   All children at the school, which caters primarily to the
children of high-ranking officials and Soviet intelligentsia, begin
to study English at the age of 8.
   Mrs. Reagan, clearly aware most Russian language studies in the
U.S. are on the high school and college and that she was among the
children of Soviet privileged, responded, ``No, they don't.''
   But then she parried, ``Do all the Soviet children in every
school here study English?''
   The children immediately broke out in loud argument, many
insisting that, indeed, all Soviet children do learn English.
   The first lady, who finally remembered with a chuckle that she
had learned several Russian words, responded ``Yes, yes, I mean,
da, da,'' at one point.
   But she flunked a pronunciation test when the children tried to
get her to say the Russian words for peace, earth and sun _ mir,
zemlya and solnsa _ and she was able to get only one out of three.
At one point, she threw up her hands in exasperation.

   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Monday
it hoped the improvement in superpower relations was more than a
maneuver by President Reagan to help Republican prospects in the
U.S. presidential election.
   Pictures and reports of the first day of Reagan's visit to
Moscow dominated the front pages of Pravda and the government
newspaper Izvestia, the only two national papers to publish Monday.
   Pravda said ``the two countries are carrying out a
business-like, constructive dialogue. The agreement on medium- and
shorter-range missiles, the first in history concerning elimination
of nuclear weapons, already has been signed and ratified.''
   ``One would like to hope that behind this are not just manuevers
in the race for votes (for `his' Republican Party), but also an
ability to discard out-lived notions for the sake of progress,''
Pravda said.
   Izvestia, normally an evening paper, published a morning edition
in which the entire first page except for a small space across the
bottom was devoted to the meeting between Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Pravda printed a picture of the U.S. and Soviet flags flying
together next to its headline announcing Reagan's visit. Both
papers gave prominent play to pictures of the two leaders with
their wives, and seated together at the beginning of their talks.

   How do you know the summit is being held in
Moscow? When the sign on the wall says ``Attention _ This is a
non-secure area.''
   The signs are posted in the White House press office's outpost
at the Hotel Mezhdunarodnaya, where the Soviets have set up the
international center for reporters. Many members of the press and
some of the top officials are also quartered at the hotel.
   Officials are warned: ``This area is not safe for sensitive
conversation or reading of classified material.''
   The U.S. government has long been concerned about the Soviets'
ability to eavesdrop electronically on conversations.
   But officials at the State Department and the White House said
they are confident that conversations held by the president and his
aides either at the embassy or Spaso House, the U.S. ambassador's
residence were Reagan is staying, will be private.
   The government flew in sensitive encryption and communications
equipment, and reinforced some rooms with shields to make them
impervious, officials said earlier.

   Americans may have written to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev by the thousands, but they are not lining up
to buy the book of their letters. The collection of American
missives to the Kremlin boss went on sale at the start of the
summit here, but only one buyer has come forward.
   Progress Publishers printed 2,000 copies of ``Americans Write to
Gorbachev,'' and put the first stack on sale at the press center
for the U.S.-Soviet summit that began Sunday.
   The books sell for only 2.10 rubles ($3.50), but the Progress
kiosk takes only hard currency.
   Most Russians have no access to convertible currency, and since
the book has been issued only in Russian language, it has found
little market among those able to pay for it.
   Asked how many copies had been sold by midday Tuesday, the
Soviet salesman replied: ``Exactly one.''
   The book's publication was announced earlier this month in an
article by Sovietskaya Kultura, which said Gorbachev received more
than 80,000 letters from Americans last year.

<HEAD>Peter Rodino Pressured To Step Down To Make Way for Black
Congressman</HEAD>

   Two Democrats are battling to become New
Jersey's first black congressman by succeeding Rep. Peter Rodino,
who spent 40 years championing civil rights but was pressured to
step down to give his district minority representation.
   Rodino, a Democrat, announced in March that he would resign at
the end of his term, closing a colorful political era that began
when he took office in 1948.
   Rodino had become an institution in New Jersey and Washington,
and climbed to national prominence as chairman of the impeachment
hearings against former President Richard Nixon.
   Rodino consistently scored big victories, even as his heavily
Democratic 10th District's once Italian neighborhoods changed to
black, Hispanic and Portuguese.
   Since the early 1970s, the district has been predominantly black
and Hispanic.
   The drive to oust Rodino left a bitter aftertaste because of the
effort's racial _ some say racist _ overtones.
   ``The issue no longer is whether this district can elect a black
congressman,'' said Keith Jones, president of the state's NAACP.
``The question is whether they can serve as well as Peter Rodino.''
   The June 7 Democratic primary pits Newark City Councilman Donald
Payne, 53, vice president of a computer forms manufacturing
company, against fellow Councilman Ralph Grant, a teacher of
sociology at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
   The Democratic primary winner is expected to easily turn back a
challenge from Republican Michael Webb, who also is black, in the
general election in the urban district that includes Newark. Webb,
who has never held elected office, is unopposed in the GOP primary.
   Some of Payne's backing this year emerged even before Rodino
announced his retirement, creating an uneasy situation for local
leaders who didn't want to put too much pressure on Rodino, a
champion of civil rights and still popular among voters.
   Rodino served as House floor manager for the landmark Civil
Rights Act of 1966 and wrote the 1982 Voting Rights Act. He is an
honorary member of the congressional Black Caucus and has been
honored by the NAACP.
   Payne was endorsed in the 1986 primary against Rodino by the
Rev. Jesse Jackson. Although the prominent presidential hopeful has
remained neutral in this year's primary, many believe the previous
endorsement has a lingering effect.
   Touring the district with Jackson in 1986, Payne said it was
time for the district to elect its first black representative.
Payne took 36 percent of the vote that year, far short of Rodino's
60 percent.
   In a recent interview, Payne defended his 1986 call to replace
Rodino with a member of a minority group and denied that racism was
at work.
   ``We felt that we had to address one of the biggest problems in
America,'' said Payne. ``Large numbers of people are feeling
they're not part of the system. ... I wanted to show black
youngsters that they are not being left out.''
   Rodino brought much of the pressure on himself, saying in his
1986 campaign that he would serve until President Reagan left
office in January 1989.
   But after the election, Rodino surprised many Democratic leaders
by throwing fund-raisers and backing off his campaign statement.
   This didn't stop some from pressing Rodino to retire. State
Senate President John Russo endorsed Payne before Rodino's
retirement announcement, and Newark Mayor Sharpe James said he
supported a minority representative for the district.
   The three major hopefuls for the office speak glowingly of
Rodino's service. Even GOP contender Webb said he had voted for
Rodino.
   The candidates have the same platform: fight drugs, house the
homeless, help the elderly and bring in jobs. The campaign is
focusing on records and personalities.
   Both Democrats support Jackson for president.

<HEAD>Media Maven Tackles Tough Image-Making Assignment _ George Bush</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the going gets tough, Republican
politicians send for Roger Ailes _ the blunt, rotund media maven
who has molded images from Nixon to Reagan. His assignment this
year: George Bush.
   The job, as several national polls attest, is not going to be
easy. And so here is Ailes, holed up in a bare office a few blocks
from the White House, attempting to perform once again the miracles
that led one observer to dub him Dr. Ailes.
   ``I'm a guy who can help balance the scene a little bit,'' says
Ailes, a top Bush strategist as well as the vice president's
television coach and advertising consultant. ``I see myself as a
fellow who works for the underdog.''
   Ailes is a powerful player who insists that his role in the Bush
campaign is ``pretty minor;'' an aggressive, colorful and witty man
trying to stay deep within the woodwork.
   Down from Manhattan for three days last week at Bush
headquarters, Ailes expertly deflected questions with a stream of
disparaging remarks about his girth, his skills and his importance.
All of them are considerable.
   On the first: ``Some people are just built like mailboxes. It's
not my fault. It's genes and spaghetti.''
   On the second: ``My job is to help, but I'm not an image-maker.
You can't create something that isn't there. You can't make
somebody someone he's not.''
   On the third: ``A hundred years from now, you think people are
going to have seminars on Roger Ailes? Hell, no.''
   Maybe not, but Ailes has already played a pivotal role in Bush's
shifting fortunes.
   For one thing, he primed Bush for his infamous confrontation
with CBS anchorman Dan Rather. ``I happened to be hanging around,''
Ailes says with typical understatement. ``Once they have the rifles
cocked, you might as well fight back.''
   Ailes also coached Bush for this year's GOP debates and
suggested that he call Pete du Pont by his given name of
``Pierre,'' a tactic that nonplussed the former Delaware governor
during a live broadcast. And Ailes made a TV ad that Bush aides
credit with helping the vice president defeat Sen. Bob Dole in New
Hampshire _ the turning point of his drive for the nomination.
   ``I'm rarely ever able to get a client of mine to say one
commercial I did saved them,'' says Dan Payne, who produced some of
the ads used by Democrat Michael Dukakis, Bush's likely rival.
``For Ailes to be able to do that, says something about his
persuasiveness in that campaign.''
   Ailes was depicted as an enfant terrible _ cynical, foul-mouthed
and unerring in his perceptions _ in Joe McGinnis' book, ``The
Selling of the President 1968.''
   ``Let's face it,'' he is quoted as saying. ``A lot of people
think Nixon is dull. ... They look at him as the kind of kid who
always carried a bookbag. Who was 42-years-old the day he was born.
They figure the other kids got footballs for Christmas, Nixon got a
briefcase and he loved it. He'd always have his homework done and
he'd never let you copy.''
   Twenty years later, Ailes is as cutting as ever, but not about
Bush. ``The more you know about George Bush, the more you like
him,'' he says. ``He has been out of the limelight for the last
seven years. But I don't see that as a problem. It's an
opportunity.''
   Newsweek labeled the vice president a ``gaffe-o-matic'' and
published an embarrassing glossary of ``Bushspeak.'' ``When he uses
plain speech, he seems to be speaking something other than his
native language,'' says Kathleen Jamieson, a political media
analyst at the University of Texas.
   Ailes responds, ``The guy is a very articulate human being. I
don't care if he fluffs up some lines once in a while. It doesn't
matter to me.''
   He adds, ``I advised him once to stop saying some word and he
got all mad and said no. I sort of respected that and shut up and
never gave him any more advice'' on which words to use or not use.
   In past presidential and congressional campaigns, Ailes has
demonstrated an uncanny ability to make vulnerable candidates
appear strong and appealing.
   After President Reagan bombed in his first debate with Walter
Mondale in 1984, Ailes psyched him for the second debate with a pep
talk ``worthy of Knute Rockne,'' Garry Wills wrote in his book
``Reagan's America.'' By all accounts, Reagan redeemed himself in
the second encounter.
   This year, Ailes is assembling creative teams around the country
to contribute ad ideas for Bush. So far, he has shown Bush with his
family, with Reagan, with foreign leaders. What next?
   ``Basically, you're going to see us present Bush's record and
Dukakis' record and let people decide if they want a liberal or a
conservative,'' Ailes says. He's determined to make America see
Bush as he sees him _ and convinced they'll like what they see.
   If Reagan is John Wayne, Ailes says, then Bush is Gary Cooper _
``quiet, nice, gentle. He doesn't want to fight. He would like to
talk everything out ... But this guy's got a steel core when it's
necessary.''

<HEAD>Florida Democrats Promote Graham for Vice President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida Democrats are promoting Sen. Bob
Graham for the vice presidential spot on the ticket although the
prospect leaves the state party chairman ``scared to death.''
   A group of Floridians, headed by U.S. Rep. Bill Grant, have
written letters to likely nominee Michael Dukakis and uncommitted
delegates, urging them to back Graham. The group also has
distributed 500 ``Graham for V.P.'' buttons.
   ``We're trying to create a national awareness that he is a
viable possibility,'' said Grant, who promised that a committee
will be formed as the Graham-backers expand their effort.
   The committee hopes to deluge the national convention with
banners, signs and stickers.
   ``Bob Graham is not only a favorite son, he's a very strong
candidate,'' said state AFL-CIO President Dan Miller. ``He was a
very popular Southern governor, and he would bring a Southern
flavor to the ticket.''
   But other Florida Democrats have mixed feelings about the effort
by Graham supporters, especially Charles Whitehead, the state's
party chairman.
   If a Dukakis-Graham ticket were elected in November, Republican
Gov. Bob Martinez would be able to appoint a candidate of his
liking to serve as senator until a special election in 1990.
   Whitehead said he is ``scared to death'' when he thinks about
Graham as vice president.
   ``The greatest thing for me as party chairman would be Bob
Graham on the ticket, because I believe that would ensure us of
carrying Florida,'' Whitehead said. ``But the worst thing for me
would be to have Gov. Bob Martinez get to appoint a senator.''
   Graham has had nothing to do with the effort to promote him,
according to Grant, but his backers believe the former two-term
governor and first-term senator would be enthusiastic about running
with Dukakis.
   Graham's Washington press secretary, Ken Klein, said his boss is
not seeking a place on the ticket.
   ``He is not active in trying to make the phone ring,'' Klein
said. ``He has been flattered by the suggestion that it might
ring.''

<HEAD>Leningrad Offers History, Cultural Riches For Mrs. Reagan's Visit</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Summit Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LENINGRAD, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moscow may dominate politics during
the superpower summit but Leningrad can offer rich historical and
cultural treasures _ plus the visiting New York Philharmonic _ when
Nancy Reagan visits the Soviets' second largest city Tuesday.
   Mrs. Reagan apparently will miss the opening concert of the New
York orchestra's 10-day Soviet tour Tuesday night in Tchaikovsky
Hall. And when Zubin Mehta takes his musicians to Moscow on
Saturday, the Reagans will be gone.
   But as the first lady will discover, this magnificent city of 5
million people that Peter the Great built on northern marshland has
other attractions that Moscow cannot boast.
   Leningrad, first named St. Petersburg and then Petrograd, was
the capital of the Russian Empire from 1703 to 1918. After the
Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the capital was moved to Moscow, but
many argue that Leningrad has superior architecture, unique
cultural advantages and a more cosmopolitan air.
   Leningrad is close to Soviet hearts as the cradle of the
revolution that brought the Communists to power more than 70 years
ago.
   It also suffered the most during World War II, when 650,000
people died of starvation during a Nazi blockade and more than
17,000 were killed in air raids and artillery shelling.
   For many tourists, the biggest draw is the Hermitage Museum,
which houses one of the most fabulous art collections in the world.
Paintings by Leonardo, Picasso, Matisse and other great artists can
be found in the Hermitage, whose collection was begun in 1764 by
Catherine the Great.
   The main building, Catherine's Winter Palace, is itself a work
of art. The baroque architecture was done by Bartolomeo Francesco
Rastrelli, an Italian who designed several other Leningrad
landmarks.
   Many a visitor has become exhausted trying to see the 65,000
works occupying 400 rooms in the Hermitage. Guides advise spreading
a tour over several days.
   The Winter Palace lies on a historic site, Dvortsovaya Ploschad
or Palace Square. It was on this square in 1905 that troops of Czar
Nicholas II fired on peaceful demonstrators, killing as many as 30
people in what came to be known as ``Bloody Sunday.''
   Soldiers chased the provisional government from the Winter
Palace in the climactic event of the 1917 revolution.
   The architectural center of the city is the Admiralty, a former
shipyard whose tapered golden spire can be seen from many parts of
Leningrad.
   Another must for visitors is the ``Bronze Horseman,'' an
equestrian statue of Peter the Great, who founded the city as a
``window on the West.'' He chose the site for the commercial and
cultural links to the West afforded by a strategic outlet to the
Baltic Sea.
   As it approaches the Gulf of Finland, the Neva River combines
with other tributaries to form an intricate delta consisting of
more than 40 islands. As a result, Leningrad is laced with canals,
many of them bordered by the painted facades of mansions once owned
by aristocrats. The city thus earned its nickname, ``Venice of the
North.''
   The main shopping and entertainment street is Nevsky Prospekt, a
wide avenue lined with buildings of classical architecture.
   Leningrad is the birthplace of modern Russian literature and the
setting for works by Pushkin, Gogol and Dostoyevsky. The composer
Peter Tchaikovsky worked here, as did the jewelry craftsmen of
Faberge.
   The Kirov Ballet of Leningrad is the fabled rival to Moscow's
Bolshoi Ballet.
   Mrs. Reagan will be missing one of Leningrad's annual treats.
Because of its extreme northern latitude, the sun never sets
completely from June 11 to July 2, except for brief twilights.
   The phenomenon, known as White Nights, has been the subject of
poems, paintings, songs and a movie starring ballet star Mikhail
Baryshnikov, who began his dancing career at the Kirov.

<HEAD>Study: Afghanistan Unable To Support Return Of Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The war in Afghanistan has cut that
nation's food production by one-half, and the devastated cropland
cannot support the immediate return of millions of refugees,
according to a study released Monday.
   The survey said it will take at least three years and $4 billion
to restore cropland and livestock affected by 10 years of fighting
in Afghanistan. Other officials have said such reconstruction could
take 10 to 20 years.
   Professor Azam Gul, an Afghan citizen who directed the six-month
study, said the devastation had occurred mainly since Soviet troops
intervened in 1979 to back the government in its war with Moslem
guerrillas.
   ``There was deliberate destruction of the agricultural system by
the Russians, particularly along the highways,'' Gul told reporters
at a news conference. Villages were systematically bombed and trees
were destroyed around Soviet bases, he said.
   Farmers reported that the Afghan army burned crops and shot
cattle and sheep, sometimes from helicopter gunships, the report
said. Hundreds of farmers said more than five animals a year in
their herds were blown up by land mines, according to the report.
   Other farmers told researchers they sold livestock to pay for
food or transportation out of the country.
   The Swedish-financed survey was conducted by a team of Afghan
researchers who returned to their home areas to question 20,000
farmers. The results are designed to help aid projects and resettle
more than 5 million refugees after Soviet troops are out of
Afghanistan.
   ``If the refugees returned en masse now, the land would not
support them. That is the categorical conclusion of the survey,''
said Tom Morrison of the Britain-based Agrisystems, which trained
the researchers and collated the data.
   Gul said agricultural production in 1986 fell to 45 percent of
the level in 1978, the year before the Soviet intervention. Good
rains last spring brought production up to 53 percent of its 1978
level, he said.
   The 68-page report released at the news conference said food
production improved in 1986 after the U.S.-supplied Moslem
guerrillas received anti-aircraft missiles, ``providing a
protective umbrella and allowing agricultural operations to
continue during daytime.''
   Gul said the survey was conducted only in guerrilla-held areas
but included all 29 provinces. At least two of the 68 researchers
escaped an ambush by government troops and another was captured and
imprisoned. Six who were sent to remote provinces still have not
reported back, Gul said.
   The researchers used questionnaires to collect details on war
damage, crop yields, irrigation and use of fertilizers.
   The results showed that of the farmers who fled Afghanistan in
1987, 42 percent reported their cattle, sheep or goats had been
shot to death or killed by mines, and 65 percent of the farmers
said their crops were burned.
   The report recommended a phased return of the refugees timed to
the distribution of food aid and the rebuilding of the Afghan
farms. Most of the refugees have fled to Pakistan or Iran.
   Reconstruction will be slow, said Morrison. ``It's not only a
question of money. It's a matter of time just for oxen to
reproduce. You need three years to produce high quality seed,'' he
said.
   Political obstacles also will delay rehabilitation, said Anders
Fange of the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan, which paid for the
$870,000 project.
   ``No matter what kind of government there will be, it will be
very weak,'' said Fange, who is based in the refugee camps at
Peshawar, Pakistan.
   Fragmentation of authority between the government and local
guerrilla commanders will make the distribution of aid extremely
complicated, he said.
   The Soviets are in the process of withdrawing their more than
100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan under a U.N.-sponsored accord
signed in April. The guerrillas, who began fighting the Afghan
government after a Communist coup in 1978, have said they will keep
up the war until the Afghan government is defeated.

<HEAD>Rare Peal Of Church Bells Heard As Reagan Visits Monastery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MASHA HAMILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greeted by rare peals of church bells, President
Reagan visited a newly restored monastery Monday and voiced hope
that religious bells might be ``clamoring for joy in their newfound
freedom'' someday throughout the Soviet Union.
   ``The faith of your people has been tested and tempered in the
crucible of hardship,'' Reagan told 18 black-garbed Russian
Orthodox monks in the walled Danilov Monastery on the southern edge
of the Soviet capital. ``But in that suffering, it has grown
strong.''
   Reagan has been cautious in his praise of increased religious
tolerance under Secretary General Mikhail S. Gorbachev, stressing
that more freedom is needed for Soviet Jews as well as Christians.
   His visit to the oldest monastery in Moscow, built in the 13th
century and once converted into a factory by the atheistic Soviet
government, seemed aimed at bringing his point clearly home.
   ``We may hope that perestroika will be accompanied by a deeper
restructuring ... and that glasnost, which means giving voice, will
also let loose a new chorus of belief,'' Reagan said.
   The president said he hoped the Soviet government's decision to
give the monastery back to the Orthodox Church in 1983 ``signals a
willingness to return to believers the thousands of other houses of
worship which are now closed, boarded up or used for secular
purposes.''
   A pool of Soviet and foreign journalists was permitted to listen
to Reagan's remarks but was asked to leave when the monks responded.
   Although the Soviet Union is officially atheist, unofficial
estimates put the number of Soviet religious believers at more than
90 million.
   In 1929 the state issued a series of restrictions on religious
practice, including a requirement that church members register with
state authorities and a ban on religious education. Over the past
few months, the government has announced that a review of the
restrictions is under way.
   Nevertheless, church bells still are rarely heard in Moscow. But
they rang out twice on Monday, once when President and Mrs. Reagan
arrived at the monastery and again when they left.
   The monastery was closed to worshipers during the Reagans'
half-hour visit. Several hundred Soviets crowded against police
barricades near the monastery and lined nearby sidewalks, some
waving at the Americans.
   Inside the monastery, the Reagans were shown a religious icon
which was being renovated in the Cathedral of the Holy Fathers,
which was decorated with birch branches for the occasion.
   The president then walked past a gold-topped cupola into a
reception room where he spoke to the monks who wore gold crosses
around their necks.
   ``Our people feel it keenly when religious freedom is denied to
anyone anywhere, and hope with you that soon all the many Soviet
religious communities that are now prevented from registering or
are banned altogether, including the Ukrainian Catholic and
Orthodox Churches, will soon be able to practice their religion
freely and openly,'' he said.
   Reagan quoted exiled Soviet author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who
wrote about church bells that once sounded throughout Russia.
   ``In our prayers we may keep that image in mind,'' Reagan said,
``the thought that the bells may ring again someday through Moscow
and the countryside, clamoring for joy in their new-found freedom.''
   The Danilov Monastery, seat of the Orthodox Church's
patriarchate, has been renovated in the past several years for the
celebration next month of the 1,000th anniversary of the
establishment of Christianity in ancient Russia.
   The Reagans were accompanied by Metropolitan Filaret, the second
highest ranking leader in the Russian Orthodox Church hierarchy.
   The monastery was founded in 1272 by the first Prince of Moscow
and served as part of the southern defenses of the city. After a
period of decline, it was rebuilt by Ivan the Terrible in the 16th
century.
   After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the Soviet government
took over the monastery and turned it into a factory. In May 1983,
it was returned to the church.

   Pete Hamill will rejoin the New York Post to
write a column three times a week, the newspaper said Monday.
   The move was announced by Post owner Peter S. Kalikow, who
praised Hamill's ``inimitable style and unique perspective.''
   In the column, which is expected to start next month, Hamill
will cover issues such as drugs, homelessness, local politics and
the impact of national policies on New York.
   ``I also plan to examine the endless variations of that New York
specialty, murder,'' Hamill said.
   Hamill, 52, joined the Post in 1960 as a reporter and stayed for
14 years. He also has written for the Daily News, New York magazine
and the Village Voice. He has published six novels and a seventh is
scheduled to be published this winter by Random House.

   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev neared agreement on a secondary arms accord during summit
talks today that preceded a dramatic effort by Reagan to champion
human rights and religious freedom.
   Reagan visited a monastery and implored Gorbachev to permit a
new era of religious freedom. Quoting Russia's pre-revolutionary
writer, Alexander Pushkin, he said: ``It's time, my friend, it's
time.''
   But the Soviets were giving no ground on the touchy human rights
questions. After Reagan finished an extraordinary meeting with
dissidents and refuseniks, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov said, ``They are not the best of the Soviet public;
rather, on the contrary.''
   Despite the pointed differences on human rights, there was no
apparent tension at a state dinner tonight. The two leaders flashed
smiles and chatted amiably, occasionally laughing, as they stood
next to each other in a guest receiving line in the chandeliered
Hall of Facets at the Kremlin.
   Toasting Reagan later, the Soviet leader called for closer
contacts with Americans. But Gorbachev said, ``this should be done
without interfering in domestic affairs, without sermonizing or
imposing one's views and ways, without turning family or personal
problems into a pretext for confrontation between states.''
   Reagan said the two leaders had continued searching at their
fourth summit for ``common ground'' in the U.S.-Soviet
relationship, and he would advise his successor next January that
``it is a search that must be continued.''
   Also, he said, ``it is a search that can succeed.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the formal summit
session focused on arms control. There were signs ``the two sides
were coming together'' on an arms-test notification procedure, he
said. The accords had seemed sidetracked just last week, but
Gerasimov said, ``I believe that tomorrow we will have a draft
treaty on the launching of ballistic missiles.''
   Gerasimov called the session ``businesslike,'' and said
Gorbachev still hopes to come to agreement with Reagan on a far
more important treaty to reduce strategic arms arsenals. Arms
control working groups continued to meet.
   To the several dozen dissidents and refuseniks and members of
their families arrayed before him at the U.S. Embassy guesthouse,
the president said: ``I came here hoping to do what I could to give
you strength.''
   ``But I already know it is you who have strengthened me. You
have given me a message to carry back: While we press for human
rights through diplomatic channels, you press with your very lives,
day in, day out, year after year, risking your jobs, your homes,
your all.''
   He said the United States ``views human rights as fundamental,
absolutely fundamental, to our relations with the Soviet Union and
all nations.''
   Reagan said it was ``a hopeful time'' for the Soviets, with the
release of political and religious prisoners and an increase in the
number of people allowed to emigrate. Evenso, he said the Kremlin
does not meet the standards spelled out by the 1975 Helsinki
agreement on human rights.
   Reagan was applauded warmly by the audience, but likely
inflammed Soviet sensitivity on the subject. Before his arrival
here, Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders said they didn't want to
be lectured on human rights.
   Reagan also expressed hopes for religious freedom in the Soviet
Union, pointing out that thousands of homes of worship ``are now
closed, boarded up or used for secular purposes.''
   The second day of summitry also was marked by a new air of
optimism that agreement could be reached on two secondary
arms-control pacts that had been stalled.
   Explaining the progress, Gerasimov said a compromise now seemed
possible in counting cruise missiles carried on warplanes and on
placing mobile missiles in defined regions in order to keep track
of them.
   These are two of the verification problems blocking a new treaty
to reduce strategic nuclear weapons.
   But the Soviet official said the United States was preventing a
resolution of the problem of monitoring cruise missiles on
submarines. He said the Soviets had proposed a test in which two
ships, one carrying cruises and the other none of the weapons,
would be monitored.
   He said the proposal had been turned down as an intrusion and
probably because the United States has an edge in sea-launched
cruise missiles. Gerasimov said that was ``an illusion'' and ``only
temporary.''
   Fitzwater and Gerasimov said the two leaders also reviewed their
differences on the U.S. Star Wars missile defense program, but that
neither side altered its views. ``There was no changing of minds,
more an exchange of views,'' the U.S. spokesman said.
   Reagan attended a morning meeting with Gorbachev and then paid a
visit to to Moscow's oldest monastery, where he was greeted by
bearded monks and the pealing of church bells.
   Later, he held an extraordinary meeting at the U.S. ambassador's
residence with Soviet refuseniks and dissidents. One speaker, Gleb
Yakunin, a Russian Orthodox priest, lost his parish 22 years ago
and was sentenced to a labor camp.
   He said the contraints on religions resulted in a decline of
morals, growth of alcoholism and drug addiction and stagnation of
the economy, and said that Gorbachev`s program of perestroika, or
restructuring, ``is unthinkable without true freedom of religion.''
   Reagan's second day in Moscow began with a meeting with
Gorbachev in St. Catherine's Hall behind the brick walls of the
Kremlin enclave.
   About 30 seconds after a clock chimed 10 a.m., the gold doors at
opposite ends of the room were opened and, from the left, in walked
Gorbachev leading the Soviet delegation, while from the right, the
president led the U.S. participants.
   They met at the center of the table and shook hands, then shook
hands with each member of the other delegation.
   The Soviet leader was asked by reporters if he would act on the
14 human rights cases included on a list presented by Reagan on
Sunday. ``There are too many lists,'' Gorbachev replied.
   Commenting on Soviet willingness to allow his meeting with
dissidents and refuseniks, Reagan said, ``They did that for me so
that I'd feel at home.''
   He added, ``Every once in a while I am meeting some rather
disagreeable people at home.'' A reporter asked if he was saying
dissidents are disagreeable people. With a pained look on his face,
Reagan said, ``I don't mean that. You know what I mean.''
   Inside the monastary, Reagan, accompanied by his wife Nancy,
told the monks that he and other Americans prayed that perestroika
would bring a reawakening of religious freedom to the Soviet Union.

   A leading scholar who left the Soviet
Union in 1975 to teach at Yale University is suing the school,
claiming it misrepresented its retirement policy.
   Sebastian Shaumyan, an expert in mathematical linguistics,
receives about $19,800 annually _ a $750-a-month pension from Yale
and $900 a month in Social Security benefits. He earned about
$55,000 a year when he retired in 1986.
   He claimed, in a lawsuit filed in New Haven Superior Court, that
Yale didn't explain its retirement plan, including that he would
have to retire at 70. He's seeking a settlement of about $240,000
and an improved pension, his attorney said.
   Dorothy Robinson, Yale's general counsel, said handbooks
distributed to Yale professors in 1978, 1981 and 1984 informed them
of Yale's policy.
   Yale spokesman Walter Littell declined to comment on the lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III has seen his
credibility come into question several times in the past two months
as he struggles with growing calls for his departure.
   During his most tumultuous two months in office, Meese has made
comments he quickly had to clarify; has been contradicted by a
conservative Republican senator who should be a natural ally; and
has been contradicted by a man he wanted to appoint to a high
Justice Department position.
   The attorney general's problems began more than a year ago when
his longtime friend E. Robert Wallach came under criminal
investigation in the Wedtech scandal.
   At the behest of Wallach, now under indictment as a result of
the investigation, Meese got involved as White House counselor with
the South Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor Wedtech Corp. and later
as attorney general with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project.
   His Wedtech involvement triggered a criminal probe that began
May 11, 1987, and is expected to result several weeks from now in a
report raising questions about Meese's ethical conduct.
   The protest resignations of two of Meese's top aides two months
ago caused an outburst of calls for his departure. The two, Arnold
Burns and William Weld, quit out of concern that Meese's continued
tenure was hurting the Justice Department.
   The calls increased this month when Meese fired his chief
spokesman, conservative Terry Eastland.
   Asked why he fired Eastland, the attorney general emphatically
rejected the notion that Meese felt his chief spokesman had
inadequately defended him.
   ``This has nothing to do with a defense of me,'' said Meese.
   But at the May 14 meeting where Eastland was relieved of his
duties, Meese criticized Eastland's performance in defending
Meese's planned trip to Japan under the auspices of a nonprofit
group with a profit-making arm that makes the travel arrangements,
according to department sources familiar with the conversation.
Meese said he thought Eastland looked unprepared at a news
conference where Eastland defended the travel arrangement,
according to the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Meese also criticized as inadequate Eastland's response in a
newspaper article to the New Jersey governor's call for the
attorney general to resign, said the sources.
   In response to a question about whether the attorney general
felt he was still effective, Eastland was quoted in the newspaper
article as saying that Meese ``obviously believes he is fully
effective in his job'' and that the attorney general had indicated
on several occasions he doesn't intend to resign. Meese thought
Eastland should have made the assertion himself that Meese was
fully effective and wouldn't resign, rather than attributing those
conclusions to the attorney general, according to the sources.
   On March 31, two days after the public uproar began over the
protest resignations of Burns and Weld, Meese was asked at a news
conference if he would meet that day with conservative Sen. Strom
Thurmond. Meese said he didn't have a meeting later in the day with
Thurmond and that he had already met with a number of people.
   Meese neglected to mention that he had just completed a meeting
with Thurmond minutes before. Meese subsequently authorized a
written clarification, after Thurmond issued a statement saying a
meeting that day with Meese had focused on congressional concern
over problems at the Justice Department.
   In April, when a reporter asked Meese whether Wallach had
recommended St. Louis attorney John Shepherd for a Justice
Department job, Meese said no.
   But it turned out that Wallach did recommend Shepherd to Meese
for a Justice Department job in 1985, a fact which Meese
acknowledged after further inquiries later the same day. Asked why
he had denied it earlier, Meese told his spokesman he thought the
reporter was referring to whether Wallach had made such a
recommendation recently.
   On April 5, Meese announced that he was recommending Shepherd to
the White House to become deputy attorney general, the post vacated
by the Burns resignation.
   The same day Shepherd, who later withdrew his name from
consideration, said ``we all see'' the legal troubles confronting
the attorney general and that Meese saw the legal problems too.
   Asked about Shepherd's comments, Meese said he thought they
referred to legal problems generally in the department, not his
own. Shepherd later confided to department aides what was obvious
to everyone in the room, that he had been referring to Meese's own
legal problems.

   Former Vice President Walter Mondale
recalls that after he graduated from Elmore High School he was able
to get a job inspecting peas at a canning factory.
   ``When we graduated here in 1946, there were a lot of jobs that
didn't take skills,'' Mondale said in an interview before
addressing this year's 17 graduates and several hundred guests
Sunday in the school's Walter F. Mondale Auditorium.
   ``Those days are disappearing,'' said Mondale, adding that his
pea-inspecting job required only an hour of training.
   Good jobs nowadays require knowledge of many disciplines,
including science and languages, Mondale said.
   ``I'm going to try to teach a little lesson to these graduates
about what I've learned in these 42 years,'' he said. ``We're now
competing with everybody everywhere.''

   The first climbers to conquer Mount
Everest celebrated the 35th anniversary of their assault on the
world's highest mountain with a weekend gathering at the camp where
they trained.
   Sir Edmund Hillary, 69, who with Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay
made the final climb to the 29,028-foot summit, flew in from New
Delhi where he is now New Zealand's high commissioner to India.
Tenzing Norgay died in 1986.
   Other members of the pioneering 1953 British expedition also
returned to the base camp at the Pen-y-Gwryd Hotel in the Snowdonia
mountains in north Wales.
   ``Just about the only subject we hardly touched on this weekend
was, oddly enough, Everest,'' said Lord Hunt, 77, who led the
expedition. ``We have probably said all that there is to say to one
another on that subject.''

   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines says she
once considered her ousted predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos, one of
the most brillant people in her country.
   ``He had all the possibilities to improve the Philippines,'' she
said in a television interview with the Italian state-run TV
network RAI that is to be broadcast Tuesday. ``It was a terrible
shame that along the way he forgot that his principal duty was that
to serve the people and not his personal interests.''
   Asked why some people still support Marcos, she replied: ``His
presidency lasted 20 years and I'm sure that he helped lots of
people. It seems to me completely natural that a human being would
show gratitude toward someone who helped him.''

   Julia Spidell doesn't usually work 18-hour
days, especially now that she's 67, but she made an exception for
President Reagan and his wife Nancy.
   ``I worked without stopping for three weeks straight _ from 6:30
in the morning to 11 o'clock at night,'' said Mrs. Spidell, who was
chosen to make a quilt that Mrs. Reagan is expected to give to
Soviet leader Mikahi Gorbachev during this week's Moscow's summit
meetings.
   ``I was so excited my hands trembled,'' Mrs. Spidell said. ``It
has to be one of the greatest compliments a craftsman can receive.''
   Mrs. Spidell, who lives in the community of Glade Valley, said
she was commissioned to stitch the quilt in April by a local
antique dealer who is a friend of an officer of the State
Department's office of protocol.
   ``A quilt is so down-home _ it's like a nice warm, friendly
thing from the grassroots people of the United States,'' Mrs.
Spidell said in a telephone interview last week. She declined to

   Cardinal John O'Connor has received some
criticism for his plan to visit the Soviet Union next week to help
celebrate the millennium of Christianity there, but he says passing
up the trip would have been irrational.
   Some Ukrainian Catholics in this country have criticized the
trip, to be led by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the papal secretary
of state, because they say the church in the Soviet Union is
subject to persecution.
   But O'Connor said Sunday that ``it would be grossly irrational
to ignore the possibility of reaching an accord. Who knows what is
happening in the Soviet Union today?''
   He said he will arrive in Moscow with the Vatican delegation on
June 8 to commemorate the 1,000th anniversary of the establishment
of Christianity in Russia.

   Police arrested 23 youths after bands of
neo-Nazi skinheads injured seven people in a weekend rampage
through the streets of Rouen and Brest, authorities said Monday.
   The incidents began early Saturday when groups of young people
with shaved heads _ or skinheads _ drove in two vans through the
town of Rouen, in the western province of Normandy. Armed with iron
bars, baseball bats and carrying neo-Nazi literature, the bands
stopped in various places in the city and beat up people, police
said.
   They said one young man was hospitalized for injuries received
in a fight between two groups of skinheads.
   One group attacked an off-duty policeman, then entered a bar and
injured its owner as well as a customer.
   Police arrested 15 skinheads and charged them with using weapons
to injure and incapacitate victims, as well as with the illegal
transport of arms.
   The next day, in the western coastal province of Brittany _
about 300 miles away _ at least 150 skinheads, dressed in fatigues
and boots, began a rampage through the town of Brest after a rock
concert they planned to attend was canceled because of bad weather.
   Police said eight were detained after the group attacked four
people with brass knuckles.

   Soviet spokesmen criticized President Reagan's
meeting with dissidents and Jewish refuseniks Monday as ``hardly
aimed at improving understanding,'' and said his summit campaign on
human rights threatened to sabotage arms control talks.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda told its readers that
although the United States is full of scientific and technological
marvels, it also is a land of homelessness, hunger and repression
of minorities.
   On a day when news of the Reagan-Gorbachev summit dominated its
pages, Pravda printed a photograph of shabbily clothed blacks
lining up for a free Thanksgiving meal in Lafayette Park across the
street from the White House.
   At the bottom of the same page, it printed a story about Leonard
Peltier, an American Indian convicted of killing two FBI agents on
South Dakota's Pine Ridge reservation in 1975. Soviet officials
have cited Peltier's case as an example of U.S. human rights
violations.
   Countering Reagan's support for greater respect for human rights
in the Soviet Union, the official news agency Tass said in a
commentary that the Soviets are ``seriously concerned'' about human
rights in the United States.
   Tass quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky as saying
that Reagan's meeting with political dissidents and refuseniks at
the U.S. ambassador's residence ``is hardly aimed at improving
understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States.''
   Petrovsky had said earlier than although Reagan was free to meet
with any Soviet citizens, the Spaso House session was different
because of ``an obviously tendentious selection of participants.''
   Reagan told several dozen political dissidents and refuseniks _
Soviet Jews who have been denied permission to emigrate _ that
Soviet leaders are beginning to realize that economic growth
depends largely on granting individual freedoms. ``We must work for
more, always more,'' he said.
   The president planned to meet with Soviet writers, artists and
university students on Tuesday.
   Referring to the dissidents whom Reagan met Monday, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said, ``They are not the best
of the Soviet public, rather on the contrary.''
   Asked whether meeting with Reagan would result in harm to the
dissidents, Gerasimov replied, ``I met Mr. Reagan today, but I
don't think I am going to be harmed in any way by just meeting
him.''
   He brushed off further questions about whether refuseniks who
met with Reagan had jeopardized their chances of leaving the Soviet
Union.
   Other Soviet commentators disputed Reagan's charges of Soviet
human rights abuses and warned him against derailing superpower
negotiations on arms control and other issues.
   ``One cannot put up with the human rights theme being exploited
to foment enmity in state-to-state relations and sabotage the
processes of disarmament and detente,'' wrote Tass commentator
Sergei Staroselsky.
   ``The Soviet side is seriously concerned ... about the
discrimination of national minorities, prosecution for political
reasons and death sentences passed on minors in the United
States,'' he wrote.
   Yelena Lukasheva, a prominent Soviet legal scholar, accused
Western human rights organizations such as Helsinki Watch of
inflating the number of Soviet political prisoners, which she said
totaled 13.
   ``The people you call political prisoners are simple
criminals,'' she told reporters. She said none was sentenced ``for
political actions or views.''
   American lawyer Karen Parker and Indian rights activist Anthony
Gonzales, both of San Francisco, were among four U.S. human rights
activists who held a news conference at the Soviet Peace Committee
on Monday.
   Ms. Parker said they had come to Moscow at their own expense to
present a ``balanced view'' by publicizing alleged U.S. human
rights abuses against racial minorities, the homeless, the hungry,
the disabled and refugees who have been returned forcibly to their
homelands.

   A protest within sight of the Kremlin on Monday
produced passionate debate on Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms by
bystanders and several dozen Jews seeking to emigrate.
   In a gathering that police had difficulty controlling, at least
100 people stopped along Kalinin Prospekt, a major avenue leading
to the Kremlin, to watch the refusenik protest and to argue their
views about Gorbachev's effort to rebuild Soviet society.
   Despite constant appeals by police using bullhorns to stop
blocking the walkway next to the Lenin Library, the refuseniks and
onlookers argued in small groups under a hot late afternoon sun.
Dozens of others pressed around to hear, oblivious to the police.
   There was no violence, and the demonstrators, who were among
those not invited to a meeting with President Reagan at the U.S.
ambassador's residence, left after about an hour.
   ``This is a country that it's impossible to leave, like a
prison,'' said 50-year-old Moscow resident Aaron Greenberg,
responding to an elderly man who said the United States observed
human rights no better than the Soviet Union.
   Greenberg said he has been waiting five years for permission to
emigrate, but that officials claim he had access to state secrets
in a postal job he held 25 years ago.
   Another bystander who identified himself as Georgy Gusev held up
a piece of white paper on which he had drawn a Star of David and a
swastika. ``Zionism is fascism,'' he said, citing Israeli
occupation of Arab territory.
   But pressed by angry refuseniks, he said he thought that anyone
who wanted to leave the Soviet Union should be free to do so.
   Other bystanders shouted that the protest was hurting Gorbachev
during his meetings with Reagan.
   One woman who stopped by blamed the refuseniks' problems on
bureaucrats whom Gorbachev has been unable to clean out of the
Soviet system.
   ``The bureaucrats all stay in place, and while they are in place
on top there won't be perestroika below,'' said Zoya Urisheva. ``If
everything was in order, we wouldn't have a refusal problem.''
   Vladimir Meshkov, a Moscow Jew who said he has been refused
permission to leave for seven years, shouted ``Let us go to
Israel'' a half-dozen times as the demonstration ended and police
began escorting the last of the protesters to a nearby train
entrance.
   Meshkov, his wife Lida and three and his family held signs
during the protest claiming, ``Refusal is a form of murder.'' He
said he had been beaten severely twice this year during
demonstrations. ``They are really trying to kill us,'' he said.
   Yuri Semyonovsky, who said he has been refused permission to
emigrate for two years, said said of the meetings between Reagan
and Gorbachev, ``we expect there will be progress but we don't know
how deep it will be.''
   One of the protesters added, ``I expect maybe Mr. Reagan will
challenge Mr. Gorbachev's idea of democracy, as a leader of a
really democratic country.''
   Others held banners calling for a ``World without missiles or
refusals,'' asking the United States for asylum, and proclaiming
themselves prisoners of the KGB secret police and the Soviet visa
office.
   Avi Weiss, head of the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry and the
National Center for Russian Jewry of New York, stopped to talk to
the protesters after he and five others conducted a protest for 18
minutes on Red Square earlier in the afternoon.
   He said the group ``insisted Gorbachev free all our people,''
and demanded that the United States make trade with the Soviet
Union depended on the Soviet human rights policy.
   The demonstration broke up without incident, he said.

<HEAD>Bush Confirms Meeting With Meese To Discuss Presidential Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush said Monday that Edwin
Meese III, the embattled attorney general, promised in a recent
private meeting not to do anything to jeopardize Bush's campaign
for the presidency.
   The vice president, speaking with reporters after participating
in a rainy Memorial Day ceremony at his oceanside vacation retreat,
confirmed that he talked with Meese, but declined to elaborate on
the meeting.
   ``Now that that secret is no longer a secret, I prefer to let
him discuss that,'' Bush, the certain Republican nominee, said of
the meeting.
   Bush aides had been refusing even to confirm the meeting, which
The Washington Post reported in Saturday's editions.
   ``He and I agreed we weren't going to discuss that,'' Bush said.
   But asked if Meese had promised not to do anything to hurt his
presidential campaign, Bush said, ``Yes, yes, I think it's fair to
say that.''
   The vice president has not called for Meese's resignation and
has said he does not want to comment on the matter until after the
independent counsel's report on Meese's legal difficulties is
issued. Bush said he expected that report to be released shortly.
   Campaign aides have said that Meese has become a political
liability, making it hard for the vice president to argue his case
for returning high ethical standards to government.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said Sunday that
President Reagan believes that Meese's legal problems could harm
Bush's political fortunes.
   ``Oh, I think so _ for the moment and to some degree. But I
think that he (Reagan), too, would urge you to wait and see how all
this unfolds and develops,'' Baker said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press'' program.
   As in years past, Bush delivered a short speech in the town
square at the conclusion of Kennebunkport's Memorial Day parade.
Bush, noting the U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow, said the arms
control agreement to eliminate intermediate-range weapons would not
have been reached ``if the United States had not been strong, if we
hadn't sacrificed from time to time as a nation.''
   ``We got there because the Soviet Union saw us as strong,'' he
said.
   Bush said that if elected, he would try to follow Reagan's lead
and reach additional arms control agreements with the Soviets,
including pacts on biological and chemical warfare.
   In his 10-minute talk, Bush twice referred to the holiday as
``Veterans Day.''
   His wife, Barbara, laid a wreath at a town monument
commemorating the war dead.
   Several thousand people crowded the streets of downtown
Kennebunkport to watch the parade which consisted of two bands, Boy
Scout and Brownie troops, town dignitaries and a half-dozen fire
engines.
   Bush is spending the week meeting with advisers and Republican
leaders in hopes of energizing his lagging presidential campaign.
   On Tuesday, he planned to meet with economic advisers, including
Martin Feldstein, former chairman of the White House Council of
Economic Advisers, former Assistant Treasury Secretary Richard
Darman, and Kathleen Eickhoff, formerly chief economist for the
Office of Management and Budget.

<TEXT>
   Werner Erhard and Associates have filed
a $5 million lawsuit against a congressional candidate who's
opposing Erhard's brother in a Republican primary next month.
   Erhard is the founder of the est program. His brother, Nathan
Rosenberg, is among those opposing Christopher Cox in the primary
for the 40th Congressional District seat.
   The suit claims that criticism of est training by Cox was
libelous and slanderous.
   The lawsuit focuses on statements about est contained in 110,000
brochures mailed to Orange County residents this month and alleged
telephone calls by Cox's campaign workers asking voters whether
they would support a candidate if he were linked to a ``cult''
organization.
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court, is
``baseless and groundless,'' said Bob Schuman, Cox's campaign
manager.
   The brochure quoted a Los Angeles Magazine article as saying
that the Chicago-based Cult Awareness Network has called est and
other Erhard programs ``destructive cults.''
   Cox's mailer is similar to one used in 1986 by the district's
incumbent, Rep. Robert Badham. Badham apologized and retracted his
statements in 1986 after Werner Erhard and Associates threatened a
lawsuit.

   The town is non-existent and some of the star
performers are dead _ but people were roaming the hills of western
Maryland looking for a rock concert being broadcast ``live'' by a
Baltimore radio station.
   In the tradition of Orson Welles' electrifying ``War of the
Worlds'' broadcast in 1938 of Martians landing in New Jersey, radio
station WGRX-FM sponsored a ``fantasy'' rock concert over the
weekend in the fictitious Livestock, a la the legendary Woodstock.
   The concert featured headliners such as Jimi Hendrix, Led
Zeppelin, the Eagles, and a reunion of the Beatles. Who wouldn't
skip the traditional Memorial Day weekend picnic for a chance to
witness rock history? Especially if the concert sponsors could
bring Jimi Hendrix back among the living.
   It was billed as attracting crowds on the scale of those who had
trooped to the now-legendary love-in and songfest in New York state
in 1969.
   One man stopped at the State Police barracks in Hagerstown to
ask directions. ``He came into the barracks, right to the front
desk. `I'm up here for the concert. Can you direct me to Livestock?
I been listening to it on the radio all the way up here,''' Sgt.
Kenneth Frick said.
   Livestock doesn't exist, Frick told the man, who sheepishly got
back into his car and drove away. ``I don't think he wanted to tell
me who he was after he realized he had been duped,'' the police
officer said.
   As many as two dozen people called the Hagerstown barracks
Saturday night and Sunday about the concert, Frick said. Others
called the state police in Cumberland.
   And despite radio accounts of less-than-desirable conditions at
Livestock, lines for the port-a-pots a mile long, people sleeping
in trees, and sweaty concertgoers cooling off in a muddy creek,
people still wanted to be there.

   For $30 a day, aspiring cowpokes can
saddle up and have the pleasure of falling off horses and dodging
bulls at the Lazy C Rodeo Ranch.
   For nearly 30 years, owner Ray Cox, 55, has been teaching the
hardy how not to get killed by a bucking horse or bull.
   ``He's had every bone in his body broken,'' said Lazy C Rodeo
secretary Debbie Dodd of her boss.
   ``He broke his foot about a year ago when he got throwed by a
bull. (The foot) was broken in two places. He limped around about a
half hour, said `that's enough sympathy,' and went on like nothing
happened,'' Dodd said.
   Saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, bull riding, barrel
racing and bullfighting are all taught at the ranch.
   The cowboys and cowgirls at the Lazy C come from all parts of
the country, including Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee,
Arkansas, Michigan and even some city slickers from Chicago.
   Dodd says Cox doesn't tell students when they've done something
right, but points out their mistakes.
   ``Because as soon as you think you're good, you lose you're fear
and then you can get killed,'' she said.
   Cox said he has ridden almost every breed of horse.
   ``I always say, if he walks on the ground, I can get him
ridden,'' Cox said.

   You've got to wield a hefty
hatchet to win the woodchopping championship of the world, and
you've got to do it in Webster Springs, where sideshows to the
annual timber titles include tobacco-spitting and ax-shaving
contests
   ``This is an excellent competition,'' said Cliff Hughes of
Auckland, New Zealand, one of several woodchoppers who traveled
from overseas for this year's nine-day Webster County Woodchopping
Festival.
   Arden Cogar, 54, a veteran logger who founded the Webster County
Woodchopping Festival in 1960, estimated there are ``about 50 to 60
woodchopping shows held each year in the United States now.''
   But perhaps nowhere in the United States is woodchopping as
appreciated as it is in Webster County, a lumbering region that's
home to the world's tallest sycamore tree.
   At least 25,000 people attended this year's festival which ended
Sunday, according to festival director Randall Underwood.
   The festival includes nine categories of woodchopping, in which
the winners are determined by how fast they fell their trees. This
year's winner of the all-around grand champion title was Melvin
Lentz of Oregon.

   The summit teams focused on arms issues. Officials said
agreements were likely on two secondary pacts and progress was
being made on a far more significant strategic arms accord.
   No one was predicting a breakthrough to conclude the so-called
START negotiations, but there was movement in two of the most
stubborn areas _ involving mobile missiles and cruise missiles
launched from warplanes. However, the president's Strategic Defense
Initiative was still under Soviet challenge and the United States
refused to permit Soviet inspection of U.S. ships armed with cruise
missiles.

   Reagan met with several dozen dissidents and refuseniks and
members of their families at the U.S. ambassador's residence,
saying: ``I came here hoping to do what I could to give you
strength.''
   ``But I already know it is you who have strengthened me. You
have given me a message to carry back: While we press for human
rights through diplomatic channels, you press with your very lives,
day in, day out, year after year, risking your jobs, your homes,
your all.''
   The president also visited Danilov Monastery and voiced hope
that religious bells might be ``clamoring for joy in their newfound
freedom'' someday throughout the Soviet Union.
   ``The faith of your people has been tested and tempered in the
crucible of hardship,'' Reagan told 18 black-garbed Russian
Orthodox monks. ``But in that suffering, it has grown strong.''

   At a state dinner at the Kremlin's Hall of Facets, Reagan and
Gorbachev exchanged toasts.
   Gorbachev called for closer contacts with Americans but said
``this should be done without interfering in domestic affairs,
without sermonizing or imposing one's views and ways, without
turning family or personal problems into a pretext for
confrontation between states.''
   Reagan told Gorbachev that their search for ``common ground'' in
U.S.-Soviet relations was one ``that must be continued'' by his
successor. ``It is a search that can succeed,'' he said.

long-time admirer of the Nobel-prize winner's ``Dr. Zhivago,'' said
the noontime visit to the wooded Moscow suburb of Peredelkino
``impressed me greatly. It was very, very touching.''
   She also visited an English class at a prestigious Moscow middle

<HEAD>Adopted Parents of Choctaw Indian Twins Say Battle to Keep them
Worth It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The adoptive parents of 2-year-old
Indian twins are optimistic the U.S. Supreme Court will uphold
their custody despite an appeal by the children's Choctaw tribe.
   Tribal rulers claim they have jurisdiction because the twins
``lived'' on the reservation while fetuses, despite a lower court
ruling that upheld the adoption since the children were born in
nearby Gulfport.
   ``The Choctaws have not seen the last of us,'' Curtiss Holyfield
said in a recent interview. ``We'll do what we have to do.''
   Holyfield's age, 62, also has been an issue in the adoption.
   The U.S. Supreme Court decided last week it will rule on the
legality of the Jan. 28, 1986, adoption of Samuel Seth and Megan
Beth, born out of wedlock to Jennie Bell, then 24. The mother had
lived on the Choctaw Reservation near Philadelphia, in central
Mississippi.
   The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians sued the Holyfields,
saying the adoption, finalized in Harrison County Chancery Court,
violated the tribe's sovereignty over its legal affairs.
   But the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled Aug. 5, 1987, that the
tribe had no jurisdiction, in part because the twins were born in
Gulfport and never resided on the reservation.
   The case has raised several legal issues, including the creative
argument by Choctaw lawyers that the twins resided on the
reservation while inside the mother's womb.
   ``It's like if a U.S. citizen went to Germany and had her child
there,'' Choctaw Chief Phillip Martin said.
   In that situation, he said, the U.S. government would have
authority over the welfare of the child.
   The Holyfield adoption is particularly unusual because the Long
Beach couple had been rejected by adoption agencies because of
Curtiss Holyfield's age. Now 62, the retired school principal and
Methodist minister would be in his late 70s when the twins graduate
from high school.
   ``That's the point. We don't know anything about the adoption.
We don't know what the deal was ... we don't know anything about
the past history'' of the Holyfields, Martin said.
   He said if the tribal court could determine the fate of the
children, Hollyfield's age ``would certainly be a factor.''
   ``Age doesn't bother me,'' Curtiss Holyfield said. ``The
important thing is we love children. How could you be a teacher, or
even a minister, if you didn't like being around children?''
   Vivian Holyfield, 47, a first-grade teacher at Waveland
Elementary School, sums up the rejection by adoption agencies in
one word: ``Discrimination.''
   While the issue is now a heated legal battle, the initial
adoption agreement, say the Holyfields, was a friendly effort
between them and Bell to solve a mutual dilemma. In 1985, Bell,
already the unmarried mother of two children, became pregnant and
believed she couldn't afford another child. She rejected the idea
of an abortion and couldn't find adoptive parents in the
Philadelphia area, Vivian Holyfield said.
   Bell could not be reached for comment this week.
   With Vivian unable to become pregnant, the Holyfields were
stymied in their dream of a family. The Holyfields say Bell
telephoned them on Dec. 3 to ask if they would be her children's
parents.
   ``I remember the date because it was my birthday,'' Vivian
Holyfield said. ``I feel the Lord wanted us to have these
children.''
   The Holyfields had known Bell several years, going back to when
she attended the United Methodist church where Curtiss Holyfield
was pastor.
   Seth and Beth were born Dec. 29 _ two months premature. The
Holyfields paid all medical bills _ $12,000 for intensive-care
treatment of the twins and about $3,500 for Bell.
   Curtiss Holyfield had six children in a previous marriage that
ended in divorce. Seth and Beth, who were 2 years and 5 months old
Sunday, ``are the aunt and uncle'' of nine grandchildren, the
youngest of which is seven, he said.

   Five people died when a boat rescuing
flood victims sank in northeastern Bangladesh, pushing to 10 the
death toll from more than a week of flooding, officials and news
reports said.
   The ferry sank Sunday near Companyganj, about 100 miles
northeast of the capital of Dhaka.
   Five people drowned earlier in Sylhet and Sunamganj districts,
which border the Indian state of Assam, as tributaries of the
Brahmaputra, Surma and Kushiara rivers burst over their banks
following heavy rains.
   Officials said rail and road communications to the two districts
have been severed and that rescue operations were hampered by
continuing rain and wind.
   The English-language Bangladesh Observer said Monday that the
homes and crops of about 1.5 million people have been flooded. The
waters have also drowned at least 5,000 livestock, the reports said.
   The flooding, common in Bangladesh in late spring, has left at
least 15,000 people homeless, while more than 50,000 remain
stranded in isolated villages, the reports said.
   Nearly 3,000 houses, most made of mud and straw, were washed
away by the waters, which have also flooded roads, according to
officials in Sylhet.

   Robert Schornstheimer, who safely landed
his Aloha Airlines jet last month after a section of the cabin blew
away in flight, says his lifelong curiosity about machinery helped
him land the plane.
   As a child, Schornstheimer said, he always wanted to know what
made things work.
   ``In some ways, I've prepared all my life, in that sense, for
that situation,'' Schornstheimer said, referring to the April 28
accident in which the Aloha jet lost a portion of its fuselage.
   One person, a flight attendant aboard the jet, was killed when
she was sucked out of the plane.
   ``One of the impressions I had was that everything was so
normal, and a fraction of a second later everything seemed slightly
unreal,'' he said.
   After he heard the section of the cabin blow away, he said, he
looked out the door of the cockpit and saw blue sky.
   ``That was a really disturbing impression. We were really
stunned for a second,'' the pilot said from his home in Hawaii in
an interview published last week in The Marietta Times.
Schornstheimer, a former Air Force pilot, graduated in 1963 from
Marietta High School and later from Defiance College in Ohio.
   Schornstheimer said he slowed the plane to about 200 mph and
adjusted its wing flaps for a controlled descent. He said the plane
shook as if it were experiencing turbulence when he tried to slow
it more.
   ``Somewhere right in that area, it went through my mind that we
wouldn't make it,'' Schornstheimer said.
   However, 13 minutes after the accident, he landed the plane
safely.
   Schornstheimer returned to his job on May 20.

   The worst heat wave in 20 years left at
least 100 people dead of sunstroke over the weekend in northern and
central India, news reports said Monday.
   Press Trust of India said 200 more people were admitted to
hospitals across the country after suffering sunstroke.
   Seven people died of sunstroke at a temple at Goverdhan town, 90
miles south of New Delhi, the United News of India reported. The
victims were walking the circumference of the temple, a necessary
ritual in the Hindu religion before entering a shrine.
   Most of the deaths were reported from the states of Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh, and Utter Pradesh. New Delhi, the capital, reported
four deaths, the news agency said.
   Meteorologists say the heat wave, which began Thursday, is the
worst in the past 20 years.
   Temperatures have risen to 118 degrees in some towns, at least
nine degrees above the average high at this time of year.
   Many cities, including New Delhi, have shortages of drinking
water. Residents often wait for hours to get water from city-run
water supply tanks.

   A cane that traditionally belonged to
the oldest person in town is being returned to its home by a
California antique collector who was about to have the gold head of
the handcrafted piece melted down.
   Officials in this central Maine town are awaiting the return of
the ``Boston Post Cane'' from the unidentified antique buff who
purchased the ebony staff from a dealer in California.
   The Monterey man got in touch with the town office about three
weeks ago, said Town Manager Mike Roy.
   The collector told Roy he noticed the Vassalboro town name
etched in the head and was curious about the historical
significance of the walking stick. When he found out its history,
he offered to sell it back to the town for the same undisclosed
price he paid for it.
   The cane was one of more than 600 handcrafted canes distributed
in 1909 by the Boston Post to towns and cities in Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Accompanying the
cane was a letter from Publisher Edwin A. Grozier that said the
canes ``should always be owned and carried by the oldest citizen of
your town.''
   Town officials were to act as trustees for the canes as they
were passed down through the years. The canes were made from
seven-foot logs of ebony shipped from Africa; cutting, finishing
and polishing them took about a year.
   No one seemed to know when the Post cane had left Vassalboro.
When it returns, it will be checked for its authenticity and
presented to the local historical society.

   A brass band played patriotic songs at a
Memorial Day service, then broke into raucous Dixieland tunes at a
graveside salute to a 19th-century madam remembered for her
business smarts and ``heart of gold.''
   About 100 onlookers clapped their hands in rhythm while the
Prospect Hill Preservation Brass Ensemble played ``When the Saints
Go Marching In'' at the large granite slab marking the grave of
Anna Wilson.
   Miss Wilson, who died in 1911 leaving behind a scandalous
reputation and a $1 million estate to charity, is buried at
Prospect Hill Cemetery near many of the leading citizens of her day.
   People who knew her decorated her grave each Memorial Day for
several years after she died. The tradition was renewed about 10
years ago, when members of the Prospect Hill brass band decided to
pay her tribute after the cemetery's traditional memorial service
to the nation's war dead.
   Frank Bramhall, who has given a eulogy for Miss Wilson the last
four years, placed a yellow rose on her grave.
   ``Whatever may be said of Miss Wilson's early career, she is
credited with being a woman of rare business ability, a large heart
and great charity,'' Bramhall said.
   Bramhall, who is broadcast and artistic manager for radio
station KVNO, lauded Miss Wilson for leaving the money she made
from her house of ill repute to charities such as the Creche
Children's Home.
   Miss Wilson had a ``heart of gold,'' Bramhall said, and she gave
her old, 25-room bawdyhouse to the city to use as a hospital.
   Miss Wilson, born the daughter of a Baptist preacher in Georgia
in 1835, came to Omaha in 1867 when the town was a jumping-off
point for pioneers heading west from the Missouri River. She lived
for many years with riverboat gambler Dan Allen, whom she never
married but is buried beside.
   At Monday's formal cemetery ceremony, a crowd of about 200
people joined in the Pledge of Allegiance led by a Boy Scout. The
band, using arrangements from the John Philip Sousa era, played
``The Star-Spangled Banner'' and other patriotic songs.
   After the playing of ``Taps,'' a marker noting early Omaha
historian and newspaperman Alfred Sorensen was dedicated. About
half the crowd left the cemetery but the rest headed to Miss
Wilson's grave.
   Band members began a slow walk toward the grave, following a
bagpiper playing ``Amazing Grace.'' The band played several
Dixieland tunes before and after Bramhall's eulogy.
   Bramhall, band leader David Krecek and program organizer Larry
McNichols said the turnout for the ceremony was one of the best
ever.
   The tribute to Miss Wilson rarely offends anyone, McNichols said.
   ``Saluting a prostitute is not the purpose of this thing,'' he
said. ``For one thing, she gave a lot of money to this cemetery.''

<TEXT>
   President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq on
Monday accused the ousted prime minister and his government of
incompetence and corruption and said he fired them because they
failed to reduce crime or improve the economy.
   Former Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo charged that the
president violated democratic principles by dissolving the
government without consulting him, and he vowed to rebound in
elections for the new government.
   Zia fired Junejo, Junejo's 33-member Cabinet and the 210-seat
National Assembly on Sunday and said elections would be held within
90 days.
   ``The government which ruled the country for more than three
years was ineffective,'' Zia, 64, said in a nationally televised
speech Monday. Zia charged that Junejo had to bribe his supporters
and lawmakers with favors that led to ``unprecedented corruption at
all levels.''
   The outgoing government relied too heavily on domestic and
foreign borrowing that deepened the nation's economic crisis, Zia
added.
   He strongly criticized the Junejo government for failing to
control crime, especially in Pakistan's largest city of Karachi,
and for failing to prevent ethnic, regional and class conflicts and
rioting.
   ``The law and order situation is so bad that people spend
sleepless nights because of the fear of getting robbed, kidnapped,
or murdered,'' he said.
   Ethnic riots in southern Sind province and the port city of
Karachi have killed hundreds since Zia lifted martial law in 1985
and handed limited power over to Junejo's Pakistan Muslim League
government.
   Speaking at a news conference, Junejo said: ``The dissolution of
the National Assembly by the president was taken arbitrarily and
solely on his own. The action is against the fundamentals of
democratic process.''
   Junejo vowed that his Muslim League will win control of the
assembly on the basis of ``our record of democracy and public
service.''
   The National Assembly and Junejo's Cabinet were scheduled to
remain in office until 1990. They were elected in December 1984.
Junejo was appointed prime minister in March 1985.
   Junejo's was the first civilian Cabinet since Zia, the army
chief of staff, ended eight years of martial law.
   Zia set no date for the new elections, but he announced a major
policy change, saying political parties will be allowed to propose
their own candidates for assembly seats.
   In the 1984 elections, parties were not permitted to field their
own candidates. The balloting was boycotted by the opposition.
   The president said he will soon appoint a caretaker Cabinet to
help run the country until a new government is elected.
   Benazir Bhutto, leader of the opposition Pakistan People's
Party, was quoted in the English-language newspaper The Muslim as
saying she welcomes Zia's move but still has doubts. ``We will wait
until the rules of the game are spelled out,'' she said.
   Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was a prime minister toppled by
Zia in a military coup in 1977. He was hanged in 1979 on a murder
conspiracy conviction.
   Zia's 25-minute speech was largely confined to domestic policy
issues, but he also discussed Pakistan's relations with the United
States and Soviet Union.
   ``Our present relations with the United States, China, and the
Islamic countries are the cornerstone of our foreign policy, and we
will continue this policy,'' he said.
   He said Pakistan's relations with the Soviet Union will improve,
despite nine years of tensions arising from Pakistan's support of
Afghan guerrillas fighting the Red Army and the Soviet-backed Kabul
government.
   Zia said relations with India, Pakistan's eastern neighbor, will
be normalized and tensions resulting from three wars in 40 years
will be reduced.

   President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq's
dismissal of his government came against a backdrop of increased
ethnic riots, terrorist bombings and a chamber of quarreling
lawmakers.
   On Sunday, Zia shocked the nation when he dissolved the National
Assembly and fired Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo and his
33-member Cabinet. Zia accused them of failing to maintain law and
order and allowing public morality to slide.
   Zia, an army general who took power in a bloodless coup 11 years
ago, appointed Junejo prime minister in March 1985 following the
December 1984 national elections.
   Zia and Junejo were faced with an upsurge in ethnic violence,
especially in the melting pot of Karachi, a sprawling port city on
the Indian Ocean.
   The main combatants are the Mohajirs, Moslems who migrated from
India after partition in 1947, and Pathans, tribes who came from
northern Pakistan.
   Sharing the cramped, squalid cinderblock slums, as little as a
traffic accident can spark days of gunfights and killing between
the groups.
   Hundreds died in such riots in November and December 1986.
Violence still flares every few weeks.
   The southern province of Sind also has seen an upsurge in
robbery, murder and kidnapping.
   Government officials say the war in neighboring Afghanistan has
spilled into Pakistan in the form of increased traffic in illicit
drugs and weapons, along with more than 2 million war refugees.
   They claim that Pakistan was a virtual stranger to drug abuse
five years ago. Officials now estimate there are as many as 1.5
million heroin addicts.
   Pakistan has paid a heavy price for its support of Afghan
guerrillas fighting to topple the Soviet-backed Kabul government.
   Hundreds of people were killed in terrorist bombings in Pakistan
in 1986 and 1987. Police blamed the attacks on Afghan government
agents.
   The worst war-related disaster occurred April 10 when a huge
ammunition depot filled with U.S.-supplied weapons for the Afghan
rebels exploded.
   Tens of thousands of rockets, grenades and artillery shells
rained over the neighboring cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
Official reports put the casualty toll at 105 dead and 1,500
wounded, but others claim hundreds of people are still unaccounted
for.
   Zia first called it an ``extraordinary accident'' but later
hinted it was sabotage. Results of a government probe of the
disaster have not been made public.
   While appealing for national unity and Moslem values,
legislation to that effect made slow progress through the 217-seat
National Assembly.
   Though dominated by the ruling Muslim League, the assembly also
contained some independents and members of small opposition parties.
   Filibusters were common when there was a quorum. Some debates
had to be canceled because of low attendance.
   Average Pakistanis seem also to drag their feet on the
Islamization issue. Although alcohol consumption is punishable by
flogging, bootleg liquor is a booming industry.
   Non-Moslem foreigners are exempted from the law.

   The Moscow summit could mean improved chances
for lasting peace and that is one of the best ways to remember
America's war dead, Veterans Affairs administrator Thomas Turnage
said Monday at Arlington National Cemetery.
   Turnage was the key speaker at the Memorial Day ceremony at the
Tomb of the Unknowns, which contains remains of unidentified
soldiers killed in each of the four major American wars of this
century.
   ``Those of us who live peace can take comfort in the fact'' that
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``are at
this very moment talking, search for peace,'' Turnage told about
4,000 people who attended the ceremony, which was held with full
military honors.
   ``President Reagan has kept his promise to strengthen our
defenses and enhance the prospects for peace,'' Turnage said.
``There's been a turnaround of unprecedented magnitude.''
   Turnage, who was appointed by Reagan, praised the president for
pursuing a policy toward the Soviet Union which he said has been
``realistic, consistent, and comprehensive.''
   Turnage decried what he said are calls to reduce military
spending and said the nation ``should heed such voices with
caution.''
   A mile east, across the Potomac River, U.S. Park Police
estimated that about 15,000 peoples gathered on the Mall to honor
the dead of the nation's most recent conflict, the Vietnam war.
   John Wheeler, chairman of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
Foundation, said 30 million people visited the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial since it opened six years ago. It has become one of the
most popular destinations in Washington.
   Former Sen. Charles McC. Mathias, R-Md., urged his audience to
remember that ``every name on the wall is not just a name. Every
name represents a person, every name has a story, a personality.''
   Laura Palmer, author of ``Shrapnel in the Heart,'' said writing
the book taught her that ``now we need to turn to the families and
friends of those who died in Vietnam and say the same thing _
`welcome home.'''
   Her book is based on some of the thousands of notes and letters
relatives of the dead have stuck in cracks on the shiny black
granite wall which carries the name of the 58,000 men and women who
died in Vietnam.

   President Reagan told nearly 100 emotionally
charged Soviet refuseniks and political dissidents Monday that he
is pressing Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev for human rights
improvements because hopes are rising that ``freedom will truly
come to all.''
   ``It is our belief that this is a moment of hope,'' he said.
``The new Soviet leaders appear to grasp the connection between
certain freedoms and economic growth. The freedom to keep the
fruits of one's own labor, for example, is a freedom that the
present reforms seem to be enlarging.''
   Reagan told would-be emigrees, persecuted religious believers
and human rights activists that he hopes economic freedom will lead
to other freedoms of religion, speech and travel.
   ``There can be no relenting, for now we must work for more,
always more,'' he declared.
   ``I have to believe that ... freedom will truly come to all, for
what injustice can withstand your strength, and what can conquer
your prayers?'' Reagan told the tense, excited tense crowd at Spaso
House, the residence of the U.S. ambassador.
   Reagan was interrupted by repeated ovations, and some in the
crowd were close to tears.
   The president's meeting, which prompted criticism by Soviet
officials and press commentators, followed his visit to the
restored 13th century Danilov Monastery on the southern edge of
Moscow. There he told a small band of Russian Orthodox monks of his
hope that current Soviet reforms will yield greater religious
freedom.
   Reagan's meetings with Christian monks and Jewish refuseniks,
who have been denied permission to emigrate, were unprecedented for
a visiting American president. Soviet authorities seemed less than
enthralled.
   Approaches to Spaso House were sealed off by heavy police
cordons. At the U.S. Embassy, where the president's guests
assembled before the meeting, they had to show identity documents
and have their names checked off a list to get through police lines.
   Two Leningrad refuseniks, Roald ``Alec'' Zelenichok and Yevgeny
Lein, said they were warned by KGB agents last week not to attend
the meeting. They came to Moscow anyway and entered Spaso House
without problems.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, asked
what he thought of Reagan's meeting, noted that the president's
guests were not ``the flower of our society.'' But they praised
Reagan for meeting them directly to discuss human rights.
   ``I'm an old fan of his, as are many of the refuseniks, so it
was very nice to see him in person and to see his personal, deep
concern,'' said Sergei Petrov, who sat next to Nancy Reagan at the
meeting. Petrov has been refused permission to join his American
wife for nine years.
   Reagan sat next to Abe Stolar, a 73-year-old American who came
to the Soviet Union as a child in the 1930s and has battled since
1975 to leave the country with his family.
   ``On the American side, I've seen everybody up to the
president'' about my problems, Petrov said. ``On the Soviet side,
the highest authority I've been able to speak with is a junior
clerk.''
   Refusenik Tanya Zieman said she was ``overwhelmed'' by the
meeting.
   ``We are not so used to hearing such human words without any
political statement,'' said her husband Yuri.
   Andrei Sakharov, 67, who once was the Soviet Union's most
prominent human rights activist, was not invited to the meeting. A
U.S. official said he would be attending a state dinner at Spaso
House on Tuesday.
   Sakharov has been restrained in his contact with Westerners
since he returned from internal exile in Gorky in December 1986. He
has spoken out in support of Gorbachev's reforms, but also makes
demands for freedom for political prisoners that do not accord with
Communist Party orthodoxy.
   While many guests at Spaso House were enthusiastic about their
meeting with Reagan, two of the political dissidents were more
restrained in their assessment.
   Yuli Kosharovsky, who has been denied an exist visa for 17
years, hesitantly replied, ''I hope so,'' when asked whether the
meeting with Reagan would help him and others who attended.
   The other was Sergei Kovalev, a sociologist who lost his job for
protesting the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and
spent 10 years of internal exile in a labor camp. ``The fact of
this meeting was more important than anything that was said,''
Kovalev said.
   The third speaker, Orthodox priest Gleb Yakunin, credited Reagan
with playing an important personal role in gaining the release of
many of the Spaso House guests from detention last year.
   ``Many prisoners of conscience are still languishing in prisons,
labor camps, exile and in psychiatric hospitals,'' he said. ``Some
are still imprisoned for religious activities. We trust that you,
Mr. President, will do everything in your power to facilitate a
speedy release.''

<HEAD>TV Crews Say Tapes of Anti-Government Protest Were Erased</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two television news agencies
said Monday that videotapes of an anti-government church service to
be used by U.S. and British networks were erased after being
transported by the state-owned airline.
   Worldwide Television News and Visnews said its crews delivered
four videotapes to the South African Airways office in the coastal
town of George, about 250 miles east of Cape Town, to be flown to
Johannesburg.
   When the shipment was collected, the video images on all four
tapes had been erased, the agencies reported.
   ``We deplore this type of tampering with the news gathering
process,'' said the agencies in a joint statement.
   The program was to be used by the U.S. networks CBS, ABC and
NBC, the British Broadcasting Corp., and Britain's Independent
Television News.
   South African Airways said it would investigate the matter.
   ``Our policy is that we do not interfere with anything that is
given us to transport,'' said an airline spokesman, quoted by the
South African Press Association.
   The television crews on Sunday filmed a church service held in
Lawaaikamp, a black settlement outside George. The service was to
protest the government's planned evictions of the settlement's
1,800 residents.
   The government says Lawaaikamp is illegal becaue it is on land
designated for use by people of mixed-race. A new mixed-race
township is to be developed on the site, and the government wants
to move the current black residents to a new town nearby.
   Among the 2,000 people attending the service were the Rev. Allan
Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and
the Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African
Council of Churches.
   The Foreign Correspondents Association, which represents more
than 100 journalists working in South Africa for foreign news
organizations, said in a statement: ``Foreign correspondents here
are constantly exhorted by the authorities to play by the rules.
Such exhortations would carry more weight if other parties were
seen to be under the same obligation.''
   About 200 religious leaders from across South Africa opened an
emergency meeting Monday to consider new, non-violent strategies,
including civil disobedience, to resist white domination in South
Africa.
   The two-day meeting, the first of its kind, was to end Tuesday
with a ``service of witness and solidarity'' at the main Roman
Catholic Church in Soweto, Johannesburg's largest black township.
   The agenda suggested that targets of civil disobedience could
include tax payments, military service and racially oriented laws
such as those mandating segregated residential areas.
   The convocation was sponsored by the South African Council of
Churches, which includes major Protestant denominations active in
the fight for black rights. Also participating were the Roman
Catholic Church and a number of independent African churches.

   American Indians ended five days of
ceremonies Monday in honor of ancestors whose graves had been
disturbed by relic hunters.
   Some 200 native Americans and supporters walked about 1{ miles
to the 40-acre site on a farm near the Ohio River. Chanting and
beating drums, they sprinkled tobacco over burning sage and threw
the mixture on the graves.
   People who allegedly bought rights to search for artifacts
raided the site last December where about 1,000 Indians were
buried. Ten men were arrested and charged with destruction of a
venerated object. They are to be tried next month; a trial date has
not been set.
   After the ceremony, the participants returned to a prayer lodge
on the nearby farm of Uniontown Mayor Raymond Turner to hold a
feast and exchange gifts.

   A judge set bail at $10,000 Monday for a man said
to have killed his mother-in-law and attacked his father-in-law
while sleepwalking.
   Last week, an Ontario Supreme Court jury found Kenneth James
Parks, 24, of nearby Pickering innocent of murder.
   He was charged with murdering Barbara Ann Woods, 42, at her home
in suburban Scarborough on May 24. Defense psychiatrists testified
that he was sleepwalking at the time and therefore not criminally
responsible.
   Parks appeared in court Monday on a charge of attempting to
murder Denis Woods at the same time. Defence lawyer Marlys Edward
and assistant prosecutor Cathy Mocha agreed to bail of $10,000 and
an adjournment to June 27.
   The defendant also faces fraud charges in connection with the
theft of $32,000 from his employer. He is to appear in district
court June 13 on that charge.

   Little Richard will take on his first regular
TV role as the host of a weekly music and comedy series in the fall.
   The longtime rock 'n' roller's new syndicated program is called
``The Colors of Success,''and is scheduled to debut nationally
Sept. 12. It will co-star Ted Lange, perhaps best known as ``The
Love Boat'' bartender, and Chip Fields, who appeared as Richard
Pryor's wife in the film ``Blue Collar.''
   Executive producers Reuben Cannon and Barry Hankerson announced
Monday that the show combines musical performance in a live setting
with situation comedy.
   Little Richard will act as the host and master of ceremonies at
a nightclub owned by a divorced couple (Lange and Miss Fields).
   The TV show is based on an off-Broadway play called ``The Rhythm
and The Blues,'' staged in 1982 and created by Hankerson.
   Little Richard, who sold more than 32 million records before
1968, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year.
He appeared in the film ``Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' and will
soon co-star with Vanna White in the NBC television movie ``The

   Police said Monday they were
investigating the cause of a melee in which a woman was fatally
shot and two men were stabbed after a Memorial Day weekend concert
and cookoff.
   The fracas apparently started among a group of motorists upset
over congested traffic following the Sunday evening event at the
Pasadena Fairgrounds, authorities said.
   Two men were involved in a fight over the snarling traffic in
which three rounds of gunfire were shot. A stray bullet struck
Sherry Ann Longoria, 24, in the upper torso as she sat in the
driver's seat of her car, police said. The other two bullets struck
another vehicle.
   Ms. Longoria's husband, Richard Savales, his brother, James
Savales, and a friend then approached the two men, police said.
   During the ensuing struggle, Javier Torres, 17, and Joseph Angel
Torres, 26, were stabbed. James Savales also suffered a minor cut
on his hand, police said.
   Ms. Longoria, Javier Torres and Joseph Torres were transported
by Life Flight helicopter to Hermann Hospital in Houston.
   Ms. Longoria died Sunday night while undergoing surgery,
hospital administrative manager Theresa Kowpak said. The two men
were in serious but stable condition in the intensive care unit,
she said.
   Eleven people were arrested in connection with the fight, eight
of them for public intoxication and the others for criminal
mischief, said Betty Parks, spokeswoman for the Pasadena Police
Department.
   Ms. Parks said the fight erupted near the entrance of the
Pasadena Civic Center on the fairgrounds.
   ``At this time it appears that it all started when these people
lost their tempers,'' Ms. Parks said. ``There was a car that went
off into a ditch and tempers flared and somebody pulled out a gun.
   ``I understand there was alcohol served at the cookoff so its
possible that people had been drinking and were in a hurry to
leave,'' Ms. Parks said.
   She did not know how many people had attended the event.
   Gibson said police are still talking to about 20 witnesses.
   Police were unsure how many people were involved in the
incident, but said some brandished tire tools and two-by-fours.

   Ernst Ruska, the West German professor who shared
the 1986 Nobel Prize in physics for developing the electron
microscope, has died in West Berlin, officials of his university
said Monday. He was 81.
   Ruska died Friday after a short illness, West Berlin's Technical
University said. It gave no other details.
   Ruska shared the 1986 Nobel Prize with West German scientist
Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer of Switzerland.
   He was awarded for developing the electron microscope in 1931.
The electron microscope is much more powerful than an optical
microscope. It can magnify the most minute objects by 10,000 times.
   Ruska discovered that electron radiation can reflect like the
light in a lense. Ruska's lense was a magnet that uncoupled the
charged elements from their course. The first commercial electron
microscope went on the market in 1939, and Rusla continued to
improve the instrument.
   In an interview with The Associated Press after winning the
prize, Ruska said he was surprised that the distinction came so
long after his discovery.
   ``The electron microscope was first built in 1931. That's 55
years ago. I could have perhaps expected this award 40 years ago,
but normally it is given for new discoveries,'' Ruska said at the
time.
   Ruska, born Dec. 25, 1906, studied first at the Technical
University of Munich and then at the Technical University in
Berlin, where he began his electron optics work and received his
doctorate in 1933.
   He worked for the giant Siemens electronics company from 1937 to
1955, when he became director of electron microscopy at the Fritz
Haber Institute of the Max-Planck Society in West Berlin.
   Ruska is survived by his wife, Irmela.

<HEAD>Senate Leaders Travel To Moscow For INF Summit Ceremony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd headed to
Moscow Monday to urge Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to permit
the printing of up to 100 million Bibles and ``enhance the spirit
of liberty'' in the Soviet Union.
   Byrd and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole were invited by
President Reagan to attend Wednesday's summit ceremony featuring
the exchange of the ratified Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
treaty documents. The Senate approved the treaty by a 93-5 vote
Friday, and the Soviet Presidium ratified it 17 hours later.
   Byrd, D-W.Va., told a news conference before boarding an Air
Force Boeing 707 from the presidential fleet that Reagan's
invitation ``underlines the nature of the American system, a system
which has the separation of powers and a system in which both the
executive and the U.S. Senate work together in the making of
treaties.''
   Byrd said that when he sees Gorbachev he will urge the Soviet
leader to expand on a promise to allow the printing of 100,000
Bibles in the Russian-speaking areas of the Soviet Union.
   ``One-hundred thousand Bibles won't go very for in a country of
280 million people,'' Byrd said.
   ``The importance that I ascribe to this, as the Apostle Paul
said, `Where there is the spirit of the Lord, there is liberty,''
said Byrd. ``So I would think that if we could get Mr. Gorbachev to
enlarge upon this publication of Bibles this would enhance the
spirit of liberty throughout the Soviet Union and where that kind
of liberty is, there has to be human rights.''
   Asked how many Bibles he would like to see printed in the Soviet
Union, Byrd declared, ``If there can be 100 million in the Soviet
Union, they would be worth more than 100 MXs in this country.''
   He was referring to the MX missile, the most powerful,
long-range rocket in the U.S. arsenal.
   Byrd said his and Dole's presence in Moscow will remind the
leaders that ``the Senate is looking over their shoulders as the
superpowers work on new arms control treaties.''
   With the signing of the INF pact, the United States and the
Soviet Union are now negotiating to reduce long-range nuclear
arsenals by up to 50 percent.
   ``We would hope that Mr. Gorbachev and the Soviets, as well as
our own American president, will understand that any new treaty
will undergo a very thorough, painstaking, careful examination
before the Senate would give its approval,'' said Byrd.
   Dole, R-Kan., thanked Reagan for inviting them to Moscow.
   ``I think our trip certainly should be a signal to people in
this country and the Soviet Union that the U.S. Senate is a partner
in the treaty-making process,'' said Dole. ``We do play an
important role.''

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Figure Oliver North Comes to L.A. To Campaign for
Friends</HEAD>

   Oliver North hits town this week to walk
precincts and help raise funds for two Republican congressional
candidates who are old White House buddies and chili-eating chums.
   The former Marine lieutenant colonel who achieved high
visibility during the televised Iran-Contra hearings last summer
will be greeted with a rally at Long Beach Airport on Wednesday.
   He will spend the afternoon walking around Long Beach, knocking
on doors and asking residents to vote for Dana Rohrabacher, said
campaign spokesman Robert Rule. Rohrabacher is one of three
Democrats and four Republicans running for the 42nd district
congressional seat that had been held by Dan Lungren until Gov.
George Deukmejian appointed him state treasurer. That appointment
has been challenged in the Legislature and the matter is pending
before the California Supreme Court.
   North will attend private fund-raisers for Rohrabacher in Los
Angeles and Pasadena in the afternoon, then be the keynote speaker
at a $250-a-person dinner for Rohrabacher in the hangar of the
world's largest airplane, the Spruce Goose. There is a $1,000
reception next door on the Queen Mary, which includes an individual
picture taken with North.
   North will spend Thursday campaigning and attending fund-raisers
for Christopher Cox, a candidate for the open 40th congressional
district seat from Orange County. There are 14 Republicans and two
Democrats in that race.
   North met Cox, 35, when they were both on the White House staff.
North was a foreign affairs specialist and Cox, of Newport Beach,
was senior associate counsel for President Reagan.
   Rohrabacher, 40, of Palos Verdes was a special assistant and
senior speechwriter to Reagan.
   ``Way before all the Iran-Contra jazz, Ollie and Dana were
friends. They have a strong personal relationship and a
professional relationship,'' Rule said.
   ``They're also chili-eating pals. Dana makes the best chili,''
Rule added.
   North retired from the Marine Corps in May after being charged
in a federal indictment with conspiring to defraud the government
by illegally diverting money from Iranian arms sales to Contra
rebels seeking to oust Nicaragua's Marxist government.

<HEAD>Brazilian Painter Alfredo Volpi Dead At 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alfredo Volpi, an abstract painter who
was widely acclaimed in Brazil but never achieved the world fame
that many said he deserved, died of a heart attack, a hospital said
Monday. He was 92.
   The Sao Paulo Heart Disease Emergency Center, where Volpi was
taken after feeling chest pains, said he died on Sunday and was
buried the same day.
   Volpi, best known for his intricate geometrical forms in varying
tones of red, orange, green, blue and yellow, left behind about
3,000 works of art that spanned a career of 70 years.
   Art critic Olivio Tavares de Araujo, one of the country's top
Volpi experts, said international fame eluded the artist because
most of his works are in private Brazilian collections and not
available for public exhibition.
   Araujo said Volpi created his own artistic movement and could be
considered ``in the same league as Picasso.'' The critic added:
``There is no doubt in my mind that in terms of artistic importance
and of overall contribution to the world of art, Volpi is Brazil's
answer to Picasso.''
   Born in Lucca, Italy, in 1896, Volpi was two years old when his
parents immigrated to Sao Paulo, South America's largest city.
   For years he earned a living and developed his artistic talents
by painting flowery decorations on the inner walls of houses in Sao
Paulo.
   Little by little he started painting on canvas _ first
representational landscapes, seascapes, portraits and still lifes.
Gradually he moved to abstract art exploring shapes, color and
light.
   It wasn't until the 1960s that he started creating the
geometrical patterns that made him famous.

<HEAD>Hindu Temple Explosion Kills At Least Three, Sikh Priests Fired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least three people, including a
child, died and 26 were injured Monday in an explosion at a Hindu
temple in the northern city of Amritsar, city police chief Suresh
Arora said.
   ``We are still investigating the cause of the blast, but it was
a big one,'' Arora said.
   Also Monday, the United News of India news agency said Sikh
radicals shot and killed seven people in Punjab state, where
militants among the majority Sikh population have been fighting to
establish a separate homeland. Amritsar is the state capital, 260
miles north of New Delhi.
   Meanwhile, the governing body of the Sikh religion fired all
five high priests on Monday and accused them of betraying the
faith, news reports said.
   Indian security forces lay siege to the Golden Temple, Sikhism's
holiest shrine, beginning May 9 to dislodge heavily armed Sikh
radicals that had holed up inside.
   The siege ended 10 days later when the Indian forces attacked
the temple in Amritsar and drove out the radicals. Forty-six
people, most of them radicals, were killed during the siege.
   The five priests were arrested and imprisoned after they tried
to defy a government curfew on the temple.
   At a meeting in Amritsar, the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak
Committee said Monday it appointed five new priests, Indian news
agencies reported.
   The 160-member governing body was quoted as saying it fired the
priests because they had betrayed the Sikh faith. It did not
elaborate.
   Those fired were Jasbir Singh Rode, the most senior Sikh priest;
Swinder Singh, leader of the Keshgarh Sahib shrine in Punjab;
Kashmir Singh, head priest of the Eternal Throne, which is the
complex housing the Golden Temple; Puran Singh, head priest of the
Golden Temple; and Jaswant Singh, head of the Damdama Sahib shrine,
also in Punjab.
   All five are in prison in Amritsar.
   Akal Takht Harcharan Singh was appointed as new chief priest,
United News of India said. It did not name the other four new
priests.
   Singh is considered a moderate and observers in New Delhi say
his appointment to the highest seat of the Sikh faith is an effort
to isolate the militants.
   The central government has been pressing the Sikh governing body
to promise in writing that it will not allow the Golden Temple to
be used again as a sanctuary by terrorists. But the committee so
far has not responded.
   Sikhism was founded about 500 years ago. It is an offshoot of
Hinduism that incorporates elements of the Moslem religion.
   Sikhs are only 2 percent of India's 800 million people, but they
are a majority in Punjab. They claim discrimination by the Hindus,
who make up 80 percent of the population.
   In June 1984, the Indian army carried out a massive raid to
drive militants from the Golden Temple. More than 1,200 people were
killed.
   Five months later Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated
by two Sikh bodguards in revenge for the raid, setting off
anti-Sikh rioting in which 2,000 people died.

<HEAD>Caller Says Former Presidential Candidate Was Killed By Kidnappers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent newspaper editor who was
kidnapped by four gunmen died Monday from wounds sustained during
his abduction, according a man who identified himself as one of the
gunmen.
   The kidnapping came during a week of violence that left scores
dead and wounded. The army and government officials said 50 people
died during clashes between leftist guerrillas and government
security forces.
   Alvaro Gomez, 69, who twice ran for president, was kidnapped
Sunday as he walked away from a Bogota church where he had attended
Mass. The gunmen killed Gomez's only bodyguard with a hail of
machine gun fire.
   A man told the Bogota radio station Todelar on Monday that Gomez
had died and that authorities would be told soon where to find his
body.
   The man sounded like the same one who called the radio station
twice on Sunday.
   In the first telephone call, an anonymous man said he was one of
the kidnappers, and then the voice of Gomez was heard saying: ``Oh,
Oh, I'm dying.''
   Gomez's wife and daughter said that they recognized Gomez's
voice. They asked the kidnappers to get medical attention for Gomez.
   An announcer at the station said on the air Sunday that the
first phone call must have been a joke. But five minutes later, the
man claiming to be the kidnapper called back and assured the
announced that the next voice he would hear was that of Gomez.
   Someone was heard speakly softly in apparent agony: ``I'm
wounded. Don't put me in the news. I'm wounded. I'm wounded. I've
been shot. Twice.''
   Gomez was editor of the Bogota morning daily El Siglo.
   The phrase ``Don't put me in the news'' is one that Gomez used
frequently with colleagues when he didn't want them to do a story
on him.
   Gomez, the son of former President Laureano Gomez, was the
second ranking official of the Conservative Party after former
President Misael Pastrana.
   Gomez's son, Mauricio Gomez, has been in Madrid for a year after
fleeing Colombia because of a death threat by apparent drug
traffickers.
   In another development, an estimated 6,000 peasants reportedly
refused on Monday to obey army orders to disperse after a clash
between army troops and people who staged a protest march.
   An exchange of gunfire on Sunday between army troops and
marchers left 13 people dead and 40 wounded, Mayor German Obando of
the town of San Vicente said in a broadcast interview with the
Bogota radio station Caracol.
   Nine peasants, an army colonel, a captain and two soldiers were
killed, Obando said. Thirty-four peasants and six soldiers were
wounded, he said.
   Obando said that after the clash the army ordered the farmers to
disperse and go back home, but that so far the peasants were
continuing their march toward the northeastern city of Bucaramanga.
   Leftist guerrillas in the ranks of the peasants had opened fire
on army troops who were trying to talk the peasants into going back
home, Gov. Eduardo Camacho said in a broadcast interview Monday
with the Bogota radio station RCN.
   Camacho is governor of the state of Santander, which includes
San Vicente, a town about 160 miles north of the capital of Bogota.
   The peasants are demanding land reform and government action to
halt right- wing death squads who have killed more than 800 people
in the last three years.

   A rocket from a fireworks display went off
course, slammed into a crowd and exploded, hospitalizing 14 people,
officials said.
   Two of those hospitalized remained in serious condition Monday.
   An undetermined number of other victims were treated for minor
injuries, fire officials said. The Sunday night fireworks display
continued after the accident as rescue crews treated the injured.
   Dayton Fire Chief Glenn Alexander said the rocket misfired and
streaked toward spectators on the Stillwater River banks downtown
where they were viewing a pyrotechnic display during the annual
River Fest. The rocket hit the bank near the river's edge and
veered upward, spraying people with sparks and debris, he said.
   Alexander said the company hired to put on the fireworks
display, San Diego Fireworks, met all the city's safety
requirements, obtained the necessary permit and had obtained a $1
million insurance bond.
   He said the crowd was kept at a distance from the fireworks that
officials considered safe.
   ``It's been this way for several years,'' Alexander said.
   Fire Lt. Barry Holbrook said Monday authorities are
investigating the incident.
   ``It hit right in front of me ... and it threw me over the
levee.'' said Dana Ray, a spectator who was treated for burns at a
local hospital and released. ``All I remember was I was just
sitting there, and suddenly there was major light and heat.''
   Jerry Cline, who was sitting on the levee just a few feet from
the explosion, said the rocket hit and the shell bounced along the
levee and ``sprayed fire'' about 50 yards along the bank.
   Dayton Fireworks Spectacular Inc., a non-profit corporation
formed by Mid-America Federal Savings and Loan Association, WRGT-TV
and WVUD-FM, organized the fireworks show for the river festival.
   Steven Stevens, 34, and James Norbert, 19, were hospitalized in
serious condition Monday. Both suffered burns.
   Six people, including four children, were listed in good
condition Monday at area hospitals, and six others in fair
condition.

   Former Moscow Communist Party chief Boris N.
Yelstin on Monday accused the Kremlin's No. 2 official, Yegor K.
Ligachev, of blocking Soviet political reforms and said he should
quit.
   Yeltsin's criticism of Ligachev in an interview with British
Broadcasting Corp. was an unprecedented case of a fallen Soviet
leader publicly criticizing those who remain in power and publicly
airing sharp high-level differences.
   It shed light on Yeltsin's fall from power that culminated in
his removal Feb. 18 as a candidate, or non-voting, member of the
ruling Communist Party Politburo.
   Yeltsin said Ligachev, the party ideologist, should quit
``because processes in the party are too slow, because the party is
still lagging behind, because the process of democratization in the
party does not develop, because the style and method of work are
behind those processes of perestroika, and Comrade Ligachev is the
main person responsible for this.''
   In a separate interview with CBS News, Yeltsin said Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms still face resistance.
   ``I think that the process is much slower than we expected,
considerably slower, and to overestimate what is happening and to
speak and to say that everything is going according to plan isn't
only an error, this is a dangerous thing to say.''
   It wasn't clear why Yeltsin chose to speak out on the second day
of President Reagan's summit with Gorbachev. Before his downfall,
Yeltsin was more accessible than most top Soviet officials to
Western reporters, and he may have wanted to take advantage of
heavy news coverage during the summit to get maximum exposure for
his remarks.
   He also may have timed his remarks not so much for the summit
but for next month's party conference at which Gorbachev's reforms
will be reviewed.
   Yeltsin, a towering white-haired man of 57, has been an
outspoken supporter of Gorbachev's efforts to restructure Soviet
society, especially of his call for more open criticism and debate
of public issues.
   His statements to the BBC indicated he had not backed down from
the criticisms of the party's policies that led to his removal from
the Moscow city leadership and the Politburo.
   He said he was hurt by Gorbachev's refusal to support him after
he criticized Ligachev at an Oct. 21, 1987 meeting of the
policy-making Central Committee. Yeltsin also said he is unhappy
with his new Cabinet-level job as deputy head of the State
Construction Committee.
   There have been rumors in Moscow for more than a month that
Ligachev and Gorbachev had a falling out as the Communist Party
prepared for an important conference that begins June 28.
   On May 23, the Central Committee adopted a radical program
calling for party bureaucrats to stop interfering in the economy
and government affairs and proposing a limit of two five-year terms
for elected party posts.
   Asked by a BBC interviewer whether it was possible for Ligachev
to stay in the leadership, Yeltsin said: ``That's up to the Central
Committee.''
   Pressed to say whether he believed Ligachev should resign,
Yeltsin replied: ``Yes.''
   Ligachev, 67, has consistently sounded a more conservative theme
on opening up Soviet society in his public statements.
   Yeltsin confirmed reports that had circulated in Moscow that he
criticized Ligachev by name at the Central Committee meeting.
   ``He is one of the _ and I'll say it straight _ he's one of the
opponents when it comes to questions of social justice,'' Yeltsin
said.
   His remarks to the Central Committee never were published, but
Gorbachev bitterly attacked Yeltsin for being overly ambitious in
remarks published in the official press.
   Yeltsin was replaced as Moscow party chief Nov. 11 by Lev N.
Zaikov.
   Asked whether he was upset Gorbachev did not defend him, Yeltsin
responded: ``I'm upset. He feels this, and I told him I'm
dissatisfied with my present job.''
   He was removed from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the
country's highest executive body, on May 24.
   The BBC interview was conducted in Yeltsin's Moscow office and
his remarks were translated into English by a Soviet interpreter.
The Associated Press obtained a copy of Yeltsin's remarks from the
BBC.
   Yeltsin also had granted an interview in May to the
German-language edition of Moscow News, a weekly organ of the
official press, in which he repeated his criticism of the pace of
reform.

<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded in a densely
populated residential district of Christian east Beirut on Monday,
killing 20 people and wounding 78, police said.
   A newspaper in Moslem west Beirut, meanwhile, predicted that
four college teachers _ three Americans and an Indian resident of
the United States _ would soon be freed. The four have been held
hostage since Jan. 24, 1987.
   Police said a blue Volvo rigged with 220 pounds of TNT exploded
on Rmaeil Street in the Ashrafiyeh district at 10:35 a.m. It was
the second car bomb explosion in Lebanon this year.
   No group claimed reponsibility, but police said they feared
Moslem and Christian extremists had begun a new exchange of car
bombings in the sectarian civil war that began 13 years ago.
   Five weeks ago, a car packed with explosives blew up at a
crowded vegetable market in Tripoli, a northern port where Sunni
Moslems predominate, killing 69 people and wounding 111. Officials
in Tripoli blamed Christians.
   In Monday's bombing, police said they were looking for a young
man who witnesses said parked the car outside a shoe shop and
hurried away.
   The explosion left a crater in the street six feet across and
three feet deep.
   It gutted shops and tore the facades off eight apartment
buildings. More than 20 other buildings were badly damaged and at
least 30 cars were demolished.
   Ruptured power cables dangled onto the street. Broken glass
littered the area for 300 yards around. Three bulldozers were
brought in to clear the debris.
   A jeweler walked between pools of blood outside his devastated
shop, picking up pieces of gold bracelets, rings and necklaces.
   ``I'm still alive. That's what counts in a country like ours,''
he said. He would not give his name.
   Zeina Ghobril, a 24-year-old telephone operator whose home was
gutted, said: ``My father died six months ago, leaving us only this
house to live in. Now the house is gone and my mother and I have
nowhere to go.''
   Firefighters battled several fires. Radio stations broadcast
appeals for blood donations.
   The car blew up about 500 yards from a branch office of
President Amin Gemayel's rightist Phalange Party.
   Militiamen of the Phalange and the Lebanese Forces, the main
Christian militia, fired into the air to clear a path for fire
engines and ambulances.
   About 11 hours after the explosion, a second blast was heard
throughout west Beirut's Barbour neighborhood, where Shiite Moslem
militia chieftain and Justice Minister Nabih Berri lives. Police
and Berri's aides said by telephone that a gas bottle exploded in a
house about 300 yards from Berri's residence, causing panic among
area residents but no casualties.
   On Friday and Saturday, Syria sent about 2,400 soldiers into the
Shiite slums of south Beirut, where rival militias had fought a
three-week war for supremacy.
   Police said 296 people were killed and 1,000 wounded in the
battle for south Beirut between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
   South Beirut has been a refuge for years to kidnappers, aircraft
hijackers, assassins and drug smugglers. Most of the 18 foreigners
missing in Lebanon, who include nine Americans, are believed held
there by pro-Iranian groups.
   As-Safir, a leftist daily that generally is restrained and
accurate in its reports on hostages, said the four teachers would
be freed soon. They were kidnapped from the campus of Beirut
University College in west Beirut by gunmen dressed as police
officers.
   In its brief report, the newspaper cited sources close to
Gemayel, the Maronite Catholic president, and linked the predicted
releases to Syrian deployment in the slums. It gave no details.
   The three Americans are Robert Polhill, 54, of New York City;
Jesse Turner, 40, of Boise, Idaho, and Alann Steen, 49, of Boston.
The Indian is Mithileshwar Singh, 60, a resident alien of the
United States.
   Most foreign hostages are believed held by extremist factions
linked to the Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed responsibily for kidnapping the teachers. Several
newspapers have linked it to Islamic Jihad, which holds at least
two other Americans.
   The Americans known to be held by Islamic Jihad are Terry A.
Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, and Thomas Sutherland, 55, acting dean of agriculture at the
American University of Beirut.
   Anderson, kidnapped March 16, 1985, is the foreign hostage held
longest. Syria is Lebanon's main power broker.

   President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev edged
forward on arms issues Monday in a summit session that was eclipsed
by Reagan's meeting with dissidents and his challenge that the
Soviet leader usher in ``a new age of religious freedom.''
   ``It's time my friend, it's time,'' the president implored the
general secretary, quoting the pre-revolutionary Russian poet
Alexander Pushkin as he sounded the human rights theme on the
second day of his five-day visit.
   In an extraordinary meeting with several dozen dissidents and
refuseniks and members of their families arrayed before him at the
U.S. ambassador's residence, Reagan said: ``I came here hoping to
do what I could to give you strength.''
   ``But I already know it is you who have strengthened me. You
have given me a message to carry back: While we press for human
rights through diplomatic channels, you press with your very lives,
day in, day out, year after year, risking your jobs, your homes,
your all.''
   He said the United States ``views human rights as fundamental,
absolutely fundamental, to our relations with the Soviet Union and
all nations.''
   The symbolism of Reagan's meetings spoke volumes. That he was
stepping into domestic matters on Soviet soil had rankled Gorbachev
aides before and after the events, and the general secretary
referred to it as he toasted Reagan at a state dinner.
   Gorbachev called for closer contacts with Americans but said
``this should be done without interfering in domestic affairs,
without sermonizing or imposing one's views and ways, without
turning family or personal problems into a pretext for
confrontation between states.''
   Reagan told Gorbachev that he will tell the man who the American
people elect this fall to succeed him that the search for common
ground must continue.
   ``Based on the achievements of the last few years, I will also
tell him it is a search that can succeed,'' the president said.
   Gorbachev said the two leaders' main task is finding a way to
reduce strategic nuclear weapons by 50 percent and noted the
``tremendous importance'' of the recent agreement under which the
superpowers will police the agreement for a Soviet pull out from
Afghanistan.
   ``The whole world is watching,'' he said.
   The summit session Monday focused on arms issues, and spokesmen
said the leaders were likely to sign agreements on two secondary
pacts and were making progress on a far more significant strategic
arms accord.
   No one was predicting a breakthrough to conclude the so-called
START negotiations, but there was movement in two of the most
stubborn areas _ involving mobile missiles and cruise missiles
launched from warplanes. However, the president's Strategic Defense
Initiative was still under Soviet challenge and the United States
refused to permit Soviet inspection of U.S. ships armed with cruise
missiles.
   The arms discussions preceded the president's two human rights
events.
   Even before the first event _ Reagan's visit to the Danliov
monastery _ Gorbachev indicated his disagreement with Reagan's
appraisal of Soviet deficiencies. ``Both sides don't have a very
good idea of what the real situation in the Soviet Union and the
United States (is),'' he said. Asked about the list of 14 cases
turned over by Reagan at their first session on Sunday, the Soviet
leader remarked, ``there are too many lists.''
   Before the dissidents, the president praised the recent surge in
Jewish emigration and the release of 300 political prisoners in the
three years since Gorbachev took the Kremlin helm.
   Afterward, Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, described
the dissidents sourly as ``not the best of the Soviet people,
rather the contrary.''
   In the past, Gorbachev and other Soviet officials have
registered irritation with American leaders lecturing them about
internal practices. But Reagan, clearly aware his words would ring
around the world, committed the United States to the freedom
movement here.
   ``It is our belief that this is a moment of hope,'' he said.
   Gerasimov did not belabor the human rights issue. His briefing
on the day's activities centered in large part on hopeful
developments in arms discussions. He said the leaders likely would
would execute two arms control agreements.
   Neither approaches in importance the treaty to reduce long-range
nuclear weapons that continued to elude U.S. and Soviet negotiators
meeting in working groups off-stage. But both are in the
``confidence-building'' category, and had been declared
unattainable by Reagan administration officials only two days
earlier.
   One agreement provides for prior notification of missile tests.
The other establishes the procedures for joint experiments with
monitoring equipment at the U.S. and Soviet nuclear test sites in
Nevada and at Semipalatinsk.
   A senior U.S. official said the two pacts would be signed
Tuesday along with a new cultural agreement if they were completed
by then.
   Also, Gerasimov reported ``certain progress'' on monitoring
cruise missiles carried by warplanes and said ``a compromise is
possible.'' At the same time, the Soviet official said the two
sides had decided mobile missiles could be stored in designated
areas in order to keep track of the elusive weapons.
   These are two of the main obstacles to a treaty to reduce
strategic nuclear weapons arsenals by 30 to 50 percent.
   However, Gerasimov said there was no agreement on monitoring
warships packed with cruise missiles. He blamed the United States,
saying it wanted to protect a temporary edge.
   ``We think this is not a serious approach at all,'' he said.
   In a late-night briefing, a U.S. official who would not be
identified by name agreed there was headway between Reagan and
Gorbachev on air-launched cruise missiles, but he said ``it is
still an outstanding issue.''
   On the mobile missiles, the U.S. official disagreed with
Gerasimov`s upbeat report. ``We haven`t heard a verification scheme
that, we think, will work,'' he said. ``...That is an area of
significant difference between us.''
   On sea-launched cruises, the U.S. official responded that ``we
have yet to see a verification regime which has been applied to
submarines that we think is desirable.''
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater pointed out
there was ``significant disagreement'' on the size of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact ground forces in
Europe.

   After his 1 hour and 45 minute meeting in the Kremlin with
Gorbachev, the president visited the Danliov monastery on the edge
of Moscow where he was greeted by bearded monks and the rare
pealing of Russian church bells.
   There he quoted Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the exiled Soviet writer
and ardent Christian who has not relented in criticizing the
Communist system from sanctuary in America.
   ``Men must abandon trivial concerns of this world and give time
and tought to eternity,'' Reagan read.
   At his Spaso meeting with the dissidents, three guests made
brief speeches in which they mixed praise for Gorbachev's reforms
with concern over the pace of reform.
   ``At present, despite democratization, our lot has not
improved,'' said Yuli Kosharovsky, a Jewish refusenik who has
sought permission to emigrate for 17 years.
   Father Gleb Yakunin, a Russian Orthodox priest who had been
sentenced to a labor camp and internal exile, lamented the
``attempt to convert our state to a country of total atheism.''
   ``The rebirth of our native land along the restructuring that
has already begun is unthinkable without true freedom of
religion,'' he said.
   Sergei Kovalev lost his job at the University of Moscow in 1969,
when he protested the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He was
sentenced to a labor camp and his internal exile for his work on a
publication that reported human rights abuses.
   He said dissidents are greeting with optimism the reforms being
sought by Gorbachev but that ``the course of changes is uncertain
and our hopes are shaky. The current, unstable situation could at
any time be turned around.''
   At Andrews Air Force Base, Md., near Washington Monday
afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd and Minority Leader
Bob Dole boarded a plane for Moscow. Byrd said their presence will
remind the leaders that ``the Senate is looking over their
shoulders as the superpowers work on new arms control treaties.''
   The West Virginian also said he would urge Gorbachev to permit
the printing of up to 100 million Bibles in the Soviet Union
instead of the 100,000 Gorbachev has agreed to. ``One-hundreds
thousand Bibles won't go very for in a country of 280 million
people,'' Byrd said.

<HEAD>Religious Leaders Meet To Consider Anti-Apartheid Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 religious leaders
from across South Africa met in emergency session Monday to
consider new non-violent strategies against apartheid, including
civil disobedience.
   The two-day convocation, first of its kind, is to end Tuesday
with a ``service of witness and solidarity'' at the main Roman
Catholic Church in Soweto, Johannesburg's largest black township.
Desmond Tutu, the black Anglican archbishop who won the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize, is scheduled to preach.
   Organizers of the meeting said Soweto officials refused to let
the service be held at an outdoor amphitheater.
   Workshops were planned on a range of anti-apartheid tactics,
including ``non-cooperation and non-collaboration'' with the
government. The agenda suggested targets of civil disobedience
targets could include tax payments, military service and racially
oriented laws such as those mandating segregated residential areas.
   The convocation is sponsored by the South African Council of
Churches, which includes major Protestant denominations active in
the fight for black rights; the Roman Catholic Church, and several
independent African churches.
   In the opening speech the Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary-general
of the church council, said the clergy needs to find effective
alternatives to anti-apartheid violence.
   ``The issue now is how can we go about ending this evil and
unjust system,'' he said. ``The intransigence and violence of the
apartheid regime has created a pastoral crisis for the churches in
South Africa, as more and more victims of this system have resorted
to the use of force.''
   Chikane said political conditions have ``worsened drastically''
since leading clergymen decided in early February to organize the
convocation.
   He cited the effective bannings of 17 anti-apartheid
organizations, closure of two opposition newspapers and pending
legislation to restrict labor unions and opposition political
groups.
   Topics to be discussed at the convocation included providing
pastoral care for victims of apartheid and developing ``strategies
of direct action'' to force the government to negotiate an end to
apartheid.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. South Africa's 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Chikane said convocation participants should develop a separate
program to increase international pressure, urging foreign
countries to ``withdraw their support of the apartheid system
militarily, culturally, politically and economically.''
   Tutu, Chikane and other clergymen have been confronting the
government since late February, when they pledged to carry on the
work of anti-apartheid organizations that were banned.
   President P.W. Botha says some church leaders appear to be
promoting violent revolution. They accuse Botha of trying to stifle
opposition to apartheid.

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister K.C. Pant of India
conferred with two Sri Lankan Cabinet ministers on Monday about
plans to withdraw the more than 50,000 Indian troops now assigned
to this Indian Ocean island nation.
   Pant told the ministers that withdrawal should depend on the
state of the Tamil guerrilla separatist campaign, said Indian
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In turn, the Sri Lankans told Pant the Indian troops should take
stronger steps to crush the Tamil insurrection in the north and
east of the island.
   ``It is a complex issue, we are going to discuss more on
Tuesday,'' one of the sources said.
   Pant arrived in Colombo Monday on a three-day visit and met Land
Minister Gamini Dissanayake and National Security Minister Lalith
Athulathmudali. He is to meet President Junius R. Jayewardene on
Tuesday.
   Indian troops have been deployed in Sri Lanka under an
India-sponsored peace plan signed in July 1987 aimed at ending the
five-year Tamil separatist war. Tamil rebels rejected the plan last
fall and the soldiers moved in to disarm them.
   India sponsored the plan partly because of the sympathies of its
own 60 million Tamils for the rebel cause.
   Tamils constitute 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
The majority Buddhist Sinhalese community controls the military and
the government and the rebels claim the Tamils suffer
discrimination.
   In another development Monday, a pro-Sinhalese extremist group
opposed to the peace plan announced it would observe a two-day
truce beginning Monday because of a festival celebrating the birth
and enlightenment of Lord Buddha.
   The People's Liberation Front, which says the peace accord
grants too many concessions to the Tamils, has been blamed for at
least 300 killings in the past 10 months.
   Two Tamil rebels were killed Monday when they tried to throw
hand grenades at an Indian patrol near Uddupiddy village northeast
of Jaffna, about 185 miles northeast of Colombo, Sri Lankan
military forces said.
   In fighting at a Hindu temple in Kalmunai district south of
Batticaloa, about 145 miles east of Colombo, one Tamil rebel and
two Tamil civilians were killed, residents in the area told The
Associated Press by telephone.

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on
Monday halted a Georgia school bond election scheduled Tuesday,
granting an injunction sought by five black voters who argued that
the election might violate the Voting Rights Act.
   Kennedy's ruling affects an election which had been scheduled
for Bibb County, where voters were being asked to approve bonds to
pay for air conditioners at the high schools and to construct a new
high school.
   The election had originally been set for the ballot on March 8,
or Super Tuesday, but the county school board decided in January to
change the balloting date to May 31.
   The five black voters sued, arguing the March 8 date was changed
because of a desire by the school board to avoid a date when black
turnout was expected to be high. Jesse Jackson was the winner of
the Georgia Democratic presidential primary.
   The five also said the election had not been pre-cleared with
the Justice Department, which oversees enforcement of the Voting
Rights Act.
   Last Friday, a three-judge appeals refused the voters' request
for an injunction to block the election, and they appealed to
Kennedy.
   In his five-page order, Kennedy noted that county officials
hadn't met requirements of the Voting Rights Act and said he
delayed the election because ``irreparable harm likely would flow
from a denial of injunctive relief.''
   ``Permitting the election to go forward would place the burdens
of interia and litigation delay on those whom the (Voting Rights)
statute was intended to protect, despite their obvious diligence in
seeking an ajudication of their rights prior to the election.''
   Kennedy's order delayed the election until the case can be heard
by the full Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Chief Rabbis Forbid Seating of Women on Religious Councils</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's two chief rabbis said Monday that the
Supreme Court meddled in religious affairs by ordering a woman
seated on a religious council and declared that any man who agreed
to sit with her was a weakling.
   The decision by Rabbis Avraham Shapira and Mordechai Eliyahu
pitted the secular law of the Jewish state against religious law,
or Halacha, which many Orthodox Jews believe is the higher.
   Two weeks ago the Supreme Court gave the religious affairs
minister, Zevulun Hammer, 30 days to seat Leah Shakdiel on the
religious council of Yeruham, a town of 6,000 people 90 miles south
of Jerusalem.
   Council members from the center-left Labor Party appointed Mrs.
Shakdiel in March 1986.
   Local religious leaders supported by the chief rabbis refused to
seat her. They claimed religious law banned women from sitting on
the council, which deals with such local religious affairs as
appointment of rabbis and construction of synagogues and ritual
baths.
   The Supreme Court ruled the actions illegal.
   Shapira, who leads Israel's Ashkenazi (European) Jews, on Monday
accused the court of interfering with rabbinical autonomy and
ordered men on the Yeruhan council not to sit with Mrs. Shakdiel.
   ``Men who sit with women are weaklings,'' he said on Israel
radio. ``They don't care about modesty.''
   Israel radio quoted Hammer as saying he would honor the court
decision and appoint Mrs. Shakdiel to the council. It also quoted
the minister as saying, however, that he would draft a law
establishing women's committees to serve alongside the all-male
religious councils.
   ``I see a possibility which preserves the Halacha and at the
same time gives women the chance to make their contribution right
away,'' Hammer said.
   The Supreme Court also overruled the rabbis last week by
ordering the Tel Aviv city government to appoint two women to the
elective body that will choose the city's next chief Ashkenazi
rabbi.
   According the rabbis, the Halacha prohibits women from electing
rabbis. Eliyahu leads Israel's Sephardic Jews.

<TEXT>
   A Moscow dissident said hundreds of thousands of
Armenians held a street rally on Monday in the capital of their
Caucasus republic to renew territorial demands that form the core
of an ethnic dispute.
   Sergei Grigoryants, a journalist, said a protest by about
300,000 people occurred outside the Opera Theater, on a square in
Yerevan where huge demonstrations were held in February.
Grigoryants is half Russian and half Armenian.
   Armenian protesters want Nagorno-Karabakh put under Armenian
jurisdiction. Most of the people in Nagorno-Karabakh, which was
assigned to the neighboring southern republic of Azerbaijan in
1923, are ethnic Armenians.
   Grigoryants said police had detained two friends of Paruyr
Ayrikyan, an Armenian nationalist arrested in March. He said Mofses
Gorgisyan and Nehak Gabrilyan were accused of organizing a protest
May 26, were held for 10 hours and fined 50 rubles each.
   They are members of Ayrikyan's Armenian nationalist group,
called the Alliance for National Self-Determination, the journalist
said.
   The last demonstration reported in Yerevan was Saturday, when
about 50,000 people were said to have demanded Ayrikyan's release
and that May 28 be made a holiday. The Armenian Republic was
proclaimed May 28, 1918 before becoming part of the Soviet Union.
   Ayrikyan, 38, emerged as a leading spokesman for activists soon
after Armenians began demonstrating Feb. 13 for annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh. He is charged with spreading false information to
discredit the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Investigators Complete Study of Ambrosiano Bank Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The results of a six-year investigation of
Italy's biggest banking scandal were delivered Monday to Pier Luigi
Dell'Osso, the prosecutor who must decide who will stand trial,
court sources said Monday.
   They said his decision is expected by the end of the year in the
case arising from the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.
   Renato Bricchetti and Antonio Pizzi, the investigating
magistrates, have accused about 50 people of being accessories to
fradulent bankruptcy, a crime bearing a maximum penalty of 15 years
in prison.
   Those charged originally included Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus,
an American from Cicero, Ill., and two other senior officials of
the Vatican bank, which had a major stake in Banco Ambrosiano.
   A court ruled recently, however, that Marcinkus, Luigi Mennini
and Pellegrino De Strobel cannot be tried by Italian courts. The
Constitutional Court, Italy's highest, has yet to rule on the
matter.
   When Ambrosiano collapsed in 1982, Marcinkus headed the
Institute for Religious Works, the Vatican bank's formal title.
   Investigators say Banco Ambrosiano, which was Italy's largest
private bank, failed because a $1.3-billion loan made to 10 Latin
American dummy companies controlled by the Vatican bank was not
repaid.
   Others named in the investigation included Licio Gelli, the
Italian financier who led an outlawed Masonic lodge; his aide
Umberto Ortolani; Italian financier Anna Bonomi Bolchini, and 25
Ambrosiano board members and officials.
   Gelli was a close friend of Roberto Calvi, the secretive
chairman of Banco Ambrosiano who was found hanging from a London
bridge in June 1982, two months before the bankruptcy.

   A high Communist Party official
predicts more party and government officials will be replaced and
said pressure was applied to avoid the sweeping personnel changes
adopted at this month's party congress.
   Premier Karoly Grosz replaced Janos Kadar as party chief, about
a third of the Central Committee membership was replaced and eight
veterans on the 11-member ruling Politburo gave way to newcomers.
   ``Further personnel changes are inevitable,'' Janos Lukacs, a
Politburo member and Central Committee secretary, said in a
television interview Sunday.
   He also said there were a lot of ``hard feelings'' on the part
of those not nominated for election and others not reappointed.
   Lukacs said that before the party congress, pressures were
exerted on practically all members of the nominating committee he
headed to put certain names on the list for the policy-making
Central Committtee.
   The committee resisted the interventions in drafting a list of
113 possible Central Committee members, he said.
   Five nominees did not get the necessary majority in a secret
vote, he said. The Central Committee membership was increased from
106 to 108.
   Parliament will convene June 29 to choose a minister of state to
assist Grosz, 57.
   It is believed Parliament also may decide on other personnel
matters not affecting the party.

<HEAD>Unloading of Toxic Waste Delayed After Port Workers Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENOA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Port workers went on strike Monday to
protest fumes from a freighter carrying 12,000 drums of toxic
chemical waste, delaying the unloading of the vessel that's been
dubbed the ``ship of poison.''
   Officials said the Syrian freighter Zanoobia would not be
unloaded until the chemicals are analyzed and damaged containers
repacked, which could take several weeks.
   Four crewmen were treated for nausea and stomach pains, possibly
caused by months of exposure to the toxic cargo. Three of the
crewmen were released and the fourth was admitted for observation,
doctors at San Martino Hospital said.
   The 2,200 tons of toxic chemical waste, produced in Italy, have
roamed the seas for 15 months in search of a port that would
dispose of them. Djibouti, Venezuela, Syria and Greece refused.
   The Zanoobia, third ship to carry the chemicals, docked in Genoa
on Sunday after officials agreed to accept and burn the cargo.
   Lawyers for the ship's owner, Tabalo Shipping, say two people
have died: a boy in Venezuela and a Zanoobia crewman.
   On Monday, the vessel was moved to an isolated dock after
hundreds of port workers walked off their jobs to protest the
smell. Unions said the protest prevented seven other freighters
from unloading.
   Ahmed Tabalo, captain of the Zanoobia, said some drums of
chemical waste, which has not been identified, are damaged and may
be leaking. Five crewmen were hospitalized earlier this month.
   ``The condition of my crew is very bad,'' Tabalo said after
docking in Genoa. ``For three months we have not entered a port.
Now we are all nauseous and sick to the stomach.''
   His ship had been moored off Carrara in northern Italy since
April 26 seeking permission to unload the cargo, which was shipped
from that port in February 1987.
   Francesco Rizzuto, a lawyer for Tabalo Shipping, said a group of
Italian chemical companies paid the Milan-based company Jelly Wax
about 36 cents a pound to dispose of the waste but the company
shipped it out of the country instead.
   It went first to Djibouti in East Africa, which rejected it. The
cargo was unloaded in Venezuela but ordered shipped out when the
boy died, reportedly after playing near an opened drum, a lawyer
for the shipping company said.
   After that, the cargo went to Syria and Greece.
   A Zanoobia crewman died during the trip from Greece to Carrara.
Lawyers for Tabalo Shipping have asked Italian prosecutors to file
charges against Jelly Wax if the death is shown to have resulted
from contamination.
   Officials said the waste will be burned at a Genoa incinerator
at a cost of between 72 cents and $1.86 a pound.

<DATELINE>COLMA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union members struck 17 cemeteries in the
San Francisco Bay area Monday, and a management spokesman said
burials at the affected cemeteries could be postponed until the
dispute is settled.
   In 1985, more than 800 bodies went unburied until a long strike
was settled.
   ``Our park has pickets out front, and our people are honoring
that,'' said Bruce Green, weekend manager of Woodlawn Memorial Park
in Colma. ``But they're not trying to stop'' Memorial Day visitors.
   The union representing 150 employees went on strike to protest
the use of non-union workers, said Carolyn Del Gaudio, business
agent for Cemetery Workers and Greens Attendants Union Local 265.
   Talks between the union and two cemetery owners' associations
broke off Saturday, said John Cantwell, representing the
associations. No new talks were scheduled, he said.
   ``The burials will simply have to be postponed,'' Cantwell said.
   The union's three-year contract with Associated Cemeteries and
the East Bay Interment Properties Association expired March 1.
   Two leading issues in the dispute are cemetery owners' use of
non-union subcontractors to do work ordinarily handled by full-time
workers and the rising cost of health insurance, Del Gaudio said.
   But Cantwell called subcontracting a ``sham issue.'' Cemeteries
have always used subcontractors, and the owners' proposal says no
workers will be laid off because of subcontracting, he said.
   The employers also are offering to pay the same amount for
employee health insurance as under the previous contract, Cantwell
said.
   Cemetery workers currently receive $14.35 an hour after 18
months, Cantwell said. Under the employers' proposal, employees
would receive raises of 30 cents an hour for each year of a
three-year contract, he said.
   It is the fifth cemetery walkout in the bay area since 1971.

<TEXT>
   President Tito's widow has taken her
dispute with the government over inheritance rights to the
Communist Party conference being held in Belgrade, the official
press reported Monday.
   Jovanka Broz presented her petition to the conference when it
began Sunday, the daily Vecernje Novosti said. It did not give
details of her complaint.
   Mrs. Broz has lived in virtual seclusion since her husband,
whose real name was Josip Broz, died in 1980 after ruling
Yugoslavia for 35 years.
   In a letter circulated among Belgrade intellectuals two years
ago, Mrs. Broz said she was evicted from Tito's residence in an
exclusive Belgrade suburb soon after his death and allowed to take
only personal effects.
   She filed suit in 1985 to seeking part of Tito's estate, mostly
paintings, furs, jewelry and furniture, but the government said the
goods were state property.
   Mrs. Broz lodged a similar complaint with the 13th Communist
Party Congress in June 1986 but was escorted away from the hall.
   Monday's reports said two party officials had ``a brief
discussion'' with her after she submitted the petition and promised
her the conference would consider the matter.

to death and then left his 13-year-old son at a relative's house
before driving to a country club and killing himself with a shot in
the head, police said Monday.
   Police Chief James McFadden said Frank Cherry, 43, of Quakertown
repeatedly shot his ex-wife, Barbara, 39, and her boyfriend, Ray
Morrissette Jr., 38, of Warminster, at Mrs. Cherry's home in
Quakertown on Sunday evening.
   The Cherrys' divorce was final in March, according to McFadden.
   The police chief said Cherry had visitation custody Sunday of
the couple's son, Michael, 13, and daughter, Jamie, 10.
   Cherry left his daughter at a friend's house but had his son
with him waiting in a car when he broke into his ex-wife's house,
McFadden said.
   Eleven shots were fired in the house and the victims both died
at the scene of multiple wounds, he said.
   Cherry left the boy with Mrs. Cherry's sister then shot himself
in the head while sitting in his car in a country club parking lot,
McFadden said.

   The Soviets agreed to let George Rodrigue hang his
paintings of Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday, but
the artist says they won't be there for long.
   ``I'm going to take them off the frames and roll them up,''
Rodrique said. ``I'm leaving on Wednesday and I am taking them back
home.''
   Rodrigue, of Lafayette, La., still doesn't know why Soviet
officials ordered the paintings taken down in the first place
Friday, two days after they were placed in a restaurant at the
Moscow international trade center where the press is working.
   But David Young, Rodrigue's press agent from Donaldsonville,
La., said the Soviets apparently thought the oil painting of Reagan
_ dressed in Western-style clothing and mounted atop a white horse
_ was embarrassing to the president.
   The Gorbachev painting shows him carrying a banner in his right
hand with his left hand extended palm up.
   Young said he met with Sergey B. Volokhov, a Soviet official
from the trade center to explain that Reagan had seen the painting
last year and seemed to like it. Volokhov did not answer his
telephone Monday evening.
   The Soviets also apparently got the OK to place the picture of
Gorbachev on the wall, he said.
   ``They checked with their people, and we told them it was
alright, so they agreed to put the pictures up,'' he said. ``It all
worked out.''
   The paintings are in a restaurant that is being run during the
summit by John Folse, a chef from Louisiana and a friend of
Rodrigue's. Folse's Cajun food was flown in for the summit, but the
Soviets are in charge of setting the prices, including a $16 cover
charge.

<HEAD>Money, Legal Woes In Wake Of Aerospace Exposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers of an aerospace exposition are
having trouble paying bills and face a suit by a company that
helped prepare the grounds.
   Air-Space America Inc., the non-profit group that organized the
combination exposition and trade show, bounced checks last week
meant to pay companies for goods and services provided during the
10-day show earlier this month at Brown Field. The group's
president, Bill Walsh, acknowledged that a mistake had been made
but said the financial problems should be resolved soon.
   Meanwhile, a chemical company that treated about 10 acres at the
field for the exposition filed suit last week, charging Air-Space
America with breach of contract. Evergreen Chemical Products is
seeking $1 million, plus other damages and legal costs.
   Air-Space America is contesting Evergreen's allegations that it
failed to meet the payment schedule.
   Walsh told The Tribune of San Diego that checks ranging from
about $700 to several thousand dollars have bounced in recent days.
He said he can't specify the value or number of bounced checks
because the organization's records weren't immediately available.
   The organization wrote the checks knowing Air-Space America
accounts lacked the necessary funds, he said, but had hoped that an
estimated $400,000 from ticket-selling outlets would arrive in time
to cover them.
   ``Unfortunately, we didn't quite make it. ... We screwed up,''
Walsh said.
   He said the ticket agencies have been urged to hurry and send
the money in.
   Air-Space America has released no exact attendance figures.
Promoters projected a total attendance of 500,000, but estimates
indicate that about 250,000 attended the exposition.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary Says Third World Debt Economic, Not Political
Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAKAR, Senegal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said
Monday that the Third World debt must be treated as a economic
rather than a political problem and that each country's case should
be handled individually.
   ``The debt question cannot be regulated in a global manner,''
Baker told reporters after meeting with President Abdou Diouf.
``Debt structures are not the same from one country to another.''
   Baker said a solution to the debt problem would be found with
international cooperation. He pointed to Senegal as a country that
achieved a certain level of credibility through its economic
development and recent successes in controling its budget deficit.
   He said this was reason for the United States to continue its
support for Senegal's economic development efforts.
   The treasury secretary will leave on Tuesday for the Ivory
Coast, where he was expected to make a major address on the Third
World debt problem to the board of the African Development Bank.
   Baker praised Senegal's multiparty political system. He said
Senegal passed an important test in February elections, which
returned Diouf to a second term and kept the governing Socialist
Party's majority in the National Assembly.
   Opponents accused Diouf's party of rigging the elections. The
government imposed a state of emergency on the Dakar region after
three days of rioting. The emergency was lifted May 17.
   Abdoulaye Wade, leader of the opposition Senegalese Democratic
Party, was stripped of his assembly seat and given a one-year
suspended prison sentence after he was convicted of inciting
violence and endangering state security. Wade opposed Diouf in the
presidential elections and claimed victory.
   Diouf's Cabinet approved an amnesty that would enable Wade to
regain his assembly seat. Final approval must come from the
National Assembly.

   A city official demanded Monday
that authorities check an environmental institute's report that
four nuclear power plants near Hamburg have serious flaws in their
safety systems.
   ``The results of this study are highly alarming for Hamburg,''
said Joerg Kuhbier, the city energy minister. ``If there were a
meltdown tomorrow, we would have a catastrophe.''
   A Darmstadt environmental research center named the Eco
Institute released a report recently that said four nuclear power
plants in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein had safety defects
that endangered Hamburg.
   Kuhbier demanded that federal, Lower Saxony and
Schleswig-Holstein state authorities determine whether the report
was valid.
   The federal Environment Ministry said later Monday it would
examine the Eco report, but ministry spokeswoman Marlene Muehe said
the plant safety systems were checked earlier this year and found
to be satisfactory.

   Officials of the seismological laboratory at the Department of
Geology said the tremor measured 4.6 on the Richter scale. They
said it was centered in the vicinity of Tulsipur, about 190 miles
west of Katmandu, in Dang district.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measureed by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage,
while one of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.

   A vintage Royal Air Force jet fighter
crashed during a holiday air show Monday and the pilot was killed.
   The twin-engine Meteor T-7 plunged into a field three miles from
Coventry Airport while making a descending turn in preparation for
a fly-past, airport manager John Reeve said.
   The 10,000 spectators attending the Warwickshire Air Pageant on
the British bank holiday could not see the plane when it crashed,
showering debris on homes and gardens in the area, said a member of
the control tower staff.
   ``It dipped out of sight behind some hangars and when it didn't
reappear we realized something was wrong and the alarm was
raised,'' said the staff member, who was not identified in
accordance with British practice.
   ``Perhaps it pulled a bit too much and the pilot blacked out,''
Reeve said. ``It went in at substantial impact and smashed into
thousands of pieces.''
   Airport officials said the plane was stationed at an RAF base in
Scampton, Lincolnshire.
   A base spokesman refused to identify the pilot because the
family had not been notified.
   The Meteor, the first RAF jet fighter, went into service in 1943
and remained in service until the early 1960s, undergoing several
design changes.

   Richard Wedge Morin, a former State
Department official and later Dartmouth College's librarian, has
died at age 85, school officials said Monday.
   The Norwich, Vt., resident died Sunday at Mary Hitchcock
Memorial Hospital in Hanover. Morin, a native of Albert Lea, Minn.,
graduated from Dartmouth in 1924 and earned his law degree from
Harvard in 1928.
   He became the United States' vice consul in Paris from 1929 to
1933, and served for two years with the State Department's Western
European Division in Washington.
   In 1935 he established a law practice in Minnesota, but in 1942
he returned to the State Department to help set up the Offices of
Public Information and Public Affairs. He was the first chief of
the Division of Public Liaison and then deputy director of the
Office of Public Affairs, which coordinated the department's
international cultural and information work.
   Morin served as the U.S. delegation's deputy public liaison
officer at the San Francisco conference at which the United Nations
was established.
   In 1948 he became Dartmouth's executive officer under
then-president John Sloane Dickey. He chaired Dartmouth College
publications, and in 1950 became Dartmouth's librarian, a position
he held for 18 years. Morin was president and vice president of the
New England Library Association.
   Morin is survived by his wife, Pauline, and three daughters. A
memorial service will be held Saturday at Dartmouth's Rollin Chapel.

   A single-engine plane plunged into a back
yard where a family was gathered for a barbecue, killing the pilot
and three people on the ground. Four others on the ground were
injured.
   The impact of the high-speed crash Sunday sent gasoline and oil
boiling out of the ruptured tanks, and two-story-high flames
engulfed the yard and even covered parts of the surface of the
family's swimming pool.
   The dead included Jennifer Lynn Pedersen, 10, who lived with her
parents at the house; and Jim Padgett, 39, and Kristine L. Sutter,
38, two Phoenix residents who were visiting the Pedersen family,
Sgt. Andy Anderson, police spokesman, said Monday.
   Anderson said the pilot tentatively was identified as Bonnie
Ravenscroft, 25, Mesa.
   Authorities said the single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza crashed
shortly after taking off from Phoenix's main airport about 5:40
p.m. after dropping off two passengers. The crash site was about 3{
miles from the airport.
   ``It was a nose-down, wings-level impact,'' said Don Llorente, a
National Transportation Safety Board investigator at the scene
Monday.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately determined, but
initial indications were that it was not due to engine problems,
Llorente said.
   ``We found both propeller blades and they exhibited damage
consistent with high power,'' he said.
   ``There was no indication of a problem'' while the pilot was in
contact with air controllers, Llorene said.
   The engine sounded like it was at ``takeoff speed,'' said David
Terrace, an aviation buff who lives nearby.
   ``I saw it go down behind trees ... I didn't hear the impact,
but then I saw the smoke right away,'' Terrace said. ``The last I
saw it, the plane was going in at about a 45-degree angle.''
   Lee Daly, a private pilot, said it appeared the pilot descended
at full throttle, causing a wall of flames at least two stories
high.
   ``It just flew down. It wasn't gliding at all,'' he said.
   The injured were David Pedersen, 38, and his wife, Susan, 30,
Jennifer Lynn's parents; Amy Doerschlag, 9; and John Bass, a
neighbor in his mid-30s who rushed to the home after the crash.
   The Pedersens and Amy were listed in fair condition at Phoenix
hospitals, while Bass was treated for smoke inhalation at another
hospital and then released.
   Amy was a weekend house guest of the Pedersens while her parents
attended a funeral in California, Anderson said.
   Collin DeWitt, a Fire Department spokesman, said gasoline and
oil boiled out of the ruptured tanks, and flames covered part of
the Pedersen's swimming pool surface for a time.
   ``There is a tremendous amount of debris in the back. There
isn't a section of the airplane that is more than 3-feet square,''
DeWitt said.
   John Baca, 23, who lives across the street, said his house shook
with the explosion.
   ``By the time we got from the kitchen to the living room and
looked out the front window, their whole back yard was in flames,''
he said.
   ``I didn't even know it was an airplane crash. I thought an
acetylene tank or something, a car or something, had blown up,''
Baca added.
   DeWitt said the crash, reported at 5:41 p.m., triggered a
two-alarm fire that firefighters put out about two hours later.

<HEAD>Larry Speakes Defends Nancy Reagan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House spokesman Larry
Speakes defended Nancy Reagan on Monday against criticism that she
wields too much power, but he did not try to excuse his own action
in inventing quotations he attributed to the president.
   Speakes was promoting his recently published book, ``Speaking
Out,'' at the American Booksellers Association convention, which
ends Tuesday.
   ``I think everything Nancy does comes from her concern as a wife
to see that her husband's health is protected and that he is a
success,'' Speakes said during a news conference.
   As for allegations in a book by Donald T. Regan, Reagan's former
chief of staff, that Mrs. Reagan used an astrologer to help guide
and influence her husband, Speakes said: ``I didn't know anything
about that. I guess it was a state secret he kept for his own
book.''
   Of his own invention of quotations during the 1985 arms control
summit, Speakes said, ``I do agree it was wrong.'' But, he added,
he doesn't think it was an unusal move for a press secretary.
   ``Maybe I've blown the whistle on a longtime White House
institution,'' he said.
   Speakes was among a number of celebrities including former first
lady Lady Bird Johnson, newsman David Brinkley, and cartoonist
Charles Schulz who were on hand Monday to promote new books.
   But the main focus of the convention was the trade show at the
Anaheim Convention Center where publishers wooed booksellers to
order their fall lines, while authors mingled with editors and
agents.
   ``It's a throwback to the Middle Ages, a fair and a chance to
discover new issues and new people,'' said ABA Executive Director
Bernie Rath. ``Everybody brings their own objectives with them.''
   No central issues dominated meetings by ABA members but
recurrent themes included the rising cost of running a bookstore,
the battle between chain stores and independents and the increasing
use of technology in ordering and marketing books.
   Michael J. Weiss, author of ``The Clustering of America,'' told
the booksellers that they can better target buyers through a
marketing system that categorizes neighborhoods into 40 groups.
These are given such colorful names as ``shotguns and pickups'' and
``furs and station wagons.''
   ``This idea that America is a melting pot is a myth,'' he said.
``Americans don't melt.''

   Delegates to a Communist Party
conference criticized party leaders Monday for not making reforms
suggested two years ago and said they should be fired unless they
solve the nation's economic problems.
   Yugoslavia has a foreign debt of $21 billion, Europe's highest
annual inflation at 170 percent and an unemployment rate of 15
percent. Economic problems have caused increasing social and labor
unrest.
   Dimitrije Kocovic, a Belgrade delegate, said in debate Monday
that ``the greatest responsibility'' for not implementing
resolutions of the last congress in 1986 ``is borne by presidents
of the Presidium of the Central Committee, in this period Milanko
Renovica and Bosko Krunic.''
   Krunic replaced Renovica and currently serves as party leader.
The party chief changes annually under a rotation system among the
leadership.
   Criticism of party leaders by name is rare, but generalized
criticism of the leadership in the press has become frequent with
economic deterioration in the past year.
   Several delegates said Monday a special party congress should
have been held instead of the three-day conference, which comes
half-way between two party congresses.
   ``Unless we carry through a complete social reform by next
autumn, it will be necessary to call a special congress that would
elect a new leadership,'' Slobodan Milosevic, leader of the Serbian
party, told the delegates. ``The leadership will either fulfill the
desire of the people or the people will replace it.''
   He apparently referred to the Central Committee and the ruling
Presidium, or Politburo, whose members are chosen at party
congresses.
   The congresses, held every four years, have broad powers to
change rules and personnel, but conferences held between them are
largely advisory. The leadership opposed a special congress,
contending the crisis did not require it.
   Milan Kucan, Communist leader of Slovenia, urged the national
party ``to relinquish its nostalgia for monopoly on power'' and
said ``domination of politics over economy'' should be eliminated.
   Demanding ``political democratization'' and economic reform,
Kucan declared: ``We all want to be a part of Europe, where we
belong. We want its standards, quality, ... organization and
work,'' not ``shortages and poverty.''
   Breda Blaznik of Slovenia, the most developed of Yugoslavia's
six republics, told the conference: ``The workers do not want to
support a party as ineffective as this one. They also do not want
to live in poverty.''
   Several delegates said the party should not meddle with the
economy and that more elements of market forces should be
introduced.
   On Saturday, the government imposed an austerity program that
includes substantial price increases, wage reductions of up to 30
percent and a 23.9 percent devaluation of the dinar, the national
currency.
   Living standards already have declined by about one-third since
1980 and the unpopular new plan probably will make that situation
worse.
   Labor unrest is expected to grow, which party chief Krunic
acknowledged in a speech to the conference Saturday.
   ``Social upheavals are certain to take place and may be grave,''
he said, but rejected calls for a multi-party system as a way of
dealing with the crisis.
   Francka Strmole of Slovenia demanded in Monday's debate the
adoption of a new constitution more democratic than the current
one, which took effect in 1974 before the death of President Tito.
   She said a law that allows prosecutions for non-conformist views
should be changed to cover only violence aimed at overthrowing the
system.
   ``Repression ... should not be used to prevent free expression
of opinion,'' she declared.

<HEAD>EEC To Maintain Humanitarian Aid To South African Groups</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community pledged
Monday to maintain humanitarian aid to South African anti-apartheid
groups even if these are effectively banned under a bill being
prepared by the Pretoria government.
   It did not say how it would do this.
   The EEC development commissioner, Lorenzo Natali, met in
Brussels on Friday with South African church leaders from several
denominations and with leaders of the Kagiso Trust, a South African
group that aids victims of apartheid.
   EEC officials said Monday that Natali assured them of EEC
support of those who ``use all pacific means to fight for the
abolition of apartheid.''
   The Common Market has earmarked $30.6 million for humanitarian
aid to South African opposition groups in 1988, up from $24 million
in 1987 and $12 million in 1986.
   The religious leaders urged the EEC to pressure South Africa
into shelving a bill _ now before South Africa's Parliament and
likely to be adopted later this year _ which will let the
government seize funds from abroad if it believes these will be
used for political activities.
   South African churches and church groups rely heavily on foreign
funding. Under the bill, they would need government approval to get
foreign aid.
   Last week, an all-party group in the European Parliament urged
the EEC to increase economic sanctions against South Africa if it
tightens up its anti-apartheid legislation.
   In 1986, the EEC banned new investments in South Africa and
halted imports of iron, steel and gold coins from the country.
   Apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   More than 650 television sets washed
up on the shore near this southwestern city over the weekend after
a cargo container fell overboard from a freighter in a violent
storm, customs officials said Tuesday.
   Other containers packed with tobacco bales and personal
belongings also washed up near Cape Naturaliste lighthouse on the
southern coast of Western Australia state, customs officer Con

   He said a 36-foot container was sighted directly below the
lighthouse and broke open on the rocks.
   ``It was virtually impossible to cart the television sets up the
lighthouse cliff face,'' Greenwood said.
   All the sets were wrecked, he said.
   The containers fell off the freighter Plata which was on a

the FBI office here and was arrested. He brought $50,000 with him
and revealed where to find the rest of the stolen cash, and the
full amount was recovered late Monday afternoon, Special Agent Bob
Lund said.
   ``I think we were somewhat surprised,'' he said. ``We'd been
working on this, and on something like this you generally expect to
go out and make an arrest.''
   Gray, one of three Wells Fargo guards transporting the money
from Boise, Idaho, to the Federal Reserve Bank in Salt Lake City,
had been sought since he disappeared the night $2.52 million in
$100 bills was taken from the truck.
   Authorities said at the time that the truck had stopped at a
convenience store and the two other guards found themselves locked
inside by a wedge of wood used to jam the door.
   Lund declined to say where it was found or to elaborate on
Gray's whereabouts since May 5, when the crime occurred.
   Gray, charged with three federal felony counts of theft, was
scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday morning before a federal
magistrate.
   Lund said he did not know why the guard turned himself in, but
he speculated that a nagging conscience and homesickness were
factors.
   ``Number one, he doesn't have a criminal history,'' he said.
``Number two, I think he probably planned this thing out and said,
`Yeah, I can live without my family for a while. I can go to South
America ... live luxuriously for a long, long time.'
   ``Then he just got to missing these people. I think he might
have had some conscience pangs,'' the agent said.
   The day after the robbery, Gray was charged in U.S. District
Court and a warrant issued for his arrest.
   Another FBI agent, Dennis M. Moler, declined to say whether
further arrests of possible accomplices were forthcoming, saying
only that the investigation was continuing.

<HEAD>Fears of Anti-Semitic Attacks on Eve of Christian Celebration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   Vandals reportedly smashed Jewish graves at a
cemetery west of Moscow and Jewish residents of the Soviet capital
said they feared anti-Semitic incidents during celebrations of the
millenium of Christianity here.
   At least one Jewish family said it planned to move out of Moscow
for fear of attacks against Jews by an anti-Semitic group using the
millenium celebration, which starts next week, as an excuse.
   Moscow News, a weekly that has been at the forefront of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``glasnost'' policy of greater
openness, reported in its May 29 edition that two drunks smashed 16
tombstones and damaged 30 others. The newspaper claimed the May 15
incident in a Jewish section of Vostryakovo Cemetery was not
motivated by anti-Semitism.
   ``The investigators, after the most thorough checkups, failed to
discover any data which would testify to the criminals'
nationalistic motives, or to some sort of settling of accounts,''
the newspaper said. ``So I'm convinced that this was a case of
drunken hooliganism and not an anti-Semitic action,'' wrote Moscow
News reporter Andrei Gurkov.
   Cemetery workers restored the tombstones at a cost of thousands
of rubles, the newspaper said.
   Avi Weiss, a leader of American Jewish groups, said Moscow Jews
told him they were concerned about possible anti-Semitic activities
during the millenium celebration. A bulletin of the Union of
Councils for Soviet Jews, based in Washington, D.C., also reported
such fears.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov was asked at a news
conference Monday about the cemetery vandalism. He said he didn't
know about it but that ``of course these people should be brought
to justice.''
   Sergei Grigoryants, a dissident journalist in Moscow, said in
mid-May he had heard reports that leaflets viciously denouncing
Jews had been circulating in the capital. The source of the
leaflets was unknown.
   A 29-year-old Moscow Jew who said he was sending his family to
Lithuania for safety suspected the ultranationalist, anti-Semitic
group Pamyat was behind the campaign.
   ``One of Pamyat's major points is that Jews spoil their lives
and that the (Bolshevik) revolution was done by Jews,'' said the
man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the group might be using the 1,000th anniversary of
Christianity in Russia ``as an excuse to retaliate.''
   A family acquaintance reported that a group of unidentified
people warned the owner of a dacha in the Moscow suburb of Ilinsky
not to rent the country house to Jews ``or we will burn it down,''
the man said. Another area of dachas popular among Jews,
Malakhovka, is largely unoccupied because of fears of anti-Semitic
attacks, he said.

   President Oscar Arias said Monday he
is seeking the help of two other Latin American leaders to
negotiate a solution to the crisis involving Panama's Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Arias said he asked President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and
Carlos Andres Perez, a former president of Venezuela, to help with
the negotiations.
   As head of Panama's Defense Forces, Noriega is de factor leader
of that country. The Reagan administration has been increasing
pressure on Noriega to quit, including economic sanctions on Panama
and freezing Panamanian assets in the United States, since the
general was indicted in the United States last February as a drug
trafficker.
   Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to
achieve peace in Central America, said Monday, ``This morning I
telephoned President Cerezo and ex-president Perez to ask them
that, as Latin Americans, they help mediate to find a negotiated
solution to the crisis in Panama.''
   He spoke with reporters at the presidential palace after meeting
with Joao Baena Soarez, general secretary of the Organization of
American States.
   On March 28, Perez and Spain's prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez,
asked the Roman Catholic archbishop of Panama, Monsignor Marcos A.
McGrath, to mediate in the crisis.
   ``We had proposed such negotiations, but the United States
interfered in the conflict and it failed. It is now up to us as
Latin Americans to find a Latin American solution to the Panamanian
crisis,'' Arias said.
   ``I think that Perez, as a member of the Socialist
International, and Cerezo, as a Christian Democrat, would be good
representatives in this mediation with Panamanian (political
sectors), where all ideologies are represented.''
   The Christian Democratic Party is one of the main opposition
groups to the Noriega-backed government in Panama.
   Noriega's hand-picked president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, tried to
fire the general on Feb. 26, but Noriega got the national
legislature to fire Delvalle instead. Delvalle has since been in
hiding in Panama.
   Months of secret negotiations between a State Department envoy
and Noriega representatives failed to dislodge the general.
   Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for drawing up a
Central American peace plan last August to end the war by
U.S.-supported rebels in Nicaragua and to end leftist guerrilla
wars in El Salvador and Guatemala.

Plant</HEAD>

   Thousands of students shouting
``Yankee go home!'' marched through downtown Seoul on Monday during
the funeral procession for a dissident student who committed
suicide.
   Police fired tear gas to break up the protest after the hearse
bearing the body of Choi Duk-soo left Seoul Railway Station for the
southern city of Kwangju.
   Also Monday, about 20,000 workers at the nation's leading
automaker, Hyundai Motor Co., walked off the job in a salary
dispute. It was the second labor problem to hit Hyundai in a week.
   Hyundai Precision and Industry Co., a subsidiary of the Hyundai
group, was closed for a fourth day because of a labor dispute.
Company officials said 10 executives were virtual hostages inside
the plant.
   Choi was buried at a public cemetery in Kwangju, the scene of a
1980 anti-government uprising in which at least 191 people were
killed.
   ``Drive out Yankee imperialists!'' and ``Down with military
dictatorship!'' the protesters chanted as they marched behind
Choi's hearse.
   Police kept a low profile during the four-mile march but fired
tear gas when the students burned a huge U.S. flag after memorial
services in front of the railway station.
   A handful of students hurled back firebombs, but most protesters
and hundreds of terrified commuters ran for cover from the tear gas.
   Some protesters were taken away by police, but overall arrest or
injury figures were not immediately known.
   About 10,000 protesters had gathered in front of the station
after marching with Choi's coffin. Choi died last Thursday after
setting himself on fire in an anti-government protest on May 18.
   In South Korea, suicide is sometimes used by dissidents to call
attention to their protests.
   Choi, a student at Dankuk University, left a note protesting the
holding of a student spring festival on the anniversary of the
Kwangju incident, the worst civil uprising in modern South Korean
history.
   Choi was the second student to kill himself this month in
political protest. Cho Sung-man, a student at Seoul National
University, stabbed himself and jumped off a building in Seoul on
May 15.
   Students and radicals have staged a number of protests in recent
weeks to demand the withdrawal of 42,000 U.S. troops from South
Korea and the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo's government.
   The protesters blame the United States for supporting military
rule in South Korea and partitioning the Korean Peninsula, divided
since 1945.
   In the southeastern city of Ulsan, Hyundai Motor's assembly line
was shut down after more than 80 percent of union members voted to
strike to press demands for wage increases.
   The union sought an increase of 48 percent, or $183, in monthly
earnings. Management offered a 25 percent increase, officials said.
They said Hyundai autoworkers with five to six years of experience
earn about $821 a month, including bonuses and other allowances.
   The officials said the strike would cost Hyundai, which sells
vehicles in the United States, an estimated $19 million in daily
sales.
   The strike by about 2,000 workers at Hyundai Precision and
Industry Co., a major manufacturer of train cars, was in its fourth
day. Workers there demanded higher wages and improved living
conditions.
   Hyundai Precision officials said the strikers prevented about 10
company executives, including Chairman Chung Mong-ku and President
Yoo Ki-chul, from leaving their offices inside the plant.
   A union leader speaking on condition of anonymity told The
Associated Press by telephone that the company executives ``remain
here of their own will to solve the dispute.''
   Repeated efforts to connect telephone calls to the executives
failed.
   On Friday, some strikers beat two company officials when they
tried to leave the plant. One official was in critical condition
after brain surgery. The other official was in serious condition
with head injuries.

<HEAD>Test Burn of Rocket Motor Edges Up Against Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the 11th day in a row, weather Monday
forced a delay of a test burn of a Pershing II rocket motor, and
now the Army is bumping up against a Tuesday deadline for the test
because of the newly ratified treaty with the Soviet Union,
officials said.
   The burn, originally scheduled for May 20, was delayed again
Monday when winds gusted to 50 mph out of the southeast at the
Pueblo Army Depot, about 15 miles from Pueblo.
   Spokesman Mary Wilson said the test was rescheduled for Tuesday
morning, if weather permits. If the test is not conducted by the 5
p.m. deadline, it will not be able to be scheduled for at least 30
days.
   The test burn would be the first step toward determining the
suitability of using the Pueblo Army Depot as a site for destroying
the Army's 420 Pershing missile fleet as a condition of the new
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   Tuesday is the last day the test can be conducted before the
United States and the Soviet Union formally exchange the documents
of the INF treaty Wednesday at the summit meeting in Moscow. The
treaty was ratified by the Senate last week.
   ``Then it becomes governed by the treaty,'' Wilson said. ``If we
were to test fire it, it is then treated as an eliminination (of a
weapon) under the treaty and subject to inspection by the Soviet
inspectors.''
   ``They'd have to witness it. ... We have to give them 30 days'
notice for an elimination inspection,'' she said.
   Army and Colorado Department of Health officials have set up 50
collection stations on and off the Army depot grounds to collect
the chemical fallout from the rocket burning to determine if any of
the pollutants would be harmful.
   In order to keep pollution problems to a minimum, the Army is
allowed to conduct a test burn only if there are winds aloft
greater than 8 mph blowing from the west, relative humidity under
70 percent and a cloud ceiling greater than 5,000 feet. There also
must be a mixing between the layers of the atmosphere, and the test
must be done by late afternoon.
   The health department is requiring the test before the Army can
designate the depot for the $9 million program. Wilson said because
the Army stores and maintains Pershings at Pueblo, the installation
is the preferred site for demolishing them, but three other
installations also are being considered for the project that would
create as many as 120 jobs.

   Solemn Memorial Day ceremonies honored the nation's war dead
Monday, drawing thousands to Washington's monuments and small-town
cemeteries, while many others partied in the sunshine to kick off
the summer season.
   ``It's about the saddest day _ that and Christmas,'' said
Margaret Meyers, 90, of Columbus, Ohio, who lost two sons at
Normandy in 1944.
   Memorial Day is ``a day of reflection, of being extremely
disappointed in the heart and mind ... and of thinking ... how much
I wish I could close the book on my father,'' said Robin Powers,
28, of Orion Township, Mich., outside Detroit. Her father, Maj.
Gary G. Wright, was declared missing in action after his Air Force
reconnaisance jet disappeared over Southeast Asia on Jan. 17, 1967.
   At Boston, a cannon on the bow of the 190-year-old USS
Constitution was fired 21 times beginning at noon.
   A wreath-laying ceremony was held at the Tomb of the Unknowns in
Arlington Cemetery just outside Washington, drawing about 4,000
people.
   U.S. Park Police estimated that 15,000 people gathered on the
Mall in Washington for a ceremony at the Vietnam Memorial.
   The Kennedy family spent a quiet Memorial Day at their
Hyannisport, Mass., compound following a small memorial service
Sunday for the 71st birthday of President John F. Kennedy, said
family spokesman Marc O'Connor.
   Illinois' new Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, dedicated less than a
month ago, attracted more weekend visitors than Lincoln's Tomb,
officials said. ``They're there from early morning until the
cemetery closes at 7 p.m.,'' said Nan Wynn, site manager for the
memorial, located in Springfield's Oak Ridge Cemetery less than a
quarter-mile from Lincoln's Tomb.
   Homeless veterans were among the 200 to 300 people marching in
the traditional New York County American Legion parade in
Manhattan. Larger parades were held elsewhere in the metropolitan
area.
   ``I marched in the parade because I felt I wasn't recognized by
the American people,'' said Wayne Fraley, 36, who provided air
support for soldiers in Vietnam and now lives in a homeless men's
shelter in Queens. ``In time of war we were called elite. How did
we ever land in the streets?''
   A five-month observation of the 125th anniversary of the Battle
of Gettysburg opened with a parade and a speech by retired Gen.
William C. Westmoreland, who said the nation-building process that
soldiers died for during the Civil War continues today.
   ``A nation is never fully formed,'' Westmoreland told an
audience of about 1,000 in a speech at Gettysburg National Cemetery
in southeastern Pennsylvania. About 1,500 children spread flowers
on the graves of the 3,722 Civil War soldiers buried here.
   Solemnity was followed by Dixieland jazz at Prospect Hill
Cemetery at Omaha, Neb., when a band and about half of a crowd of
200 followed up a Memorial Day observance with a graveside salute
to Anna Wilson, a bordello madam who left $1 million to charity
when she died in 1911.
   ``Saluting a prostitute is not the purpose of this thing,'' said
program organizer Larry McNichols. ``For one thing, she gave a lot
of money to this cemetery.''
   In Los Angeles, 20 protesters chose Memorial Day as the occasion
to demand a boycott of the movie ``Rambo III,'' denouncing the film
as overly violent and declaring it inflames passions against the
Soviet Union.
   In Indianapolis, people already were lining up Monday for
tickets for the 1989 running of the famous 500-mile race. The line
of those waiting to turn in their orders at the ticket windows
stretched 100-deep at times.
   Though most workers got the day off, Monday was not a paid
holiday for state employees in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.
Alabama state employees worked as a trade-off for the holiday they
received April 25 for Confederate Memorial Day.
   Much of the nation had fair weather for Monday's ceremonies,
parades, picnics and beach parties, but parts of the West had
weather definitely not in keeping with the holiday's reputation as
the start of the summer season.
   Large sections of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming were
closed because of snow, which accumulated 4 to 6 inches deep in
park mountain passes by early afternoon, park officials said.
   Snow fell at higher elevations of Utah, with 5 inches at the
Alta ski resort, and light snow lingered in northeastern Nevada,
the National Weather Service said. On Sunday, a surprise storm
dumped up to 6 inches of snow in the mountains of northern
California, surprising thousands of travelers and campers.
   Stiff wind and pounding seas trapped scores of boaters in coves
on the Channel Islands off Southern California, and 19 people were
rescued after their boats were smashed in two spots on Santa
Catalina Island.
   But where the weather was good, people shook off the memories of
winter and headed for the outdoors.
   ``We've been very busy,'' said Elizabeth Rothenberger of the
Exeter Public Golf Course in Reading, Pa.
   Temperatures were in the 70s and 80s across Michigan and
tourists packed motels and a state park along Grand Traverse Bay on
the state's Lake Michigan side.
   ``Last year we never did fill up,'' Traverse City State Park
Manager Ivan Rockwell said. ``This year, we were full on Saturday
night.''
   AAA Michigan said staffers at Van Riper State Park near
Champion, just west of Marquette, reported the biggest crowd in 20
years.
   Beaches along most of Massachusetts' Cape Cod were less crowded
Monday after clouds moved in. ``It was crazy until today,'' said
Tanya Hirst at the Cape Cod National Seashore.
   Along the Missouri shore of the Mississippi River, St. Louis
Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr., piloting the Becky Thatcher
Riverboat, edged St. Louis County Executive Gene McNary aboard the
Tom Sawyer in their annual Memorial Day Riverboat Race. The boats
are driven by modern propellers but carry paddle-wheels to look
like the old-time river steamers.
   ``We were long overdue,'' Schoemehl said. ``We had a new boat
and a new beginning.'' McNary leads in the seven-year series with a
4-2-1 record.

   Thousands of Arabs defied a general strike call
by underground leaders and went to work Monday in the first failure
of such a protest in the six-month Palestinian uprising.
   The clandestine United Leadership of the Uprising, believed to
be made up of Palestine Liberation Organization activists, called
the strike to keep attention focused on the uprising during the
U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow.
   But dozens of Arab buses, some crowded with standing passengers,
rolled from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip carrying
Palestinians workers to Israel. In the Gaza Strip, shops were open
and transit was operating.
   Estimates by Arabs of how many Palestinians went to work in
Israel ranged from 10 percent in some areas to 50 percent in
others. The army said more than half the 110,000 Palestinians who
work in Israel showed up at their jobs.
   Israeli leaders and some Palestinians said the fizzled strike
showed support for the underground leadership was waning. But other
Arabs said a leaflet ordering the protest caused confusion and was
not widely distributed.
   In the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, a protest broke out
after a 28-year-old Palestinian woman was shot and her 9-month-old
daughter lost an eye when Israeli troops fired rubber bullets
during a clash.
   Officials at Shifa Hospital said the woman, Najah Ahmed Masoub,
was shot in the left arm and her daughter, Huda, lost her left eye.
   Arab reports said the injuries came as Mrs. Masoub tired to
block soldiers from arresting her brother. The army said it was
investigating the report.
   Since the unrest began Dec. 8, 198 Palestinians and two Israelis
have been killed.
   Left-wing legislator Dedi Zucker of the Citizens' Rights
Movement told Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin that soldiers harshly
beat Palestinian prisoners on their way to jail.
   In a letter to Rabin, Zucker submitted an affidavit from a
reserve soldier, Ariel Stemker, who said he saw a 12-year-old Arab
boy brutally clubbed as he emerged from an army bus transporting
him to Dahariye prison near Hebron.
   ``A soldier started to beat the boy on the barbed wire in a
deliberate attempt to injure him,'' Stemker wrote. ``He grabbed the
boy from behind, then holding him by the hair and the seat of the
pants, threw him up in the air and tried to cut his face.''
   Stemker said the soldier ignored his shouts to stop and instead
threw the boy ``with all his force into a wall, head first. The
boy, who had been crying, started to scream from pain. The soldier
kicked him and a jailer beat him on the back with a club.''
   Underground leaders urged Arabs to shut down the occupied lands
and fly the outlawed Palestinian flag as President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev meet.
   Palestinian flags were flying in Jenin and Nablus, the West
Bank's largest city. New graffiti on walls in Bethlehem warned
merchants not to open during the strike.
   But the leaflet did not circulate in the Gaza Strip. Nablus
businessman Saed Kenaan said some Palestinians were confused by the
strike call because a previous leaflet did not order a general
strike on Monday.
   Other Arabs said the strike's failure showed Palestinians were
growing tired of frequent calls for strikes.
   ``The leadership is pushing things way too far, they are asking
the impossible,'' said Farah El Araj, the mayor of Beit Jallah.
``They call for supporting and developing local Palestinian
industry and then they call for more strikes.''
   Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American activist who faces deportation
from Israel, said he would ask U.S. officials to arrange a meeting
with U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz during his visit June
5.
   Awad, 44, spoke after he was freed briefly from jail to appear
in court to file a libel suit against an Israeli newspaper that
alleged he dealt in drugs to raise funds for the PLO.
   Awad, who was born in Jerusalem and lived in Wapakoneta, Ohio,
was jailed May 5 when Israel ordered him deported after accusing
him of playing a role in inciting the uprising.
   The U.S. government has urged Israel to reconsider the case.

   Some champions of reform already have sunk in the
untested waters of political competition here, one of the victims
said Monday.
   Prominent political scientist and writer Fyodor M. Burlatsky
said Cmmunist Party activists are feeling their way through
democratic elections to the party conference on June 28, a major
event that will be attended by 5,000 delegates.
   Burlatsky confirmed Monday that the conference will not name any
new people to the 300-member, policy-making Central Committee, in
part to protect the committee headed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev from
detrimental changes.
   ``If elections to the party conference have become so difficult,
how do we know elections to the Central Committee won't be tied up
by some of these negative factors?'' he commented.
   Burlatsky fell with the fortunes of Nikita S. Khrushchev, the
late former premier, but resurfaced to back Gorbachev's
``perestroika'' campaign of restructuring Soviet society.
   He said the party's charter does not spell out procedures for
selecting delegates to party conferences.
   ``We are learning democracy, finding a style as we go,'' the
political scientist said. ``It is certainly experimental.''
   The last party conference was in 1941, and times have changed
radically and old ways of choosing delegates are no longer
relevant, he said.
   Burlatsky; historian Yuri Afanasyev, and Tatyana Zaslavskaya,
the nation's most prominent sociologist, are among those turned
down by regional party authorities after being selected by their
local groups as candidates to attend the conference.
   Exclusion of such noted backers of reform prompted
demonstrations in Moscow and Leningrad over the weekend and
accusations that the selection process was rigged.
   Burlatsky brushed off suggestions that the absence of some
perestroika advocates could allow conservatives within the party to
slow or damage the reform program. The conference will consider a
slate of policy decisions and proposals from delegates that will
form a blueprint for legislative changes.
   ``Mikhail Sergeyevich's policies and programs are sufficiently
strong enough to carry the conference,'' Burlatsky said.
   He joked that his absence would take its toll, ``but I don't
think it is dangerous to perestroika.''
   In effect, the party conference will pass judgment on
Gorbachev's reforms and determine their future.
   Among the proposals are suggestions for jury trials; relaxation
of restrictions on religion; reform of the criminal justice system;
limits on the political terms of party officials, and some formal
sanctioning of the informal groups springing up in the Soviet
Union, which Burlatsky said now number about 30,000. The groups,
which are unofficial but sometimes tolerated, have come together to
press causes like environmental protection and individual freedoms.
   Instances where Gorbachev's backers failed to get elected as
delegates were sometimes the result of individual party officials
striking their names from lists forwarded by factories, institutes
and local party organizations, Burlatsky said.
   ``There were cases where regional secretaries themselves, for
formalistic reasons, withdrew certain names,'' Burlatsky said,
using a term that suggests conservatism.
   Ms. Zaslavskaya criticized the delegate selection process at a
news conference last week, saying the choices had not in every case
been beneficial for the fate of Gorbachev's reforms.

<HEAD>Timor Earthquake Jolts Darwin, Blacking Out City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DARWIN, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major earthquake centered just south
of the Indonesian island of Timor jolted this northern Australian
city Tuesday, blacking out most suburbs for more than one hour.
   The Australian Seismology Center in Canberra said the tremor
measured 7 on the Richter scale. It said the quake's epicenter was
in the Banda Sea area of Indonesia, 400 miles north of Darwin.
   Aside from disruption to power supplies, there were no reports
of damage or injury in Darwin, Australia's northernmost city with a
population of about 70,000.
   Scientist Kevin McCue said the quake was felt at 6:45 a.m. (3:45
p.m. EDT Monday).
   McCue said the island of Timor would have been severely shaken
and probably suffered landslides. There was no immediate reports
from Indonesia.
   The 15-second tremblor was felt across a wide area of northern
Australia.
   It was the strongest earthquake in the Banda Sea area in more
than four years. A magnitude 7.1 earthquake occurred Nov. 24, 1983.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measureed by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage, a 7 is capable
of widespread, heavy damage, and a magnitude 8 is a ``great''
earthquake, capable of tremendous damage.

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense minister for Saudi Arabia
has arrived to be treated for an orthopedic problem by a Birmingham
doctor, officials said Monday.
   Mike Immel, executive director of the Alabama Sports Medicine
and Orthopedic Center, said Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul Aziz will be
examined Tuesday by Dr. James R. Andrews, who is one of six
orthopedic surgeons with the medical group.
   Immel said he did not know yet if surgery will be performed on
Aziz, a member of the Saudi royal family who serves as Saudi
Arabia's second deputy prime minister, minister of defense and
aviation, and inspector general.
   ``We're going to examine him to determine what if anything needs
to be done beyond that point,'' Immel said.
   Immel did not release further details of the ailment, but Jay
Zines, administrator for clinical services at South Highlands
Hospital, said it involved one of the defense minister's knees.
   Zines said Aziz will probably be admitted to the hospital
Tuesday.
   Andrews has treated members of the Saudi royal family for at
least 10 years. The doctor used to have a medical practice in
Columbus, Ga., where he met members of the royal family at Fort
Benning, Immel said.

<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 4 grafs after 5th graf pvs, Bush refused, to UPDATE

<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, looking to avoid the fallout from Edwin
Meese III's legal woes, said Monday the attorney general promised
not to jeopardize Bush's presidential bid. Democrat Michael
Dukakis, meanwhile, assured his black supporters that he would
offer rival Jesse Jackson a major role in his campaign.
   Bush confirmed published reports that he held a private meeting
with Meese who promised the vice president he would not do anything
to hurt the likely GOP nominee's campaign.
   ``Now that that secret is no longer a secret, I prefer to let
him discuss that,'' Bush told reporters after participating in a
Memorial Day ceremony at his vacation retreat in Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   Asked if the embattled attorney general had promised not to do
anything that would jeopardize his run for the presidency, Bush
said, ``Yes, yes, I think it's fair to say that.''
   Bush refused to elaborate on the issue that many campaign aides
consider a political liability. The vice president has said he will
not comment on the matter until after independent counsel James
McKay completes his investigation and issues his report on Meese.
   Meese himself said in a broadcast interview that he would hurt
Bush if he stepped down now.
   ``If I were to quit now, for example, it would be a real
liability because people would say there was something wrong,'' he
said in an interview on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' on Monday night.
   Meese refused to say what he and Bush discussed, other than that
they ``talked frankly about the campaign.''
   ``I think it's important to George Bush...as well as myself that
the record be set straight,'' he told interviewer Pat Buchanan.
   Bush is spending the week at his oceanside home, conferring with
advisers and Republican leaders on his strategy for November and
ways to energize his faltering campaign.
   Democratic front-runner Dukakis, meanwhile, indicated what role
Jackson would play at the national convention and in the fall
campaign at a meeting with black supporters in Boston.
   ``What kind of role would I play if I came in second and he came
in first?'' the Masschusetts governor asked rhetorically. ``I would
be out there working for a Democratic victory. ... I hope if I am
the nominee that we can work together.''
   Dukakis said Jackson would have ``an important role in the
convention and the campaign and I hope in what we do afterward.''
   Participants in the meeting said Dukakis promised to offer
Jackson campaign aides jobs in the fall campaign and also said
blacks and minorities would hold major positions in a Dukakis
administration.
   ``Very clearly the presence of black Americans in this campaign
is going to have to be expanded,'' said Charlene Drew Jarvis, a
District of Columbia council member who attended the session. ``We
got that commitment today from Michael Dukakis. ... He was clear
that the issues that are important to black Americans are issues
that are going to be important to him.''
   Jackson spoke approvingly of the gathering. ``He (Dukakis) has
an obligation to reach out,'' he said.
   Of the part he will play when the primary season is over,
Jackson said, ``I expect to have a big role at the convention and a
big role this fall. That role has not been determined...I will
exercise my own options.''
   Dukakis, who has more than 1,700 of the 2,081 delegates needed
to win the nomination, is expected to reach the magical number on
June 7, when California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico hold
primaries. All told, 466 delegates are at stake in the four states.
   Jackson, who has 900-plus delegates, spent Memorial Day
campaigning in New Jersey, where he called for an end to war as he
stood in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty.
   ``Study war no more,'' Jackson told a crowd of about 250 in
Jersey City, N.J. ``Nations must not rise up against nations.'' He
also laid a wreath at a war memorial.
   Earlier, at a rally in Elizabeth, N.J., Jackson evoked the words
written by poet Emma Lazarus and inscribed on the statue's book to
raise the issue of hazardous waste pollution.
   ``Give me your poor, your tired, your huddled masses, yearning
to be free,'' Jackson said. ``New Jersey, you can't be free with 97
toxic waste dumps,'' which have been targeted for federal cleanup
funds.
   In honor of the holiday, Dukakis attended a Memorial Day service
in the state capital. He also met with Argentine President Raul
Alfonsin.
   Bush, as he has done in recent years, delivered a short speech
in the town square at the conclusion of Kennebunkport's Memorial
Day parade. Bush, noting the U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow, said the
arms control agreement to eliminate intermediate-range weapons
would not have been reached ``if the United States had not been
strong, if we hadn't sacrificed from time to time as a nation.''

   A powerful cold front spread rain and snow and gusty wind into
the Rocky Mountains on Monday, but much of the rest of the nation
had fair weather for Memorial Day.
   A snow advisory was in effect through the night for the
mountains of northwestern Wyoming, with heavy snow possible at
elevations above 8,000 feet. Up to 6 inches of snow had fallen in
the higher passes of Yellowstone National Park, closing roads in
much of the park, the National Weather Service and Park Service
said.
   A snow advisory also was issued for elevations above 8,000 feet
in Utah where 4 to 8 inches of snow was possible, and a snow
advisory also was posted over parts of southwestern Montana.
   Up to 18 inches of snow had fallen in northeastern Nevada over
the weekend. Up to 6 inches fell in the mountains of northern
California, surprising travelers and weekend campers.
   Thunderstorms and hail pounded western portions of the Texas
Panhandle on Monday night, and at least one tornado was reported.
   Two counties were placed under a tornado warning after sheriff's
deputies reported ``baseball-size hail'' in the vicinity and a
tornado touched down near Needmore, about 60 miles northwest of
Lubbock. There were no reports of injuries or major damage.
   Warm, windy weather spread ahead of the cold front and strong
thunderstorms developed over eastern Wyoming.
   Southerly wind gusted to 50 mph over the high Plains and
temperatures warmed into the 80s as far north as eastern Montana.
The cold front created a sharp temperature contrast across Montana
on Monday, from the 80s in the east to the 30s in the west.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms spread across extreme
southern Florida, and showers over much of New England kept
temperatures in the 50s.
   Youngstown, Ohio, had a record high for the date of 88 degrees,
and Alpena, Mich., tied its record of 89.
   Record lows were posted in Bakersfield, Calif., at 44 degrees,
and at Orlando, Fla., at 63.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees at Eureka, Nev., to 92 at Port Hope, Mich. The low for the
day was 22 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   For Tuesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
over the Great Plains region. Showers were forecast from northern
Arizona to the northern Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. Showers
and thunderstorms were forecast across southern Florida, and widely
scattered showers were forecast over New England.
   Highs only in the 50s were predicted from northern Arizona to
southern Idaho and western Wyoming; in the 80s in the valleys and
deserts of southern Arizona and southern California; in the 60s and
70s over the rest of the West; and mostly in the 80s east of the
Rockies, with some lower 90s in the Southeast and the middle
Atlantic Coast region.

   A group of workers has demanded freedom
for four activists jailed for alleged assault on a factory guard
during labor unrest earlier this month, the wife of one of the
accused said Monday.
   A petition signed by 239 employees of the Dolmel electric
machinery plant in the southwestern industrial city of Wroclaw was
sent to the prosecutor for the Wroclaw-Fabryczna district, said
Maria Pinior, wife of jailed activist Jozef Pinior.
   Pinior, a Wroclaw activist in both the banned Solidarity trade
union and the outlawed Polish Socialist Party, and three associates
were arrested at the plant May 5 during a labor rally in sympathy
with striking workers at the Nowa Huta steelworks in Krakow.
   Although the four are accused of assaulting the guard,
eyewitnesses ``agreed that it was the accused who were brutally
attacked by the guard,'' the petition asserted.
   The four are the last still in prison out of dozens of activists
and strikers detained during at least five strikes in Poland
between April 25 and May 10.

   The Philippine miltary sent more
troops and artillery to the disputed Spratly Islands to guard
against further moves in the area by other countries claiming the
island chain, it was reported Tuesday.
   The Manila Times and Malaya newspapers quoted a group of
Filipino scientists in their reports. There was no confirmation
from the Ministry of National Defense.
   Both newspapers quoted Eduardo Gonzalez, chief of a group of
petroleum scientists who visited the Spratlys this month, as saying
Filipino troops there were on full alert and that additional
marines and weaponry had been deployed on islands claimed by the
Philippines.
   The Philippines, Malaysia, China, Vietnam and Taiwan claim the
Spratlys, known in the Philippines as the Kalayaan, or Freedom,
islands. Last January, Chinese and Vietnamese forces clashed in the
Spratlys, located in the South China Sea.
   In a related development, the commander-in-chief of the U.S.
Pacific Command told reporters in Manila on Monday that tensions in
the Spratlys could pose a threat to Philippine security.
   ``The ongoing differences there have to be worked out,'' said
Adm. Ronald Hays, who was in Manila for meetings with Filipino
military officials. ``One would hope for a way that does not entail
more bloodshed or fighting.''
   Hays said the dispute was ``not a matter for the U.S. to attend
to at this point.''

   Kenji Fukunaga, a veteran politician of the
governing party and former speaker of Japan's lower house, died of
respiratory failure at a hospital early Tuesday, a hospital
official said. He was 77.
   Fukunaga, who was chairman of the Japan Amateur Sports
Association at the time of his death, had entered the hospital in
Omiya, north of Tokyo, on April 10 for treatment of an intestinal
ailment.
   Beginning in 1949, Fukunaga won election 15 consecutive times to
the House of Representatives in the Diet, Japan's parliament.
   Fukunaga served as lower house speaker for two years up to 1985.
He also served as minister for labor, transport, and health and
welfare between 1961 and 1977.
   In 1972 he was dispatched to Israel as a special government
envoy after a bloody attack by the Japanese Red Army terrorist
group at Tel Aviv's Lod Airport.

   A reporter asked if he was suggesting that dissidents are

   With a pained look on his face, Reagan said, ``I don't mean

   Later, Marlin Fitzwater, the president's press secretary, said
Reagan was having ``a little good sport and good humor with the

   Hunter College has closed two classroom
buildings because they contain tons of chemicals that have turned
toxic and potentially explosive with age, the city's environmental
department said Monday.
   Some of the chemicals, found in science laboratories and storage
rooms, were as much as 30 years old, said Joan Paylo, spokeswoman
for the city Department of Environmental Protection.
   ``It's an unbelievable example of environmental and scientific
mismanagement,'' she said. ``No one remembers when such a store of
chemicals was discovered in a non-profit type of setting.''
   College officials first became aware that toxic and potentially
explosive chemicals were present in the two buildings May 11, when
the Fire Department discovered some samples of ether during a
routine inspection, said college spokesman Robin Elliott.
   Subseqent investigations by the college, the city's
environmental agency and other city agencies revealed tons of
expired chemicals in the two buildings, and the city asked that the
buildings be closed, Ms. Paylo said.
   Some of the substances have already been removed, with part of
the work being done by the police bomb squad, officials said.
   Classes at the college ended for the year two weeks ago, and
registration for the school's summer session is not expected until
June 8.
   Elliott said the college's policy had been ``to leave the
regulation of materials to individual researchers in the labs.''
The discovery of the dangerous chemicals ``shows that you can't
leave this important safety-related area to individual people,'' he
added.

<HEAD>Minister Says Some Members of Cave Assault Squad to be Punished</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said
Monday that some members of the assault squad that attacked a New
Caledonian cave to free 23 hostages committed acts ``contrary to
military duty'' and will be punished.
   Nineteen native Melanesians were killed during the May 5 attack
on the cave on Ouvea island, part of the French Pacific territory
of New Caledonia. Two members of the assault squad also were killed.
   Chevenement told reporters that the commander of the team
charged with evacuating the injured has been suspended.
   The evacuation of Alphonse Dianou, the presumed leader of the
captors, ``leaves a certain number of points obscure,'' he said.
Dianou, wounded in the attack, later died.
   Chevenement did not say how many people may have committed acts
``contrary to military duty'' or what their punishment might be.
   The assault, ordered by then-Premier Jacques Chirac, triggered
immediate protests from separatist Melanesians who called it a
politically motivated massacre. Melanesian witnesses said three
people were ``executed'' after surrendering.
   The cave attack came three days before the final round of the
French presidential election in which Chirac, a conservative, was
vying with Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, who won a
second seven-year term.
   On May 13, Chevenement, appointed defense minister in the new
government, ordered an inquiry into the assault from both the army
and the gendarmerie.
   A separate inquiry is being conducted by the Justice Ministry to
determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths of three of the
19 Melanesians.
   Most native Melanesians want independence for New Caledonia. A
group of them took hostages to press their demand for negotiations
to discuss independence and to cancel regional elections in New
Caledonia, held April 24, the same day as the first-round
presidential vote.

   In naming a new batch of cardinals, Pope
John Paul II seeks to expand his church's influence in the Soviet
Union and China. But U.S. Roman Catholics may be disappointed in
their share of the 25 new red hats.
   Two new American cardinals are on the list of new ``princes''
from 18 countries announced by the pope on Sunday: Archbishops
Edmund C. Szoka, 60, of Detroit and James A. Hickey, 67, of
Washington, D.C.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the passing over of Los
Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony, 52, was the ``great exclusion''
among other possible American candidates.
   He said Mahony was bypassed because of his relative youth and is
likely to become a cardinal at a later time.
   The appointment of Szoka and Hickey will bring to five the
number of active U.S. cardinals. The others are Bernard Law of
Boston, Joseph Bernardin of Chicago and John O'Connor of New York.

   With the declining fortunes of the Marxist-led Polisario

guerrillas are deserting the movement and drifting back across the
desert to join the Moroccan side.
   Moroccan officials say the deserters are arriving at an average

   A group of foreign reporters met many of them on a recent

   Usually talking in the presence of Moroccan officials, they

   President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev edged
forward on arms issues Monday in a summit session that was eclipsed
by Reagan's meeting with dissidents and his challenge that the
Soviet leader usher in ``a new age of religious freedom.''
   ``It's time my friend, it's time,'' the president implored the
general secretary, quoting the pre-revolutionary Russian poet
Alexander Pushkin as he sounded the human rights theme on the
second day of his five-day visit.
   In an extraordinary meeting with several dozen dissidents and
refuseniks and members of their families arrayed before him at the
U.S. ambassador's residence, Reagan said: ``I came here hoping to
do what I could to give you strength.''

   Former Moscow Communist Party chief Boris N.
Yelstin on Monday accused the Kremlin's No. 2 official, Yegor K.
Ligachev, of blocking Soviet political reforms and said he should
quit.
   Yeltsin's criticism of Ligachev in an interview with British
Broadcasting Corp. was an unprecedented case of a fallen Soviet
leader publicly criticizing those who remain in power and publicly
airing sharp high-level differences.
   It shed light on Yeltsin's fall from power that culminated in
his removal Feb. 18 as a candidate, or non-voting, member of the
ruling Communist Party Politburo.

   After years of steady gains, organ donation is in

who are failing to make good use of consent laws designed to assist
transplant programs.
   ``The people are willing by and large (to donate organs). Yet
the profession is not responding,'' said Dr. Lawrence G. Hunsicker,
president of the American Society of Transplant Physicians.
   ``It's pretty dismal,'' agreed Faye Davis, executive director of

successful. More people want to go for them. More doctors are
trained. And the donor pool is definitely not increasing.''

   Lack of an alternative to military
rule, and a protest movement so well-mannered it apparently is no
threat, have stymied U.S. attempts to force Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega from power.
   For his part, the general uses the populist appeal that has
characterized 20 years of de facto military rule and deflects the
spotlight from himself. Noriega says the issue is not whether he
stays or goes, but Panama's dignity and self-determination.
   This plays well in a country that knows it was created in 1903
essentially for Washington's convenience and where a new
nationalism sparked by the Panama Canal treaties burns brightly.

   The U.S. dollar moved higher against other major
currencies in Europe Monday amid optimism that a technical rally
could continue.
   The price of gold held steady.
   The dollar's strength reflected continued upward momentum after
the currency broke through the technical barrier of 1.7100 West
German marks late Friday, dealers said.
   During Monday's trading, it rose further to pierce the
1.7280-mark point.
   A trader at a foreign bank in Frankfurt said the dollar could
rise further but warned that investors are likely to remain
somewhat tentative until the next batch of U.S. trade figures are
released in mid-June.
   Some traders said there was little fundamental strength in the
dollar and that the upward move may have been exaggerated by the
thinness of the market.
   Markets were closed in Singapore, London and New York on Monday
for national holidays, but dealings were active in Frankfurt.
   The dollar rose nearly a cent against the British pound. It cost
$1.8478 to buy one pound in Europe, cheaper than $1.8570 in London
late Friday.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.34 yen to a closing 124.98 yen. Later in Europe,
it was quoted lower at 124.08 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.7270 West German marks, up from 1.7140; 1.4415 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4305; 5.8025 French francs, up from 5.7660;
1.9335 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9177; 1,280.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,270.75, and 1.2378 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2407.
   In Zurich, gold was unchanged, closing at a bid $452.50. Earlier
in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.94 to close at a bid $454.31.
   Silver was quoted in Zurich Monday at a bid price of $6.57 a
troy ounce, down from Friday's late bid of $6.59 in London.

   New York nearly caught up with California to be
the state with the most residents working for foreign bosses in
1986, according to newly compiled government statistics.
   Nationwide, employment by foreign bosses rose 4 percent and
Britain remained the biggest employer, the Commerce Department says
in a report to be published in mid-June.
   Figures for 1987 will not be compiled until this time next year,
a delay caused by the difficulty of collecting employment
statistics from thousands of foreign-owned companies.
   The report says 2.96 million Americans worked in 1986 for
foreign bosses _ specifically, operations other than banks that had
at least 10 percent foreign ownership.
   California held onto the No. 1 spot by just 27 people as its
total shrank and New York's grew rapidly.
   Next were Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North
Carolina, Georgia and Florida. South Dakota was last, just behind
North Dakota.
   In spite of the attention that Japanese investors have received
in recent years, they ranked only fifth as bosses of Americans
behind the British, Canadians, West Germans and Dutch.
   The Commerce Department does not disclose foreign employers by
name, but it is obvious that some of the big deals of 1986 had an
impact on the numbers.
   For example, the $3.4 billion acquisition of Allied Stores Corp.
by Canada's Campeau Corp. helps explain why Canada's U.S.
employment jumped by about 75,000.
   On the other hand, West Germany's overall U.S. employment
dropped a whopping 100,000 largely because W.R. Grace & Co. no
longer counted in its totals. Grace repurchased 26 percent of its
shares from the Flick industrial group of West Germany for $596
million.
   Although Japan's U.S. employment rose only about 2 percent, its
heavy investments in the United States, especially financial
companies, caused its U.S. assets to shoot up 51 percent.
   With $96.7 billion in U.S. assets, Japan ranked third behind
Britain's $133.8 billion and Canada's $129.5 billion.
   The report, completed in early May, will be published in the May
issue of the department's Survey of Current Business, which is
released in mid-June.

<HEAD>Last Natural Ore Open Pit Mine In North America Nears Extinction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AURORA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trucks the size of houses rumble in and out
of the Donora mining pit with sandbox simplicity.
   With each round trip to a nearby processing plant, they bring
North America's last working open pit mine of high-grade natural
iron ore about 100 tons closer to extinction.
   ``At one time we thought the natural ore on the Mesabi Range was
going to last forever,'' said G.B. Morey, chief geologist for the
Minnesota Geological Survey.
   That was in the 1890s, when the nation's largest deposits of
moist black and blue ore were being discovered on the Mesabi,
Vermilion and Cuyuna ranges in northeastern Minnesota. About 2.82
billion tons and two world wars later, the Donora pit just east of
Aurora at the McKinley Extension Mine is all that's left.
   There are other natural ore deposits scattered around the Great
Lakes, in Canada and the western United States, but none that can
be profitably mined with today's technology, Morey said. Abundant
taconite, a flint-like rock containing a low-grade iron ore that is
extracted and converted into pellets, has replaced it as the main
source for steel.
   ``You can't ever say it's dead,'' Morey said of natural iron ore
mining. ``But it's the end of an era.''
   Don LeMay, Northwest Ore Division manager for LTV Steel Co.,
said the canyon-sized Donora Pit his company leases from U.S. Steel
Co. is expected to be scraped clean of the precious mineral in
another three or four years.
   ``Yes, we're going to miss it,'' LeMay said. ``We cherish that
type of material.''
   Compared to taconite, natural iron ore is steelmakers' gravy.
For every 100 tons scooped from the 1,200-acre Donora Pit and
sifted through a washing plant, about 80 tons are left for the
blast furnace. By the time 100 tons of taconite are processed into
ore-grade pellets, only 33 tons are left for making steel.
   In addition, a ton of natural ore costs less to produce and
burns more efficiently in blast furnaces because it is first shaped
into a porous rock-like material by fusing it with another compound.
   LeMay said the Donora supply of natural ore has given LTV a
small competitive edge over other U.S. steelmakers, who rely on the
abundance of high-grade natural ore in Brazil and other countries
in addition to domestic and Canadian taconite. LTV ships its
natural ore from Duluth to Indiana Harbor, Ind., where it is made
into steel.
   ``Our operation has been going out of business ever since I
joined it,'' said Mike Sterk, manager of engineering.
   ``We consider ourselves a vanishing breed,'' said Gene Garner,
mine engineer.
   When LTV filled its first train car of natural ore at the mine
in 1983, the workers followed tradition and planted an evergreen
tree in it.
   That was when they were still digging in the Stephens Pit
started by U.S. Steel. When that pit was nearly exhausted in the
fall of 1983, digging commenced at the adjacent Donora Pit. More
than 3 million tons of the resource have been removed from the site
since then and another 3 million tons are left, Sterk said. By the
time the shovels are scraping quartzite at the bottom, they'll be
350 feet below the upper rim.
   Co-workers Paul Kaska, 52, of Gilbert, and Matt Turner, 49, of
Eveleth, say the end sometime in 1992 will be bittersweet. They'll
miss the fraternity developed during long years of natural ore
mining all over the range, but enjoy the leisure of retirement.
Kaska said all but about a half dozen of the 70 hourly wage earners
at Donora will be eligible for a pension when the end arrives. The
others may find work in LTV's taconite operations on the Iron
Range, they said.
   ``No more eating out of lunch buckets,'' Kaska said. ``And I
remember once that I had to work when it was 52 below (zero).''
   Turner said the wage and pension cuts accepted by union workers
during the mining depression earlier in the decade will be among
his biggest memories and he said many men are looking forward to
the day when they don't have to drive to work. As natural ore
operations moved east along the Mesabi, most miners stayed in their
hometowns and were left with drives of up to 90 miles away to
Aurora.
   ``We're not going to be too terribly sorry when she goes,''
Turner said.
   Morey said the end of natural ore mining on the Iron Range is
also likely to remind natives of the region that the largest
benefactors of the resource were the Eastern steel companies.
   ``It's one of the real sore points in this whole thing,'' Morey
said. ``We produced the material and we got very little out of it.
Certainly the history isn't ideal from the state's point of view.''
   But the history won't be written until the last load of
high-grade natural iron ore is shipped off the range. Like the last
loads shipped out of the range's other ore pits, it will be aptly
decorated with a broom.

   While Soviet authorities wage a domestic war
against rampant alcoholism, they are giving Vladimir A. Yamnikov
their official blessing to perfect a ``supervodka'' for export to
American drinkers.
   ``We don't drink it, we just make it,'' said Yamnikov, the
jovial, 48-year-old director of the Crystal distillery, one of two
Soviet plants that make Stolichnaya vodka.
   No production or sales restrictions apply to the export of
Stolichnaya, which is billed as ``the only authentic Russian vodka
available in the United States,'' although Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has sharply reduced the volume of vodka available for
domestic consumption.
   Last week, in advance of the fourth Reagan-Gorbachev summit,
Yamnikov took American reporters on a tour of his sprawling red
brick factory in Moscow, where employees get a double message from
management: work hard so others can drink, but don't drink
yourselves.
   Red banners hanging along the walls and dimly lit hallways,
pungent with vodka fumes, urge workers to increase quality and
productivity. One poster depicted a man drowning inside a vodka
bottle and warned that alcohol can cause ``a collapse of hopes.''
   Long before joint business ventures between Soviet and Western
companies became fashionable, PepsiCo struck a deal with the
Soviets in 1972. PepsiCo buys Stolichnaya for resale in the United
States and the Soviets produce Pepsi Cola at 20 plants.
   The key to making good vodka is purity, said chief plant
engineer Oleg M. Ivanov _ pure alcohol and pure water.
   Under his supervision, raw alcohol is poured into stainless
steel columns four stories high and is separated into different
densities. Alcohol of a certain density is selected for Stolichnaya
and slowly trickles through gray metal cylinders containing three
sets of activated charcoal filters.
   The purified alcohol is then mixed with Moscow tap water that
itself has been filtered.
   The best alcohol goes to the two Stolichnaya export production
lines, where 58 bottles a minute are filled by machine and packed
by hand into boxes labeled ``Made in the USSR'' in English.
   The biggest market for Stolichnaya is the United States, where
12 million one-liter bottles are sold annually when superpower
relations are good.
   U.S. sales plummeted when Soviet troops intervened in
Afghanistan in late 1979 and again in 1983, when the Soviets shot
down a South Korean jetliner. But PepsiCo says sales soared during
the Washington summit meeting between President Reagan and
Gorbachev last December, and the company expects the Moscow summit
to provide another sales boost.
   Sounding like a market-oriented capitalist, Yamnikov says he
hopes to whet American drinkers' tastes with an experimental new
``supervodka'' which he plans to market under the ``Golden Ring''
label.
   ``We are keeping the original recipe but improving the quality
of alcohol and purifying the water,'' he said. ``We are developing
the product.''
   Between drags on Marlboro cigarettes and gulps from shot glasses
of his vodka, Yamnikov told reporters that ``the temptation is
enormous'' for his employees to help themselves to vodka whose
domestic sales have been restricted.
   White-uniformed Zhena Buganova, a plump blonde in her 50s who
inspects the passing bottles of Stolichnaya, said workers are
allowed to take some of the vodka only during holidays, and only if
they pay for it.
   Vodka for domestic consumption, such as the Pshenichnaya label,
is produced with less care and at a faster pace, using older
equipment that breaks down frequently. To comply with government
orders to slash production by 43 percent, only three of the five
domestic bottling lines are operating.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported in late 1987 that
out of a Soviet population of more than 284 million people, there
were more than 4.5 million ``registered'' alcoholics, of whom about
1 million required compulsory care.
   Yamnikov said Gorbachev's sales and production curbs are not the
best way to combat alcoholism.
   ``The main reason for alcoholism is a lack of self-discipline,''
he said. Yamnikov believes Soviets should be taught to drink in
moderation through ``social education.''
   The high prices and limited availability of alcoholic beverages
has driven many Soviet drinkers to illegal moonshining. The labor
newspaper Trud reported recently that moonshiners actually are
outproducing the legal alcoholic industry.
   Export vodka is treated here as though it were liquid gold, a
valuable source of hard foreign currency. A law that took effect
this year allows Yamnikov's factory to receive up to 20 percent of
its income in hard currency, he said. The rest goes to the
government.
   Yamnikov looks to the day when the Crystal plant will produce
only vodka for export. He says he will use his share of the hard
currency to buy foreign bottling and packaging equipment and
improve social services for his 1,200 employees.

   After three years of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms, the underpinnings of the Soviet economy have been
strengthened but people are still standing in long lines for scarce
supplies of food and shoddy consumer goods.
   ``Unfortunately the majority of Soviet families are not
witnessing the material benefits of perestroika,'' Abel Aganbegyan,
the Soviet leader's chief economic adviser, said at a presummit
news conference.
   Under Gorbachev's ``perestroika'' policy of economic
restructuring, he said, the Soviet Union is building more housing,
producing more milk and meat, and spending more money on health
care and education.
   The Soviet people, however, are still awaiting the fruits of
perestroika as Gorbachev and President Reagan hold their fourth
round of summit talks this week. They have queued even for such
basic items as sugar, of which the Soviet Union produces more than
any other country.
   Aganbegyan said Gorbachev and his advisers are seeking a
breakthrough in consumer goods and services in the next two or
three years.
   As reforms take hold, he said, Soviet authorities should be able
to stop food imports by the mid-1990s and start buying a few more
foreign consumer goods to satisfy a huge, pent-up domestic demand.
   But Aganbegyan says that in the meantime, two key elements _
price reform and creation of a convertible currency _ must be put
into place.
   Another more radical economist, Nikolai Shmelev of the Soviets'
U.S.A. and Canada Institute, says reforms must seek to end the
economy's chronic inefficiency.
   According to Shmelev:
   _ 20 percent of the country's production capacity lies idle
because of a labor shortage, while other sectors of the economy are
overstaffed by 25 percent. ``Some 25 percent of our manpower could
be released tomorrow and there would be no effect on production,''
he said.
   _ The Soviet Union manufactures seven times as many tractors as
the United States but must import American food.
   _ The Soviets produce more shoes per capita than any nation but
still imports shoes to meet consumer demand for fashion and good
quality.
   _ An estimated 200 billion rubles ($320 billion) languish in
savings accounts because there is no way the money can be invested
or used to buy goods and services.
   Perestroika aimed to decentralize control over the Soviet
economy by giving local managers a greater share of the
responsibilities and choices now exercised by Moscow bureaucrats.
Gorbachev also is trying to encourage a small cooperative sector to
provide consumer items that a state-operated economy cannot.
   The Communist Party Central Committee, in a report adopted
Monday for a party conference to be held next month, said
Gorbachev's reforms had pulled the economy away from the brink of
crisis.
   Aganbegyan said 3.4 million new apartments are being built every
year. The party and government also have begun a costly
hospital-building program, invested an additional 11 billion rubles
($18 billion) in education _ including teacher pay raises _ and
have boosted food production by 8 percent over the average of the
previous five-year plan.
   Price reforms, which are to take effect in the early 1990s, must
reduce the 60 billion rubles ($100 billion) the Soviet government
pays every year in subsidies for bread, milk, meat and other foods,
Aganbegyan said.
   The subsidies may be trimmed to between 10 billion and 20
billion rubles, he said, but probably cannot be eliminated entirely.
   Aganbegyan and other economists have promised consumers the
state will compensate them for higher prices. No price reform
details have been announced.
   Price reform is being touted as the first step toward making the
ruble convertible.
   Such a move probably would result in a sharp drop in the ruble's
value against Western currencies, compared to current official
Soviet rates. But convertibility would stimulate the foreign trade
needed by the Soviets to buy modern technology and enter into joint
business with foreign companies.
   If other economic reforms take hold, Aganbegyan said, the Soviet
Union then would begin importing more goods to give its consumers a
wider selection.

<TEXT>
   A leading scholar who left the Soviet
Union in 1975 to teach at Yale University is suing the school,
claiming it misrepresented its retirement policy.
   Sebastian Shaumyan, an expert in mathematical linguistics,
receives about $19,800 annually _ a $750-a-month pension from Yale
and $900 a month in Social Security benefits. He earned about
$55,000 a year when he retired in 1986.
   He claimed, in a lawsuit filed in New Haven Superior Court, that
Yale didn't explain its retirement plan, including that he would
have to retire at 70. He's seeking a settlement of about $240,000
and an improved pension, his attorney said.
   Dorothy Robinson, Yale's general counsel, said handbooks
distributed to Yale professors in 1978, 1981 and 1984 informed them
of Yale's policy.
   Yale spokesman Walter Littell declined to comment on the lawsuit.

   French Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy and West
German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are satisfied with the
U.S. dollar's current level against the major world currencies,
officials said Monday.
   The meeting among Beregovoy, Stoltenberg and other top economic
and monetary officials was one of a regular series of bilateral
consultations between France and Germany.
   Karl-Otto Poehl, president of the West German Bundesbank, said
he hoped the recent weakness of the Deutsche mark in foreign
exchange trading is temporary, Economics Ministry officials said.
   Beregovoy and Stoltenberg also reaffirmed the importance of
stabilizing the dollar at around its current levels, the officials
added. In a joint declaration, they called for continued monetary
stability.
   Referring to the French government's desire to reduce interest
rates, the ministers said they intend to remain in close contact on
the subject.
   The French monetary authorities moved last week to lower key
money market interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.
   Beregovoy, who was appointed two weeks ago, has said real, or
inflation-adjusted interest rates in France are the highest among
the major industrial countries and that they are about two
percentage points too high compared with German rates.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 29 years, Wilbur Hany was the loyal company
man, working at the General Electric Co. plant in Bloomington, Ill.
   But he found his years of service didn't protect his job and,
like thousands of older workers, he has sued his former employer
charging age discrimination.
   ``I never thought it would come to this,'' said Hany, who now
makes ends meet by doing yard work and other odd jobs.
   ``No doubt I was a company man. I built a house within two miles
of the job so I could be closer to it,'' he said. ``Now I got house
payments and no job.''
   As companies lay off older workers to save money, many former
employees are fighting back with lawsuits.
   Just this month in Illinois, nearly 40 former managers of
Caterpillar Inc. in Peoria and about 50 ex-employees of a Wilson
Foods Corp. meat plant in Monmouth filed suits charging age
discrimination.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Washington has
reported a substantial increase in the number of age discrimination
charges nationwide in the last five years.
   In 1987, the commission received 11,627 complaints, up from
13,854 in 1986 and 9,207 in 1982.
   Thomas J. Goger, editor-in-chief of the Washington-based
Research Institute of America Inc., which focuses on employment
law, said age discrimination complaints ``are occurring at a faster
rate today due, in part, to corporate restructuring.''
   But if companies retain employees solely on the basis of
seniority, they may face complaints from recently hired workers
under an affirmative action plan, Goger said.
   He advised businesses facing cutbacks to take great care in
handling layoffs by carefully documenting the reasons for their
decisions.
   The lawsuit filed by the former Wilson employees contends that
workers near retirement age lost out on severance benefits when the
company closed the Monmouth plant and laid off 600 workers as part
of a restructuring plan in 1986.
   Landon Toland, a spokesman for Wilson, said the Monmouth plant
was sold to another company last year. He declined comment on the
suit.
   The suit against Caterpillar, the manufacturer of farm and heavy
equipment, contends that managers in their 50s who took
``voluntary'' retirement were forced to accept the company's offer.
The managers were told that they were facing dismissal or demotions
if they did not retire, the suit alleges.
   These managers settled for a pension plan that paid them
one-third to one-fourth of what they had been earning, the suit
said. They are seeking lost wages, benefits and pensions as well as
reinstatement to their old jobs.
   Caterpillar called the suit ``unfounded.''
   The company, in a prepared statement, said it had to cut its
salaried work force in Peoria by 25 percent because it was
suffering from ``a severe and unprecedented business recession in
the '80s.''
   Margaret Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the EEOC in Washington,
says most age discrimination complaints are settled quietly out of
court with a monetary award.
   But some cases like Hany's involve extensive litigation.
   General Electric is appealing a jury's decision in favor of Hany
and 14 other former workers that found the company guilty of
engaging in age discrimination at its Bloomington plant.
   Tom Palette, a GE spokesman in Bloomington, declined comment on
the pending litigation.
   Despite the suit, Hany still has fond memories of his job. ``I
loved what I did and the people I worked with,'' he said. ``Shoot,
I'd go back to work tomorrow for them and be glad.''

   The Senate seems prepared to sustain President
Reagan's trade veto but the administration's supporters are pushing
for quick approval of a more moderate version, the bill's sponsors
say.
   ``We're in a position where it will be extremely difficult to
have a second bill,'' Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, told reporters last week following a 308-113
House vote to override Reagan's veto.
   Reagan vetoed the measure, focusing largely on its provision to
require companies to provide their employees with 60-day notice of
plant closings and large-scale layoffs. Within hours, the House
replied by voting to enact the bill over the president's objections.
   The Senate appears set to vote on the override move when
lawmakers return from this week's Memorial Day recess, but sponsors
are frank to say they doubt their chances of duplicating their
success in the House.
   ``It's an uphill fight,'' Bentsen said. ``We have to have
another three votes and at this point, I don't know where they
are.''
   But talk persists of a revised bill that would sail through
Congress once the smoke over the first one cleared. House Minority
Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., raised it as a possibility and
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., declared it the most
likely outcome.
   Sponsors see as one weak link in the administration's armor the
raft of special goodies that lawmakers tucked into the bill and
which they would like to deliver to the constituents this year.
   One example: The bill would repeal the 1980 windfall profits tax
on oil companies. The tax is hated in Texas as one that singles out
an industry that has been suffering since oil prices took a dive in
1985.
   ``I get paid to take political risks,'' Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, told reporters after voting against the legislation. He
was critical of the plant-closings provision, which he said would
hurt the economy.
   He also has been predicting legislation later this year that
will repeal the windfall tax. Possibly a stripped-down trade bill.
   Indeed, a chorus ranging from U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
K. Yeutter to the National Association of Manufacturers has been
calling for a new bill once the Senate sustains Reagan's veto of
the current one.
   ``Once the president's veto is sustained in the Senate, we and
our more than 13,000 manufacturing members will throw all our
weight behind a new, unencumbered trade bill,'' said a statement
from Alexander B. Trowbridge, president of the National Association
of Manufacturers.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said he had already ``been contacted by
three different industries in Illinois who want amendments'' on a
revised bill ``and if it's happening in Illinois, it's happening in
New York, it's happening in Wyoming, it's happening all over.''
   He said he told the industries, however, that ``I think it's
unlikely that a second bill is going to emerge.''
   Lawmakers are all but universal is saying such a stripped-down
bill just might win approval in the House, where leaders can clear
the way and shove aside cumbersome amendments that could bog down
the measure.
   The Senate is another matter. The bill's supporters have been
raising the prospect of a galaxy of amendments designed to please
business and other interests back home on election eve and a rash
of filibusters to go with them.
   In fact, Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said earlier that he
would filibuster any stripped down bill unless it contained the
plant-closings.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd has not closed the door on
getting such a measure through the Senate. but he has said
repeatedly that ``there cannot be a quick turnaround'' on the
issue, that under Senate rules it would be very difficult to get
such legislation through in the time remaining this year and that
anyone pinning his hopes on a second bill is being ``naive.''

<HEAD>Trade Official: Taiwan Becoming Lead Foreign Investor In
Philippines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan is replacing the United States
and Japan as the main foreign investor in the Philippines, Trade
Secretary Jose Concepcion said Monday.
   The government has predicted that foreign investment will grow
from $420 million last year to between $1 billion and $1.5 billion
by the end of this year, Concepcion said.
   The United States is expected to account for between 25 percent
and 30 percent of the total, with Japan accounting for about 20
percent.
   ``If we look at a billion dollars, probably 40 percent will be
from Taiwan,'' Concepcion said. He attributed the increase to an
appreciation of the Taiwan dollar, the Philippines' proximity to
Taiwan and low labor costs here.
   He said the Taiwanese also were becoming less interested in
investing elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
   ``Thailand has begun to cool off as far as investments,''
Concepcion said. ``They are putting more restrictions, and so we
are seeing more of these investments coming in.''
   Taiwanese investments in the Philippines have centered on the
plastics and garment industries.
   Concepcion appeared at a breakfast forum to discuss U.S.
proposals for a massive aid program for the Philippines known here
as a ``mini-Marshall plan.''
   The secretary said he favored using any funds to build up the
country's agriculture, which accounts for about 70 percent of
export earnings.
   ``What we need is not the `mini-Marshall plan' but an
agro-industrial plan which would beef up our economy,'' he said.
   U.S. officials have not disclosed details, but the Washington
Post said last month that the United States would work with its
allies to put together a $10 billion package modeled after the
Marshall plan that rebuilt Japan and Western Europe after World War
II.

<HEAD>English Professors Tutor Judges To Improve Writing Of Legal
Opinions</HEAD>

   A ``judicial writing SWAT team'' is taking aim
at judicial and legal gobbledygook.
   Or as the lawyers might say, said parties of the first part are
endeavoring to render obsolete henceforth what has heretofore been
an overabundance of wherefores and whereases of the said parties of
the second part.
   The self-described team is a group of English professors from
the University of Maryland at College Park who have traveled the
country for 10 years teaching judges how to get to the point.
   ``Lucidity and clarity _ that's what we're after,'' said Robert
Coogan, one the professors.
   The writing course, running two to five days, brings common
sense formulas to courtroom prose, said Charles Rutherford, a
College Park instructor.
   Often times, judges will make their decision in the last
paragraph on the last page, forcing the reader to wade through page
after page of legal prose.
   ``It's like reading an Agatha Christie novel,'' said Rutherford.
   One of the legal writing tenets taught at the seminars says an
opinion should start with an introduction of the case's
circumstances to orient the readers, followed by the decision and
an orderly outline of the issues and legal precedent.
   ``You have to take the reader by the hand,'' said Rutherford.
   Archaic words and common repetitive phrases such as ``in
connection with'' and ``pertaining to,'' or ``null and void''
should be used as infrequently as possible, according to the
tutors. ``If the crime was committed at the Seven-Eleven store they
(judges) might say `said store' in their decisions. We come down
hard on that,'' Rutherford said. ``You'd never think of saying that
in a conversation unless you're a really constipated person.''
   The result, said Rutherford, is a shorter, more efficient
opinion less characterized by the usual words of the profession _
and much more readable.
   Judge Jonathan J. Kaplan, of the Superior Court in Hartford,
Conn., recently took the course.
   ``The first day of the seminar I was told one of opinions was
`numbingly long.' And it was true,'' said Kaplan. ``My very first
paragraph was a page and a half long. You're going to lose your
reader that way.''
   Latin still has its hooks in legal writing because it was the
original language of the law.
   The root of the writing problems dates back to 14th century
English common law. Ideas were expressed more than once because, as
common law developed, three languages _ Latin, French, and English
_ were used.
   Kaplan said judges in general simply don't learn how to write
clearly and succinctly.
   ``When you become a lawyer or a judge, you become more and more
verbose,'' he said.
   The seminar, said Kaplan, has made his writing easier and more
readable.
   Judge Paul Gartzke, of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, agreed
that most judges are rarely good writers.
   ``Everyone that graduates from college thinks they can write.
Then when they graduate from law school they believe they can write
and then when they become judges they realize they're all wrong and
they can't write legal opinions,'' said Gartzke, who's taken the
writing course with the university's professors several times.
   ``Judges flounder around in their written opinions. Imagine the
poor devil that has to read them,'' said Gartzke.
   States require judges to take a varying number of continuing
education credits a year and the writing course is one of many
possible options.
   ``They accept what we can say. We acknowledge their superiority
on legal matters and if we make a mistake they jump on us,'' said
Coogan.

   Irish Distillers Group Ltd., maker of
Jameson's Irish whiskey, on Monday rejected takeover offer that
values the company at 168.7 million pounds, or about $312 million.
   The offer, proposed by a new company jointly set up by the
liquor groups Cantrell and Cochrane Group Ltd. and Gilbeys of
Ireland Ltd., values Irish Distillers at 268 pence, or $4.96, a
share.
   Gerry Dempsey, chairman of the takeover group, said the
acquisition would help expand whiskey sales in Ireland and abroad
and give the Irish economy a boost.
   In a statement, Irish Distillers' board of directors called the
bid ``totally unacceptable, unsolicited and unwelcome.''
   In addition to Jameson's, Irish Distillers, one of the country's
largest public companies, produces other well known brands
including Bushmills, Paddy, and Powers, as well as Cork Dry Gin and
Huzzar vodka. It also operates cash-and-carry food outlets.

<TEXT>
   King Fahd on Monday reiterated the
need for OPEC members to stick to the cartel's quotas and prices so
that the world oil market will stabilize.
   ``If intentions be pure and all member states abide by the OPEC
rulings ... this will be in the interest of all oil producing and
consuming states alike,'' Fahd was quoted by Saudi Press Agency as
saying at the Cabinet's weekly session.
   Fahd had expressed the same view ahead of April's meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, where
ministers discussed means of propping up the flagging oil prices
around an $18-a-barrel benchmark.
   Six non-OPEC oil producers earlier had proposed a 5 percent cut
in output by oil producers inside and outside the cartel, a demand
backed by Iran. But it was rejected by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
countries within OPEC, and the meeting ended inconclusively.
   The issue will be taken up again when the cartel convenes again
on June 8 in Vienna.
   Saudi Arabia is the leading OPEC member state, and sits on more
than a quarter of the world's oil proven reserves.
   Separately, a report issued by the Saudi Arabian Monetary
Agency, the kingdom's equivalent of a central bank, showed the oil
sector's contribution to the gross national product had dropped
from 55 percent a decade ago to 30 percent last year.
   The report said that this affirmed the success of the kingdom's
efforts to diversify its economy away from dependence on crude oil
exports.
   The private sector's share in the GNP rose from 30 percent 10
years ago to 49 percent in 1987, while non-petroleum exports
increased from $31.5 million to $2.1 billion in 1987, the report
said.
   Dependence on imports dropped from 70 percent of total demand 10
years ago to 43 percent last year, it said.
   The main Saudi exports are petrochemicals, but the kingdom also
is developing an agricultural base and has begun exporting produce
to other countries.
   The report said petrochemicals contributed 11 percent to GNP and
agriculture 7 percent last year, compared with 6.5 percent and 3
percent a decade ago, respectively.

   World champions in recycling, the thrifty Swiss
are collecting more valuable waste than they can handle.
   Symbols of the nation's steadily rising drive to reuse can be
seen on most any street: neatly tied bundles of old newspapers and
bags of used clothes are regularly piled on sidewalks for
collection. Consumers dump used glass in a nationwide network of
blue steel containers, often located at supermarkets.
   Tossing in a shopping bag's worth of bottles has become
practically second nature for the beer and wine-loving Swiss.
   One Geneva foreign resident recounts he once put down a load of
empty bottles while briefly returning to his car. Meanwhile, a man
who happened to walk past dropped them into a nearby container.
   Why do the Swiss save things that others more often consider
garbage? Environmental concerns, a tradition of self-sufficiency in
a small, landlocked country with few natural resources and a highly
developed transport network are some explanations.
   ``The Swiss are becoming increasingly environment-conscious,''
said Albert Weiss, director of Vetrorecycling, Switzerland's sole
glass bottle recycler. The company commends ``an intelligent and
disciplined population.''
   Most bottles carry deposits, usually 50 centimes, or about 35
cents, and are returned to bottling plants via stores. To combat
the rising mountain of household garbage, the Swiss milk industry
will replace cardboard cartons with old-fashioned returnable
bottles for a six-month trial this fall.
   Non-return bottles usually land in recycling containers, to
which virtually all of Switzerland's 6.5 million people have easy
access. Most separate colors into green, brown and transparent.
   About three-quarters of all glass bottles and jars in
Switzerland are recycled. Last year, 140,000 metric tons were
brought back, up 53 percent from 1981.
   ``We motivated consumers from the start by paying local
communities for old glass _ 8 million Swiss francs (about $5.7
million a year) _ and publishing collection results,'' Weiss says
of a program launched in 1972.
   But the Swiss, who also consume French wine and German beer,
have an annual glass surplus pile of several thousand tons. Last
month, the first Swiss factory turning powdered old glass into
insulating foam began operation.
   On another front, local activists have launched collection
drives for bottles made from a new type of plastic that can be
reprocessed into foil or fibers.
   Old clothes find a new life, too. At least twice yearly, all
Swiss household receive colored plastic bags with an appeal to
donate used jackets, dresses, socks and shoes that are clean and
wearable.
   Some 15,000 tons were collected last year and one third was
shipped to less developed countries. Most of the rest is sold
second-hand or recycled into yarn and, for example, dishrags.
   ``No other European country is as organized and intensive,''
said Beat Alder, head of Texaid, which coordinates six of the nine
collection organizations.
   Paper is reused again and again in this country where
supermarket grocery bags cost 14 cents each.
   Some 553,000 tons of used paper and cardboard were retrieved
last year. Swiss industry didn't need it all, despite using the
highest proportion of recycled paper in the world, 44 percent.
Exports, generally to neighboring countries, rose 18 percent.
   Thriftiness and social welfare are combined by the state
telecommunications monopoly PTT, which sells old telephone books
brought back by customers to recyclers. The proceeds bought 455
radios and televisions for the handicapped and elderly last year.
   Aluminum recycling is not big in Switzerland, mainly because few
drinks are sold in cans and too little is collected for economical
reuse, said Hans-Peter Fahrni of the Federal Environmental
Protection Office.
   But meanwhile, old engine oil is used in the cement industry.
The town of Moudon has a factory that turns household waste into
construction bricks. And more than half of all garbage is burned at
plants that generate heat for Swiss homes.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp. paid a $250,000
state fine for selling and advertising apple juice for babies that
was actually apple-flavored sugar water, state officials said
Monday.
   Beech-Nut, based in Fort Washington, Pa., and two of its
executives were named in November 1986 federal indictments for
shipping 5 million jars of misbranded and adulterated apple juice
for babies between 1978 and 1983.
   The product was actually made from synthetic concentrate and
contained little or no apple juice, authorities discovered.
   The juice had been bottled at the firm's Canajoharie plant in
central New York.
   In addition to the federal charges, Beech-Nut also faced charges
of violating the state's agriculture and markets law. The state
case against Beech-Nut was closed with payment of the fine, state
Attorney General Robert Abrams said.
   ``The magitude of the penalty sends a clear message to the food
processing industry that false labeling is a serious offense,
especially when the product is food intended for babies and young
children,'' he said.
   A telephone recording at Beech-Nut headquarters said all offices
were closed Monday.
   Beech-Nut pleaded guilty last fall to 215 counts of violating
federal food and drug laws and agreed to pay a $2 million fine.
   In February, two of Beech-Nut's former executives were convicted
on hundreds of violations of federal food and drug laws along with
conspiracy and mail fraud charges.
   Two Beech-Nut employees had testified for the prosecution that
they repeatedly warned executives that the concentrate was phony.
The company claimed that the fault remained with the supplier of
the apple juice concentrate.
   There were no allegations that the juice caused any health
problems.
   In May 1987, Beech-Nut, a subsidiary of Nestle Inc., settled a
class-action suit that was filed in federal court in Philadelphia
in response to the Brooklyn indictment.
   In that case, the company agreed to set up a $5 million cash
fund for consumers and to provide $2.5 million in Beech-Nut and
affiliated products to retailers.

<TEXT>
   The results of a six-year investigation into
Italy's biggest banking scandal have been handed over to a state
prosecutor who will decide which of 50 people accused will stand
trial, cources said Monday.
   Court sources said the decision by Deputy State Prosecutor Pier
Luigi Dell'Osso is expected by the end of the year in the case
stemming from the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.
   Investigating magistrates Renato Bricchetti and Antonio Pizzi of
Milan have accused about 50 people of being accessories to
fradulent bankruptcy, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years
in prison.
   Those originally charged by the investigators included U.S.
Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus and two other senior officials of the
Vatican bank, which held a major stake in Banco Ambrosiano.
   However, a court recently ruled the three Vatican officials _
Marcinkus, Luigi Mennini and Pellegrino De Strobel _ can not be
tried by an Italian court. Italy's highest Constitutional Court has
not yet handed down its decision in the case.
   At the time of the collapse, Marcinkus was the head of the
Institute for Religious Works (IOR), the formal title of the
Vatican bank.
   Investigators say Banco Ambrosiano, Italy's largest private
bank, failed because a $1.3 billion loan made to 10 Latin American
dummy companies controlled by the IOR was not repaid.
   Others named in the investigation included Licio Gelli, the
Italian financier who headed an outlawed masonic lodge, his aide
Umberto Ortolani, Italian financier Anna Bonomi Bolchini and 25
board members and officials of the collapse bank.
   Gelli was a close friend of Roberto Calvi, the secretive
chairman of Banco Ambrosiano who was found hanging from a London
bridge in June 1982, two months before his bank declared bankruptcy.

<HEAD>Baker Calls Third World Debt An Economic Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAKAR, Senegal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said
Monday the Third World debt crisis must be treated as a economic
problem rather than a political one, with each country's case
handled individually.
   ``The debt question cannot be regulated in a global manner,''
Baker told reporters after meeting with Senegalese President Abdou
Diouf. ``Debt structures are not the same from one country to
another.''
   A solution to the debt problem, Baker said, would be found with
international cooperation. He pointed to Senegal as a country that
has achieved a certain level of credibility through its economic
development and recent successes in controling its budget deficit.
   Baker is scheduled to leave Tuesday for the Ivory Coast, where
he is expected to deliver an address on the Third World debt
problem to the board of governors of the African Development Bank.
   Baker praised Senegal's multi-party political system, saying the
country had passed an important test during the February elections,
which returned Diouf to a second elected term and retained the
ruling Socialist Party's majority in the National Assembly.
   Opponents claimed Diouf's party rigged votes to win re-election.
The government imposed a state of emergency on the Dakar region
after three days of severe rioting in the city. The state of
emergency was lifted May 17.
