   Both sides reported progress at the
second round of South Africa-Angola talks which ended Friday and
said the talks would lead to further meetings soon involving the
United States and Cuba.
   The governments are seeking an end to conflicts in southern
Africa that include a civil war in Marxist Angola and a war for
independence in South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   South Africa's foreign minister, Roelof Botha, said, ``I hope
that what we have started would one day be rewarded with peace,
stability and prosperity for the whole of southern Africa.
   ``We are both agreed that there can be no military solution for
our continent and in particular for southern Africa.''
   The South African delegation was exuberant and clearly
considered its reception in this socialist nation a triumph.
   Botha exchanged gifts with Foreign Minister Antoine Ndinga-Oba
of the Congo before leaving for home.
   Congolese sources said Botha met privately with President Denis
Sassou Nguesso, one of the continent's most vocal opponents of
apartheid, South Africa's policy of racial separation.
   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Justice Minister Fernando Van-Dunem led Angola's delegation.
   ``We do know what each other wants and we cleared our stance,''
he said.
   Angolan and South African officials said U.S. and Cuban
diplomats would attend the next session of talks. Both nations
attended talks last week in London aimed at a regional peace
settlement.
   The U.S. administration seeks withdrawal of an estimated 40,000
Cuban soldiers from Angola. Cuba says its forces are there to help
Angola fend off South African incursions. Rebels who have been
fighting a guerrilla war for 13 years, seeking to overthrow the
Angolan government, are supported by the United States.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO, also is
fighting a bush war trying to force South Africa to leave
South-West Africa, commonly known as Namibia, and for Namibia to
become independent.
   Friday's four-hour talks were held in a small, government-owned
villa and ended on a cordial note with each side thanking the other
for its frankness.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $10 Million to Brain-Damaged Boy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury awarded $10 million Friday to a
Northern Virginia child who suffered irreversible brain damage
during birth.
   The four-man, two-woman U.S. District Court jury decided on the
award after hearing testimony that three doctors named in the case
did not act quickly when tests indicated the baby's heart rate was
slowing.
   Jack Olender, attorney for 3-year-old Edward Leahy, Jr., said he
believed it was the largest medical malpractice award ever in the
District of Columbia.
   Olender said obstetricians Richard Newman, Julian Safran, and
Stephen Horwitz performed an emergency caesarian section delivery
about four hours after problems were first noticed.
   The operation was not conducted in time to prevent the child
from suffering irreversible brain damage, Olender said.
   ``He's unable to walk, talk, or feed himself,'' said Olender.
``Everything has to be done for him.''
   The judgment is about $6 million dollars greater than the
malpractice insurance policy held by the doctors, who are in
partnership.
   The child's parents, Edward R. and Patricia Leahy of McLean,
Va., will receive no compensation in the award, Olender said.
Instead, the money will be placed in a trust fund under court
approval and used for the child's care.
   Attorneys for the doctors did not say whether an appeal of the
verdict or award is planned.
   Problems in the birth arose around 4 a.m. on Dec. 11, 1984, when
an electronic fetal monitor indicated that the child's heart rate
was slowing, Olender told the court.
   In such cases, a declining heart rate often indicates a shortage
of oxygen, usually resulting from a pinching of the umbilical cord,
and emergency caesarian section deliveries are usually performed as
soon as the problem is discovered, Olender asserted.
   The emergency operation did not take place until 9:15 a.m.
   Columbia Hospital for Women _ the Washington, D.C. hospital
where the birth took place _ originally was named in the suit, but
was dropped from the case when it agreed to pay $800,000 in a
settlement.

<HEAD>Publisher Gets Nine-Month Sentence For Printing Statements Denying
Holocaust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A publisher convicted in a retrial of maliciously
publishing statements denying the Holocaust was sentenced Friday to
nine months in jail.
   Ernst Zundel, 49, arrived at the district courthouse bearing a
small coffin inscribed with the words ``Free Speech is Dead.''
   After his 1985 conviction he went to his sentencing carring a
heavy wooden cross, also signifying the demise of freedom of speech
in Canada.
   As in his earlier conviction, Zundel is seeking to appeal his
sentence and jury conviction and has applied for bail to keep him
out of jail at least until his appeal can be considered. But he had
to start the weekend behind bars awaiting a bail decision.
   The West German immigrant won his first appeal and was granted a
new trial in district court that ended in the second conviction.
   Zundel, who operates Samisdat Publishers in Toronto, was charged
under a law forbidding publication of statements known to be false
or likely to cause injury or mischief to the public interest.
   Zundel was charged with publishing a booklet _ which he did not
write _ that denies official accounts of Nazis exterminating Jews
in wartime prison camps. The booklet says the horror stories about
the Holocaust were all a hoax and a fraudulent scheme by Zionists
to extract financial reparation from postwar Germany.
   However, Judge Ronald Thomas took judicial notice of the
Holocaust at the beginning of the trial, recognizing it as a
historical fact. From then on, Zundel's essential defense was that
he honestly believed the contents of the pamphlet and was not
knowingly spreading false news, as the charge alleged.
   Jewish leaders were happy with the verdict, saying it would
serve to protect ethnic minorities from social intolerance.
   The Canadian Jewish Congress said it ``demonstrates that
Canadians will not tolerate the vilification of ethnological
communities.
   ``It reaffirms the effectiveness of the Criminal Code in
upholding social and racial harmony,'' group officials said.
   B'nai B'rith Canada expressed confidence the outcome ``will
serve to deter hatemongers, no matter who their targets may be,
from pursuing their aim of dividing Canadian society and turning
some of us against our fellow citizens.''

   Police blamed a bad tip from an informant
for the mistaken drug raid that left a family frightened and sent
the father to a hospital with multiple cuts and bruises.
   ``These people are the victims of a tragic set of
circumstances,'' Newark Police Chief Ken Jones said Thursday.
   A police informant pointed out the Kim apartment as a place
where narcotics had been dealt, Jones said.
   Bok Hwan Kim, 49, said he was alone Tuesday in the living room
of the apartment he shares with his wife, three daughters and
78-year-old mother-in-law when police arrived outside his door.
   Seven or eight members of the three-department Southern Alameda
County Narcotics Enforcement Team swarmed into the house, put a gun
to Kim's head and wrestled him to the floor, Kim said.
   Attorney Shawn Steel said he plans to file a $1 million claim
against the city, the first step in filing a lawsuit.
   Kim, who was treated at a hospital for cuts and bruises about
the face, said the officers grabbed his wife, Jung Ja Kim,
handcuffed her and forced her to lie on the floor.
   Police have apologized to the family for the raid.
   The officers ransacked the house for more than a half-hour
before realizing they were not in the home of drug dealers, Kim
said.
   Jones disagreed, and said he believed that the officers did not
search the apartment beyond ``determining who was in the
apartment.''
   ``It is my understanding,'' Jones said, ``that shortly after
entering the building they realized they must have gotten bad
information and immediately backed off.''

<HEAD>Divorced Prom Escort Arrested On Charges Of Trespassing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SMITHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A divorced man who defied a principal's
prohibition against escorting a high school student to her prom was
promptly arrested on trespassing charges after arriving with his
date Friday.
   Troy Cripps III, dressed in a black tuxedo, was taken into
custody at the Dekalb County High School prom after arriving with
18-year-old Tammy Sliger, said Dekalb County sheriff's Deputy Steve
Johnson.
   Cripps, 23, was freed on $250 bond, Johnson said. He was
scheduled to appear in court May 25.
   Circuit Court Judge John Maddux had ruled earlier Friday that
the school board and Principal Ernest Ray could bar Cripps from
escorting Sliger to the dance.
   Ray had barred four divorced men from the prom after receiving
an anonymous letter threatening ``trouble'' if they were allowed to
attend, said school Superintendent Aubrey Turner.
   ``We felt that it was probably from one of the divorced wives,
saying they didn't feel the school should let this type of thing
occur,'' he said. ``There was a threat as far as just causing a
disturbance.''
   Sliger and Laura Lea Cooper, 17, asked the court for a
restraining order, arguing that that school officials were
discriminating against their dates because of age and marital
status, said Carolyn Todd, Sliger's mother.
   ``She's just crushed and her feelings were hurt so bad,'' Mrs.
Todd said after the court ruling.
   Turner conceded that the fact that the four men were divorced
may have disturbed some school officials.
   ``I can't say that that wasn't a factor, that might be a
secondary factor because that gets into morals,'' he said. ``The
primary factor was that there might be some problems, we have to
ensure a safe environment for their prom.''
   Mrs. Todd said that divorced people had been allowed to attend
the prom in the past and that school officials overreacted to the
anonymous letter.
   ``If they can keep people from going to the prom, then they can
keep people who write a threatening letter from coming into the
prom,'' she said.

   The Centers for Disease Control and the National
Education Association launched their first joint conference on AIDS
and education Friday with a focus on showing teachers how to teach
about the deadly disease.
   The three-day conference, expected to draw 100 educators from
around the country, is the latest event in what NEA President Mary
Hatwood Futrell described as her association's ``all-out war
against AIDS.''
   ``We are going to work with our members to determine what we can
do as an organization to raise the consciousness level of the
members of our profession,'' said Ms. Futtrell.
   The NEA is the nation's largest teacher union, with 1.9 million
members.
   ``The role of a teacher is a especially critical in dealing with
young people,'' she said. ``Children trust their teachers and they
will go to their teachers for information. We must have factual
information and know how to respond to young people.''
   Ms. Futrell added she hopes the conference will spur action on
AIDS education.
   ``We don't think we can wait five years,'' she said. ``We need
to begin to talk to young people now about changing their behavior
so they don't get the disease.''
   Friday's keynote speaker was John W. Washburn Jr., an AIDS
patient who is retired superintendent of the Brighton School
District near Rochester, N.Y.
   ``We've got a mission,'' Washburn said in an interview before
his address. ``The kids in our high schools are going to bear the
brunt of this disease and they're going to bear the cost.''
   Washburn, 48, was diagnosed last spring with AIDS and disclosed
his illness in January, when he embarked on a series of appearances
and speeches to educate high school and college students and
teachers about the disease.
   ``Exploit me,'' said Washburn. ``My time is limited. I want to
be exploited by whoever can use me to put windows on what is now
happening with AIDS and what is likely to happen.
   ``My years in public school work have groomed me. ... I'm not
embarrassed by the questions,'' said Washburn, who is homosexual.
   Other participants in the conference include researchers and
officials of the Atlanta-based CDC. Discussion will include ways to
incorporate AIDS education into the school curriculum.
   The NEA and the CDC's parent agency, the U.S. Public Health
Service, are members of the Health Information Network, created in
1987 in an AIDS education effort. Last fall, the network
distributed 1.9 million copies of a handbook for teachers on AIDS.
   AIDS has struck 973 American children under age 13; of those,
566 have died, according to the CDC. In all, AIDS has struck more
than 61,000 people in the United States, killing more than 34,000
of them.

<HEAD>IRS Says It Welcomes Suggestions From Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is promising that
next year's tax returns will be a little easier to understand,
thanks in part to a handful of college students.
   The students, working through the University of Akron's Center
for Taxation Studies, told a Senate subcommittee earlier this year
that tax forms and the instructions for filling them out can be
made simpler. They took their recommendations to the IRS Friday and
the IRS was impressed.
   ``We intend to look at the result of their wrestling with the
instructions, of our wrestling, and then use the best of both,''
said Arthur Altman, chairman of the agency's forms committee.
   ``It's a friendly effort,'' he added. ``There's going to be good
come out of it.''
   Nicholas Creme, director of the taxation center in northeast
Ohio, agreed. ``The 1040EZ and the 1040A should be a lot easier and
understandable come next January,'' he said.
   Students at the center, who help low-income taxpayers facing IRS
penalties, were spurred on by a study showing that more than half
of Americans cannot understand the instructions for the simplest
tax form, the 1040EZ.
   They tackled first the instructions for the 1040EZ and the
1040A, and presented these recommendations Friday. By July 1 they
hope to complete their proposed revisions of those two tax forms.
Later, they want to rewrite thusands of pages of tax regulations
and publications that are used by lawyers and other tax
professionals.
   Altman and leaders of the student effort met for more than an
hour Friday. ``It's a terrific experience to work with folks
outside our organization and give them an opportunity to stand in
our shoes,'' Altman said. He acknowledged, however, that ``We still
have a long way to go.''
   John Nye, an Akron law student, praised the IRS for its interest
in the effort. ``Many people don't realize the problems of taking
new tax laws and converting them into readable instructions,'' he
said. ``We're interested in getting a real good product for the
taxpayers.''
   Mary Ray, a Carnegie-Mellon University graduate student who is
serving as design consultant for the project, called it ``the type
of work we live for _ to take a document and see what it really
means, what the people really need to know.''
   The bulk of the suggestions for cleaning up the tax instructions
dealt with format and layout.
   One of the key suggestions was that a final checklist be
included in the instructions, since the IRS acknowledges that most
penalties are imposed because of mathematical errors. Another urged
that the instructions be written alongside the tax forms; another
called for fewer words and more white space on each page.
   The students also urged that the tone of the instructions be
made more friendly, by generous use of the word ``please.'' They
called for elimination of most of the multisyllable words and of
double and triple negatives.
   As an example of how the wording can be cleaned up, the students
pointed to a sentence in the instructions aimed at taxpayers who
don't get home-delivered mail.
   The instructions now read: ``If your post office does not
deliver mail to your street address and you have a post office box,
enter your post office box number on the line for your personal
home address instead of your street address.''
   The students' suggestion: ``If your mail is not delivered to
your home, and you have a post office box number, put that number
in the place of your street address.''

   A judge ordered actor Peter O'Toole to
return his 5-year-old son to a former girlfriend by Tuesday or face
fines and possible arrest.
   Monmouth County Superior Court Judge Alexander Lehrer issued the
order Friday after Raoul Felder, an attorney for Karen Sommerville
O'Toole, requested an arrest order because O'Toole had not returned
his son, Lorcan, by a May 7 deadline.
   O'Toole and his former girlfriend, a Navesink resident who has
taken the 55-year-old actor's name but never married him, have
joint custody of the boy. Last December, they agreed to switch
custody of Lorcan every three months until September 1989, when
they hope to reach a long-term agreement.
   O'Toole took Lorcan to London in February.
   His attorney, Jeffrey Weinstein, said O'Toole held on to the boy
because Ms. Somerville O'Toole violated the custody agreement by
firing Lorcan's nanny. ``Peter was acting ... in the interests of
Lorcan,'' Weinstein said.
   Lehrer scheduled a hearing on the custody case for June 14.
   O'Toole faces $1,000 a day in fines if he does not comply with
the order, Felder and Weinstein said.

Management in Sundance, Utah, which he founded.
   He also said two Soviet movie makers would visit his Sundance

   Redford said the agreements resulted from meetings in the past
four days with prominent members of both professions.
   Redford, long active as an environmentalist, also moderated a
two-day conference on depletion of the ozone layer in the upper

   Not everything, however, was conducted over a conference table.
Redford presided over the showing of eight of his movies in

   The baseball movie ``Shoeless Joe'' has two
new members of its team _ Burt Lancaster and Ray Liotta.
   Lancaster will play Dr. Archibald Graham, who under the moniker
``Moonlight Graham'' played one inning of one game for the New York
Giants in 1905, said publicist Dave Fulton.
   Liotta, who appears in the current movie ``Dominick and
Eugene,'' will play the title character of Shoeless Joe Jackson,
the baseball star who was disgraced in the 1919 Chicago Black Sox
scandal.
   Filming in the Dubuque area is scheduled to begin May 31, Fulton
said recently.
   The story centers on an Iowa farmer who hears a voice telling
him that if he builds a baseball diamond in his cornfield, Shoeless
Joe will return to the game. Kevin Costner has already been cast as
the farmer.
   The female lead for the movie has not been chosen, Fulton said.

   A 29-year-old man in the southern Chinese
province of Guangdong was executed for stealing 113 bicycles over
more than two years, an official newspaper reported today.
   The Legal Daily said the intermediate people's court of Shantou
had sentenced to death Xiao Guoqi, who was executed Friday, for
infringing on the legitimate property of citizens and jeopardizing
social order.
   It said Xiao stole $7,000 worth of bikes between March 1984 and
May 1986.
   An accomplice, Zheng Kundi, was sentenced to 13{ years in prison.
   China releases no figures on capital punishment, but is believed
to have executed more than 10,000 convicted criminals since
initiating an anti-crime drive in 1983. Murder, rape and multiple
thefts are among the most common crimes leading to execution,
normally a bullet to the back of the head.

   The lawyer for a woman convicted of poisoning two
people with cyanide said he wants a mistrial after a juror admitted
settling an unrelated product contamination lawsuit shortly before
the trial began.
   U.S. District Judge William Dwyer questioned jurors Friday about
whether they were improperly influenced during deliberations in the
nation's first death-by-product-tampering trial.
   Most of the questioning was directed at juror Laurel Holliday,
who has acknowledged being the lone holdout for Stella Nickell's
acquittal before switching her vote to guilty on Monday, the fifth
day of deliberation.
   Mrs. Nickell, 44, of Auburn, was convicted of five counts of
contaminating over-the-counter medicine capsules with cyanide. They
included two counts of spiking the Excedrin capsules that killed
her husband, Bruce Nickell, 52, and Susan Katherine Snow, 40, of
Auburn, in June 1986.
   She faces possible life imprisonment at a June 17 sentencing.
Prosecutors said she killed her husband to collect $176,000 in life
insurance.
   Before a verdict was reached, Ms. Holliday told Dwyer she had
received an anonymous phone call the previous Friday telling her
Mrs. Nickell had failed an FBI lie detector test. That information
was inadmissible at trial.
   After the verdict, it was revealed Ms. Holliday had filed a
lawsuit of her own last year in a contaminated product incident,
but had not mentioned that fact during jury selection.
   Ms. Holliday sued Pepperidge Farm Inc. after she bit into a
Goldfish cracker in July 1986 that she said contained an
aspirin-substitute pill. The matter was settled out of court for
$500, less than two months prior to Ms. Holliday's selection for
Mrs. Nickell's jury.
   Ms. Holliday told Dwyer she dismissed the anonymous call from
her mind and judged the case on the facts. She also said she did
not mention her own lawsuit during jury selection because she did
not think it was relevant.
   Ms. Holliday also said Friday that during the trial, she had
talked with friends about writing an article about her jury
experiences, but did not discuss facts of the case.
   After the unusual session Friday, defense lawyer Thomas Hillier
said he would file a mistrial motion within a week.
   ``The testimony of juror Holliday raised very serious and
troubling questions on her ability to sit on this jury,'' Hillier
said.
   Ms. Holliday's failure to reveal her own suit kept lawyers from
questioning her about that fact, Hillier said. Further, he said
there was no way to verify her statements that the phone call had
no effect on her decision.
   Federal prosecutor Joanne Maida declined to comment.

   Soldiers were called out Friday to
help dig for people missing in the rubble of a building collapse
that killed at least 13 the day before.
   Red Cross and state government officials confirmed the number
known dead and said 53 people were injured.
   Gilberto Sanchez, radio officer at police headquarters, said
about 60 soldiers from the army garrison joined firefighters,
police and volunteers in the rescue effort. Bulldozers and cranes
were brought from as far away as Salamanca, 78 miles to the
southwest.
   Aguascalientes, a city of about 500,000 people 320 miles
northwest of Mexico City, is the capital of Aguascalientes state.
   By late Friday, two or three people were believed still trapped
in the rubble, Celia de la Torre, a state government spokeswoman
said.
   Juan Diaz, head of special services for the local Red Cross,
said hundreds of people came to help in the rescue.
   At least 116 workers were in the building when the four upper
stories collapsed, said Diaz, reached by telephone from Mexico City.
   ``Relatives of the victims practically attacked the ambulances,
trying to identify'' the victims, he said.
   The building, still under construction, consisted of three
basements, a main floor and three upper stories.
   As workers were about to pour the last concrete late Thursday
afternoon, it collapsed onto a furniture factory that occupied the
ground floor and part of the basement area.
   Lower floors of buildings in Mexico often are occupied while the
upper stories are constructed.
   Roberto Padilla, an Aguascalientes state government spokesman,
said the state attorney general's office was investigating the
collapse of the building, which was three blocks from the main
plaza and the state capitol.
   Jorge Castaneda, head of the Aguascalientes Civil Engineers
Association, said a committee of engineers and architects also
would investigate.
   Juan Navarro, a police duty officer, said by telephone: ``They
were apparently pouring fresh concrete when it caved in. Apparently
the building did not resist the weight.''
   Juan Flores, a survivor who was buried for five hours, was
quoted by the Excelsior news agency as saying:
   ``I had finished working and was about to leave when ... all of
a sudden everyone started yelling hysterically that there was an
earthquake. I dashed under a table and all of a sudden everything
went dark, and there was this terrific noise and there was dust
everywhere.''
   He said a slab of concrete fell on the table and ``that is what
protected me from the rest of the debris.''
   Flores said he was quiet at first, but ``the fear and the
anguish of being buried ... impelled me to yell very loud, and the
rescue squads dug me out.'' Earlier Friday, the Red Cross had
reported 18 killed and 96 injured.
   Juan Manuel Diaz, the Red Cross duty officer at Aguascalientes,
said there had been confusion about reports from the scene. He did
not elaborate.

<HEAD>Senate Votes To Use Military Against Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has joined the House in ordering
the Pentagon to jump into the war on drugs even though lawmakers
say the plan won't solve America's illicit drug problems.
   ``I think we all know the drug epidemic in this country is far
past the stage where interdiction can stop it,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., agreed, noting that
ordering the military to help ``shows that we're serious about
drugs ... (but) I don't think anybody's certain how much impact
this will have.''
   Dole and Nunn were among the supporters Friday night as the
Senate voted 83-6 to order the military to join the anti-drug war,
including having Navy officers arrest suspected drug traffickers
who are stopped by U.S. warships in international waters.
   The plan was tacked on as an amendment to a Pentagon budget
bill, which the Senate is likely to approve early next week.
   Senate passage will send the measure to a House-Senate
conference committee to be reconciled with the different Pentagon
budget bill passed Wednesday by the House.
   That measure includes an even stronger anti-drug package,
ordering President Reagan to have the military seal U.S. borders
against drug traffickers.
   Senators trying to fashion an anti-drug plan for the military
had spent three days working out the details, with the arrest
provisions being the chief stumbling block.
   The military is prohibited from enforcing civilian laws by
tradition and by the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act. But that law is in
force only within the United States and its territorial waters and
the Navy arrest powers would be outside that jurisdiction.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, voted against the plan and criticized
his colleagues for voting ``in a great hysteria.''
   ``We're posturing on this,'' Glenn said. ``We all get up,
posture, make our little statements and it isn't going to make any
difference. ... This is not the mission for the military.''
   Military officials have generally opposed the plan, arguing that
military personnel are trained differently than civilian law
enforcement officials, and noting that traditionally there has been
a firm line drawn between civilian and military law enforcement.
   But Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci worked on the plan with
the senators, and Reagan approved it before the Senate voted, Dole
and other senators noted.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said he had originally opposed using
the military to fight drugs, but changed his mind because ``the
drug flow has reached flood tide ... we cannot ignore.''
   In other action on the bill Friday, the Senate:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Killed, 56-37, a proposal to permit the Navy to have just 14
deployable aircraft carriers, rather than the 15 the service says
it wants and needs. The proposal would have required the retirement
of the aging carriers Midway and Coral Sea faster than the Navy
wanted.
   _Defeated, 56-37, a plan to spend $100 million to begin
development of a system of protection against the accidental launch
by an enemy of nuclear weapons. The plan would have used technology
now being studied for early phase deployments of Reagan's Star Wars
anti-missile system.
   _Rejected, 51-43, a proposal to cut the budget for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known, from $4.6
billion to $4 billion and use the extra $600 million for a variety
of non-nuclear weapons. The House bill proposes $3.5 billion for
SDI.
   Voting against the drug amendment were Sens. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Dan
Evans, R-Wash.; Glenn; and Lowell Weicker, R-Conn.
   Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Albert Gore,
D-Tenn.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.; Chic Hecht,
R-Nev.; David Karnes, R-Neb.; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; John Kerry,
D-Mass.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; and Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo.

   Business leaders and Reagan
administration officials are betting that Democrats have worked too
hard to fashion trade legislation to scuttle it after President
Reagan's expected veto.
   ``Members of Congress have put a great deal of work in this
legislation and my judgment is that these persons will not wish to
see the bill disappear,'' U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K.
Yeutter said Friday. ``They have a great deal of time, effort,
energy and creativity invested in this piece of legislation.''
   Yeutter said he expected the president to deliver his veto
message to Congress next week, but he said he was optimistic about
it not meaning the end of the three-year effort to write the trade
bill.
   Although not specifically mentioning House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, by name, Yeutter noted that a provision repealing the
windfall oil profits tax is dear to the hearts of Texas legislators.
   ``I suspect it will be particularly difficult for them to
explain to Texas constituents that they were willing to drop a
piece of legislation so important to the state of Texas,'' he said.
   Yeutter spoke with reporters after addressing a private session
of the Business Council.
   Composed of 61 chief executives of the nation's largest
corporations, the council meets twice a year at the Homestead, a
posh resort in the mountains of southwestern Virginia.
   Reagan is vetoing the massive trade bill because of a provision
that would require companies to give 60 days' notice of plant
closings and major layoffs.
   The administration supports much of the 1,000-page bill, but
objects to the plant-closing provision, which Yeutter called
``onerous.''
   Yeutter said the technical language of the provision would
provide ``a field day for lawyers and a nightmare for American
businessmen'' by providing a legal basis for challenging virtually
every plant closing or layoff.
   American Express Co. Chairman James D. Robinson III, one of the
executives attending the retreat ending today, acknowledged that a
veto of the trade bill risked losing ``very constructive''
legislation, but he said, ``The business community is prepared to
take that risk.''
   ``It's been called simple plant-closing legislation, well it's
10 sections and 56 subsections and inconsistent language,'' he said.
   The business executives, in an economic report issued at the
start of their conference, predicted that last year's record trade
deficit of $171.2 billion would drop below $150 billion this year.
   But, the forecast, which reflects a consensus of the member
companies' chief economists, said the reduction would not be enough
to stem the fall of the dollar.
   It said the dollar, which has lost about half of its value
against the Japanese yen in two years, would fall from its present
level of 125 yen to about 115 yen by the end of 1989.
   John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank
holding company, said a substantial improvement in the trade
deficit was iminent because of the devalued dollar.
   A weaker dollar improves U.S. export prospects by lower the cost
of U.S. goods overseas.
   ``There is a price at which the trade balance will turn around,
and most of us think we're pretty close to it,'' Reed said.
   Generally, the executives' forecast painted a rosy picture of
moderate economic growth, manageable inflation and low unemployment.
   It said growth, as measured by the gross national product, would
be 2.4 percent this year, down from 3.8 percent last year.
   Inflation of consumer prices was expected to be 3.9 percent this
year, down from 4.4 percent in 1987. Unemployment, now at 5.4
percent, should remain under 6 percent through 1989, the executives
said.

<HEAD>Farmers A Little More Immune From Outside Economic Forces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A big question for farmers is whether the
general recovery in U.S. agriculture will continue long enough for
them to pull out of the financial mire that has gripped many since
the early 1980s.
   The Agriculture Department isn't making flat predictions about
that, but one of its economists says general economic conditions
``are not expected to make or break the U.S. agricultural sector''
during the next 18 months.
   Ralph Monaco of the department's Economic Research Service says
the next year and a half will be one of those periods when
``macroeconomic factors'' aren't likely to set the course for the
nation's farmers.
   By contrast, the financial crunch on farmers in the early '80s
sprang largely from events over which they had no control: a
worldwide recession, a rise in the value of the U.S. dollar against
foreign currencies, and high interest rates.
   For the last couple of years, however, the farm outlook has
improved dramatically, overall, and in 1987 USDA says the net cash
income of farmers was at a record level of $57 billion. This year's
forecast is down, perhaps in the range of $50 billion to $55
billion, because of higher production costs and a reduction in
federal payments.
   But Monaco, whose assessment was reported in this month's
Farmline magazine, says he is optimistic about the U.S. economy in
general and that he expects a replay of 1987 conditions.
   For the next year and a half, Monaco thinks, the real growth of
the U.S. economy will be about 3 percent a year, inflation will not
accelerate significantly (remaining at 3.5 percent to 4 percent
annually), interest rates will be relatively stable, and
unemployment will continue its slow decline.
   Some other Monaco's observations:
   _Both the federal budget deficit and the U.S. trade deficit
should continue to improve. The budget deficit dropped to $150
billion in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30 from $221
billion in 1986. The trade deficit improved in real terms by $10
billion last year, the first substantial gain since 1980.
   _Exports of both agricultural and non-agricultural products are
likely to continue gaining in 1988. A key factor has been the
decline in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies,
which makes it cheaper to buy U.S. products.
   _The improved exports and business investment should continue to
drive the current U.S. economic expansion, now in its sixth
straight year. In the 1983-86 period, however, the economy was led
by consumer and government spending.
   _Real growth, as measured by the nation's gross national
product, or GNP, has done well since 1982, the last recession year,
averaging a gain of 3.1 percent a year.
   ``In general, positive signs seem to prevail over recent
concerns about deficits and stock market volatility,'' Monaco said.
   But he added: ``Prospects for the rest of the world are less
favorable than for this country. Low export earnings and high debts
are still a serious problem for many developing countries. And
economic growth remains uneven around the world.''

   Farmers are hiring more workers this spring,
and they are paying more for them, according to an Agriculture
Department survey.
   The department said Friday that its survey last month indicated
958,000 hired workers were employed by farmers, compared with
885,000 in the comparable period of April 1987.
   Those did not include 224,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. Those were up from
188,000 a year earlier, the report said.
   Field work was hampered in some parts of the country by rain and
wet ground when the survey was taken during the week of April
10-16, the report said. But corn planting was getting under way in
most major production states and was about 6 percent completed by
the end of the week.
   Planting of cotton, spring wheat and other crops also took place
during the week surveyed.
   ``Lettuce harvest was just beginning in Salinas, Calif., and was
very active in the San Joaquin Valley,'' the report said. ``Harvest
of cantaloups, watermelons and honeydew melons progressed well in
Arizona. Florida's valencia orange harvest continued, and
grapefruit movement was strong.''
   The report said the national figures for hired workers had a
sampling error of 4.5 percent.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $5 per
hour, up from $4.90 a year earlier, the report said.
   For those workers provided by contractors, there was no national
wage rate available. However, workers in California averaged $5.68
per hour, down from $6.15 a year ago, while those in Florida
received an average of $6.15 per hour in April, up from $5.85 a
year ago, the report said.

   The Agriculture Department says wool and
mohair price supports will be down slightly this year.
   Shorn wool marketed in 1988 will be supported at $1.78 per
pound, down from $1.81 in 1987, the department said Friday.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said the support for 1988 mohair will be
$4.69 per pound, down from $4.95 last year.
   When market prices are depressed, wool and mohair producers get
federal payments to raise their earnings nationally to the
announced support level. This spring about $130 million in
subsidies are being paid to producers for wool and mohair sold in
1987.

   A father has been charged with murder
in the Oct. 30 death of his 7-week-old daughter whose five donated
organs kept 3-year-old Tabatha Foster alive for six months.
   Earl Franklin Shirks, 44, of Pennington Gap, was arrested late
Thursday and jailed without bond in the death of Heather Renee
Orick, said Lee County Sheriff Robert Chadwell.
   Shirks had told authorities at the time that she was injured in
an auto accident.
   Chadwell declined to reveal the cause of the girl's death.
   Heather's liver, pancreas and parts of her stomach, small
intestine and colon were donated to Tabatha, a Madisonville, Ky.,
toddler whose five-organ transplant in Pittsburgh received national
attention. She died Wednesday.
   Shirks took his daughter to Lee County Community Hospital on
Oct. 8. The child died 22 days later at Children's Hospital at Fort
Sanders Hospital in Knoxville.
   In an interview after his daughter's organs were donated, Shirks
said Heather was in a little seat on the console of his car when he
slammed on the brakes to avoid another vehicle. He said she struck
her head on the gear shift.

<HEAD>Chinese, Taiwanese Musicians To Meet In U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Composers from China and Taiwan will meet in New
York in August in the first large-scale conference supported by
professional arts organizations from the two rival governments,
organizers say.
   In a release received in Beijing today, the Center for
U.S.-China Arts Exchange at Columbia University said 10 composers
each from China and Taiwan will take part in the Aug. 6-14
conference on ``Tradition and the Future of Chinese Music.''
   Center Director Chou Wen-chung said the 1987 relaxation of
restrictions on Taiwan residents visiting mainland China
contributed to a growing interest in cultural and educational
exchanges.
   ``Because the center is in touch with artists in both places, we
were aware that this moment offered an extraordinary opportunity,''
he said.
   Chou said he hoped the conference would lead to greater cultural
cooperation and contact in the arts between China and Taiwan.
   The Nationalist government on Taiwan has rejected all proposals
by Beijing for direct trade and cultural contacts. However,
Taipei's decision last year to let residents visit the mainland led
to a sharp increase in contacts between people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.
   The release said consultants who will help choose the conference
participants include Hsu Tsang-houei, chairman of the Chinese
Composers' League in Taiwan, and Wu Zuqiang, secretary-general of
the China Federation of Literary and Arts Circles.
   The center is the only U.S. agency dedicated solely to cultural
exchange with China. It brought Arthur Miller's ``Death of a
Salesman'' to China and was behind the Academy Award-winning film
``From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China.''

<TEXT>
   Trade legislation passed by Congress could
cost the United States thousands of jobs in the nation's nearly
10,000 imported-auto dealerships, their trade association says.
   ``The massive American imported automobile market is going to be
held hostage,'' said Robert McElwaine, president of the American
International Automobile Dealers Association, at a news conference
Friday.
   The $40 billion-a-year imported automobile industry is a likely
target if the United States move to restrict imports in a trade
dispute, McElwaine said.
   ``We are the first target for retaliation,'' he said. ``We are
such a huge target. Not only is there a large volume of product, it
is such an expensive product, and there is a large amount of money
involved.''
   President Reagan has vowed to veto the trade bill because of a
provision requiring advance notice of plant closings.
   Should Reagan veto the bill, Congress would be in a better
position next year to write less damaging trade legislation,
McElwaine said.
   ``By next year, according to our calculations, the trade deficit
will have been drastically reduced, the export wave will be at full
flood, (and) America's prosperous economy will be so
export-dependent that few would be willing to risk derailing the
economy with an ill-advised trade bill,'' McElwaine said.
   McElwaine said the danger to his industry comes from provisions
designed to encourage the executive branch to retaliate against
nations restricting U.S. access to their markets.
   ``I think it would cause us damage,'' McElwaine said.
   Restrictions on imports of Korea's Hyundai cars alone could
potentially cost 15,000 jobs at dealerships, McElwaine said.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is lifting controls on most art
troupes and will let individuals organize their own performing
groups, the official China Daily reported today.
   The daily quoted Culture Minister Wang Meng as saying state-run
art troupes will be replaced with a system that will permit free
and open competition among troupes. Performers will be allowed to
set their own box office prices and decide their own programs as
long as they are licensed and do not violate state laws and
regulations.
   Wang said the reforms are designed to stimulate the professional
enthusiam of the 200,000 people working in the nation's 3,094 art
troupes.
   He said many state-run troupes, where lifetime employment
prevails, are overstaffed, especially with those who are old and in
poor health.
   Wang said the state will continue to run a small number of the
country's best troupes or those needing special state support.
Among those are new experimental groups and groups in ethnic
minority areas.
   Wang said state-run troupes will also adopt a new salary system
with outstanding performers receiving better pay than those with
mediocre skills or past their prime.
   The state's decision to give up its monopoly over the arts has
drawn some criticism in the official press, with artists being
quoted as saying many traditional Chinese and minority musical,
dance and opera troupes are doomed by the ``survival of the
fittest'' policy.
   Concern has also been raised that troupes forced to pay their
own way will turn to sex, violence and superstition to draw
audiences.

   Senate leaders appear satisfied enough with
verification measures worked out in Geneva to open debate next week
on the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty.
   But Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said he will not
formally schedule that debate until three Senate committees hold
hearings and approve the agreement.
   ``I want to hear what the chairmen and ranking Republican
members of these committees have to say following these hearings,''
Byrd said. ``They are the experts in this field.''
   Some senators said there is now at least a chance the Senate
will consent to the ratification of the treaty by the time
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev convene
their Moscow summit on May 29.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is set to testify before the
Foreign Relations Committee on Monday afternoon on the agreement he
reached this week in Geneva with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze. The Armed Services and Intelligence committees
announced they will hold a joint private meeting late Monday
afternoon.
   Following a 90-minute luncheon briefing Friday by White House
national security adviser Colin Powell, Byrd said he and other
Senate leaders were told the agreement removes a roadblock and is a
forward step.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas quoted Powell as
saying Byrd's decision last week to postpone Senate action on the
treaty ``did make a difference'' in Geneva.
   Negotiators addressed concerns in the Senate that the Soviets
were backing away from effective implementation of the on-site
inspection provisions of the treaty.
   Other senators who attended the briefing also said the results
of the Geneva talks seem constructive.
   ``I'm optimistic we can move ahead,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``I think at this moment there is more optimism for the passage
of this treaty than at at any other time during this long
process,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking GOP member of
the Armed Services Committee.
   Warner said the Soviets changed their position to meet U.S.
objections on every issue that was raised.
   Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty, providing for the total elimination of U.S. and
Soviet mid-range missiles, at their Washington summit last December.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services chairman, said he now
hopes that the treaty can be ratified in the 15 days that remain
before the summit.
   Opponents of the treaty were not satisfied, and Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., said he would offer ``something like a dozen''
amendments to the pact.

<TEXT>
   The deaths of 10 bald eagles that
apparently ate illegally poisoned animal carcasses threaten the
comeback of the endangered birds in the Chesapeake Bay area,
federal officials said.
   ``While our national symbol is making a recovery, it cannot
sustain this rate of loss month after month nor will we tolerate
it,'' said Frank Dunkle, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   Five dead eagles, one adult and four immature bald eagles, were
found May 3 in a field near the carcasses of three raccoons, a deer
and a vulture. Five others were found elsewhere in Dorchester
County between March 12 and May 1, including the Blackwater
National Wildlife Refuge near Cambridge.
   ``The birds are not in danger of becoming extinct'' because of
illegal poisoning of animals, but ``the deaths resulting will have
some impact on their recovery because the deaths are occurring in
an area where we have a large amount of bald eagles,'' Glenn D.
Therres, the non-game and endangered species program manager for
the Maryland Forest, Park and Wildlife Service.
   State and federal officials said they are particularly concerned
because the county has the greatest concentration of bald eagles in
the Chesapeake Bay area. The eagle population, devastated by the
use of the pesticide DDT in the 1950s and 1960s, had been restored
to its highest levels on the East Coast.
   Officials are testing tissue from the dead eagles and the
carcasses for chemicals. Results are expected in several weeks, but
because the eagles had been dead at least a month before they were
found, such analyses can be difficult, said Inez Connor, a
spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Newton Corner,
Mass.
   ``The fact there has been a carcass near all of the eagles we
have found leads us to think that they died as a result of eating
poisoned animals,'' Ms. Connor said. Criminal charges could be
brought against anyone found to be poisoning animals. Bald eagles
are protected under federal law.

<HEAD>Walsh Says Justice Department Has Final Word On Document
Declassification</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh says the
Justice Department has the final word on whether certain classified
material can be used in the Iran-Contra trial of Oliver North and
three co-defendants.
   That concession could enable the department to scuttle the
prosecution of the fired National Security Council aide, former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers
Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.
   In a legal memorandum filed in the case, Walsh said he ``must be
deferential to the executive's determination as to whether national
security concerns prevent public disclosure of validly classified
information.''
   Walsh has amassed 50,000 classified government documents that
may be relevant to the prosecution of charges that Hakim, North,
Poindexter and Secord conspired to illegally divert to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels the profits from sales of U.S. arms to
Iran.
   Another 250,000 secret documents may contain information
relevant to the defense of the case.
   By Walsh's description, the most sensitive 5 percent to 10
percent of the documents contain secrets about U.S. intelligence
and military operations and sensitive foreign policy initiatives.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), the
attorney general must certify to the court that disclosure of
certain documents as evidence in court would endanger national
security. The law provides for substitution of summaries of the
documents or statements of what the evidence would prove if
revealed in open court.
   The court has the power to dismiss criminal cases if too much
evidence is withheld.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has warned that he would
dismiss charges if relevant secret documents are not declassified
for use at the trial as evidence.
   Gesell also has expressed an unwillingness to spend a lot of
time rewriting classified documents so that they could be presented
as evidence in a public trial.
   He has given Walsh until June 10 to submit a list of documents
the independent counsel wants to use as prosecution evidence that
won't be declassified.
   The legal memorandum from Walsh to Gesell was filed in response
to a question about the issue that the judge posed during a May 6
hearing.
   Walsh said: ``It is an inherent function of the executive branch
to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive national security
information to the extent necessary to permit the government to
conduct its foreign affairs and national defense activities
effectively.
   ``Neither the independent counsel statute nor the regulation
purports to confer upon independent counsel any general power of
declassification.''
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who has been questioned
repeatedly by the Iran-Contra grand jury about his November 1986
investigation of the arms-for-hostages deals, has recused himself
from the case, or any others involving independent counsels.
   Any decision about classified information in the Iran-Contra
case would have to be made by an acting attorney general.
   Walsh said that under a 1982 executive order on classified
documents, he has no authority to declassify government secrets and
must therefore defer to the authority of the attorney general.
   Walsh said he agreed to comply with the 1982 executive order
when he obtained the 300,000 pages of classified documents in the
course of his investigation.

<HEAD>Aloha Pilots Say They Are Ready To Return To Air</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilots who safely landed an Aloha Airlines
jetliner April 28 after the cabin blew open at 24,000 feet said
Friday they look forward to returning to the air in a few days.
   ``I've ridden in a couple airplanes since the incident,'' the
pilot, Robert Schornstheimer, said at a news conference. ``I'm
really more comfortable at the controls of an airplane than I am in
this setting here.''
   Schornstheimer and co-pilot Mimi Tompkins landed the Boeing 737
on the island of Maui after a third of the cabin peeled away on a
Hilo-to-Honolulu flight. A flight attendant was swept to her death
and 61 passengers were injured.
   A check of Federal Aviation Administration records Friday showed
14 cracks or instances of corrosion were found in several routine
maintenance checks on the plane before the accident, but none of
the defects was found in the area of the damage.
   According to FAA records, each of the cracks or corroded areas
was repaired by replacing sections of the plane's metal skin.
   A federal investigation has focused on metal fatigue as a
possible cause of the accident.
   Neither pilot would discuss the cause. However, they related the
15 harrowing minutes while they guided the crippled plane to an
emergency landing.
   ``It was a split-second thing. There was a loud noise and the
cockpit door was gone and there was blue sky,'' Schornstheimer
said. He added: ``Normally, you don't expect to lose that much of
an airplane and still be able to fly it.''
   According to FAA records, the defects uncovered during routine
maintenance by Aloha were on the rear-bottom portions or wings of
the plane during routine Aloha inspections. The top of the cabin
peeled away in the accident.
   Nick Wantiez, Aloha director of engineering, said the number of
defects was ``not untypical of some airplanes, but probably better
than most.''
   ``Generally, it was in quite good shape from a corrosion
standpoint,'' Wantiez said. ``The basic airplane looked quite
clean.''

<HEAD>Week-Old Soviet Opposition Party Outlines Bold Platform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new opposition group challenging the Communist
Party's political monopoly has outlined a platform that calls for
free trade unions and end to Soviet domination of the Baltic states
and of Eastern Europe.
   The week-old Democratic Union, whose members have been harassed
by authorities as ``anti-social,'' said in unveiling the progam
Friday that it plans to try to register with the state but expects
to be rebuffed.
   At least a dozen uniformed policemen milled around outside as
party organizers gathered in a crowded eighth-floor apartment in
northwest Moscow to discuss plans for political action.
   Police made no attempt to stop those entering or leaving.
   The group's declaration of goals and principles followed a week
of meetings in which organizers said more than 150 Soviets from 27
cities took part.
   Yuri Denisov, one of the party's 15 Central Coordinating Council
members, told journalists it would try to comply with laws
requiring groups to register their activity, ``but of course we
expect problems with that and we do not expect to succeed.''
   Another coordinating council member, Alexander Lukashev,
outlined broad party policies. He said the group aims to present an
``opposition'' to the Communist Party's monopoly on power and
political thought.
   The group opposes the ``Soviet occupation'' of the Baltic states
of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and Soviet actions in Eastern
Europe that have helped keep Communist government in power there,
he said.
   The party has called for independent trade unions, and on Friday
issued a statement denouncing Polish officials' actions to halt
industrial strikes over the past month in the Soviet-allied country.
   ``The Democratic Union comes out in opposition to
totalitarianism of political parties,'' the group's statement of
principles declares as its first objective.
   The party program sets out methods for calling elections and
filling leadership positions, and says funds raised by the group
will be used for ``informational activity, agitation, printing
costs and organizational needs.''
   Party activists complained that their first week was marred by
``repressive'' and ``unconstitutional'' actions of the KGB, local
police forces and the state-run press.
   The official Tass news agency denounced the party on Wednesday,
accusing the activists of ``slanderous, anti-social activity.''
   Dozens of participants were detained by police after meetings
last weekend, with sentences of five to seven days in jail handed
down summarily to four of them, including dissident magazine editor
Sergei Grigoryants.
   Grigoryants, who edits the unofficial magazine ``Glasnost,''
remained jailed Friday night and no one had been permitted to see
him, the activists said.
   Denisov said the party planned a political conference in the
fall, but that details of that gathering had not been worked out
yet.

   The battle to keep a landmark art deco
hotel from being turned into a parking lot heated up as
preservationists and the city struggled to save it and the owner
began pulling plumbing from the building.
   ``People are distressed and distraught that we would be losing a
building,'' Nancy Liebman, legislative liaison for the Miami Design
Preservation League, said Friday as a work crew carted plumbing and
scrap metal from the beachfront Senator Hotel.
   ``While it's still here, it's worth a continuous battle,'' she
said.
   The three-story, green-and-white hotel was built in 1939, and is
on the National Register of Historic Places, Ms. Liebman said. It
is one of 800 art deco buildings in the mile-square area that
comprises the only official art deco district in the world, she
said.
   The closed hotel's owner, the Royale Group, must raze the
Senator for parking spaces as a condition for obtaining bank loans
to renovate other art deco buildings it owns, Royale attorney
Harold Rosen said.
   ``It's not we're anti-preservation, but we have to be practical,
too,'' Rosen said. A date for demolishing the building has not been
set.
   Mayor Alex Daoud said he hopes last-ditch negotiations scheduled
next week with the Royale Group's owners will keep the wrecking
ball away.
   ``We're doing everything within our power to preserve it,'' said
Daoud, whose staff is checking legal avenues, possible land swaps
and the feasibility of buying the hotel.
   Preservationists will keep an eye on the building, Ms. Liebman
said.
   ``It's hard to see where this urgent crush for parking is,'' she
said. ``The Senator has every single deco feature. It's a perfect
example, an important masterpiece.''
   The art deco district's buildings are painted pastel colors and
sport geometric designs, its sidewalks are painted pink and it's
often featured on NBC's ``Miami Vice'' television show.
   The city is pushing for the renovation of the district's
buildings in its effort to bring back the glory days of tourism.
The 70-room Senator is a crucial part of the district, said Barbara
Capitman, president of the Art Deco Society of Miami Beach and the
National Art Deco Societies of America.
   ``The Senator ... has probably the most famous etched glass in
the district,'' Mrs. Capitman said. ``It is a particularly
seductive building.''
   Ms. Liebman and Mrs. Capitman accuse the Royale Group of
ignoring pleas from them and city officials to save the hotel,
which was closed after the group bought it in 1984.
   Rosen countered that in the nine months it took his clients to
obtain a demolition permit, no one offered a viable alternative. He
said none is expected now.
   ``Our people are more active in preserving than any others on
the beach,'' Rosen said. Preservationists ``have blinders on,
they're not in the real world.''
   Daoud said he remained optimistic, but understood the Royale
Group's problems.
   ``They first started to restore it, purchased new doors and
fixtures, but what happened was they had to provide this parking,''
Daoud said.
   ``It's almost a Catch-22: you've got a developer renovating the
area, doing a great job, and he's the same individual who's
knocking down one of our architectural treasures to make room for
parking.''

<HEAD>ICC Tentatively Votes To Approve Union Pacific Merger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed purchase of the regional
Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad by the Union Pacific Corp. has been
tentatively approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, sources
say.
   The regulatory agency has scheduled an official announcement on
Monday of its decision.
   Agency and congressional sources, speaking on condition they not
be identified, said the commission had voted 4-0 on Friday to
permit the Union Pacific and MKT merger.
   The Union Pacific, a 21,500-mile network, proposed in November
1986 to acquire the 3,100-mile MKT system, known as the Katy line,
for $110 million and to assume its outstanding debts.
   As proposed, the merger would eliminate about 1,100 Katy jobs
because of closing of rail yards and repair shops. Union Pacific
also proposed the abandonment of 405 miles of track, mostly
operated by Katy.
   The Union Pacific, the nation's third largest railroad system in
terms of track mileage, serves about 20 states with routes from Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle in the West to Chicago and New
Orleans.
   The company was formed in 1982 with the merger of the Union
Pacific, Missouri Pacific and Western Pacific railroads.
   The Katy serves six states, with mostly north-south routes
running from Omaha to the Gulf Coast in Texas.
   Dennis Watson, an ICC spokesman, said he had no information on
how commissioners had voted in the case, and could not confirm or
deny that the merger had been approved.
   The sources said retiring commissioner Malcolm Sterrett, who did
not seek reappointment to a new term on the agency, did not vote.
The agency made its decision by a voting system that does not
require a public meeting.
   The railroads say consolidating their operations would provide
shippers with better service at lower costs, and offer direct
single-line routes in some areas. Without the merger, the ICC has
been told, the financially troubled Katy will have difficulty
surviving against bigger competitors.

   A house fire started by burning candles
killed a 9-year-old girl and injured her brother hours after the
power company cut off electricity for non-payment of a $34.86 bill,
officials said.
   Tammy Tiggs was pronounced dead at Centinela Hospital Medical
Center in Inglewood early Friday after she was pulled from her
burning home, sheriff's Lt. Ray Gonzales said.
   Her brother, Antwon Tiggs, 12, was in critical condition at
Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne, a nursing supervisor
said. Their sister, Vernicia Bolts, 17, who was caring for the
younger children while their parents attended a church meeting, was
treated and released.
   Several deputies, firefighters and paramedics were overcome by
smoke or cut by glass, but all were treated and released at area
hospitals.
   The fire was reported at 11:41 p.m. Thursday. Miss Bolts had
blown out most of the candles being used to light the house before
everyone went to bed, but apparently at least one kept burning and
ignited the blaze, county fire Inspector Ken Sotro said.
   Earlier Thursday, the Southern California Edison Co.
disconnected service to the house because the family's $34.86 bill
was overdue, said Darcy Skaggs, an area manager for the utility.
   ``There had been a credit problem over a long period of time,''
Skaggs said. ``They had been given proper notice. We hand delivered
a final notice on May 3. There was no response. The final notice
expired on May 11. On May 12, service was disconnected.''
   The deadline for payment had been extended several times for the
family and the account had been overdue for at least a year, Skaggs
said.
   Firefighters estimated damage caused by the fire at $205,000.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican says Pope John Paul II's
tour of Paraguay will proceed as planned after the country's
authoritarian government backed off on its bid to block a papal
meeting with opposition leaders.
   The Vatican had said earlier that it was ``astonished'' that the
government of President Alfredo Stroessner would try to alter the
schedule for the pope's trip to Paraguay, the last stop on his
four-nation, 12-day South American tour.
   In Lima, Peru, meanwhile, today's stop on the papal tour, a
column of 60 marching leftist rebels firebombed a hotel where the
papal press center is headquartered.
   In Santa Cruz, a center for this nation's notorious cocaine
trade, the pope on Friday issued his harshest condemnation of drug
trafficking since he began the trip May 7 in Uruguay.
   At the city's municipal airport _ which U.S. drug agents say is
used intensively by cocaine runners _ John Paul told about 220,000
people at a Mass that the drug trade ``leads to the most terrible
form of slavery and sows your soil with corruption and death.
   ``There is an urgent need not only to protect youth from drug
consumption but to combat trafficking itself, which is a totally
infamous activity,'' the pontiff said.
   He challenged his audience to tackle a long list of ills that
plague Bolivia, South America's poorest country.
   Also Friday, the Vatican said in a communique released in
Bolivia that ``The holy father's pastoral visit to Paraguay will
proceed just as planned.''
   Earlier this week, Stroessner's government canceled John Paul's
scheduled Tuesday meeting with the Builders of Society in Asuncion,
Paraguay's capital.
   About 350 intellectuals, businessmen and politicians belong to
the group, which is sponsored by the church and includes
representatives of unauthorized opposition parties. Paraguay had
said the ban was for ``security reasons.''
   According to Friday's Vatican statement, the lifting of the ban
was arranged at a meeting between Paraguayan government
representatives and the Vatican ambassador and local bishops.
   Cancellation of the meeting would have marked the first time a
government altered John Paul's official itinerary on the 37
overseas trips he has made since becoming pope nearly 10 years ago.
   Stroessner, a general and the Western Hemisphere's
longest-reigning leader, has run Paraguay since 1954.
   In Lima, marching rebels, many wearing hoods and chanting
revolutionary slogans, tossed a fire bomb, threw rocks and smashed
three large front windows as they paraded in front of the Hotel
Crillon.
   The violence came amid a wave of guerrilla activity Friday and
followed a week-long series of rebel attacks.
   Pro-Cuba guerrillas on Thursday briefly disrupted a mass at the
the Santo Toribio Seminary, where the pope is to speak this
weekend, and urged those attending to join their leftist
insurgency, church officials have said.
   The same day, Maoist rebels bombed a police bus on a busy
downtown street and wounded 14 policemen in one of the bloodiest
attacks ever in the capital.
   The hotel bomb, described as a Molotov cocktail by employees,
broke a window and set an inside curtain ablaze, witnesses said.
There were no injuries and the blaze was rapidly doused, police
said.
   The press center for the papal visit is headquartered on the
main floor of the plush hotel.
   Also Friday, leftist guerrillas bombed a bank and strafed a
military installation with machine-gun fire from a passing car,
police said. There were no injuries in either attack.

<HEAD>Navy Won't Appeal Dismissal of Surgeon's Conviction</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Donal is cq</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Donal M. Billig will leave the Navy next
week free and clear of charges that he killed three patients
through surgical negligence.
   The Navy decided Friday against appealing a military review
court's decision to overturn Billig's conviction on
involuntary-manslaughter charges. The charges stemmed from Billig's
tour as chief heart surgeon at the Navy's flagship Bethesda, Md.,
Naval Medical Center.
   Navy Secretary William Ball also has approved a request from
Billig, a commander in rank, to be released from active duty, said
Lt. Brian Cullin, a spokesman for the service.
   ``He will be released without pension sometime next week,''
Cullin said.
   Cullin said the decision against an appeal was made by Navy
Secretary William Ball and the Navy's judge advocate general, Rear
Adm. H. Don Campbell.
   Billig, 57, was convicted in early 1986 on charges of
involuntary manslaughter and negligence in the deaths of three
patients. He was sentenced on March 3, 1986, to four years in
prison and last summer was rebuffed in his first bid for parole
from Fort Leavenworth, Kan.
   Billig's case attracted extensive public attention, in part
because of the sensational nature of some of the charges. It also
prompted congressional reviews of military health care in general
and several large monetary settlements between the government and
relatives of Billig's patients.
   Prosecutors described Billig as an egocentric man, nearly blind
in one eye, who hid his visual handicap and continued performing
complex heart operations despite numerous warnings that he was
killing patients.
   The U.S. Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review concluded
April 13, however, the prosecution never showed that Billig's
surgical technique and conduct in the operating room were so out of
line as to constitute criminal conduct.
   The spokesman said 36 legal claims totaling $153.6 million were
ultimately filed against the Navy in connection with cases handled
by Billig. To date, 12 have been settled for a combined $2.2
million, eight denied and 16 are pending, Cullin said.
   ``After reviewing the opinion ..., the judge advocate general
has determined there is no viable, legal basis for further
review,'' Ball said in a statement.

   A bomb exploded inside a truck early
Saturday near reviewing stands being prepared for farewell
ceremonies marking the Soviet withdrawal. Police said eight people
were killed and 20 injured.
   The blast occurred at 5:45 a.m. (9:15 p.m. EDT) in a housing
area on the banks of the Kabul River. Witnesses said they saw four
bodies being removed from a house that was destroyed.
   The blast demolished embankment walls on both sides of the river
that threads through the Afghan capital.
   Blood was visible on the gates of a nearby factory and personal
belongings, including carpet slippers, were scattered in the street.
   Witnesses said flames were visible when they arrived shortly
after the blast. The bomb had been planted in a large truck that
lay badly mangled at the scene.
   Last month, six people were killed and 49 wounded in another
bomb blast along the river banks on the 10th anniversary of the
April 1978 revolution that brought a Marxist government to power in
Afghanistan and triggered widespread insurrection.
   Soviet soldiers entered the war in December 1979 to help the
allied government fight off the anti-Communist rebels. About
115,000 remain here to back forces loyal to President Najib.
   But under an accord signed in Geneva on April 14, the Soviet
troops begin pulling out Sunday and are to complete the withdrawal
within nine months.
   Information for this account was based on a news agency pool
report from Kabul by Reuters. The Associated Press was not allowed
to go on the trip to Kabul because of questions it asked Najib in
the capital last month.

   Clouds of smoke rose over the Mississippi
River bluffs as competitors fired up their cookers for Memphis'
annual barbecue contest, a weekend party of pork and beer billed as
the largest shindig of its kind.
   ``If you do him right, it'll take 24 hours,'' Fred Burnett of
Orlando, Fla., said Friday as he opened the side of his black iron
cooker to proudly display a 135-pound pig being turned into a
tender treat.
   ``We'll serve him with a spoon, not a knife,'' Burnett added.
   The cook-off, part of the city's annual Memphis In May Festival,
drew 175 cooking teams from around the country to compete in three
categories: whole hog, ribs and pork shoulder. Judging was set for
this afternoon, and the winners were to be announced tonight.
   Many of the teams, varying from three or four members to dozens,
also took part in a showmanship contest Friday. They staged skits
in costume outside their cooking booths, which ranged from simple
tents to elaborate two-story affairs and fully equipped kitchens
mounted on trailers.
   Barbecue cookers included plain iron drums and fancy customized
rigs.
   One team prepared its pork in a large metal cooker shaped like a
rabbit. Another relied on a bright red compact car gutted and lined
with iron to fashion a cooker.
   Keith Coleman, who owns a marine engine business in Memphis,
cooked his team's barbecue in what was once a 900-horsepower diesel
engine.
   Mounted on a 20-foot-long trailer with a built-in kitchen, the
shiny steel-and-iron rig cost about $20,000, Coleman said.
   ``We're ecologically sound. We catch our own waste and we're
totally self-contained,'' he said. ``When we get there, we're
there. We've got water. We've got electricity. Just add pork and
stir.''
   The contest is for pork cookers only, and Denise Bollheimer, a
spokeswoman for the 11-year-old event, said organizers were trying
for a world record for the amount of pork barbecue served in a
single day.
   The cook-off is billed as a ``world championship,'' but
organizers were trying for the first time to take a formal
accounting of the amount of meat cooked by the competitors. They
predicted the total would be in the tons.
   ``We've heard rumors that other contests are trying to claim
title as the largest, but we don't think they have a chance,'' Ms.
Bollheimer said. ``We will bask in the glory of knowing we're the
world's largest barbecue contest.''
   The Memphis In May Festival focuses on a different country each
year, and this year's guest was Great Britain, leading to numerous
Union Jacks and other British decorations at barbecue booths.
   One team, the Royal Kilted Kookers, included several members
from Scotland, even though their background as barbecue cookers was
limited.
   Tam White of Edinburgh said it was his first brush with American
barbecue.
   ``I tasted the ribs for the first time last night,'' White said.
``I found some meat on the bones and it was great. The only ribs
I'd had before were from a Chinese restaurant.''

<HEAD>Workers Keep Digging; Survivor Recalls `Anguish Of Being Buried'

   Rescuers cleared crumbled concrete
on the fading hope that someone might still be alive under the
rubble of an unfinished four-story building 1{ days after it
collapsed, killing at least 13 people.
   Officials said Friday that at least 53 people were injured when
the structure came crashing down as workers were about to pour the
last concrete at a furniture factory that occupied the ground floor
and part of the basement.
   Some of the injured were buried for hours.
   ``I had finished working and was about to leave when ... all of
a sudden everyone started yelling hysterically that there was an
earthquake,'' said Juan Flores, who was buried for five hours.
   ``I dashed under a table and all of a sudden everything went
dark, and there was this terrific noise and there was dust
everywhere,'' he told the Excelsior news agency.
   He said a slab of concrete that fell on the table protected him
from the rest of the debris.
   Flores said he was quiet at first, but ``the fear and the
anguish of being buried ... impelled me to yell very loud, and the
rescue squads dug me out.''
   The Aguascalientes state government said 13 people died,
including a 16-year-old boy riding past the building on a bicycle
when it collapsed Thursday. But a Red Cross official said at least
14 people were known dead.
   All day Friday, officials gave conflicting estimates of the
number of people believed trapped under the rubble.
   Eduardo Zapata, chief Red Cross attendant on duty late Friday in
this city 320 miles northwest of the capital, said crews were
painstakingly working their way down through the massive rubble.
   Rescuers swung sledgehammers at chunks of rubble and passed
concrete blocks down a line as they cleared the debris piece by
piece.
   ``Below, we think there is no longer anyone alive because there
wouldn't be enough air,'' Zapata said.
   He said a large amount of dirt had fallen in with the building,
which had three basement levels, a main floor and three upper
stories.
   ``We have the building plans and we are making tunnels where we
think there may be people and when we determine there are not, we
will begin to use machines,'' he said.
   He said workers planned to search through the night.
   Gilberto Sanchez, the radio officer at police headquarters in
this city of half a million residents, said about 60 soldiers from
the army garrison joined firefighters, police and volunteers in the
rescue effort.
   Bulldozers and cranes were brought from as far away as
Salamanca, 78 miles to the southwest.
   Celia de la Torre, a state government spokeswoman, said late
Friday the number of dead stood at 13. Zapata said 14 were known
dead. He said 12 bodies had been recovered and two others remained
in the rubble.
   Two people were missing, he said. Mrs. de la Torre said
authorities believed two or three may still be trapped.
   Mrs. de la Torre said original estimates that several dozen
people were trapped may have been high and many may have escaped
uninjured.
   Juan Diaz, head of special services for the local Red Cross,
said at least 116 workers were in the building when it collapsed.
   Roberto Padilla Marquez, a state government spokesman, said the
state Attorney General's Office had begun an investigation to
determine who was responsible for the collapse of the building
three blocks from the main plaza and the state capitol.

   The Sanitation Department has a new weapon in
its battle to keep the Big Apple clean _ the loud, high-pitched
voice of Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   Koch has made a tape-recording that will be played through
loudspeakers mounted on street-sweeping trucks that find their path
blocked by motorists.
   ``The Sanitation Department has to clean this street!'' it
blares. ``We can't because of your illegally parked car! Please get
it outta here!''
   Koch told reporters at City Hall on Friday that he wanted to
``tell motorists that I'm on their tail and I'm in the car
immediately behind them, and if they don't get out (of the way),
well, then we may just have to give them a summons. And they'll
expect me to get out of the truck and to give them a summons.''
   Asked if he actually will ride shotgun on a street sweeper, Koch
said, ``it hasn't occurred to me, but maybe.''

   Residents of this exclusive city by the
sea will have to put up with the racket from tennis ball machines
if a city committee's recommendation goes through.
   The City Council's Ordinances, Rules and Standards Committee on
Thursday agreed to a compromise that would allow the use of the
machines at the same time heavy construction is permitted _ 9 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m. between Dec. 1 and April 3, and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. the
rest of the year.
   Construction is banned on weekends, but the tennis ball machines
would not be.
   Since March, when the noise complaint issue arose, many
residents have urged the committee to ban the machines' use on
weekends.
   ``On an absolutely still summer evening, with no trains, no
airplanes and no boats going by, the tennis machines could
conceivably be very annoying because of their rhythmic thump,
thump, thump,'' said Councilman Paul Ilyinsky.
   The city council will take up the issue at its June 14 meeting.

<HEAD>Author John Steinbeck's Effects To Be Auctioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Furniture, paintings and other items that belonged
to the late John Steinbeck will be sold at auction next weekend,
says an estate broker hired by the author's sons.
   The furniture is nicked and scratched, knobs are missing from a
china cabinet and the frame is pulling away from an oil painting.
Some pieces seem vintage garage sale.
   ``We're not talking a great deal of monetary value on these
pieces,'' said Sylvia Link, a Denver estate broker and antiques
dealer who will conduct the sale at Estate Brokerage House on
Friday through Sunday.
   Steinbeck, author of ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and the 1962 Nobel
Prize winner, died in 1968.
   The sale has been commissioned by his sons, John, 41, and
Thomas, 43, who live in California. John lived in Boulder from 1979
to 1987, and his father's belongings remain stored there.
   The collection accounts for much of the author's estate, with
the exception of some silver sold earlier and items kept by the
family, according to John's wife, Nancy Steinbeck.
   The furniture and art is an eclectic mix, much of it American
and Oriental. Acquired by the man whose works, such as ``Cannery
Row'' and ``Of Mice and Men,'' were sympathetic to the common man,
the items reflect Steinbeck's apparent casual attitude toward
material possessions.
   A Chippendale corner cupboard normally would sell for about
$3,000. Because it belonged to Steinbeck, it probably will sell for
about $5,500, Link said.

<HEAD>AZT Seen Extending AIDS Patients' Life Spans Even In Long-Term
Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The makers of the only drug approved for
treatment of AIDS say that for nearly two years the medication has
continued adding to the life spans of patients who have used,
according to a published report.
   Officials of Burroughs Wellcome Co. told an advisory committee
of the Food and Drug Administration that even in long-term
treatment the beneficial effects of azidothymidine, known as AZT or
zidovudine, continue without an increase in negative side effects,
The Washington Post reported Saturday.
   An unidentified FDA official said the treatment ``adds at least
six months'' but no study has yet documented how much time the drug
adds to the life of AIDS patients.
   One study of 229 people with AIDS and severe AIDS-related
complex found that 58 percent of those who received long-term
treatment with the drug were alive after 21 months, while 50
percent of those who never received the treatment were dead after
nine months, the company said.
   Another study of 4,800 people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex
who received the drug between October 1986 and September 1987 found
that 73 percent were alive 11 months after starting treatment.
   ``This is significantly better than what might be expected for
such patients had they not been treated,'' said Dr. David Berry,
vice president of research at Burroughs Wellcome.

<HEAD>IRS Loosens 1986 Restrictions on Deductions for Artists, Writers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has given
writers, painters and other artists a reprieve on an partial
exemption they had lost in the 1986 revision of the federal tax law.
   The IRS ruling on Friday will allow the group to deduct some of
the expense of creating their works, even before the artwork or
written work like a book begins to produce income.
   The IRS said artists will be allowed to write off operating
expenses over three years, with a 50 percent deduction permitted in
the first year and 25 percent in each of the next two. The rule
will apply, the IRS said, only ``where the personal efforts of the
individual are mainly responsible for the creation of a work of
art.''
   ``It certainly alleviates the complexity concern these people
have had,'' said Tom Evans, a tax counsel for the Treasury
Department.
   ``I guess 50 percent is better than nothing,'' said best-selling
biographer Kitty Kelley, a leader in the fight to overturn the 1986
provision.

<HEAD>Appeal to US to Halt Asylum Refusals in Southeast Asia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of advocates for refugees in Southeast
Asia says the United States should take the lead in stemming the
``drift into dissolution'' of people seeking asylum from Vietnam.
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, with strong support
from the United States, also should call an international
conference to highlight the issue said the Washington-based U.S.
Committee for Refugees.
   Unless the U.S. government gives the problem new priority, it
will be to blame for ``permitting a vital, humanitarian initiative
to drift into dissolution,'' the group said.
   ``Thailand lit the fuse in January, when it began to push back
Vietnamese boats from its eastern and southern coastlines,''
committee director Roger Winter added in a statement.
   ``What we are seeing now is the predictable chain reaction to
bar asylum throughout the region,'' he said, citing increased
resistance to temporary asylum on the part of Indonesia, Malaysia,
Hong Kong and the Philippines.

   A man who admits sneaking a cigarette in an
airplane bathroom faces up to $4,000 in fines after becoming the
first person accused of violating the new ban on smoking aboard
short flights, officials said.
   ``He's not the first one to smoke on an airplane when they
weren't supposed to, but he's the first person to be accused of
breaking this new law,'' Federal Aviation Administration
spokeswoman Elly Brekke said Friday.
   Darryl Seigel, 38, of Seattle says he absent-mindedly began
smoking inside the lavatory during a 100-minute Seattle-to-Reno
flight on Thursday.
   ``It was an honest mistake,'' he said.
   A flight attendant spotted smoke coming from the lavatory after
Seigel left it about 20 minutes into the flight, said Rich Peacock,
spokesman for Reno Cannon Intenational Airport.
   The attendant asked Seigel if he knew about the federal law
against smoking on domestic flights of two hours or less, and then
told him he would be arrested when they landed.
   The flight attendant had explained the new law to passengers
before the plane took off.
   Airport security detained Seigel for two hours for questioning
at the request of the flight crew, Peacock said.
   Statements were taken Friday from the flight and maintenance
crews aboard the USAir plane Seigel was flying in, Brekke said. The
investigation should be completed within 60 days.
   Siegel faces three possible charges: Smoking when a no smoking
sign is on, which carries a $1,000 fine; smoking in the lavatory,
which also carries a $1,000 fine; and tampering with a lavatory
smoke detector, which carries a $2,000 fine.
   The federal smoking ban on short flights went into effect April
23.

   About 35,000 suburban homes and businesses were
without telephone service today because of a fire at a switching
center, but about half probably will have intermittent dial tones
by Sunday, officials said.
   It will take until at least June before all the customers in
western suburbs will have full service, Illinois Bell vice
president James Eibel said Friday.
   ``We could have as many as 21,000 lines up in Hinsdale by the
end of this week, but it's not going to be the standard of service
that Illinois Bell wants to provide,'' Eibel said.
   ``That's my most optimistic view if everything absolutely goes
right _ and, frankly, it will not,'' Eibel added.
   Technicians originally thought the digital switching device
damaged by smoke and water in the fire Sunday could be repaired,
but Eibel said Illinois Bell has decided to purchase a new one from
AT&T. There were no injuries in the fire.
   A telephone systems analyst told the Chicago Tribune on Friday
that such a switch could cost as much as $16 million.
   Meanwhile, State Rep. James R. Stange introduced a House
resolution Friday calling for an investigation of the fire by a
special legislative committee.
   ``It has devastated hundreds of businesses, many of which place
catalog orders such as Spiegel and those which operate 800 numbers
like Holiday Inn,'' Stange said.
   ``Our whole economy has been temporarily staggered. Gas
stations, airports, hospitals, restaurants, delivery services,
brokerage houses _ you name it _ all have suffered,'' Stange said.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega vowed not
to give in to U.S. demands that he step down as Panama's military
leader after claiming negotiations with the Reagan administration
had fallen apart.
   In Washington on Friday, the White House said U.S. officials
still were talking with Noriega about his resignation. But
Noriega's spokesman said the general would refuse any deal that
includes a deadline for such a departure.
   A U.S. attorney prosecuting Noriega on drug charges, meanwhile,
sharply criticized the reported U.S. offer to throw out the charges
in exchange for Noriega's resignation as Defense Forces chief and
at least temporary exile.
   Asked Friday about the talks, Noriega said: ``Everything fell
apart.''
   Later, he said: ``The dignity of Panama is not negotiable while
there are foreign troops on our territory, humiliating our soil,
while there is economic aggression, as long as there are threats,
as long as there is psychological war ... as long as (U.S.)
Ambassador Arthur Davis does not get out.''
   Noriega spoke with reporters Friday at ceremonies in this rural
town, 90 miles from Panama City, on the anniversary of the death of
a revolutionary hero, and during a meeting with local officials in
Rio Hato, 60 miles southwest of the capital.
   Asked in Washington about Noriega's comments, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``He says that all the time. He
said `fall apart' or something similar before. ... We are still
talking. We are still negotiating.''
   The Reagan administration has been trying through economic
sanctions to pressure Noriega into stepping down since February,
when he was indicted in Florida on drug-trafficking charges.
   As military chief, Noriega is the country's de facto ruler.
   The general said Friday that State Department envoy Michael
Kozak was in Panama, but added: ``I have not talked with Mr.
Kozak.''
   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, Noriega's spokesman, said there was little
variety in what the United States has been offering.
   ``The thing is Kozak comes each time with the same plan, the
original plan a little more elastic,'' he said.
   ``The plan has a deadline for (Noriega) resigning his post, a
deadline for leaving the country ... With those conditions and that
pressure neither the general nor any other Panamanian nor any Latin
American will cede.''
   In Washington, Reagan administration officials acknowledged
discussing with Noriega the possibility of dropping the drug
charges in exchange for his departure from power.
   But Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Friday argued against
dismissing the drug charges, said U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner of
Miami, who obtained one of the indictments.
   Kellner said dropping the drug charges ``would send the wrong
message'' to Americans.
   U.S. Customs Service Chief William von Raab, whose agency's
investigation contributed to the drug indictments against Noriega,
also said Friday that Noriega should be prosecuted.
   Noriega's lawyers plan to appear in court to request dismissal
of the drug charges in about a month. They contend the charges are
politically motivated.
   In La Negrita, Noriega did not address the crowd, but listened
to three speeches by local authorities denouncing ``Yankee
aggression.''
   When a reporter asked if he could run for president in elections
scheduled for next May, he smiled broadly.
   ``Legally, yes,'' he answered, surrounded by supporters.
   Asked if he was actively considering running for president,
Noriega merely laughed.
   A ``dignity battalion'' of about 100 men attended the ceremony.
They had vintage rifles and were dressed in blue jeans, T-shirts
printed with ``not one step backward,'' and red-and-white baseball
caps saying ``I don't sell out my country.''
   The United States still recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle, now in
hiding, as Panama's legitimate president. Noriega had him dismissed
on Feb. 26, the day after Delvalle tried to fire the general.

   Summer heat waves are deadlier for
Northerners and Midwesterners than for Southerners, where almost no
one dies when the mercury soars, a researcher says.
   The top six cities for weather-related deaths are St. Louis, New
York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Kansas City, Mo., and Chicago, said
Dr. Lawrence Kalkstein of the University of Delaware's Center for
Climatic Research.
   During an average summer, 183 people die in St. Louis because of
weather alone, Kalkstein said. In New York, it's 139 and in
Philadelphia, 118.
   The cities with the lowest weather-related death rates are
southern areas: Dallas, New Orleans and Oklahoma City.
   ``In those three cities in an average summer season, almost no
one dies'' from heat-related problems, Kalkstein said.
   When the temperature in a city exceeds a certain threshold, such
as 92 degrees in New York, the number of people who die can
increase by up to 50 percent, Kalkstein said.
   Kalkstein determined the threshold temperatures using a weather
stress index in work funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   In a $225,000 study funded by the Environmental Protection
Administration, Kalkstein is looking at other aspects of weather's
impact on human health, such as pollution and the effect of world
temperatures that are expected to continue rising into the year
2060.
   The EPA has given Kalkstein scenarios for determining what will
happen as temperatures go up.
   Kalkstein said, however, that the future heat-related death rate
is uncertain because it's unknown whether people will acclimatize,
or adjust to increasingly warm weather.
   ``We wonder if New Yorkers will react like they do today or like
people in Jacksonville, (Fla.),'' Kalkstein said.
   Assuming people do not adjust, if the temperature warms by 7
degrees, New York would see an estimated 1,294 deaths instead of
the current 139, said Kalkstein, who arrived at the figures by
combining weather and death-rate data. St. Louis would face 1,664
deaths instead of 183.
   In general, people adjust, so there is ``no real reason to
believe they won't acclimatize in the future. But we're concerned
that conditions might get so much warmer that it might be too much
for humans to tolerate,'' Kalkstein said.
   As the Earth warms, Kalkstein said, there are other factors to
consider, such as housing.
   ``St. Louis is the best example. Most inner-city people live in
red brick houses with black roofs. Even if people acclimatize,
those houses will be uninhabitable for humans'' because they will
be too hot, he explained.
   People over age 65 were more stressed in hot weather than
others, Kalkstein said. He determined that the elderly are
generally more affected by hot, dry days, while younger people are
more affected by hot, humid weather.
   The duration of hot weather appeared to have more effect on
death rates than the intensity of the heat, Kalkstein said.
   ``In the summer, the kind of day that killed most people was not
necessarily a day when it got very, very hot, but it got pretty hot
and remained warm all day and all night,'' he said.
   The research also showed that heat waves in the beginning of the
season had more impact on mortality than late-summer heat waves.
   ``By the time August comes around, (people) are used to heat,''
Kalkstein explained.

<HEAD>NEA Leader Says Teachers Have Crucial Role in Fighting AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers have a crucial role to play in fighting
AIDS and can not only shape the lives of young people but
``actually save those lives,'' says the president of the National
Education Association.
   ``Children trust their teachers and they will go to their
teachers for information. We must have factual information and know
how to respond to young people,'' said Mary Hatwood Futrell,
attending a three-day AIDS education conference sponsored by the
NEA and the Centers for Disease Control.
   Educators at the conference are discussing patterns of AIDS
infection among young people, problems teachers face in AIDS
education, legal issues and other topics.
   ``Some will say ... `Here you go again, getting involved in
social issues,' but educators and students will not be immune''
from AIDS, Ms. Futrell said in an interview Friday.
   Dr. Gary Noble, CDC deputy director for AIDS, said the
conference is aimed at helping teachers educate their students
about the deadly disease.
   ``No one should die of ignorance,'' Noble said. ``No child
should reach the age of sexual maturity or experimentation with IV
(intravenous) drugs without knowing about (AIDS virus)
transmission. Teachers have a most unique opportunity to bring the
facts out.''
   The conference was addressed Friday by John W. Washburn Jr., an
AIDS patient who is retired superintendent of the Brighton School
District near Rochester, N.Y.
   ``We can put a stop to this plague. You have important roles in
this task,'' Washburn said.
   Washburn, 48, was diagnosed last spring with AIDS and publicly
disclosed his illness in January. He then embarked on a series of
appearances and speeches to educate high school and college
students and teachers about the disease.
   Washburn said he does not think he is being unfairly exploited
as a gay man willing to talk openly about his illness.
   ``Exploit me,'' he said. ``My time is limited. I want to be
exploited by whoever can use me to put windows on what is now
happening with AIDS and what is likely to happen.
   ``My years in public school work have groomed me ... I'm not
embarrassed by the questions.''
   Other scheduled participants in the conference, which concludes
Sunday, include officials and researchers of the Atlanta-based CDC.
Discussion will include ways to incorporate AIDS education into the
existing school curriculum, to help young people avoid the virus
which causes the disease.
   The NEA and the CDC's parent agency, the Public Health Service,
are members of the Health Information Network, created in 1987 to
serve as a resource in the AIDS education effort. Last fall, the
network distributed 1.9 million copies of a handbook for teachers,
``Facts About AIDS.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome has struck 973 American
children under age 13; of those, 566 have died, according to the
CDC. In all, AIDS has struck more than 61,000 people in the United
States, killing more than 34,000 of them so far.

<HEAD>After 27 Years, Zoo Atlanta's Famous Gorilla Walks Outside</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He was skeptical at first, a little suspicious,
not sure what to make of grass, or trees, or sunshine. After all,
he hadn't seen those things in 27 years, since he was 3 years old.
   But Willie B., Zoo Atlanta's star attraction, quickly grew on
Friday to like his new home _ a $4.5 million outdoor ``rain
forest'' where, finally, he will live like the Western lowland
gorilla he is.
   As several dozen reporters, photographers and zoo staffers
watched from behind trees and bushes and across protective moats,
Willie B. played his part perfectly at what was a coming-out _ both
for him and for the once-beleaguered zoo where he lives.
   Just four years ago the zoo was declared one of the worst in the
nation by the Humane Society of the United States.
   Friday morning, as only a few zoo employees quietly watched,
Willie stepped out of his bad-weather shelter, walked around, felt
rain, and ran back in.
   ``A very intelligent thing to do,'' pronounced a proud Zoo
Atlanta Director Terry Maple.
   Later, the door again was thrown open, and the great ape hopped
out to meet his public.
   A minute later, he climbed back in.
   Another minute later, out again. Six minutes after that, a car
horn sounded _ and he scampered back inside.
   All the while, his eyes darted back and forth, alert to the
slightest movement or sound.
   But after 40 minutes, Willie boldly climbed a small hill outside
his door and picked up a few pieces of fruit thrown by his keeper.
   He heard peacocks, zoo construction trucks, an airplane, and car
horns.
   And for the first time in 27 years, he felt the sunshine on his
back.
   Within an hour, he was jumping in the air, trying to de-limb his
first tree.
   The zoo director beamed.
   ``This is a very special moment,'' Maple said. ``I will always
treasure this time. ... I'm delighted with the way he responded to
the whole thing. It just couldn't have been better.''
   Willie B., named for former long-time Atlanta Mayor William B.
Hartsfield, last month was moved from his tile-walled, steel-barred
cage _ his home since he arrived at the zoo in May 1961 _ into the
new indoor quarters he will use for sleep and shelter.
   After five weeks to grow accustomed to the enclosure, with
Charles Horton, his keeper of 14 years, often sleeping nearby to
keep him company, zoo officials decided he was ready.
   Soon, he will live near _ but separated from _ 13 gorillas on
loan from Emory University's Yerkes Primate Research Center.
   Zoo officials hope that within a year, Willie can go on a date.
   ``We'll get a young, reproductive-proven female, hopefully one
who could be seductive and friendly,'' said Yerkes Director
Frederick King. ``A Marilyn Monroe of gorillas, to show him what to
do.''

<HEAD>Hijackers Were Air Force Veterans, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Chinese men who hijacked a jetliner from the
mainland to Taiwan were air force veterans who had worked as radar
operators, the official China Daily said today. Taiwan said it was
weighing charges against the men.
   The report indicated that the hijackers' knowledge of air routes
foiled an attempt by the pilot to fly the Boeing 737 to Hong Kong
rather than land in Taiwan, seat of the rival Nationalist
government.
   In Taiwan, the country's chief security agency recommended today
that the two hijackers be prosecuted. The Taiwan Garrison Command
said the two violated Taiwan's civil aviation code.
   If charged with hijacking, the men could face the death penalty.
   The air pirates, Zhang Qingguo, 27, a worker at an arsenal in
Yunnan province, and Long Guiyin, 26, a steelworker from Guizhou
province, have been granted political asylum in Taiwan.
   They comandeered the plane Thursday about an hour after it left
the southeast coastal city of Xiamen for Canton on a domestic
flight.
   The plane, escorted by Taiwanese jet fighters, landed at
Taiwan's Qingquangan Air Force Base. It was refueled and flew back
to Xiamen, 136 miles across the Taiwan Straits, to end the
nine-hour ordeal for the 105 passengers and 11 crew members aboard.
   The China Daily said Zhang and Long first overpowered the
plane's security guard with a dagger and what appeared to be a gun.
They wrapped the chief flight attendant, who tried to set off an
alarm, and another attendant in a cotton curtain and threatened to
blow up the plane with explosives.
   After entering the cockpit, they covered the heads of the radio
operator and co-pilot with plastic bags, it said.
   An earlier report by the official China News Service said the
hijackers covered the head of the pilot, Yang Yongling, and told
him they had guns and knives. Zhang later told a television
interviewer in Taiwan that he had a toy pistol and fake explosives.
   As the plane entered Hong Kong air space, Yang tried to trick
the hijackers and land there, but the two realized his ploy and
forced him to continue toward Taiwan, the China Daily said.
   In Taipei, Taiwan, officials said the director of the Taiwan
Garrison Command's court martial division had recommended that the
hijackers be prosecuted for endangering flight safety, a charge
that carries a maximum penalty of 7 years in jail.
   Command officials refused to say whether the mroe severe charge
of hijacking might also apply.
   Liu Ching-yi, presiding judge at the Taipei District Court, told
reporters the court would consider the charge with compassion
because of the hijackers' motives.
   The garrison command delivered to the court a statement by the
two hijackers, saying they hijacked the plane because they detested
the ``brutal rule of the Chinese communists'' and wanted to seek
freedom in Taiwan.
   It was the second time a commercial Chinese airliner was
hijacked to outside the mainland. Six Chinese commandeered a
Trident owned by the Civil Aviation Administration to South Korea
in May 1983.
   They were imprisoned in South Korea for a little more than a
year, then released and allowed to go to Taiwan.

<TEXT>
   The dispute over a 10-year-old Bible-quoting
schoolyard preacher, who was suspended a fourth time after he
refused to stop proselytizing and go to class, will wind up in
court, his mother says.
   ``It's gone too far now,'' Robin Strode said Friday after her
son, Duffey Strode, received his fourth suspension from Eastfield
Elementary School in this tiny town in the Blue Ridge Mountains of
western North Carolina.
   Duffey, surrounded by dozens of reporters, stood in the school
parking lot Friday morning, ignoring requests from Assistant
Principal Shirley Ramsey that he stop preaching and come in out of
the rain.
   He accused onlookers of various sins.
   ``Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain!''
Duffey shouted. ``Thou shalt not commit adultery! You're guilty!
Even your eyes are filled with adultery! Men can't keep their eyes
off women and women can't keep their eyes off men. Adulterers shall
be put to death and their blood shall be upon them!''
   After several minutes, Mrs. Ramsey left Duffey standing on the
sidewalk and went into the school. After talking to his mother, he
entered the building to hand in some homework. Five minutes later,
the boy emerged, carrying a letter of suspension.
   The letter did not mention preaching, but said Duffey was
suspended for 10 days for being insubordinate, refusing to abide by
school policies, refusing to accompany Mrs. Ramsey into the school
and disruptive behavior.
   Duffey appeared unrepentent. ``I'd rather get gold and silver up
in heaven than an education down here,'' he said.
   ``This thing's going to court,'' Mrs. Strode said. She said she
has contacted an attorney through the Rutherford Institute, which
she described as a non-profit Christian legal foundation based in
Manassass, Va.
   Duffey's brother, Matthew, 5, and sister, Pepper, 6, also were
suspended for defying school officials earlier this month.
   Mrs. Strode said they probably will be suspended again when they
return to school Thursday.
   ``I told them if they want to go back and preach, that's fine,''
she said in an interview at the family's home.
   Mrs. Strode blames the family's problems on school officials.
   ``They are the ones who are keeping my children from getting an
education,'' she said.
   Mrs. Ramsey said the Strode children could return to school
Monday if they would agree to stop shouting Bible verses on school
grounds. She said expulsion was unlikely since the school year was
almost over.
   But Mrs. Strode said she couldn't guarantee Duffey would quit
preaching.
   ``I just leave that up to him, and if he wants to preach, I'll
back him 100 percent,'' she said. ``And if he doesn't, that's fine,
too.''
   Earlier, when asked if he felt pressured by parents, Duffey had
said, ``No. They ain't. I want to do it.''

   A passenger train hit a freight train
that was waiting at a rail station in northern Bangladesh, killing
at least five people and injuring 50, police said today.
   Three passenger coaches and one freight car were derailed in the
crash Friday at Azimnagar station near Ishwardi, 65 miles north of
Dhaka.
   Three of the injured were in critical condition, according to
police contacted by telephone in Ishwardi. They spoke on condition

were suspended pending an investigation.

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad has
underscored his efforts to make Islam the state religion by
ordering members of the armed forces to offer five prayers a day.
   Ershad said Friday that the prayers are now compulsory for
Bangladesh's 150,000 servicemen because they had ``taken the pledge
to defend the sovereignty and independence of the country by
putting their hands on the holy Koran,'' the Moslem equivalent of
the Bible.
   About 90 percent of Bangladesh's 105 million people are Moslems.
Hindus, Christians and Buddhists serving in the armed forces are
exempted from the mandatory prayers, according to an official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The five daily prayers, which are recited while facing Mecca,
are one of the five main duties of the Islamic faith.
   The government on Wednesday introduced legislation to make Islam
the state religion. Since Ershad's Jatiya Party holds 251 of
Parliament's 300 seats, the bill is expected to be approved.
   Opposition politicians, women's groups and professional
associations have denounced the legislation, saying it could cause
friction among religions and curtail women's rights.
   Major opposition parties are not represented in Parliament. They
boycotted the March 3 elections, because they refuse to participate
in a government headed by Ershad.
   The opposition has been campaigning since Nov. 10 for the ouster
of the former army general, who seized power in 1982. He later was
elected president in a vote that was marked by charges of flagrant
misconduct.

<TEXT>
   Six army officers have been arrested and
eight civilians implicated in a failed attempt to topple the
civilian government of President Vinicio Cerezo, the army said.
   Three other officers were suspended or ordered to retire for
their involvement in Wednesday's attempted coup, the army said in a
comminque Friday.
   Troops loyal to the government stopped columns of soldiers who
were moving toward the capital Wednesday from bases at Jutiapa, 75
miles southeast of the capital, and Retalhuleu, 115 miles southeast
of here.
   No shots were fired and the insurgents returned to their bases,
officials said. No details were given on the size of the rebel
force.
   The communique said the arrests and forced retirements ``are the
first actions of an administrative and legal nature applied to
re-establish army discipline'' after Wednesday's uprising.
   The army communique did not identify the civilians implicated in
the uprising, but said they included three former officers.
   ``The ex-officials are in retirement for having been expelled
earlier from the institution due to lack of morality and
discipline,'' the communique said.
   Cerezo on Thursday said only that the civilians did not include
leaders of the country's 14 legally registered political parties.
He said his government would take legal action against them, but
did not identify those allegedly involved.
   The communique listed those under arrest as Cols. Gustavo Adolfo
Cifuentes Dardoon, Neftali Antonio Galvez Cortez, Carlos Augusto
Garavito Moran and Gustavo Adolfo Padilla Morales; Maj. Manuel
Mariia Gordillo Martiinez; and reserve Lt. Miguel Angel Acevedo
Portillo.
   Cifuentes Dardon was a deputy commander of the Jutiapa base and
Padilla Morales was a deputy commander of the Retalhuleu base.
   Suspended without pay were aviation Lt. Col. Eduardo Roberto
Mazariegos Ramirez, for 12 months; and Capt. Ronaldo Cecilio Leiva
Rodriguez for nine months. Capt. Alan Roberto Castellanos Reyes was
retired.
   Cerezo, a Christian Democrat, took office Jan. 14, 1986, as the
first civilian president since 1970. There have been numerous
reports of coup plots during his administration, but all apparently
were stopped before any action was taken.

<TEXT>
   Four staff members have been put on temporary
leave at Chicago-Read Mental Health Center while officials
investigate the death of a newborn girl who drowned in a toilet
last month, state officials say.
   The workers were suspended last week and will continue to
receive paychecks, Dave Devane, spokesman for the Illinois
Department of Mental Health, said Friday.
   ``Our investigators are still talking to people,'' Devane said.
``Several other actions might be taken by the time the whole matter
is concluded in about two weeks.''
   Devane said there would be no criminal charges filed against the
newborn's mother or anyone else involved. He declined to comment
further on what other actions the department might be considering.
   The death prompted several mental-health advocacy groups to
accuse the department of chronic underfunding and understaffing of
its facilities.
   But Devane said hospital staff members checked the 34-year-old
woman before she had given birth, about 15 minutes before the
infant was found in the toilet.
   Staff members found the child after they saw blood on the
mother's leg, he said. An autopsy showed the newborn had drowned.

   Frank Sinatra says the people who write
``kiss-and-tell'' books such as those written about President
Reagan by former aides are ``pimps and whores.''
   The people who write such books ``can't write their own name to
earn a living properly,'' Sinatra said in an interview telecast
Friday on Larry King's Cable News Network talk show.
   ``They've got to lean on somebody else, and they know nothing
about the person of whom they've written,'' said the 72-year-old
singer. ``Those are the pimps and whores.''
   Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan and former Reagan
press secretary Larry Speakes recently published books that told
unflattering tales about the president.
   ``They're the ones who write the books about people with whom
they had a kind of privy association and believed in them and
believed in the other guy and suddenly they're out making a buck

   Sinatra is a friend of President and Nancy Reagan.

   ``It didn't really sting me that much,'' he said. ``I've been

<HEAD>Art Institute to Run Ad Apologizing for Mayor-in-Lingerie Painting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Art Institute of Chicago has purchased
full-page newspaper ads apologizing for a student's painting of the
late Mayor Harold Washington in frilly women's underwear.
   The painting, titled ``Mirth and Girth,'' was seized by a group
of black aldermen last week who stormed the school's halls and was
later confiscated by police.
   While the Art Institute prepared its apology, the American Civil
Liberties Union threatened a lawsuit on artist David Nelson's
behalf, and discord over the black aldermen's seizure of the
painting led to angry words exchanged in the City Council.
   The Art Institute and its school _ where the painting was shown
briefly in a private, juried student show _ plan to run full-page
advertisements in three daily Chicago-area newspapers offering an
apology for the caricature of the city's first black mayor, who
died of a heart attack in November.
   ``It contains an apology for the distress and concern that the
painting caused to the community,'' Art Institute spokeswoman
Eileen Harakal said of the ad, which will run in Sunday's Chicago
Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times, and in Monday editions of the
Chicago Daily Defender, which has a primarily black readership.
   ``We would like to see calm in the community,'' she said Friday.
``We never intended for there to be any unrest in the first place
and want to put the entire incident behind us and move on.''
   Ms. Harakal refused to release the text of the ad before
publication.
   The Art Institute and its school came under fire Wednesday, when
aldermen began receiving telephone complaints about the work by
Nelson. The City Council passed a resolution cutting off city funds
for a school program unless the painting was removed and demanded
an apology.
   The black aldermen then stormed the school and removed the
painting.
   The painting was returned to Nelson Thursday, defaced with a
5-inch gash on Washington's left shoulder, after the ACLU
intervened with the city corporation counsel, said Jay Miller, the
Illinois ACLU's executive director. The organization is considering
a lawsuit seeking monetary damages from police for violating the
artist's civil rights, he said.
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer, who succeeded Washington, said he was
disgusted by the work. ``It should never have been hung. In fact,
it should never have been painted.''
   Several white aldermen complained Friday that black colleagues
had overreacted.
   ``The whole thing could have been resolved with a phone call,''
said Alderman David Orr. ``Now, by going to the council floor and
grandstanding on the issue, millions of people will have seen this
sad, insensitive, disgusting picture, as opposed to a few dozen.''
   But at a meeting of black ministers Friday, the Rev. Willie
Barrow, executive director of Operation PUSH, the civil rights
group founded by Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson,
described the painting as ``the latest in a series of escalating
attacks and insults against the black community.''
   The Art Institute, meanwhile, received dozens of calls Friday
from people supporting an artist's right to show his work, Ms.
Harakal said. Students said they had consulted attorneys about
filing a civil rights lawsuit against the aldermen and police for
impounding the painting.

<HEAD>Government Tightens Noose Around Sikh Temple</HEAD>

   Government forces fired at the Golden
Temple today after seizing surrounding buildings and tightening
their grip on the shrine, where militant Sikh separatists were
holed up for a sixth day.
   Sikh extremists and government commandos traded intermittent
fire through the night inside the sprawling temple complex, home of
the Sikh faith's holiest sanctuary. At least 27 people, mostly Sikh
militants, have been killed during the siege that began Monday.
   About 20 women and children, thought to be relatives of the
militants, remain in the temple, Amritsar Police Chief K.P.S. Gill
said.
   Government forces on Friday seized about one-third of the
complex, including adjacent temple offices and a hostel. That left
the militants with the equivalent of 3{ city blocks, including the
temple.
   The extremists inside the temple complex are thought to number
fewer than 100. Police sharpshooters killed at least six militants
Friday, including one who tried to shoot his way out of the complex.
   Police said no government troops have been killed since the
siege began. About 2,800 troops are posted outside the temple.
   Most of the militants are believed to be entrenched at the
western side of the complex, officers said. But they said any
government assault would more likely come from the west, officers
said.
   ``The eastern side is difficult to enter because terrorists are
still holding two 80-foot towers overlooking that entrance,'' said
a paramilitary officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Authorities escorted journalists to a sandbagged position atop a
buildimg overlooking the towers today.
   In a two-hour period, government troops regularly fired machine
gun bursts into the temple compound, but only sporadic shots were
returned.
   S.D.S. Aswal, deputy superintendent of the Central Reserve
Police Force, said the Sikhs did not fire from the tower in
daylight because that would give away their position: ``They start
firing from portholes cut into the tower after late evening.''
   The bunker had a commanding view of the Golden Temple and the
sacred pool that surrounds it. One body was seen lying near a
marble walkway.
   In the square facing the compound's main entrance, cane-wielding
police charged at a group of Sikhs who attempted to march into the
temple. At least eight marchers were arrested, said witnesses who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The siege is the biggest massing of forces outside the Golden
Temple since June 1984, when the army stormed the 400-year-old
shrine to dislodge the Sikh militants.
   More than 1,200 people were killed, and Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, who ordered the raid, was assassinated five months later by
her Sikh bodyguards.
   Sikh militants have waged a campaign of violence, often gunning
down whole family of Hindus and moderate Sikhs, in their battle to
establish a Sikh homeland in northern Punjab state, which includes
Amritsar.
   Although Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's total population,
they are a majority in Punjab. The Sikhs say they are discriminated
against by Hindus, who comprise 82 percent of India's 800 million
people.

   Showers and thunderstorms stretched across a broad area today
from southern New England into Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Missouri
after heavy rains closed some roads.
   Showers and thunderstorms also covered much of Florida, and
showers lingered over southern Georgia and the Carolina coast.
   A few showers and thunderstorms continued ahead of a cold front
crossing the northern High Plains. Scattered showers dampened the
Pacific Northwest. Fair skies prevailed over the rest of the nation.
   Thunderstorms Friday night forced the closing of some roads in
Trimble County, Ky.
   Strong, gusty winds blew through the Great Plains. In Wyoming on
Friday night, winds gusted to 58 mph in Rawlins and hit 62 mph in
Cody.
   High-temperaure records were set in a number of cities,
including Casper, Wyo., where a reading of 85 degrees topped by 1
degree the mark set in 1941. Temperature records fell in Tucson,
Ariz., where it was 105 degrees, 2 degrees higher than the 1978
record for the date; Billings, Mont., 87 (85, 1969); Alamosa,
Colo., 81 (80, 1984).
   A cold front moving eastward across the country caused
temperatures to plunge today. In Montana, the mercury had dropped
as much as 40 degrees by early today. Temperatures ahead of the
cold front were still in the 60s and low 70s in the south central
region and the Southeast.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
Florida to the Carolina coast; scattered showers and thunderstorms
from Tennessee and the upper Mississippi Valley to the northern and
central Plains to Colorado; a few showers over Washington and
Oregon and windy conditions prevailing over the northern Rockies
and northern Plains.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 70s or 80s over
much of the nation; in the 50s or 60s from New England to the Great
Lakes region and from the northern Rockies to the Pacific
Northwest; the 90s over the central and southern Plains; and from
the 90s to near 110 degrees in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 28
degrees at Sawyer Air Force Base in Marquette, Mich., to 87 degrees
at Yuma, Ariz.

<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers' contracts with Chrysler
Corp. will stand despite a narrow rejection by skilled trades
workers of a pact ratified by a majority of 66,000 union members,
UAW leaders say.
   ``The International Executive Board after reviewing all the
issues ... has determined that this contract stands properly
ratified,'' the union said Friday in a statement attributed to UAW
President Owen Bieber and Vice President Marc Stepp.
   The contract was ratified by 54 percent of the vote Wednesday.
Skilled trades workers, who have an additional, separate contract
but cast a single vote for or against both pacts, narrowly rejected
it.
   Chrysler says it has about 10,500 active skilled trades workers.
   Delegates to the UAW's 140-member national Chrysler council who
represent skilled trades workers met in Chicago on Friday with
Stepp and other union leaders to determine whether negotiations
should resume.
   The union and Chrysler could have returned to the bargaining
table to discuss skilled trades issues if those had been behind the
rejection. However, if the rejection was on issues in the main
contract, such as economics, then the UAW would take no further
action.
   The union's decision indicated that the rejection concerned the
main contract. Union officials had said before the meeting that
they believed the rejection was economic, and blamed it on a $1,000
signing bonus.
   Chrysler workers received a $2,120 bonus in 1985 for signing a
three-year contract.
   The UAW executive board, which includes Bieber, Stepp, other UAW
vice presidents and regional directors, decided to ratify the
contract after receiving a report on the Chicago meeting.
   The contracts, reached May 5 after 2{ weeks of early
negotiations, cover 66,000 hourly and salaried Chrysler workers in
15 states.

   That was the most ever paid for a pearl, Christie's spokeswoman

brought $3,315,714 for the benefit of the Bellerive Foundation,
which promotes the conservation of natural resources.
   A 33.13 carat, pear-shaped diamond, also from the collection,
sold for $1.8 million to a private collector whose name was

   A man was convicted of murder in an attack on
a 65-year-old woman who was raped and robbed before being tied to a
bed and burned to death.
   A Superior Court jury deliberated less than two days before
pronouncing Manuel Mendoza, 23, of Alhambra, guilty Friday of one
count each of murder, rape, arson and robbery in the Feb. 7, 1986,
assault on Mary Frances Litovitch.
   Mendoza faces either a life sentence in prison without parole or
the death penalty, Deputy District Attorney Lauren Weis said. A
separate hearing will be held to determine the jury's sentencing
recommendation.
   Mendoza also was convicted of nine other felonies, including
robbery, burglaries and kidnappings that occurred from Feb. 5 to
Feb. 7, Weis said.
   Evidence presented by the prosecutor showed that Mendoza broke
into Litovich's home during the afternoon and sexually assaulted
her. After tying her to the posts of a bed, he attempted to
strangle her, breaking her neck, then poured a flammable liquid
over the bed and set it ablaze.
   Neighbors heard Litovich's screams and tried to rescue her as
smoke billowed from her bedroom. But she died before they could
reach her.
   Mendoza later was arrested after a neighbor reported seeing him
fleeing with a case later identified as Litovich's camera case. The
case, later recovered, contained some of the woman's jewelry, Weis
said.

<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded inside a truck today
near reviewing stands being prepared for farewell ceremonies to
mark the retreat of Soviet soldiers. Eleven Afghans were killed and
12 reported wounded.
   The blast occurred in the heart of Kabul at 5:45 a.m. (9:15 p.m.
EDT Friday) in a housing area on the banks of the Kabul River.
   A Western photographer on the scene told The Associated Press
that a baby and 11-year-old girl were among those killed and all
the casualties were Afghan civilians. Most appeared to have been
occupants of nearby homes destroyed by the impact of the explosion,
he said.
   ``When the bomb exploded some of the houses nearby just
collapsed.''
   Witnesses said they saw four bodies being removed from one house.
   The blast was so great that it shattered the windows of a bus
depot across the river, 300 yards away and left a crater 20 feet
wide and 10 feet deep.
   Soviet troops arrived afterward, the photographer said by
telephone.
   Vladimir Sevruk, deputy chief of the Soviet Communist Party
Central Committee's propaganda department, also provided casualty
figures to foreign reporters covering the pullout, which is to
begin Sunday.
   In Moscow, the official Tass news agency reported that the blast
killed 11 people and wounded 13 and blamed ``Afghan anti-government
formations.''
   The explosion demolished embankment walls on both sides of the
river, which threads through this ancient capital city, whose
streets are now filled with Soviet troops, tanks and armored
personnel carriers.
   Blood was visible on the gates of a nearby factory and personal
belongings, including carpet slippers, were scattered in the street.
   Witnesses said flames were visible when they arrived shortly
after the blast. The bomb had been planted in a large truck that
was badly mangled.
   Last month, six people were killed and 49 wounded in another
bomb blast along the river banks on the 10th anniversary of the
April 1978 revolution that brought a Marxist government to power
and triggered widespread insurrection.
   Anti-Communist guerrillas also were blamed for a May 4 attack on
a Soviet convoy north of Kabul that killed a photographer for the
Soviet newspaper Izvestia and an undisclosed number of soldiers. It
also wounded Sevruk's son, who also works for Izvestia.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
Soviet-allied government put down the insurrection.
   About 115,000 Soviets have been assisting Najib's troops, but
they will begin leaving the country on Sunday in observance of a
peace agreement signed in Geneva on April 14.
   Half of the Soviets must be out by Aug. 15, and the rest are
expected to follow quickly, although the accord gives them nine
months to complete the pullout.
   At a new conference today, the head of the Soviet military
contingent in Afghanistan said the guerrilas were taking their toll
on Soviet and Afghan troops, but that rebel attacks would not deter
the withdrawal.
   ``The opposition may have some effect on us, but not much, and
certainly they will not be able to frustrate the timetable,'' Lt.
Gen. Boris Gromov told reporters.
   Troops manning the Soviet armor in Kabul have been setting out
gasoline pumps and supplies along the route of retreat. For
security reasons, Soviet officials have been tight-lipped about the
exact number of troops who will begin the move north on Sunday.
   The Soviet national news program Vremya reported Friday night
that soldiers were ready for the withdrawal, but gave no figures.
   Vremya reported that 167 Soviet encampments would be left behind
for the Afghans to use, but that some of the facilities would be
put to civilian use as hospitals and schools.
   Information for this account was based in part on a news agency
pool report from Kabul by Reuters and on Moscow monitoring of
Soviet news broadcasts. The Associated Press was not allowed to go
on the trip to Kabul because of questions it asked Najib in the
capital last month.

   The movie ``La Bamba'' swept the Golden Eagle
Awards at the 18th annual Nosotros Banquet, which honors
achievements and contributions by Hispanics in entertainment.
   At Friday night's gala, the most promising actor and actress
awards went to Lou Diamond Phillips and Rosana de Soto, who star in
the movie about the short life of 1950s rocker Richie Valens.
   ``La Bamba'' director Luis Valdez was named outstanding director
for the film, which was released in both English and Spanish last
summer.
   Los Lobos, the band whose version of the Valens hit ``La Bamba''
climbed to the top of the record charts last year, won the music
achievement award.
   Other winners included Charlie Sheen, named outstanding actor
for his performance in the movie ``Wall Street,'' and Raquel Welch,
who won outstanding actress.
   She starred as the determined barmaid mother who filed legal
actions to remove a racist teacher from her daughter's high school
in the NBC-TV movie ``Scandal in a Small Town.''
   Jaime Escalante, the Garfield High School math teacher whose
success in teaching students calculus was dramatized in the movie
``Stand and Deliver,'' was named winner of a lifetime achievement
award, as was the musical group Las Hermanas Padilla. The group has
been performing for more than 50 years.
   Eddie Velez and Elizabeth Pena were named outstanding television
actor and actress. Velez's series, ``Trial and Error,'' was
canceled by CBS.
   Kenny Ortega, the choreographer for the movie ``Salsa'' and
``Dirty Dancing'' was named outstanding choreographer, while singer
Jose Feliciano was named outstanding performer.
   The Nosotros group was founded in 1980 by actor Ricardo
Montalban and others interested in promoting Hispanics in
entertainment.

   Ferry services around Britain began
resuming normal operations after unionized workers ended walkouts
that had been called in support of a strike by ferry workers in
Dover.
   The National Union of Seaman instructed its members to end its
sympathy strikes on Friday. The strikes had been called in support
of a 14-week-old walkout by workers at P and O European Ferries in
Dover.
   Truck drivers angered at the disruption of freight traffic by
the strikes also ended on Thursday their four-day blockade of ferry
loading berths in English, French and Belgian ports.
   Thousands of ferry workers in more than a dozen British ports,
including some 2,300 Sealink British Ferries workers in Dover, had
walked out in recent weeks in sympathy with their P and O
colleagues.
   P and O workers struck in February to protest new work
conditions extending the work week.
   P and O, the largest channel operator, wants to streamline
operations before the undersea Channel Tunnel between England and
France opens in 1993.

   The army reopened the occupied Gaza Strip today
after a 29-hour closing imposed to prevent Palestinians from
reaching Jerusalem for prayers marking the last Sabbath of Ramadan,
the Moslem holy month.
   In the Gaza strip's Shati refugee camp, Israeli soldiers opened
fire to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators, wounding a
16-year-old Palestinian in the leg, said doctors at Gaza City's
Ahli Arab Hospital. Three Arabs suffered beating injuries. The army
said it was checking the report.
   PLO leaders orchestrating the Arab protests in the occupied
lands allowed stores to open for several hours this morning in most
areas of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Arab east Jerusalem. The
move allowed residents to stock up for the three-day holiday
marking the end of Ramadan next week.
   In Gaza, Palestinian youths burned tires in the main street at
noon, a signal to the merchants that it was time to close again,
said an Arab reporter who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At Jerusalem's sacred mosque complex, hundreds of Arab
worshipers protesting Israeli occupation battled riot police after
Ramadan prayers Friday, leaving 20 Arabs and four policemen
injured. Nineteen Arabs were arrested.
   Police firing rubber bullets stormed the complex after
protesters threw stones, chanted nationalist slogans and burned
Israeli flags. Israel radio said a U.S. flag also was set ablaze.
   About 3,300 police officers have been deployed in Jerusalem
since Thursday to maintain order during Ramadan prayers.
   Authorities said the beefed-up force would remain at least
through Sunday, the 40th anniversary of the founding of Israel and
also Jerusalem Day, when Israelis mark the anniversary of the
capture of Arab east Jerusalem in 1967.
   The army freed 281 Palestinian prisoners Friday in a holiday
gesture. Still imprisoned are more than 4,500 Arabs arrested since
the uprising began Dec. 8 in the lands Israel seized in the 1967
Middle East war.
   The army recently released from prison about 100 youths between
the ages of 14 and 16, leaving only a few in that age group in
custody, army West Bank commander Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna told
Israel radio Friday.
   He said no prisoners were younger than 14.
   About 15,000 Moslem worshipers attended Ramadan prayers Friday
at Jerusalem's Temple Mount. Last year's attendance was 200,000.
   The numbers were drastically reduced after the army sealed off
Gaza Thursday night, barring the coastal strip's 650,000 residents
from entering Israel. Roadblocks also prevented most of the West
Bank's 850,000 Palestinians from reaching Jerusalem.
   After prayers in Jerusalem, about 1,000 worshipers marched
around the Temple Mount, chanting ``Jews out'', ``We don't want to
see any Zionists'' and ``No fear, no fear. The stone is better than
the Kalashnikov (rifle).''
   A few hundred youths hurled stones at the police station facing
the Al Aqsa Mosque there. Seconds later, about 100 helmeted riot
police carrying clubs and assault rifles charged the complex,
firing rubber bullets into the crowd.
   Hospital officials said they treated 20 Arabs for rubber bullet
injuries, and police spokesman Rafi Levy said four police officers
were slightly hurt by hurled stones.
   At least 10 injured Arabs were carried across the complex on
stretchers. An elderly Arab, blood streaming down his face, shouted
`God is great' and flashed a victory sign. Four or five women were
also carried out on stretchers.
   During the two-hour clash, many worshipers remained inside the
mosque, afraid to leave. The Moslem prayer leader appealed to
police through loudspeakers to withdraw.
   Residents in the West Bank city of Nablus and neighboring
refugee camps remained confined to their homes for a second day
today.
   The army imposed the curfew after receiving ``warnings that
people in Nablus planned disturbances,'' Mitzna said.
   In the Gaza Strip city of Khan Yunis, soldiers fired rubber
bullets at a car that crashed through an army roadblock Friday, and
an Arab passenger was struck in the eye, the army said.
   Army officials have said more than 1,400 Arabs have been injured
in the uprising, along with 298 soldiers and 172 Israeli settlers.
   The U.N. lists 187 Arabs and two Israelis killed since Dec. 8.

   Berlin Philharmonic conductor Herbert von
Karajan's frequent absences and canceled West Berlin concerts have
struck a chorus of sour notes from once-loyal Berliners and will be
taken up by the city's Senate.
   The council said Friday that it would debate those issues May 30.
   A Social Democratic delegate to the Senate, Walter Momper, said
it would also examine recording and other contracts made by
Karajan's agent that may involve work by the entire Berling
Philharmonic.
   ``Berlin and its orchestra are not a vehicle that exists solely
to advance Karajan's economic interests,'' he told reporters.
   Karajan, the orchestra's 80-year-old ``conductor for life,'' has
been sharply criticized in recent months by Berlin fans and city
cultural officials who disburse the public funds that help bankroll
the orchestra.
   He canceled a heavily advertised Berlin concert on Sunday, April
24, then flew off to Japan for a tour with the orchestra the next
day, provoking widespread complaints from Berliners.
   Karajan has suffered medical problems in recent years, including
severe back pains that have forced him to cancel conducting
appearances. But city cultural officials say he has on several
occasions called off concerts under questionable circumstances.
   During a tour of West Germany last November, Karajan called off
a concert appearance in Duesseldorf, saying he couldn't mount the
podium because he said he had food poisoning from eating tainted
fish.
   Karajan later changed his mind and performed, but called off
another appearance in Stuttgart during the same tour.
   Michael Dieterici, a city Cultural Affairs office spokesman,
recently told The Associated Press that West Berlin provides some
$25 million in subsidies to the orchestra. He said he did not know
how much money Karajan receives directly.
   West German publications have recently carried reports about
enormous sums of money Karajan's agents allegedly demanded last
year for a concert tour of Taiwan. The tour was later called off
because of the fees Karajan was demanding, according to the reports.

   Pro-Iranian fundamentalists today
attacked the last stronghold of their Syrian-backed rivals in the
city's southern slums, where the two factions have waged a bloody
duel for control since May 6.
   Police said six people were killed and 13 wounded in today's
inter-Shiite Moslem fighting, lifting the nine-day toll to 204
killed and 574 wounded.
   In other fighting today in the southern neighborhoods, Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat's loyalist
guerrillas and Syrian-backed adversaries traded mortar and
artillery fire at the Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp.
   Police said three people were killed and 11 wounded in the
fighting between Arafat's mainstream Fatah guerrillas and rebels
led by Col. Saeed Mousa.
   There was no word on what started the fighting at the refugee
camp, where billows of smoke rose from the gunfire. The intense
battles in the area, where the pro-Syrian Amal and the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah were also fighting, kept reporters out.
   A police spokesman said Hezbollah launched a pre-dawn assault on
the Shiyah district, seeking to dislodge Amal of its last
stronghold in the area. The thuds of exploding shells echoed across
west Beirut as the two factions battled with heavy artillery,
mortar and tank fire.
   Hezbollah said in a statement that its fighters were advancing
into Shiyah. Amal spokesmen said the assault was repulsed and that
a counter-attack was launched to retake positions captured by
Hezbollah.
   Police said they were unable to verify the claims.
   The two groups were fighting in a 16-square-mile enclave where
most of the 18 foreign hostages were believed held by kidnappers
affiliated with Hezbollah, or Party of God. The Beirut-based weekly
magazine Ash-Shiraa said Friday the hostages had been moved from an
exposed Hezbollah barracks to the home of Sheik Ibrahim al-Amin,
Hezbollah's spokesman, in a less vulnerable neighborhood.
   Ash-Shiraa was first to report in November 1986 on the secret
U.S. arms sales to Iran made in an effort to free the hostages, who
include nine Americans.
   Syria, meanwhile, escalated its war of words with Hezbollah. A
ranking Syrian official said, ``Hezbollah has become an aberration
on the Lebanese scene.
   ``This phenomenon is destabilizing tranquility and warrants
immediate and drastic treatment,'' the official told the Moslem
Voice of Nation radio without elaborating. The broadcast did not
identify the official.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 25,000 troops
in the Bekaa and in north Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate. Though Iran's main Arab ally, Syria has been
alarmed by Tehran's attempt through Hezbollah to dominate Lebanon's
1.2 million Shiites.
   Police estimate Hezbollah has 3,000 combatants fighting Amal,
which has thrown some 6,500 militiamen into the battle.
   Hezbollah also said Amal's military headquarters on the main
Beirut Airport highway were overrun during the night. Amal denied
the claim.
   Hezbollah's snipers killed a Syrian on the airport highway on
Friday and Syrian soldiers fired back, killing five Hezbollah
fighters. It was the first time that the Syrians directly
intervened in the fighting, which falls outside their jurisdiction.

   Ex-president Ferdinand Marcos today
pledged support for President Corazon Aquino and told his followers
not to stage a new coup. About 5,000 people rallied to demand the
ousted leader's return.
   Marcos also asked Mrs. Aquino to allow him to return to bury his
95-year-old mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4.
   On Friday, Marcos claimed he was negotiating with Manila and
Washington to return for the funeral and he expected the talks to
be finalized in a few days.
   There was no immediate comment from the government to Marcos'
latest statement, broadcast by Manila radio stations. Earlier
today, Mrs. Aquino's spokesman said the imminent return of Marcos
was ``impossible.''
   ``I ... reiterate that I oppose violence, that I have no
intention of mounting a coup d'etat or causing a civil war,''
Marcos said in a statement read by telephone from Hawaii by his
spokesman Gemmo Trinidad.
   ``Instead let us join forces with Madame Aquino so that the
communists and some rebel bands would not venture to commit acts of
adventurism to challenge the stability of the current government.''
   In another statement issued Friday by his followers, Marcos said
he hoped an agreement on his return could be reached ``in a day or
two.''
   Mrs. Aquino's spokesman, Teodoro Benigno, branded the statement
meaningless. U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt told reporters that
American officials ``just haven't been involved at all'' in
negotiations regarding Marcos' return.
   Meanwhile, a bomb exploded near sundown today at military
headquarters, killing one soldier, officials said. The building has
been vacant since being set ablaze during an August coup attempt.
   Navy Lt. Anselmo Cabingan, a military spokesman, said the victim
was believed to be a member of a roving guard force and may have
picked up an explosive device left after the coup plot failed.
   ``It's an accident,'' Cabingan said. ``It`s not connected with
anything political or whatever. It's just a simple accident as we
see it.''
   Mrs. Aquino, citing national security, has refused to allow
Marcos to return for his mother's funeral. Benigno said the
decision was unanimously endorsed by the Cabinet.
   ``There is nothing that should cause worry, excitement or
nervousness on our people about reports that ex-president Marcos
will return,'' Benigno said. ``There is no truth to that.''
   Marcos supporters gathered today under a blistering sun in a
downtown square and marched to the Mendiola Bridge about 300 yards
from the presidential palace. March leader Salvador Panelo said
they would remain there until Mrs. Aquino reversed her decision or
Marcos appeared before them.
   Police agreed to allow the estimated 5,000 protesters to remain
there as long as the protest was peaceful. About 200 riot police,
backed by four water cannon and four firetrucks, guarded the
approach to the palace.
   Protesters waved banners reading ``Give Us Marcos or Give Us
Death,'' while others claimed Marcos was the only one who could
stop the Communist insurgency, which erupted and spread nationwide
during Marcos' 20-year rule.
   Marcos supporters have been linked to several attempts to topple
the Aquino government. Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986 after
a popular uprising.
   Marcos told ABC News in an interview Friday that he would
support the Aquino government if he were allowed to return.
   ``My mother is dead and I'd like to go home,'' he said in slow,
somewhat slurred speech from his home in Honolulu. ``I will support
the Aquino government to prevent any adventurism or prevent any
attempt at the takeover by the communists.''
   ``There is nothing that Madame Aquino should fear from me,'' he
said. ``I mean well. And if I should be any obstacle, we will be
able to work it out.''
   The body of Marcos' mother has been lying in state at a suburban
church since her death. Marcos supporters say she will be buried in
northern Luzon but have given no firm date for the funeral or for
the body to be taken north.
   The United States barred Marcos from leaving Hawaii without
permission after the Aquino government claimed he had chartered a
plane in January 1987 to return home if a coup attempt succeeded.

   Student protesters today hurled rocks
and firebombs as police set off barrages of tear gas to break up a
march advocating reunification talks with North Korea.
   There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.
   The march broke off from a rally of about 10,000 students from
universities around the country who gathered at Korea University.
   Some prominent dissident leaders, including the Rev. Moon
Ik-hwan, attended the rally. Relatives of hundreds of jailed
dissidents also participated.
   The students, many wearing headbands reading ``unification,''
also asked the government of President Roh Tae-woo to make
concessions to persuade North Korea to join the Seoul Olympic Games
in the fall.
   In a separate statement, the demonstrators proposed that student
leaders of South and North Korea meet on June 10 to discuss
national unification and the Olympic co-hosting.
   Unification of the Korean Peninsula has emerged as a major
campus issue as radical students shifted their anti-government
strategy after legislative elections last month, when the
opposition made a strong showing.
   North Korea has said it would boycott the Olympics in Seoul
unless it is allowed to co-host the Games.
   After the campus rally, about 5,000 students walked out of the
school to begin what they called ``a grand peace march'' to
headquarters of the National Red Cross in downtown Seoul.
   When the marchers went 1,000 yards, about 2,000 riot police
intervened, pushing the students to both sides of the street. Some
students responded by throwing rocks.
   Many protesters were forced back to the school, where they began
throwing hundreds of firebombs and rocks over the fence. Police
retaliated with tear gas.

<HEAD>Jazz Trumpeter Chet Baker Dies In Fall From Building</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with police saying Baker used heroin
before death. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American trumpeter Chet Baker, a
jazz virtuoso who found fame in the 1950s but whose career was
haunted by heroin addiction, died in a fall from the second floor
of his hotel.
   Baker, who was 59, took heroin just before he fell from the
hotel window shortly after 3:10 a.m. Friday, police spokesman Klaas
Wilting said today. Authorities found Baker dead in the street.
   Wilting said suicide was possible. But Ria Wigt of Wigt
Productions, Baker's worldwide agent, said Baker ``wasn't the type
of man'' who would commit suicide.
   Born Chesney Baker in Yale, Okla., in 1929, the musician set the
standard for what jazz buffs knew as the ``cool school.''
   In 1952, he was working with Charlie Parker on the West Coast
when he joined the piano-less quartet of British saxophonist Gerry
Mulligan.
   With his good looks and youth and fragile, introverted tone,
Baker soon became a cult figure. In 1953, he topped the Metronome
trumpet poll and started his own quartet. His work became more
assured and outgoing.
   Baker looked something like actor James Dean and sounded
something like famed jazz trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke. As a player,
Miles Davis was his main inspiration.
   In 1955, Baker took a group to Europe that showed high promise.
Then his career started to suffer. An Italian court sentenced him
to a 16-month prison term in 1960 for drug possession.
   In San Francisco in 1968, Baker said he was beaten up by
hoodlums and suffered severe injuries that included the loss of his
teeth, a trumpet player's nightmare.
   For two years Baker didn't play, but he said recently he had
quit drugs. He began recording again and made an album with pop
star Elvis Costello.
   In 1974, critic John S. Wilson wrote in The New York Times that
Baker had developed ``more range and assertiveness within the
wistfully ruminative style with which he has also been associated.''
   Baker had scheduled several appearances in the Netherlands as
part of a tour that also included West Berlin and France.
   He had been staying at the Prins Hendrik hotel close to
Amsterdam's drug district, said Wilting.
   ``The way it looks, he had just been using'' heroin, Wilting
told The Associated Press. Traces of heroin use were found in
Baker's hotel room, he added.
   ``Maybe he started acting funny,'' said Wilting. ``He was alone
and shoved the window open himself and either fell or jumped out _
I don't suppose we'll ever find out which.''
   A receptionist at the hotel, where Baker checked in Thursday,
said the musician ``was a little nervous'' when he arrived. He did
not elaborate.
   The receptionist, who refused to give his name, said the window
of Baker's room slides open vertically, leaving a 10-inch gap at
most.
   ``How he got through there I don't know,'' the receptionist
said. ``He must have been dead straight away,'' he said.
   The hotel official said Baker showed no signs of drug abuse.

   Iraqi warplanes today attacked and set
ablaze five ships, including two of the world's largest
supertankers, at an offshore oil-loading terminal that belongs to
Iran, shipping executives reported.
   One ship was reported sinking and 20 crew members were reported
missing.
   An Iranian jet fighter was overheard by radio monitors as it
warned an unidentified U.S. Navy warship to stay away from the
area, said the executives, who spoke on condition they not be
identified.
   A large number of Iranian salvage tugboats were reported
battling fierce flames aboard the Liberian-flag, 564,739-ton
Seawise Giant, the world's biggest ship, from which oil was leaking.
   The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
received the information from ships in the vicinity.
   Thirty-six members of the Seawise Giant's 50-member crew were
evacuated while the crew of the four other vessels had abandoned
ship, the sources said. It appeared the other 14 from the Seawise
Giant were missing.
   The 457,841-ton Burmah Endeavour, a British-flag vessel that
also ranks among the world's five largest vessels, was the least
damaged. But radio communication indicated two crew members were
missing, sources said. Both the Seawise Giant and the Burmah
Endeavour are used as ``motherships'' or oil storage depots.
   The sources said the Spanish-flag 235,000-ton Barcelona, which
was taking on cargo from the Seawise Giant, was sinking as a result
of the attack. Four Spanish crewmen were missing and 26 were
rescued, said the Spanish national news agency EFE, quoting
London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit.
   The other two stricken vessels were the 231,712-ton Iranian
tanker Khark and the 152,004-ton Cypriot ship Argosy, both shuttle
tankers used by Iran to carry oil down the Persian Gulf to Larak.
The sources said these were still aflame, but damage was not severe.
   The Iraqi News Agency said ``large numbers'' of jets took part
in the rare long-range raid and all returned safely to base.
   An air raid siren sounded at Larak around 1:05 p.m. (5:05 a.m.
EDT) as Iraqi warplanes made one of their rare long-range raids on
Larak, at the northern end of the Strait of Hormuz, the gulf's
gateway.
   The Seawise Giant also was hit in Iraqi raids last year, once in
October and again in December. The huge vessel is chartered by
Iran's government-owned oil company as a floating storage depot for
oil at the Larak terminal.
   It was not known whether the Burmah Endeavour was serving as a
similiar role or picking up an oil cargo.
   Most of Iran's oil customers pick up shipments from Larak. The
Iranians use a special fleet of chartered tankers to shuttle crude
to Larak from the Kharg Island terminal in the northeastern gulf.
   Kharg, 350 miles from Larak, is in the Iraqi-declared exclusion
zone, where ships entering are susceptible to attack.
   Shipping sources said the Iranians apparently warned off a U.S.
warship when it tried to move closer to Larak to check out the
situation. The unidentified American ship was not heard to reply,
and radios afterward were silent, the sources said.
   A U.S. source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
U.S. Navy had monitored a radio message from an Iranian F-4 Phantom
jet ``requesting permission to attack a ship.'' There was no
American vessel in the area at the time, and there was no
indication of what ship was referred to, the source said.
   U.S. warships are now permitted to intervene on request in
attacks on neutral shipping as well as to provide ``humanitarian
aid'' to non-U.S. flag vessels, but only in international waters.
   Today's attack occurred inside Iran's territorial waters.
   The Iraqis have recently intensifed air raids on tankers plying
Iranian waters as part of Baghdad's bid to throttle the vital oil
exports that help Tehran finance the 7{-year-old war.
   The Baghdad High Command has claimed nine air raids on ``large
maritime targets,'' meaning ships, off Iran's coast in the past two
weeks. Three have been confirmed by Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence
Unit.
   Iraqi attacks mainly are directed at tankers in Iranian waters
closer to Kharg, and sometimes off Lavan island, a terminal in the
central gulf.
   Iraqi air forays against Larak, which would necessitate midair
refueling of the jets, are rare.

   Praise for Jesse Jackson and a talk on party unity from New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo helped calm troubled waters between Jackson and
Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis, but Cuomo
continued to withhold his endorsement of either man.
   Vice President George Bush, meanwhile, campaigned at a defense
plant in Fullerton, Calif., where he called Dukakis' views on
defense ``naive at best'' and warned they ``would be dangerous.''
   Dukakis spent much of Friday fending off attacks from Jackson
and Bush, suggesting his Democratic rival's call for a big spending
increase for education ``doesn't make any sense'' in the face of
federal budget deficits.
   Cuomo emerged Friday from a 1{-hour private meeting in San
Francisco with Jackson, saying the Democrats needed him.
   ``The Democratic Party needs Reverand Jackson for his personal
input, for his personal capacity, for his ability to deal with the
issues intelligently _ not just to articulate them, which he does
with eloquence and effectiveness, but understanding the issues,
especially questions of foreign policy,'' Cuomo said at a
fund-raiser for a local congressional candidate.
   But Cuomo, who eliminated himself as a possible presidential
contender last month during his state's sometimes rancorous
primary, also praised Dukakis as ``a man of great intelligence,
great sensitivity and great practicality.''
   The balancing act helped Cuomo keep an earlier promise not to
endorse any candidate until after the June 7 California primary,
where 336 delegates to the national convention are at stake.
   Jackson immediately praised Cuomo's stand on an endorsement,
saying that ``waiting until after June 7 is the appropriate thing
to do. That was the governor's commitment, and he has remained true
to his position.''
   Jackson put in an appearance earlier Friday at a drug treatment
center in Los Angeles. Jackson, who has made fighting drugs a
primary theme of his campaign, criticized Dukakis for not putting
forth ``a comprehensive plan.''
   And in an interview with The New York Times, Jackson compared
Dukakis with Bush, saying: ``Like Bush, Dukakis almost brags about
putting forth no plans. Like Bush, Dukakis says I have not said
anything concrete to anybody about anything.''
   ``We fundamentally are on the same side of history,'' said
Jackson later, muting his criticism of Dukakis following his
meeting with Cuomo.
   Bush, the certain Republican nominee, told the crowd of defense
plant workers: ``The Dukakis doctrine is the doctrine of wishful
thinking. And it is bad thinking.''
   ``The Soviets ... respect only strength. To think that they
would agree to cuts in their strategic and conventional arsenals in
the face of unilateral American abandonment of major weapons
programs is the height of folly.''
   Bush also went on the offensive on the environmental issue.
   ``I want to make the environment a Republican issue,'' he told a
cheering crowd of about 800 Republicans at a rally in Portland,
Oregon. ``I would like to be remembered the same way as Teddy
Roosevelt _ next to the national security, it's the condition of
the Earth that you will leave to generations to come. We can do
better.''
   Meanwhile, a pollster for President Reagan said Friday that Bush
faces an uphill battle against likely Democratic nominee Dukakis in
November because of growing national pessimism about the country's
future.
   Richard Wirthlin, in an interview with the Detroit News, said a
national survey he completed last month for the Republican National
Committee found that polls showing Bush trailing Dukakis are
accurate.
   ``Bush is behind at this point,'' Wirthlin said. ``I don't
believe he is in a hole that he can't get out of, but he has a
major task ahead.''
   Wirthlin, who has advised Reagan for eight years, worked for
Bush's early political season rival, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.
   Bush was to visit a tree nursery near Medford, Ore., today; take
a raft trip Sunday and visit a tree research lab in Washington on
Monday.
   Dukakis dismissed Jackson's accusation that he is too vague,
pointing to his record as Massachusetts governor.
   ``It will come as a surprise to the White House and Mr. Bush if
my views on the world and my style of political leadership has any
similarity to his. One of the things I have is a record. People
don't have to guess about it,'' he said.
   Speaking to about 200 students at Jefferson High School in Daly
City in a suburb of San Francisco, Dukakis warned against illegal
drugs and called for increased public emphasis on education.
   His wife, Kitty, told students of her own 26-year dependency on
diet pills.
   Dukakis also hit back at Jackson on education.
   ``You can't go around talking about $20 billion more for public
education out of the federal budget when you've got a $170 billion
deficit. That doesn't make any sense,'' he said. ``You've got to
pick your priorities and pick them carefully.''

<TEXT>
   Americans sent more than 80,000 letters to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev last year, and the ``most
characteristic'' of the messages will be published in a book, a
Soviet newspaper reported Saturday.
   Sovietskaya Kultura published excerpts of 13 letters from across
the United States and an introduction that will be included in the
book.
   The book will be called ``Americans Write to Gorbachev,'' which
was also the headline on top of Saturday's newspaper story. The
letter excerpts mostly expressed the writers' concerns about world
peace and the threat of nuclear war, but they also touched on
topics like Stalinism and the aims of socialism.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor of the weekly news magazine Ogonyok,
described the American missives as ``letters of hope.'' Korotich
and Soviet affairs scholar Stephen Cohen of Princeton University
discussed the mail and its meaning in a dialogue that will
accompany the letters selected for the book.
   Sovietskaya Kultura did not say when the book would be available.

<TEXT>
   A 21-year-old woman admitted in court that
she committed 2,257 crimes in a four-year spree that netted 291
cars and other goods worth more than $2 million.
   Sharon Head, who wrote a 37-page confession after talking to
police for 165 hours, was sentenced to 4{ years in prison Friday by
Judge Martin Stephens at Cardiff Crown Court.
   ``The catalogue of crimes you committed almost defies belief,''
the judge said.
   Ms. Head, who has a 5-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter, said
she became involved with a gang of criminals as a teen-ager.
   ``All I can say is that I was a very stupid person and I am
deeply sorry,'' she said. ``I want to get all the crimes cleared
up. I want to start afresh.''
   Ms. Head was arrested after starting a series of fires in a
house in Cardiff where she had lived.
   She pleaded guilty to one charge of arson, four thefts and four
burglaries and asked for 2,248 other offenses of theft, burglary,
attempted burglary and stealing cars to be taken into consideration.
   She admitted stealing 291 cars, some to order, including
Ferraris, Porsches, Jaguars and Range Rovers. Prosecutor Paul Lewis
said only 129 have been traced.
   Defense attorney Charles Cochard said Ms. Head kept just a small
part of the proceeds of her crimes to help care for her children.

   They turn out faithfully to wave
banners and chant slogans for their exiled leader's return, but
supporters of Ferdinand Marcos are dwindling, and some of his
former champions believe the ousted president is history.
   The death May 4 of Marcos' mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos,
revived the spirits of his die-hard followers. They have
transformed her wake into an ongoing rally to demand that Marcos,
70, be allowed to return from exile in Hawaii for the funeral.
   ``Give Us Marcos or Give Us Death,'' read the banners in
downtown Manila on Saturday as thousands rallied to demand the
ousted leader's return.
   Nearly 10,000 Marcos supporters turned out Wednesday for a noisy
rally and vowed to camp near President Corazon Aquino's residence
until she changed her mind and allowed their leader to come home.
   But most of the crowd drifted away in the hot summer night, even
before the 4 a.m. deadline imposed by the military for them to
disperse.
   More than two years after a popular uprising drove Marcos from
power, thousands of Filipinos still long for the return of the
``Apo,'' or the ``grand old man,'' who dominated Philippine
politics for two decades.
   But most Filipinos don't expect, let alone want, him to return
to power.
   Mrs. Aquino refused to let Marcos come home for his mother's
funeral, citing his continued threat to national security in the
wake of several attempts to topple her.
   ``Another fact that the loyalists would have to accept is that
Marcos is already part of history and that Mrs. Aquino is president
of the Philippines, for better or worse, until 1992,'' wrote
columnist Alvin Capino in the Philippine Daily Globe, which has
been critical of her leadership.
   Marcos loyalists are loosely organized into several political
groups, including the ``I Am a Filipino Movement,'' and the New
Society Movement.
   Those groups routinely muster crowds of several hundred, who
turn out for pro-Marcos rallies at public squares and in front of
the American embassy.
   The crowds are a curious mix of middle-aged men and women, aging
movie queens, former Marcos-era officials and northerners studying
in Manila.
   Reliable figures on the number of Marcos supporters are
unavailable. His lawyer, Rafael Recto, insists that Marcos still
enjoys broad albeit discreet support.
   ``After all, Marcos was elected and proclaimed by the people
while Cory was just put in the chair by two men _ Ramos and
Enrile,'' Recto told the newspaper BusinessWorld.
   He was referring to the role of Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, a former
defense minister, and Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, the former
military chief, in the February 1986 uprising that toppled Marcos.
   But results of congressional elections in May 1987 and of
regional balloting last January show the New Society Movement with
little support except in Marcos' native north and in scattered
areas of Mindanao island.
   Loyalty to Marcos remains strongest in his home province, Ilocos
Norte, and other areas of northern Luzon where the Ilocano language
is spoken. Ilocanos make up about 10 percent of the 58 million
Filipinos and have a reputation here for clannishness.
   ``The trouble with us Ilocanos is we feel prouder of the honor
of having a president from among us rather than the benefits it
brings,'' said Rosario Lazo, an Ilocano member of a pro-Aquino
party, in a recent interview.
   Elsewhere, there are numerous signs that most Filipinos no
longer believe Marcos has a role to play in Philippine politics.
   A survey of about 2,000 Manila residents, conducted in March and
released Thursday by the respected Ateneo Social Weather Station,
found that the percentage of those who opposed Marcos' return
declined from 68 percent in October to 39 percent in March. But it
appeared the decline was due more to a feeling that Marcos was no
longer a danger than to any new support for him.
   Even some military dissidents who have tried to topple the
government seem reluctant to link themselves to Marcos.
   Right-wing sources say former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan, leader of the Aug. 28 coup attempt, has refused to join
with two other renegades _ former Lt. Col. Reynaldo Cabauatan and
former Brig. Gen. Jose Marie Zumel _ because of their
identification with Marcos.
   Honasan, who escaped from a prison ship last month, played a key
role in the February 1986 military revolt that triggered the mass
uprising against Marcos.
   Rep. Ramon Durano Jr., a congressman from Cebu island and son of
Marcos' longtime friend and political ally Ramon Durano Sr., said
recently that despite personal ties to the Marcos family, political
reality has forced him to cooperate with the Aquino administration.
   ``If I don't cooperate with the administration, my bills won't
get passed and I can't work for my constituents,'' he said.

   France on Saturday launched the world's
smallest nuclear-powered attack submarine.
   Canadian government and military officials joined French
dignitaries to watch the launching of the Amethyste, which will be
operational in 1991. Canada is considering buying the submarine.
   The manufacturers, Cherbourg Arsenal, said it is the world's
smallest nuclear-powered vessel. It is 243 feet long and 23 feet
wide and weighs 2,400 tons.
   The Amethyste has a speed of at least 25 mph and can operate at
depths up to 984 feet. It carries a crew of 66.
   The manufacturers said the submarine carries torpedoes and
anti-ship Exocet missiles.
   The Canadians have said they plan to use submarines of this type
to patrol vast areas in the Arctic.

<HEAD>Study Foresees Massive Change in U.S. Industry in Next Two Decades</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a four-year study on new technologies,
the government has concluded that the next two decades will be a
time of massive change in which virtually every U.S. product,
service and job will be reshaped.
   The study, done by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment and released on Saturday, said that Americans in the
21st century should enjoy longer, more productive lives than any
preceding generation.
   The study said that emerging technologies should offer the
opportunity to expand educational opportunities, extend life and
reduce sickness and make work more rewarding by using machines for
tedious, repetitive jobs.
   But the study warned that rapid change also threatens to ``shake
the foundations of the most secure American businesses.''
   ``With each opportunity for progress, there are opportunities
for serious misstep,'' the study said. ``Change can create an
America in graceless decline, its living standards falling behind
those of other world powers.''
   The report is titled ``Technology and the American Economic
Transition.'' Eight congressional committees ordered researchers to
take an in-depth look at the forces now at work on society and what
the implications were for policy-makers.
   ``We know that we are moving away from an economy heavily
dependent on raw materials, where most businesses were isolated
from international trade,'' said project director Henry Kelly.
   As one example of how change has already reshaped the country,
the study said that the number of lawyers, bankers, scientists and
accountants needed to supply Americans with food was now roughly
equal to the number of farmers.
   In fact, only four out of every 100 jobs in food production is
on the farm. More than half of the jobs in food production now are
held by sales people, precision craftsmen, managers and data entry
clerks.
   The study said that for the country to take full advantage of
emerging technologies, Congress should consider making fundamental
changes in its tax laws and various government regulations.
   ``Regulations designed to protect consumers ... may have
outlived their usefulness in areas ranging from banking to housing
to electric utilities,'' the study said.
   In the tax area, the study urged reducing or abolishing the tax
on capital gains and reforming or abolishing the corporate income
tax. The report said these taxes reduce needed investment to boost
U.S. productivity.
   The study also said that the deduction for housing interest
should be limited to a fixed amount because it made little sense to
encourage investment savings in the form of home purchases but not
permit the complete deductibility of educational expenses because
this discouraged investment in human capital.
   Among the report's predictions about the future:
   _New technologies for collecting, storing and manipulating
information have the potential to revolutionize the economy.
Businesses are already spending 40 percent of their investment
dollar on computers and other ``information'' machines, double the
1978 share.
   ``The potential productivity gains in this area _ the movement
and organization of information _ are at least as great as those
produced (by) the first Industrial Revolution,'' the study said.
   _Increased foreign competition was inevitable with the
post-World War II recovery of Japan and Western Europe and the
emergence of sophisticated production in places like Korea and
Taiwan. Undisputed U.S. economic leadership may be lost, but the
change does not necessarily mean that U.S. living standards will
decline. Living standards in Britain rose steadily for a century
after it lost its dominant position in the world economy.
   _Consolidation of farm ownership is likely to continue so that
by the year 2000, the 14 percent of farms with annual sales higher
than $250,000 will account for between 80 percent and 90 percent of
total sales. Likewise, grocery stores will continue getting larger.
So-called super stores with 200,000 square feet of space offering
20,000 products now account for 28 percent of all grocery store
sales.
   _The U.S. housing industry, to combat the decline in home
ownership, may follow the trends of Sweden and Japan, moving toward
prefabricated homes built on assembly lines, sold in showrooms and
then put together on the site.
   _The nation's educational system is on the brink of major
technological changes through the use of computers that will make
learning more productive and fun while allowing teachers more time
to spend with individual students.

   A man who tried to smuggle gold into India
by swallowing 48 nuggets was caught when an airport metal detector
started beeping, customs officials said Saturday.
   Mohammed Soorya, 30, was arrested Friday at Bombay's airport
after he arrived from the Persian Gulf emirate of Dubai, said
assistant customs collector P.J.R. Shekhar.
   A magistrate ordered Soorya to undergo a medical examination,
and an X-ray showed 48 small objects in his stomach, Shekhar said.
   He said Soorya admitted swallowing 24 ounces of gold. India bans
gold imports by private citizens.
   Soorya was being given laxatives at a a hospital, and six gold
pieces had been recovered by Saturday.
   The recovery was slow because Soorya, a Moslem, was observing
the dawn-to-dusk fast during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and
would not swallow anything before sundown, said doctors.

   Writing about your ex-boss, who also happens to
be the president of the United States, can be profitable.
   A sampling of the crop of books on President Reagan by former
administration officials shows that some of the authors have done
quite well.
   There was a first printing of 250,000 copies for Donald T.
Regan's ``For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington,'' to be
published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich on May 23. There's a second
printing of 75,000, and the former White House chief of staff was
given a $1 million advance. Regan says he is donating the advance
and the proceeds of the book to charity.
   Harper & Row spent a reported $2.4 million in 1986 for David
Stockman's ``The Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution
Failed.'' The investment seems to have paid off for both the
publisher and the former director of the Office of Management and
Budget with 325,000 books in print.
   ``Revolution,'' a book written by Martin Anderson, former
assistant to the president for policy development, to be published
on May 18, has a first printing from Harcourt of 25,000.
   Charles Scribner's Sons published ``Speaking Out'' earlier this
year by Larry Speakes, Reagan's former spokesman. The book had a
first printing of 100,000 copies, and Speakes and co-author Robert
Pack received a six-figure advance.
   However, there were only 35,000 books in print for former deputy
White House chief of staff Michael K. Deaver's ``Behind the
Scenes,'' published by William Morrow Co. in 1987.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III has told
President Reagan he shared objections by prosecutors to dismissing
drug trafficking charges against Panamanian military leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega, one of the prosecutors says.
   Meese ``told me that he also opposed'' any dismissal and ``he
would convey my thoughts to the president,'' U.S. Attorney Leon
Kellner of Miami said Friday after meeting with the attorney
general in Washington.
   ``He did that today,'' Kellner said.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle, whose office in Tampa obtained
one of two drug indictments against Noriega in February, said from
Florida if he were ordered to sign an order dismissing charges
against Noriega, ``They wouldn't have to fire me, I would resign.''
   ``I could not myself sign an order of dismissal, but I may not
be in a position to stop it,'' Merkle said Friday in his first
public comment about the negotitations reportedly going on to
remove the military leader from power.
   Reagan administration officials have said they were ``plea
bargaining'' with the Panamanian military chief and de facto ruler
over the possible dropping of drug-smuggling indictments returned
in February by grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla.
   The State Department apparently believes that dismissal of the
indictments is the only way to induce Noriega's departure, but the
Justice Department sees that concession as too high a price to pay.
   But Kellner said dismissing the case would ``send the wrong
message to the people of this country.''
   ``What it says is that the bigger you are and if you have more
threats to give to this country, we'll let you get away with
criminality,'' Kellner said, explaining his objections.
   ``How do we continue ... going after the little fish when the
big fish can walk away?'' he said, referring in particular to the
Colombia-based Medellin cartel.
   As he has since word of a possible deal with Noriega leaked out
Wednesday, Meese told reporters he would have no comment on the
matter.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., today lauded the administration's
objective of getting rid of Noriega but said the charges against
him must stand. ``Letting him off the hook would send exactly the
wrong message at exactly the wrong time to the world's drug
king-pins, the peddlers of death and misery,'' said the former
presidential candidate in a statement released by his office.
   At the White House on Friday, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater was asked about assertions by Noriega that negotiations
with the United States on his eventual departure from power have
collapsed.
   ``He says that all the time,'' Fitzwater said. ``He said `fall
apart' or something similar before.
   ``We are still talking. We are still negotiating.''
   Fitzwater said Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, met with Reagan on Friday afternoon. He
would not say what the subject of the meeting was or who else, if
anyone, attended.
   The president left for his weekend at Camp David a half-hour
later than originally scheduled, but Fitzwater would not say
whether the meeting caused the delay.
   Earlier Friday, Panama's foreign minister denied that Noriega
was negotiating to have the drug charges dropped.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter, interviewed on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' said no deal involving Noriega
was imminent and the drug indictment ``isn't really part of the
negotiations.'' He did not elaborate on what was being discussed.
   A top State Department official, Michael Kozak, has been engaged
in secret negotiations with Noriega in Panama, and administration
sources said Wednesday the military chieftain was told that if he
left Panama for a year, perhaps in August, the indictments would be
dropped.
   However, Noriega said Friday night, ``I have not talked with Mr.
Kozak,'' and he called for the U.S. ambassador to Panama to leave
the country.
   ``The dignity of Panama is not negotiable while there are
foreign troops on our territory, humiliating our soil, while there
is economic aggression, as long as there are threats, as long as
there is psychological war ... as long as Ambassador Arthur Davis
does not get out,'' Noriega said during a meeting in Rio Hato, 60
miles southwest of Panama City.
   State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said she had no
comment on Noriega's statements or whether the United States was
considering withdrawing Davis from Panama.
   Noriega has survived widespread public protests and an economic
collapse at home as well as sustained U.S. diplomatic and economic
pressure.

<TEXT>
   Parts of George Orwell's celebrated novel ``1984''
about a mind-numbing totalitarian society have been published in
the Soviet Union with an introduction saying Soviets are ready to
judge it for themselves.
   However, the excerpts, appearing in this week's Literaturnaya
Gazeta, also carry an editor'snote suggesting Orwell's fictional
society bears no resemblance to the Soviet Union of today.
   The page of excerpts was published in the literary newspaper
with an introduction by Sergei Zalygin, editor of Novy Mir
magazine. Novy Mir plans to publish the 1949 novel in full later
this year. The novel has never before been published in the Soviet
Union.
   The excerpts included the omnipresent warning of Orwell's
imaginary regime that ``Big Brother is Watching You'' and the
mind-bending recitations of the Ministry of Truth that ``War is
Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength.''
   Orwell, an Indian-born Briton who died in 1950, grappled with
the nature of human freedom in his essays and novels, which include
``Animal Farm.''
   Zalygin compared Orwell's ``1984'' with the writings of Mikhail
Bulgakov and Yevgeny Zamyatin. Their tales of dictatorship, ``The
Master and Margarita'' and ``We,'' were long suppressed.
   ``It's possible that Orwell wrote his work with a concrete
address _ the address of socialism _ but that time has been passed
when we were frightened and, to put it delicately, confused,''
Zalygin wrote.
   The repression that marked Josef V. Stalin's 29 years in power
has been denounced by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has
also advocated a freer hand in the arts and release of long-banned
literary works.
   Zalygin wrote of Orwell: ``Now not only can he judge us, but we
judge him, as we know where he was right and where he was not.''
   Popular novels often are serialized in large-circulation monthly
journals in the Soviet Union, where books are usually published in
too small a quantity to satisfy public demand.

<HEAD>Rangoon Says Two Killed By Police, 625 Arrested In Student Riots</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two students killed during riots in March
were shot to death by police, according to the findings of an
official inquiry announced Saturday.
   A government statement on the front pages of newspapers said a
three-member government-appointed commission reported that 34
people, including students, policemen and people living in the area
of the campuses, were injured in the March 12-17 violence.
   The commission was headed by U Ba Maw, a member of the Council
of Peoples Justices, or the Supreme Court. The statement didn't say
when the commission reported its findings to the government.
   The riots at the Rangoon Institute of Technology and Rangoon
University were the worst student disturbances in recent years in
Burma, a tightly controlled nation under one-party rule.
   The commission said 625 students were arrested.
   Authorities hadn't previously given any figure for arrests and
said only that one student died from unspecified causes when police
quelled rioting at the Rangoon insitute on March 13.
   ``The post-mortem revealed that the two students died of bullets
from 12-bore guns used by the police to disperse the crowd,''
Saturday's announcement said. ``To minimize casualties, police used
12-bore single barrel guns instead of the M-16 rifles with which
they were armed.''
   The announcement said that of the students arrested, 484 have
been released and the others held for further investigation.
   It said the violence began March 12 when students at the Rangoon
Institute of Technology and local youths fought over which music
cassette they wanted played at a tea shop near the school.
   Authorities arrested a local youth said to have been involved in
the melee but released him for lack of evidence, the announcement
said. More clashes with local youths ensued the next day as
students angered by the release hurled stones and set fire to
several buildings.
   It said riot police separated the 300 students and 300 local
inhabitants, but the students, who had retreated inside the campus,
began throwing stones at the police. The police retaliated with
water cannons, but the stone-throwing intensified.
   The police then fired 14 tear gas bombs and six shots from
12-bore guns, the announcement said. It said five students were
struck by gunshots. One student, Maung Phone Maw, a 23-year-old
engineering student, died on the spot while another student, Maung
Soe Naing, died in the hospital on April 5.
   The disturbances at the institute continued until March 15 when
security personnel took control of the campus and arrested 68
students, it said.
   It said that over the next two days, students at Rangoon
University, ``instigated by political elements from the outside,''
joined the unrest.
   The announcement made no mention of March 18 rioting in downtown
Rangoon in which hundreds of students and others, demonstrating in
support of the students at the universities, shouted
anti-government slogans, smashed cars and set ablaze a government
department store.
   That riot was quelled by security forces. There has been no
official mention of arrests or casualties.

<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan Contras, poorly supplied and
politically divided, may face disintegration, with impact beyond
Nicaragua's borders, according to U.S. officials.
   Less than two months after the rebels signed a temporary
cease-fire agreement with Nicaragua's leftist government,
administration analysts on Central America say the Contras' future
seems bleak for a variety of reasons:
   _Up to 3,000 rebels, denied delivery of U.S. humanitarian aid
shipments, have fled across the Nicaraguan border into Honduras in
search of food.
   _Serious rifts have emerged in the Contra ranks. An undetermined
number of rebels mutinied recently against military commander
Enrique Bermudez at a Contra camp in southern Honduras. Bermudez
also faces opposition from at least two members of the rebel
political directorate.
   _If fighting resumes after the current cease fire ends on June
1, the Contras have enough military supplies to last only one to
two months. Congress rejected President Reagan's military aid
request on Feb. 3 and there is little support at present for a
reversal of that decision.
   _Soviet military supplies are continuing to flow to the
Sandinistas at a rate slightly ahead of the 1987 pace. According to
U.S. estimates, Soviet military deliveries totaled $105 million for
the first three months of 1988.
   ``The Contras seem to be in the process of disintegrating,''
said one official, insisting on anonymity. ``The consolidation of
Sandinista rule is upon us.''
   The official said all of the predictions he and some others in
the administration had made in February after the congressional
rejection of Contra aid are being borne out.
   Specifically, he said the aid vote has contributed to increasing
right-left political polarization in Guatemala, reflected in a
failed military coup attempt there last week, and in El Salvador,
where the rightist ARENA party won impressively in national
elections in March, the official said.
   He added that the prospective demise of the U.S.-backed rebels
in Nicaragua has had the effect of ``emboldening'' leftist
guerrillas in El Salvador who are aligned with the Sandinistas.
   These views, however, are not universally shared in the
administration. Another official, also speaking privately, said the
trends in Guatemala and El Salvador are the result of internal
developments unrelated to the situation in Nicaragua.
   The prevailing view among more conservative members of the
administration is that consolidation of Sandinista rule would
generate nervousness in neighboring countries, forcing them to
shift priorities from democratic development to concerns over
internal security.
   If military coups occur, Congress would retaliate by drastically
reducing assistance, creating both economic hardship and increasing
sympathy for leftist rebels, according to this scenario.
   The Contras and the Sandinistas signed a temporary truce in
Sapoa, Nicaragua, on March 23. They agreed to try to negotiate a
permanent cease-fire during a 60-day period starting April 1.
   With the deadline for reaching agreement on formally ending
their six-year war just two weeks away, there has been virtually no
progress toward that objective.
   Disputes between the Sandinistas and the Contras have prevented
delivery of U.S. humanitarian aid to the rebels inside Nicaragua,
leaving the administration with no option but to try to send them
cash via couriers.
   If no final agreement is reached by the June 1 deadline, the
Contras have two obvious alternatives available to them, neither
very promising, the officials said.
   As one official described it, the Contras could resume the war
and face defeat against superior Sandinista firepower. Or they
could reach agreement with the Sandinistas on a truce extension,
enabling the Sandinistas to maintain slow-pace negotiations in
hopes that total demoralization of the rebels eventually would set
in.
   If the Sandinistas decide to resume the war, this would win
renewed sympathy for the rebels in the U.S. Congress but the
Contras also could be confronted with what one official said was
the possibility of a quick ``knockout blow.''
   In that case, he said, ``if the Congress decides to approve more
aid, there would be no one to give the aid to.''

<HEAD>South Looms As Tough Battleground For Democratic Nominee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The South, once solidly Democratic in
presidential races but now reliably Republican, is a tough
battleground for Michael Dukakis as he tries to put together an
electoral coalition to defeat George Bush and enable the party to
recapture the White House.
   With many states in the politically conservative region viewed
as beyond his reach in November, Dukakis is being urged to choose a
running mate who could help the Democrats carry Texas or Florida,
the two largest states south of the Mason-Dixon line.
   Dukakis won the Democratic primaries in both those states on
Super Tuesday, a fact that gives Democrats reason for optimism.
   Supporters of the Massachusetts governor also are quick to argue
that Bush does not have the hold on Southern voters that Ronald
Reagan could claim.
   It's possible for Dukakis to find the 270-vote Electoral College
majority outside the South, a coalition that would require every
big industrial state in the North plus California and Farm Belt
states where economic hard times the past seven years have made the
Reagan-Bush administration politically unpopular.
   But any Dukakis strategy without the South would require an
electoral shift of historic proportions for a Democratic victory in
November.
   ``They cannot let us sweep it (the South),'' said Vince Breglio,
a Republican consultant and authority on electoral college
strategies. ``If we take Florida, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina
and the rest of the cotton South, I don't think they can win.''
   ``What I can't figure out is how you get the numbers if you
don't run strong in the South,'' said Walter F. Mondale, the 1984
Democratic presidential nominee.
   Mitch Daniels, who served President Reagan as White House
political director, predicted that the Democrats would ``decide the
South is a mirage and that their best hope lies in a sweep of the
industrial belt.''
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, said that if the political trends go in Dukakis'
direction and he is headed for a big victory he would run well in
the South, but ``if it's a close election, I'd say he has very
little hope of carrying much outside of perhaps a couple of border
states.''
   For generations, 16 Southern and border states gave Democratic
presidential candidates a solid electoral base. In 1944, Franklin
D. Roosevelt took all 167 electoral votes from those states.
   Dwight D. Eisenhower broke the Democratic hold on the region in
1952 and 1956. And in 1964, when Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson crushed
Sen. Barry Goldwater, the only bright spot for the Arizona
Republican was the Deep South. Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi and South Carolina resisted the Johnson landslide and
backed Goldwater, the only states outside of Arizona to support him.
   Since then, Southern and border states have voted strongly
Republican except in 1976, when Georgian Jimmy Carter was the
Democratic candidate. In 1980, Reagan took 138 of the region's 169
electoral votes and four years later, the Republican president
received all but the 3 electoral votes of the District of Columbia.
   Democratic pollster Natalie Davis is based in Alabama and she
pointed out that in 1984, Mondale got 13 percent of the white vote
in the state.
   ``If the white vote tripled and the black vote came out the way
it was supposed to, then Dukakis would beat Bush by half a
percentage point,'' she said. ``Think about that as a mission.
We've got to triple what we did in '84.''
   When Claibourne Darden, an Atlanta-based pollster, was asked how
Dukakis was playing in the South, he replied, ``He doesn't play so
hot. He is your classical, party activist, Democratic candidate for
president of which we've seen many come and all go.''
   There was little agreement on whether Texas or Florida would
offer the best hope for a Dukakis breakthrough.
   Texas is where Bush makes his home, where he first became active
in politics and where he was elected to a House seat.
   A Texas Democrat, who insisted on anonymity, called it ``highly
unlikely'' that Dukakis could carry the state, ``as unlikely that
Reagan would carry Minnesota in '84.''
   Jim Quackenbush, who was southern coordinator for the Mondale
campaign, said he thought Dukakis had a better chance of carrying
Texas than of winning Florida.
   ``Florida is just a hard state for a Democrat to take,'' he said.
   Florida Democrats talked optimistically about Dukakis' prospects
against Bush in their state.
   ``The decision on the vice presidency will be fundamental,''
said Wayne Bailey, a professor of political science at Stetson
University in Deland, Fla., and a Democratic Party activist.
   If Dukakis chooses Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia or Sen. Bob Graham
of Florida, said Bailey, ``The ticket will be very saleable in
Florida.''
   Richard Pettigrew, former Democratic chairman in Dade County,
Fla., said Nunn or Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee or Sen. John
Glenn of Ohio would be the strongest running mates for Dukakis
because they would ``assure people'' on foreign and defense policy.
   Pettigrew and Quackenbush said Nunn would be a lot more
effective in the South than Graham.
   Sabato took the opposite view. He said Nunn might not get
Dukakis any state other than Georgia. While the senator could add a
couple of points to the ticket in other Southern states, it might
not be enough to carry any of them.
   ``Graham would make much more sense,'' he said, because the
senator could bring home Florida for the Democrats.
   Even a partisan like Quackenbush conceded that in the South ``if
you're from Massachusetts, whether it's reality or perception,
you're perceived as a liberal.''
   But he contended that Dukakis can win support in the South by
emphasizing the idea that as a governor he has been ``a fiscal
conservative.''
   A big plus for Dukakis in the South is the perception that Bush
does not have the hold on voters that Reagan had.
   ``Bush's hold on Southern voters is not intense,'' said Sabato.
   ``Nobody gets excited about George Bush,'' said Davis.

<HEAD>Fiji's Marks First Anniversary Of Coup, Police Detain 18 People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Saturday detained 18 people
demonstrating against the government of Sitiveni Rabuka as Fiji
marked the first anniversary of a military takeover that catapulted
Rabuka to power.
   Rabuka celebrated his first year in power by attending an army
parade where he exhorted soldiers to be considerate in preserving
order this weekend.
   Troops remained on full alert as a precaution against possible
violence, but no major trouble was reported.
   Police broke up a ``demonstration for democracy'' in downtown
Suva while Rabuka attended the parade at the Queen Elizabeth
Barracks army headquarters. He told his troops to be mindful that
some sections of the community had suffered as a result of the coup.
   The celebrations should not ``make things worse for people who
might fear for their safety and their property,'' said Rabuka, in
an apparent reference to Indians, who outnumber ethnic Fijians in
the 715,000 population.
   On May 14, 1987, Rabuka, then a lieutenant colonel and third in
the army's chain of command, led 10 masked soldiers into Parliament
and arrested the elected Indian-majority coalition government of
Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra.
   Rabuka said he staged the coup to protect the interests of
ethnic Fijians, who comprise 47 percent of the population. Bavadra
had been in office only a month after defeating Prime Minister Ratu
Sir Kamisese Mara in April elections.
   After the coup, an interim government was set up, but when it
didn't please Rabuka, he staged a second takeover on Sept. 25.
   Since then a nervous calm has settled over Fiji. The country's
tourist-based economy is in shambles.
   Gross domestic product is down 11 percent, sugar production _
the country's major cash crop _ is down 20.3 percent, tourism has
plummeted 26.9 percent and the Fiji dollar has been devalued by 33
percent.
   At his home in Viseisei, Western Fiji, Bavadra issued a
statement vowing to continue to push for racial equality in Fiji, a
group of 300 islands east of Australia.
   At the parade, Rabuka presented good conduct and meritorious
service medals to six high-ranking army officers, several of whom
were involved in the May 14, 1987 takeover.
   He told supporters that the recipients of the medals were
``shining examples'' to follow.
   Among the demonstrators were members of the Fiji Women's Rights
Organization and a Catholic priest. The women, wearing black as a
sign of mourning, carried placards denouncing the coup.
   Banners reading ``Only One Race _ The Human Race'' and
``Democracy Lives'' were torn down by police, who told the crowd to
leave before it got out of control.
   When they refused to move, police herded some people into vans
and took them away. Officials said the demonstrators were not
charged and would be released later.
   Other demonstrators went to St. Andrew's Presbysterian Church
where, watched from outside by police and soldiers, they held a
religious service.
   On Saturday, the gates at the Parliament building remained
locked. Fiji has had no Parliament since the coup and is now
governed by an interim administration led by Mara while a new
constitution is being written to guarantee power for ethnic Fijians.
   No other incidents were reported and the army was not much in
evidence around the country except for guards at key points, such
as power installations.

<TEXT>
   The city's fire chief says he will seek a
criminal investigation into an alleged delay by security guards in
reporting a fire that ravaged the state's tallest skyscraper.
   Fire Chief Don Manning said Friday he intends to pursue legal
action ``to the extent possible'' in the wake of the May 4 inferno
that devastated four floors of the First Interstate Bank tower and
left one man dead.
   Security personnel allegedly ``failed to notify the Fire
Department of the fire in a timely manner, which is a violation of
the Los Angeles Municipal Code,'' said Battalion Chief Dean Cathey.
   City officials said security guards reset fire alarms that went
off on the 12th floor because they believed them to be false. They
say guards delayed notifying authorities for seven minutes,
allowing the blaze to spread through the 12th floor of the 62-floor
office building.
   Jim Clauson, an official with Pedus Security Services, Inc., has
disputed fire officials' version of events. Clauson said Pedus
guards called the fire department about a minute after the alarms
went off.
   Fire officials said that when fire alarms sounded a third time
on the 12th floor, security officers sent a building engineer to
the 12th floor to investigate. The worker, Alex Handy, 24, died in
the blaze.
   Manning spoke Friday during state senate hearings currently
being conducted in Los Angeles on proposed fire-sprinkler
legislation. A bill would require the installation of fire
sprinklers in all high-rise buildings in California.
   Clauson did not return telephone seeking comment about the
investigation ordered by Manning.

<HEAD>Bennett Holds Out Prospect of Future Run for Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outgoing Secretary of Education William J.
Bennett says that if he runs for any political office in the
future, it will be the presidency.
   Bennett told The Associated Press that such an effort may be
years away, ``but after watching some of the people in the stakes
for the presidency, I could do that well.''
   ``I won't mention anybody in particular,'' the outspoken
educator said, but he added that he was referring to both
Republican and Democratic hopefuls.
   Bennett, who announced last Monday he is quitting the Cabinet in
mid-September to write and lecture, brought up the White House
himself when asked in an interview if he aspired to run for the
Senate.
   Bennett said he has had overtures about possible Senate races
from his native state of New York, his adopted state of North
Carolina and from Maryland, where he now lives.
   But he said neither the Senate, nor the possibility of a college
presidency, holds any interest for him.
   ``Right now, if I were going to run for anything in the future,
I'd want to run for president,'' he volunteered.
   Asked about the vice presidency, Bennett said, ``I'm not sure
I'd make a very good No. 2 man. I like to run things.''
   Vice President George Bush, who has already locked up the GOP
nomination, says he wants to be ``the education president.'' His
campaign has kept its distance from the controversial Bennett, who
has warred with teacher unions and pilloried college presidents.
   Bennett did not mention Bush by name, but said, ``We'll probably
have a good Republican president in '88 who'll be there for a
couple of terms. If I do this, this could be way in the future.''
   A lifelong Democrat, Bennett switched to the GOP in May 1986, 15
months after President Reagan put him in the Cabinet. He has proven
a big draw at Republican functions across the country.
   Asked if he was now wedded to the GOP, the 44-year-old Bennett
replied, ``Probably.''
   Only probably?
   ``Well, sure. Look, I was a Democrat. I shifted to the
Republican Party because the Democrats left the ranch and deserted
their principles. I don't see that happening in the Republican
Party. But I put country above party, always have,'' he said.
   ``This will no doubt shock by sheer chutzpah some of my critics,
but we were not political. We were principled and a lot of our
principles ... went to the heart of what Ronald Reagan stands for
and what a lot of liberal Democrats stand against,'' he said.
   ``I know that I'm popular with audiences out there in the
country, and it doesn't seem to make much difference whether
they're Democrats or Republicans,'' he said.
   He said his relations with the education establishment may be at
their worst, but ``I would bet my relations with the American
people are at an all-time high.''
   Bennett expressed no regrets about his penchant for
controversies.
   He said he ``probably drove some people crazy'' by speaking out
at Cabinet meetings on issues other than education.
   He said he decided from the start that ``I may never have a job
like this again, so I'm going to do it all the way.''
   Sometimes, ``people rolled their eyes and said, `There he goes
again,''' he related. ``I talked about drugs a lot, use of the
military, and Justice Ginsburg, AIDS and Nicaragua, but I decided I
wasn't going to leave this job and say, `Darn it! I should have
said this! Boy if I had it to do all over again!'''
   Bennett took it upon himself to call Douglas Ginsburg last Nov.
6 to urge him to withdraw as a Supreme Court nominee after
Ginsburg's admission that he smoked marijuana while a Harvard law
professor. Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration the next
day.
   Bennett said he has not considered making such a call to his
mentor, Edwin Meese III, the embattled attorney general.
   ``No I have not. It's an entirely different situation. ... What
you have in the case of Ed (is) lots of allegations, no evidence,''
Bennett said.
   Asked if he were comfortable with an attorney general under
constant investigation, Bennett replied: ``It would be nicer, it
would be better if business were smoother. But no one feels more
uncomfortable than Ed about getting all this. But that's not a
situation I'm going to enter into.''
   Asked about the setbacks Reagan has suffered of late, Bennett
said there have been ``a lot of fly bites, people nipping at him.''
   But ``with time, the little things will slip away and the large
impact will be clear. ... '' he said. ``This is a very great man
and a good and important presidency.''

   Famed Kenyan flyer Beryl Markham possessed
the grace of the African animals she grew up with, and, her
admirers admit, at times was as cunning and ruthless.
   ``Beryl Markham: A Shadow on the Sun,'' CBS' four-hour
miniseries starring Stefanie Powers as the famed aviator and author
of ``West With the Night,'' a stirring account of life in colonial
Africa, airs Sunday and Tuesday.
   ``She was as much the Scarlett O'Hara of British East Africa as
she was a well-liked African Queen of the bushland,'' said Mary
Lovell, author of ``Straight On Till Morning,'' the 1987 biography
of Markham.
   Markham, tall, slender, self-possessed, fascinated people drawn
to her fearless, Garboesque nature throughout her life. Her solo
flight across the Atlantic in 1936 _ the first from east to west _
made her an international heroine.
   The miniseries, which is actually based on a Vanity Fair article
by James Fox, traces Markham's life from childhood in British East
Africa, where she hunted wild pig with Nandi tribesmen. She became
the continent's first female bush pilot and a renowned thoroughbred
horse trainer.
   According to her biographer, Markham angered and even frightened
people with an imperious and pedantic nature.
   ``People either utterly loved or loathed her,'' said Lovell, in
a recent interview from her home in England.
   As if to make that point, the movie details Markham's often
disastrous personal life, including three failed marriages and love
affairs with flyer Tom Campbell Black and Denys Finch-Hatton, the
English elephant hunter played by Robert Redford in ``Out of
Africa.''
   In her critically acclaimed memoirs, ``West With the Night,''
first published in 1942, Markham was praised as having a ``poet's
feeling for her land.'' But preoccupied with the advent of World
War II, the American public virtually ignored the book.
   Following its rediscovery by Marin County, Calif., restaurateur
George Gutekunst, the book was republished in 1983. By May 7 it had
sold 500,000 copies; it was listed on the New York Times
best-seller list for 79 weeks.
   In some areas, fascination with Markham approaches cult status,
according to Bernice Green, a New York publicist for CBS.
   ``I can't believe that this was a woman who did what she did
more than 50 years ago,'' said Green.
   Kenya in the 1920s and 1930s was a haven for titled Europeans,
and Markham lived among the upper class, which earned the nickname
``The Happy Valley Set'' in British newspapers because of their
relatively loose morals.
   Those who knew Markham described her as possessing an enchanting
beauty. Critic Judith Thurman writes that ``to the common
imagination she was a sort of Circe,'' referring to the Greek
mythological enchantress who turned men into beasts.
   Gutekunst said he was taken aback when he met Markham in Kenya
for the first time. Ever the flirt, she took to calling him
``Georgie-Porgie,'' borrowing from the nursery rhyme in which the
boy ``kissed the girls and made them cry.''
   ``I called her the Garbo of East Africa, not just because she
really was beautiful at her age, even when I first met her at 82,
but because of her carriage, her long swan-like neck, the mystery,
the confidence,'' said Gutekunst.
   Markham soared west across the Atlantic in 1936, becoming the
first person to fly solo from England to North America, where she
crash-landed in a bog in Nova Scotia. She then fell into obscurity.
   But not before tumultuous years in the United States, where she
worked as a consultant for Hollywood producers, married a heavy
drinker, published her biography and worked intermittently as a
short-story writer.
   Markham was born in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, in England,
and was brought to a farm in Kenya by her divorced father, retired
British Army Capt. Charles B. Clutterbuck.
   She had less than four years of formal education, but said her
father made her read widely. Later she was given a crash course in
literature and music by Finch-Hatton, the Oxford-educated
aristocrat and lover of Danish Baroness Karen Blixen, who wrote as
Isak Dinesen.
   By 1936, several planes had crossed the Atlantic westward from
Europe, but all had at least two people aboard. Markham, in a
single-engine Percival Gull monoplane, departed Britain's Abingdon
Royal Air Force aerodrome on Sept. 4.
   Despite crash-landing because of low fuel, she was given a
ticker-tape parade in New York, her original goal. Markham died in
Nairobi in 1986 at the age of 83.

<HEAD>Mysterious Coincidence Between Quakes and Air Pressure Pattern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abnormal atmospheric pressure patterns over
the Pacific Ocean and western United States during the summer and
fall may trigger earthquakes in California, including deadly jolts
in July 1986 and last October, a scientist says.
   ``I've found tantalizing but not completely conclusive evidence
of a relationship between sea-level pressure patterns and their
associated winds and moderate and larger earthquakes,'' said
meteorologist Jerome Namias.
   Namias spent 30 years as chief of the National Weather Service's
extended forecast division in Washington and is now affiliated with
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. His work in
long-range weather forecasting is widely respected.
   The statistical correlation between earthquakes and air pressure
is weak, difficult to explain in scientifically respectable terms
and ``definitely a far-out idea,'' said Namias in a recent
telephone interview.
   But he speculated that if atmospheric pressure patterns are
related to quakes, it may be because winds associated with the
patterns raise offshore sea levels slightly, putting more pressure
on the earth.
   ``We know so little about why earthquakes occur when they do
that we've got to keep an open mind, even on what seems like a
far-out kind of idea,'' said geologist Clarence Allen of the
California Institute of Technology.
   Allen said that while he guesses the correlation will turn out
to be coincidental, ``it's too early to rule out these kinds of
things. And Namias is certainly a very respected scientist.''
   Forces from unsual air pressure patterns and higher sea levels
are smaller than the moon's tidal influence on Earth and its
oceans, and seismologists still debate whether lunar gravity
triggers quakes, said Tom Heaton, scientist in charge of the U.S.
Geological Survey's Pasadena office.
   ``If we can't prove that tides do it, it seems a longshot that
(any pattern of) atmospheric pressure does it,'' Heaton said.
   Namias said he studied Caltech's list of California quakes
measuring 4.5 or more in the Richter scale since 1947.
   He found the quakes tended to occur more often a month to six
weeks after the onset of an abnormally strong gradient between very
high, sea-level atmospheric pressure over the eastern half of the
North Pacific and very low, surface-level pressure over the
interior portion of the western third of the nation.
   The unusual pattern existed prior to the 5.9-magnitude Whittier
Narrows quake and its aftershocks, which rocked Southern California
last October, killing eight people, injuring more than 200 and
causing $358 million in damage, Namias said.
   He said the same pattern preceded three hefty jolts in July
1986: the 5.9-magnitude July 8 Palm Springs quake, which caused
$5.3 million in damage; the 5.3-magnitude July 13 Oceanside quake,
which killed one person, injured 28 others and caused $720,000 in
damage, and the 6-magnitude July 21 Chalfant Valley quake near
Bishop, which caused $436,500 in damage.
   The abnormal pattern involved barometer readings of roughly 30.1
inches of mercury offshore and roughly 29.75 over the interior,
Namias said.
   Namias said the unusual large-scale pattern is unrelated to
local weather or to what some people contend is ``earthquake
weather,'' unseasonably hot, dry, windy conditions such as those
last October.
   Namias said he first noticed the quake-air pressure pattern
correlation years ago, but even after the 1986 quakes he decided
``I'd keep my mouth shut on the topic'' because he knew
seismologists would be dubious.
   He changed his mind after last October's shocks, writing a paper
published last month in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
   Namias said he noted the quake-air pressure correlation only
during summer and fall months, and that winter and spring
circulation patterns apparently discourage the phenomenon.
   In addition to speculating that winds related to the pressure
pattern might raise sea levels, Namias said large-scale winds might
affect the ground directly. He said Earth's rotation, and thus the
length of a day, changes slightly over decades because of wind drag
on Earth's surface.
   Other scientists have suggested a link between volcanic activity
in Indonesia and atmospheric pressure, wind and sea levels, Namias
said.

   Lt. Gov. Richard A. Licht, running for
the U.S. Senate seat held by John H. Chafee, said he will return a
$250 contribution from former anti-Vietnam war activist Tom Hayden
because of pressure from veterans.
   ``I've spoken with a number of friends of mine who are veterans.
They're very concerned about it. They're very supportive of me, and
they've asked me to return the money, and we will,'' Licht said
Friday during taping of WJAR-TV's ``10 News Conference,'' scheduled
to air Sunday.
   Licht, a Democrat, said he personally has no problem with
Hayden, a California state legislator, and agrees with Hayden on
many issues.
   ``I disagree with some of the things he did 20 years ago,''
Licht said. Licht said Hayden and his wife Jane Fonda have
``apologized for what they did 20 years ago,'' and ``their tactics
were wrong.''
   Licht said he wants to avoid giving Chafee an issue to exploit.
   Chafee spokesman Andy McLeod said the Republican had not made
the Hayden donation an issue, but added that Licht's move was an
admission of ``shame'' for accepting the donation to begin with.
   Bill Shultz, a Hayden spokesman, said he had no comment on the
dispute.

   A bolt of lightning hit a group of college
students having a beer party on the last day of class, leaving one
dead and 12 injured, authorities said.
   Cheltenham Township police said the students were leaving a
wooded hillside at Beaver College when the lightning hit Friday
night.
   The dead student was identified as Raymond McCollum, 22, of
Philadelphia.
   Eleven other students were treated and released at Abington
Memorial Hospital, authorities said. The other was in stable
condition today, according to nurse manager Debbie Ham.

<HEAD>Pentagon View: Drug War and Real War Not The Same</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The decision by Congress to order the military
into the war on drugs came despite warnings from Pentagon leaders
that soldiers aren't trained for civilian law enforcement and fears
it may blur the line between military and civilian authority.
   ``Our people are not trained to read Miranda rights. They are
trained to shoot to kill,'' Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci told
Congress last week.
   Sen. Ted Steven, R-Alaska, said, ``The military is uncomfortable
with this, that's true, and I think there are very tricky questions
here, but they have to realize that the American public wants them
to help.''
   ``There's a war going on against our people, a war of drugs, and
we need the military's help in fighting that war,'' said Stevens.
   Two weeks ago, the House voted 385-23 to order President Reagan
to have the military seal off U.S. borders against drug trafficking.
   Last Friday, the Senate voted 83-6 to order an expanded military
role, including arrest powers for Navy officers aboard warships
that stop drug boats in international waters.
   Both votes approved amendments to the separate Pentagon budget
bills passed by each chamber. The bills now go to a House-Senate
conference to reconcile differences, including the military-drug
provisions.
   Carlucci and other Pentagon officials have outlined two major
fears about expanding the military's role in the drug fight. One is
practical and the other legal.
   The practical objection is that having the military fight drugs
takes away from the Pentagon's main task of defending the United
States against military threats.
   The legal objection arises from the nation's traditional
separation between military and civilian authority. That separation
is most clearly spelled out by the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law
which bans the military from enforcing civilian laws.
   ``The military are not trained for the law enforcement
mission,'' Carlucci said last week. ``To suddenly tell them you're
in law enforcement, you have to shift the entire focus, the
training... There's a major difference between military and police
work.''
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard noted that devoting military
resources to drug enforcement means those resources will have to be
taken from somewhere else and ``that can affect the readiness of
this country to defend itself.''
   The two fears are legitimate, noted Stevens and other supporters
of an expanded military role.
   ``I don't think we're really blurring the line too much,'' he
said. ``Any arrests the military would make would be on the high
seas, in international waters, where a member of the military has
the same arrest power that any citizen does.''
   As for the effect on the military's readiness to fight, Stevens
noted, ``I believe that's something that we're going to have to
closely watch, and if there is an effect on readiness, then we'll
have to deal with that. But they have to be ready to help this
country fight a war that's already going on, a war against drugs.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said, ``I think it's very troubling to be using the
military this way, and one must be very careful because you run
into all sorts of potential legal problems about the separation of
the civilian and the military.''
   ``There are also potential problems with readiness,'' said
Aspin. ``The military is trained for specific roles and missions
and to the extent you take them from those missions, you detract
from readiness.''
   But ``there is tremendous pressure to act,'' Aspin noted.
``People want something done and the pressure is growing.''
   Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said they
understood the military's objections, particularly on legal issues.
But both are from states with long international borders and severe
trafficking problems, and they said those facts override the fears.
   ``We have to stop the drugs before they get into the country,''
said Wilson. ``We need to stop them on the seas or in the air.
Local law enforcement is being overwhelmed by a flood of drugs.
Once it gets into the United States, it is immeasurably more
difficult to control.''
   Graham said, ``this nation faces a terribly, terribly serious
drug problem. I think that there is a narrow, specific role for
arrests by the military in international waters. They have the
resources to do this.''
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said, ``We spend hundreds of
billions of dollars a year on the military so we can be safe. But
this nation is already at war, a war we're losing. And we need our
best troops in that war.''
   D'Amato, speaking of Pentagon complaints that drug fighting will
hurt military readiness, said, ``This is a national security issue.
Our military is supposed to help protect our national security.
Drugs as bad an enemy as any other enemy we would face.''
   The loudest critic was Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a retired Marine
pilot, who chastised his colleagues Friday for speaking ``rhetoric
for press release purposes.''
   ``We all get up, posture, make our little statements, and it
isn't going to make any difference'' said Glenn. He said the nation
lacks an effective, coordinated anti-drug plan.
   ``This is not the mission for the military,'' Glenn said.

<HEAD>Week Promising Roses for Republican Candidate Bush Turns Thorny</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a week that should have come up all
roses for George Bush, with endorsements arriving from both the
president and his only remaining Republican rival. But instead,
thorns littered the way.
   In recent days, Bush and his lieutenants have been forced to
take the defensive on a host of issues, ranging from alleged drug
trafficking by Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega to a
lackluster endorsement from President Reagan.
   Some of the troubles were minor irritants; others loomed as
potential major problems as the vice president sought to translate
his lock on the Republican presidential nomination into a fall
general election strategy.
   Some of the recent problems besetting the Bush campaign:
   _He unintentionally handed Jesse Jackson a new issue with his
characterization of the Democrat as ``the hustler from Chicago'' in
a speech to a GOP audience in Nebraska. Jackson seized upon the
remark, saying it was offensive and showed Bush had ``started to
panic.''
   _Despite enjoying a mathematical lock on the GOP nomination
since the April 26 Pennsylvania primary, Bush won only 71 percent
of the vote in last Tuesday's Nebraska primary.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., who had withdrawn from the race but whose
name appeared on the ballot, captured 24 percent while Pat
Robertson _ who endorsed Bush the following day to effectively end
his own candidacy _ polled 5 percent.
   _Questions intensified about Bush's prior knowledge of alleged
drug trafficking by Noriega, fueled by news accounts suggesting
that Bush might have known more about the situation than he has
professed.
   The political problems for Bush grew even larger with mid-week
reports suggesting the Reagan administration was considering
dropping U.S. drug charges against the Panamanian general in
exchange for his leaving power.
   Bush, who stresses a resume laden with foreign policy experience
and vows a strong anti-drug effort, again found himself in the
position of having to plead ignorance on Noriega.
   _Fallout from the legal difficulties surrounding Attorney
General Edwin Meese III continued to swirl about the Bush campaign,
heightened by on-the-record assertions by two top Bush advisers
that Meese had become a campaign liability. Bush called the
statements unauthorized. Analysts said the Meese affair could hurt
Bush with voters.
   _And finally, after weeks of jockeying between Bush aides and
the White House over the timing of President Reagan's formal
endorsment of his vice president, Reagan finally delivered _ but
with a terse statement that neither praised Bush nor touched on why
Americans should vote for him.
   Furthermore, Reagan mispronounced Bush's name at one point,
calling him, ``George Bosh.''
   By week's end, the president's mystifyingly brief endorsement
appeared to be the least of the Bush campaign's worries. Bush
declared he ``couldn't be more pleased'' with the chief executive's
manner of support and presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Reagan was ``mortified'' to think that his words had been received
as anything less than enthusiastic.
   The campaign showed greater concern over the results of the
Nebraska primary, which showed that Bush could not win solid GOP
support in the state even while running virtually unopposed.
   Political analysts suggested the weak showing underscores a
problem Bush is likely to have in November throughout the Midwest,
where the farm economy, despite some recent signs of improvement,
is still troubled.
   Bush's track record in the region has not been good. Although he
later went on to win commanding victories in other states, he came
in a disappointing third in the Iowa caucuses last February.
   He also lost to Dole in South Dakota's primary, garnering only
19 percent to Dole's 55 percent. And, in Minnesota, Bush didn't
even bother to mount a major effort. A straw poll there in February
showed only 11 percent for Bush, compared to 43 percent for Dole
and 28 percent for Robertson.
   Bush campaign strategists argued that the vice president's poor
showings in the Midwest reflect Kansan Dole's popularity more than
their candidate's vulnerability.
   ``Dole is still very popular (in Nebraska), and there was a very
low turnout,'' said Bush deputy campaign manager Ed Rogers. ``And
we'll take 71 percent of the vote any day of the week.''
   Equally troubling to Bush's general-election prospects,
according to analysts, was new survey evidence suggesting that
Reagan's popularity across party lines was unlikley to be
transferred to his vice president.
   ``No president's popularity is,'' Rogers said. ``What's
important is we're going to have the president as a great resource.
The president packs a lot of wallop out on the stump and everybody
knows it.''
   But David Carmen, a former consultant to New York Rep. Jack
Kemp's presidential campaign, said ``there are problems for Bush
that he's going to have to deal with'' and a lack of ready-made
support among blue-collar Democrats is one of them.
   ``It's a problem he's going to to have to address through
scheduling, speeches and through issues,'' Carmen said.
   To date, said the consultant, ``Bush has had a problem in
articulating a message. He's been slow to do it. But people want a
horse race and there are more Democrats than Republicans in the
country. So it is nautral that the race is going to start out at
least close, or maybe with (Democrat Michael) Dukakis ahead.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Curtails Electromagnetic Pulse Research</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department, in a surprise move,
has settled a lawsuit brought by two environmental groups by
agreeing to sharply curtail research into a high-power electrical
phenomenon known as electromagnetic pulse.
   The settlement, approved by U.S. District Judge John Garrett
Penn late Friday, derails at least temporarily a program the
Pentagon had previously described as crucial to national security.
Among other purposes, the research involved ways to ``harden''
crucial commnications and weapons guidance equipment against
electrical surges triggered by nuclear explosions.
   The Defense Department must now determine whether its
experiments, involving simulations powered by non-nuclear means,
pose a danger to humans or wildlife.
   Jeremy Rifkin, the president of the Foundation on Economic
Trends, one of the environmental groups which filed the lawsuit,
hailed the agreement as ``the first court victory of this magnitude
recognizing the threat posed by electronic or electrical
pollution.''
   ``We're extremely pleased,'' Rifkin added. ``This is the first
recognition by the Defense Department, and really the first on a
national level at all, of a whole new environmental hazard facing
all of us.''
   The Pentagon declined to discuss the matter or its reasons for
settling the case.
   The suit, filed in March 1987 by the Washington-based foundation
and the Potomac River Association Inc., ``sought essentially
exactly what we got _ an end to high-power testing until an
assessment is performed of the threat to the environment and human
and animal health,'' Rifkin said.
   The settlement will shut down or sharply curtail the operations
of a handful of Army and Navy generators and, potentially, one Air
Force facility.
   Electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, is a powerful wave, or surge, of
electrical energy that is released by a nuclear explosion and which
can travel long distances through the atmosphere or water.
   EMP became a matter of concern to the military in the early
1960s when the Pentagon discovered a nuclear bomb detonated at high
altitudes could generate a pulse so strong it could disable the
electronic components used in computers, communications and
guidance equipment.
   As a result of that discovery, military laboratories have
studied the phenomenon for 25 years in the course of developing
methods for enabling electronic weapons components to withstand EMP.
   In recent years, EMP work also has been performed with an eye
toward harnessing the energy pulses for offensive weapons, or ``zap
guns.''
   Under the terms of the settlement, the Army must now shut down
EMP generators located at Woodbridge, Va.; Redstone Arsenal, Ala.,
and White Sands Missile Range, N.M.
   The Navy will be required to shut down its so-called Empress 1
generator at the Patuxent Naval Air Station, Md.; to refrain from
starting construction of an Empress 2 system, and to significantly
reduce the operating power of two other Patuxent generators.
   The Air Force, meantime, will be allowed to continue operating
EMP simulators at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., but only if it can
provide documentation within 14 days demonstrating there is no
discernible environmental risk from that operation.
   Rick Garcia, public affairs director for the Air Force Weapons
Laboratory at Kirtland, said ``We would be prepared'' to furnish
the documentation. One of the five EMP simulators at Kirtland is
one dubbed Trestle, a $58 million structure which enables
scientists to imitate EMP effects upon aircraft electrical
equipment.
   The other EMP facilities, which are located in closer proximity
to populated areas, must remain shut down or operating only at low
power levels until an environmental assessment of their operation
is conducted, Rifkin said.
   The assessment probably will take five to six months, at which
point all the generators may be returned to service but only at
reduced power levels that ensure no electrical surge moves beyond
the boundaries of the bases.
   The Pentagon must then satisfactorily complete a full-fledged
environmental impact study _ a process that could take two years _
before the EMP generators can be used at their current power
levels, Rifkin said.
   While the Pentagon declined comment, Rifkin said he thought the
government agreed to settle the case because the foundation's
attorneys learned that two Army employees had warned the service
against conducting EMP experiments at Woodbridge until an
environmental assessment was completed.
   When the foundation filed a motion to question the two workers,
Pentagon and Justice Department lawyers suddenly indicated a
willingness to negotiate, Rifkin continued.
   ``They didn't want these guys to talk about the hazards,'' he
said. ``We had them over a barrel.''
   The foundation's lawsuit asserted that EMP experiments ``can
affect human health directly, and through the disruption of
electronic circuits in nuclear power plants, automobiles,
computers, airplanes, phone lines and navigational systems, can
cause potential catastrophies under many possible circumstances.''

<TEXT>
   The National Gallery of Art is mounting the
first big show in 20 years of works by Fitz Hugh Lane, known for
his paintings of the first winner of the America's cup and of the
first Cunard Line ship to cross the Atlantic.
   ``No other painter of the 19th century matched him in capturing
the character of maritime New England, in portraying the reflective
sheen of calm water or the agitated surface of windblown waves, the
clarity of light-filled still air or the moist atmosphere of cloudy
humid days,'' gallery director J. Carter Brown says in a tribute
appearing in the catalogue of the exhibit.
   John Wilmerding, the museum's deputy director and a specialist
on Lane, classes him just below the painter Winslow Homer.
   Lane painted the America's cup race at least twice _ once in an
unusual work that contains three views of the same yacht. That one
is in the Peabody Museum on Salem, Mass.
   The other painting, lent to this show, shows the finale of the
first race in 1851, with Britons waving their hats from a smaller
boat while the Americans look the other way. A British side-wheeler
packed with spectators is nearby.
   Lane painted the Britannia, the first Cunard Line ship, entering
Boston harbor in 1848, eight years after its first transatlantic
voyage.
   Nearly all the 61 paintings in the show are of New England
scenes. All are related to ships and the sea. There is a kind of
glowing silence about them that critics say typifies the American
movement now called ``luminism.''
   Lane died in 1865, long before the term was invented.
   The exhibit opens Sunday in the gallery's West Building and will
be there until Sept. 5. It then will move to the Museum of Fine
Arts in Boston from Oct. 5 to Dec. 31.
   The exhibit has been financed by a grant from the GTE
Corporation.

<DATELINE>CAMP DAVID, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's
weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday from his official
retreat at Camp David:
   Yesterday, Congress decided to send me a trade bill that
threatens to destroy jobs and would begin to reverse the policies
of the last seven years. After three years of hard work by the
Congress and the executive, it is unfortunate that I have no choice
but to send this back to Congress.
   While there are many positive aspects of this legislation, some
of its provisions would move us a step further toward
protectionism. Others would create new bureaucracies. But my main
objection to the trade bill involves the mandatory requirements it
sets down for business to give advance notice of lay-offs or plant
closings.
   Now let me state very clearly that I believe businesses should
give workers and communities just as much warning as they can when
it looks as though lay-offs or plant closings are going to become
unavoidable. Advance notice gives the community and the workers
themselves some time to begin adjusting. It's the humane thing to
do.
   But when big government gets in the middle of something like
this, dictating all its rules and regulations, well, the humane way
has a way of becoming inhumane, and what's intended to help
everyday working men and women can actually end up hurting them.
When you study the plant-closing provisions of the trade bill, you
see that there are circumstances in which they would actually force
a business to shut down.
   Once a struggling business issued a notice that it is likely to
close or substantially reduce its workforce, then creditors,
suppliers and customers would disappear, eliminating any chance of
survival the business might have had. Under these conditions,
temporary lay-offs are sometimes necessary to manage costs and
production. And while the bill does contain a so-called
``struggling company exemption,'' this exemption is too vague and
unclear to be workable.
   Then too, businesses will be very reluctant to add workers when
it would put them over the arbitrary thresholds in this bill and
subject them to yet another regime of federal regulation. Make no
mistake, these concerns are very real. One independent study showed
that if these provisions had been in effect between 1982 and 1986,
America today would have almost half a million fewer jobs.
   Yes, as I've said, our country should support advance
notification of lay-offs and plant closings, but this should be
decided by bargaining between labor and management _ not by some
arbitrary rules laid down by politicians and enforced by Washington
bureaucrats.
   And if I feel especially strong about this, I guess it's because
I was a union president for years myself. There were times when the
union, The Screen Actors Guild, took a hard line in negotiating
with management. But yes, there were also times when the motion
picture industry was having its ups and downs, times when the union
decided not to press quite so hard because we wanted to make sure
the whole industry remained healthy and profitable.
   The point is, it was up to us, the unions and management, to run
the motion picture industry together. We didn't need Washington in
on this act. I guess what it all really comes down to is this: just
what kind of a government do we want? For these past seven years
the administration has limited government, cutting taxes and
regulations alike. The result, the longest peacetime expansion in
America history; unemployment at the lowest level in almost 14
years; the creation of 16 million new jobs and, I might add, in the
last three years, four times as many businesses have opened as have
closed.
   We could go back to big government and indeed many of those in
favor of these plant-closing provisions argue that they're already
in effect in many European countries. Well to tell you the truth,
I'm sort of proud of being an American, proud that since 1983 the
United States has created six times as many jobs as has Western
Europe.
   I don't want to leave the impression that the trade bill is
completely bad. On the contrary, it contains a number of good and
important measures including new authority for American negotiators
seeking to open markets abroad. It also included my proposal for
helping workers affected by business failings by providing them
with training, education and job placement services, the truly
humane approach.
   That's why I want a trade bill and why I so regret the addition
of counterproductive measures that outweigh the positive features
of this legislation. So I urge Congress to schedule prompt action
on a second trade bill immediately after it sustains my veto on
this one.
   And now, one final message. At noon tomorrow in Washington
hundreds will gather to pay tribute to police officers and other
law enforcement officials who've died in the line of duty. So
wherever you are at noon, I hope you'll join me in bowing your head
and in resolving to let our law enforcement officials know that we
understand what our mothers and fathers taught us _ the policeman
is our friend.

   The ships and crewmen attacked by Iraq
Saturday were ineligible for U.S. distress assistance under the
Reagan administration's rules of engagement in the Persian Gulf, a
State Department spokeswoman said.
   ``The supertankers were inside one of the exclusion zones, which
both belligerents have declared and they were servicing the port of
a belligerent,'' spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said. ``Each of these
factors disqualifies shipping from U.S. distress assistance.''
   U.S. warships are now permitted to intervene on request in
attacks on neutral shipping as well as to provide ``humanitarian
aid'' to non-U.S. flagged vessels, but only in international waters.
   Today's attack occurred in Iranian waters, at the Larak oil
depot, the latest target in Iraq's intensified attempt to strangle
petroleum exports that help Tehran finance the war.
   McCarty repeated U.S. assertions that ``there can be no military
solution the war,'' and that any fighting that prolongs the
conflict is regrettable.
   She pleaded anew for U.N. Security Council action to implement a
10-month old resolution calling for a truce in the conflict and an
arms embargo against belligerents who fail to heed the cease-fire
call.
   The Soviet Union and China have declined to endorse the
resolution, asserting that diplomatic efforts toward a truce have
not been exhausted.

   Ailing funny lady Lucille Ball is feeling
better, but will have to stay in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at
least until Monday, a hospital spokeswoman said Saturday.
   Spokeswoman Paula Correia said doctors decided late Friday they
wanted the comedian to stay for tests and observation.
   ``Everything seems to be OK, but they just want to be sure,''
Ms. Correia said.
   Miss Ball, 76, the zany redhead of television's ``I Love Lucy,''
became ill at home Wednesday and checked herself in.
   Hospital spokesman Ron Wise said Friday that although doctors
were still unable to diagnose the cause of Miss Ball's illness, she
apparently does not have cardiac trouble, as originally feared.

   A $1.3 million-suit by two teen-agers who
claim they were hurt by flying dry ice during a concert by the
heavy metal rock band Motley Crue is expected to go to a jury
Monday.
   Special effects expert Dave Pier testified Friday that there was
no explosion at the 1985 concert that could have blasted dry ice
into the audience.
   Defendants in the civil suit include Motley Crue, concert
promoter Sound Seventy Productions Inc. of Nashville, Tenn., and
the city of Huntsville.
   David Wright, now 19, claims he suffered a facial cut at the
1985 concert in Huntsville from a piece of dry ice hurled into the
audience during a pyrotechnic display.
   Robbie Miller, now 17, says he was permanently blinded in one
eye during the display.
   The trial was recessed for the weekend and jury deliberations
are expected to begin after rebuttal testimony and closing
arguments.
   Pier demonstrated the band's pyrotechnics Friday by heating a
large hunk of dry ice with a torch. There was a whining noise but
no explosion.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu, seeking scholarships for
students from his troubled South Africa, said he will return any
honorary degrees from U.S. schools that fail to divest their South
African holdings within a year.
   ``I want to give notice here,'' Tutu said Friday during a speech
at Northeastern University, where he was given an honorary
doctorate of divinity.
   The Anglican prelate, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for
his non-violent opposition to apartheid, said his gesture may be
small, but is necessary to preserve his integrity.
   Tutu, who received an honorary degree from Harvard University in
1979, did not mention Harvard in his speech. However, he told a
group of reporters and editors of The Boston Globe on Thursday that
his reaction to Harvard's continuing refusal to divest would be:
``Sorry. Have back your degree for the sake of our people.''
   At a reception prior to a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner
Friday night, Tutu urged people to donate to his scholarship fund
as a means of striking a blow against apartheid.

   Dr. John Cannell, who uncovered the
so-called ``Lake Wobegon'' effect on standarized tests that falsely
reassures educators their students are ``above average,'' says he's
leaving West Virginia.
   Cannell on Friday said he has sold his share in a medical clinic
and is moving in June to study psychiatry at the University of New
Mexico.
   Cannell said his involvement in education helped lead to his
decision to switch from general medicine to adolescent psychiatry.
   ``I've become convinced that many of the problems of adolescents
can be blamed on the school system,'' Cannell said. ``Not all of
them, but a good part, go back to the message of failure that the
school systems give.''
   For years, Cannell claimed that West Virginia's Education
Department exaggerated its accomplishments by trumpeting results of
the McGraw-Hill Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills. Every school
district that used the tests claimed results above the national
average.
   Cannell maintains that publishers of such tests deliberately
market them to make school districts look good. McGraw-Hill and
others have denied the allegation.
   In February, after meeting with Cannell and studying his
research, Assistant Education Secretary Chester Finn Jr. said some
so-called achievement tests give ``a falsely optimistic'' picture
of school district performances.
   Finn likened the test results to humorist Garrison Keillor's
mythical town of Lake Wobegon, where ``all the women are strong,
all the men are good-looking and all the children are above
average.''

   Iraqi warplanes bombarded an offshore
terminal in the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday and set fire to five
tankers, including two of the world's largest, in a stepped-up
drive to destroy Iran's oil lifeline.
   Up to 54 crewmen were reported missing.
   One of the ships, the 235,000-ton Spanish tanker Barcelona, was
said to be sinking. Two others, including the Seawise Giant, at
564,739 tons the largest vessel afloat, were blazing out of control
hours after the mid-afternoon raid on Larak island, according to
shipping sources.
   Gulf-based sources said Iranian salvage tugs were battling
flames aboard the ships, some of which were moored together to
transfer cargo.
   Iraq announced the raid five hours later, the 10th attack it has
claimed against Iranian oil targets since April 29.
   Reports of casualties varied widely.
   Gulf-based shipping executives said at least 16 crew members
were missing, 14 from the Seawise Giant and two from the
457,841-ton British-flag Burmah Endeavour.
   In London, Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said that all of
the approximately 50 people aboard the Seawise Giant and four from
the Barcelona were unaccounted for.
   There were no reports regarding crews of the other two tankers,
the 152,004-ton Cypriot-flag Argosy and the 231,712-ton Iranian
tanker Khark. The Argosy is under Iranian charter and the Khark is
government owned.
   The attacks were part of an intensified effort by Baghdad to cut
off the export revenues that Tehran uses to finance the war with
Iraq, now in its eighth year.
   ``Penetrating Iranian enemy defenses, Iraqi pilots struck at
berthing supertankers off the island, setting them ablaze and
gutted in fire. Columns of smoke were seen billowing from the hit
targets,'' said the official Iraqi News Agency, quoting a military
communique.
   The raid was the third in the past seven months against Larak,
where international tankers pick up oil cargoes brought from Kharg
Island by Iranian ships.
   To reach the Hormuz strait, the Iraqi jets must fly more than
750 miles each way, requiring mid-air refueling en route to or from
the target.
   Five tankers also were hit in the last Larak raid, on Dec. 22,
among them the Seawise Giant, which was damaged in the first raid
last October.
   Both Seawise Giant and Burmah Endeavour, also one of the world's
five largest vessels, are under charter to Iran as ``mother
ships,'' or offshore storage tankers, at Larak.
   More than 500 ships have been damaged in the war, most of them
since it spilled into the gulf in 1984. Since the start of 1986,
about 300 commercial ships have been hit by one side or the other.
   Estimates by maritime agencies and other sources indicate that
more than 300 seamen have been killed and many injured.
   The Larak raid came hours after a U.S. Navy-escorted convoy of
three Kuwaiti tankers sailed through the Hormuz into the Gulf of
Oman without incident. It was the 31st convoy of the year.
   One of the escorting warships, the destroyer Stump, later
returned to the gulf, passing through the strait where the smoke of
Larak's fires were still visible.
   Earlier in the day, gulf-based sources quoted radio monitors as
saying an Iranian fighter plane had warned a U.S. warship to leave
an area in the southern gulf, but there was no reply.
   An American source said the Navy had overheard an Iranian F-4
fighter-bomber ``requesting permission to attack a ship.''
   The source, speaking on condition he not be named, said there
were no U.S. ships in that immediate vicinity at the time.
   Meanwhile, Iran reported that it would soon begin 10 days of
maneuvers in the southern gulf and the Gulf of Oman. No specific
date was given for the exercises, the first since the Iranians lost
six naval craft in clashes with U.S. forces on April 18.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the commander of Iran's
navy, Rear Adm. Mohammad-Hussein Malekzadegan, as saying Iran's
naval forces had ``increased several times'' since the battle.
   The April 18 fighting, which began with U.S. reprisal attacks on
three Iranian oil platforms, cost Iran two of its best frigates and
a fast patrol boat.
   Iran claimed 44 of its men were killed. A U.S. helicopter
gunship and its two-man crew were lost.
   Iran customarily retaliates for Iraq's raids by attacking
commercial ships in the gulf on a one-for-one basis. It has carried
out only one attack since the April 18 clashes, and none since the
recent wave of Iraqi raids began.

<HEAD>Reagan Poised to Veto Trade Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Saturday that while
workers should get as much warning as possible before they're fired
or laid off, he cannot sign a trade bill requiring such
notification because it ``threatens to destroy jobs.''
   ``It is unfortunate, but I have no choice but to send this back
to Congress,'' Reagan said of the 1,000-page trade measure. White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the veto would occur in the
coming week.
   In his weekly radio address, delivered from Camp David, Md.,
Reagan zeroed in on the battle over the plant-closing section of
the bill, which is expected to become a campaign issue in the fall
elections.
   While the administration supports much of the bill, it faults
the requirement that companies notify workers at least 60 days in
advance of layoffs or a plant shutdown.
   The issue should be decided between labor and management, not
government, Reagan argued.
   ``Let me state very clearly, I believe businesses should give
workers and communities just as much warning as they can when it
looks as though layoffs or plant closings are going to become
unavoidable,'' Reagan said. ``It's the humane thing to do.''
   ``But when big government gets in the middle of something like
this, dictating all its rules and regulations, the humane way has a
way of becoming inhumane,'' Reagan said.
   The president contended that the requirement would force
struggling businesses to shut down at crucial times, and that
management needs the flexibility of using temporary layoffs to get
a business back on its feet. It would also keep companies from
adding workers if it would subject them to the bill's requirements,
the president said.
   Although there are exceptions in the bill for companies that
find themselves in serious financial trouble, but Reagan derided
them as ``too vague and unclear to be workable.''
   Reagan argued that ``one independent study'' showed that if the
plant-closing provision had been in effect from 1982 to 1986,
``America would have almost half a million fewer jobs.'' He did not
cite the source of the study.
   In the Democratic response, House Speaker Jim Wright said the
nation needs the bill to combat the worst trade deficit in history
_ $171 billion. ``It weakens our country, depresses wages, reduces
our standard of living,'' Wright argued.
   He took issue with Reagan's threat to veto the bill over the
plant closing provision.
   ``This bill simply ... asks the nation's biggest employers to
give American workers at least 60 days' notice before they close
another plant. That's not too much to ask. Not sufficient cause,
Mr. President, to abandon the work of three years and scrap this
vitally needed legislation,'' Wright said.
   The House speaker contended that ``86 percent of the American
people support this plant closing provision.''
   ``Top management knows in advance when its service is no longer
required and builds golden parachutes worth millions of dollars for
its comfort. Can't we give the workers of America at least 60 days
to get their lives in order, to get new training, to cushion the
blow?'' Wright asked.
   Democrats sent the bill to the White House last week with a
parade of razzle-dazzle events and photo sessions, and have
threatened to hit Republicans in the fall with the issue if Reagan
vetoes the measure.
   The bill would overhaul the system for imposing import curbs to
retaliate against international trade violations and aid American
industries threatened by increased foreign competition.
   While it cleared the House by a 312-107 margin _ more than the
two-thirds needed to override a presidential veto _ it was approved
in the Senate by 63-36, three votes shy of the margin sufficient to
override.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address. It was delivered Saturday
by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   Good afternoon. This is Jim Wright. Let's talk a little bit
together about the most important thing to come out of Congress
this year.
   The new trade bill we sent to the president this week can be a
big victory for America. It can help us get back on track to being
No. 1 in the world.
   Last year, our country suffered the worst trade deficit in our
history _ $171 billion. We paid that much more for foreign goods
than we sold in American-made products. And that can be devastating.
   It weakens our country, depresses wages, reduces our standard of
living. In all, the trade deficit cost the average American family
about $3,000 last year.
   Because of this, we're no longer No. 1 in per capita gross
national product. Last year we fell to No. 3.
   Because of these trade deficits, our country, which was the No.
1 creditor nation in the world just five years ago, is the world's
largest debtor nation today. And foreign ownership of American
banks, American farms and real estate, and America's marketable
securities increases by about 25 percent each year.
   America can do better than that. We must do better than that.
The new trade bill will put us on an upward path. Its contents are
summed up in three important words _ rules, tools and schools.
   New rules to make a level playing field, to give American
products a chance on foreign markets. We ask other countries to
treat our goods just as we treat their goods on our markets _ no
better, no worse.
   New tools to strengthen our industrial base, to modernize our
plants, to improve our American productivity.
   Better schools to prepare America's children for increasing
world competition and to hone and sharpen the skills of America's
work force.
   America needs this bill. And so we plead with President Reagan:
Please sign the trade bill. Give America a chance to excel on world
markets again. Let ``Made in the USA'' become a badge of quality
and value throughout the world.
   President Reagan has threatened to veto this bill simply because
it asks the nation's biggest employers to give American workers at
least 60 days' notice before they close another plant. That's not
too much to ask. Not sufficient cause, Mr. President, to abandon
the work of three years and scrap this vitally needed legislation.
   Eighty-six percent of the American people support this plant
closing provision, this notification to workers. They say it's only
fair.
   Top management knows in advance when its service is no longer
required and builds golden parachutes worth millions of dollars for
its comfort. Can't we give the workers of America at least 60 days
to get their lives in order, to get new training, to cushion the
blow?
   In the name of the 2 million American workers who lost their
jobs last year because of plant shutdowns and layoffs _ many of
those plants going overseas, two-thirds of them given no notice at
all _ Mr. President, we ask you to sign this bill and let it become
law.
   In the name of Patsy Edwards and 117 employees who lost their
jobs in Tampa (Fla.) with only one day notice, please sign the
trade bill.
   In the name of Hank Schrenko and 160 iron workers at a plant in
Syracuse (N.Y.) which closed with only 15 minutes' notice, please
sign this bill, Mr. President.
   In the name of Wally Barrett and 397 workers who lost their jobs
at a plant in Eau Claire, Wis., please sign the bill.
   In the name of these and others in America's work force, good
Americans who want to help us revive this country, we call on you,
Mr. President, to consider the equities and let this vital American
initiative begin.

the plane banked as if to return to the airport, but fell and hit a

   He said the plane plowed into the ground between two small
apartment buildings, but did not catch fire.
   Gilbert said power lines were downed and aviation fuel was
leaking.
   State police sent units to the scene to assist Middlesboro
police.
   A tornado roared through the same community Monday night,
leaving one dead and 15 injured.

   Anti-communist insurgents Saturday
offered limited amnesty to Afghan government soldiers as Soviet
troops prepared for the start of their withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   Gulbadin Hekmatyar, chairman of the seven-party Afghan guerrilla
alliance, said Afghan security forces who voluntarily surrender
within four weeks after Soviet troops have left their districts
would not be tried for war crimes.
   ``Once captured ... they will face Islamic courts,'' Hekmatyar
said at a news conference at the alliance's Peshawar headquarters.
   He did not say what punishments they would face if convicted.
   The insurgents have vowed to continue and intensify their fight
until the last of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops leave
Afghanistan and the Marxist government in Kabul falls.
   Hekmatyar said the rebels had postponed a swap of one Soviet
prisoner for 25 captured guerrillas. He said his group will keep
Soviet prisoners until it establishes an Islamic government in
Afghanistan.
   He did not divulge how many Soviet or Afghan army troops were
being held.
   The leader of the extremist Hezb-E-Islami Party said his party
will hold onto Soviet prisoners and try to exchange them for
Afghanistan President Najib and other high-ranking members of the
ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   He said the guerrillas want to put Najib and his associates on
trial for war crimes.
   Western observers disagree on how long Najib can stay in power
once his 100,000-strong security force is left to face the
guerrillas alone.
   The rebels claim to have overrun 50 posts and garrisons, mostly
in eastern Afghanistan, in the last month as Red Army troops have
headed toward Kabul in preparation for their withdrawal, which
begins Sunday.
   ``May 15 means the defeat of Soviet forces militarily in
Afghanistan and the start of the puppet regime's collapse,'' said
Hekmatyar. ``The Russian withdrawal is the first phase of our
victory.''
   ``May 15 also proves that in wars, modern weapons and number of
troops do not matter,'' he said, adding, ``no power, however
arrogant, is able to crush a nation committed to its faith.''
   Hekmatyar said the guerrillas would be willing to talk to United
Nations advisers, who will oversee the nine-month Soviet troop
withdrawal.
   The 50-man force, headed by Gen. Rauli Helminen of Finland, is
composed of military personnel mainly from European countries and
Canada.
   The U.N. Good Offices Mission for Afghanistan and Pakistan said
that starting Sunday the group will inspect Soviet, Afghan and
guerrilla military bases in Afghanistan and refugee camps in
Pakistan.
   The guerrilla alliance, composed of four Moslem extremist groups
and three moderate traditionalist parties, has begun forming its
own alternative government.
   Hekmatyar said the new Islamic-style government will establish
itself inside Afghanistan in the near future. He has given no date.
   Najib's party seized power in a bloody 1978 coup. Soviet troops
intervened in December 1979, replacing one pro-Moscow government
with another.

   An elderly man has been charged with killing a
fellow nursing home resident by striking him with a cane during an
argument over an ashtray, police said.
   Adolph Rentell, 86, was arrested and charged with criminal
homicide Friday at St. Francis Hospital, where he has been a
patient for a week.
   He was arraigned in the hospital but will remain hospitalized
indefinitely for psychiatric evaluation, according to city homicide
detectives.
   Rentell is charged in the death of Jack Vassanelli, 87.
Vassanelli died last Sunday, two days after he was attacked in a
hallway of Negley House, a nursing home.
   An autopsy showed Vassanelli died of meningitis, a complication
from infection and broken facial bones caused by blows to his face.
   The attack came after Vassanelli, who was in a wheelchair, asked
Rentell to stop spitting into an ashtray Vassanelli was using,
police said.
   Despite Rentell's age and questions about his mental state,
police say he was charged because they believe he was aware of his
actions at the time of the attack.

   Bloodied but unbroken, the Soviet Army begins
pulling out of Afghanistan on Sunday amid threats of guerrilla
harassment and grave doubts about the future of the Marxist
government it leaves behind.
   On the eve of the withdrawal, the Soviet commander in
Afghanistan denied his men had been defeated in the brutal war that
has claimed an estimated 10,000 Soviet lives.
   But politically, the fruits of the 8{-year Soviet armed
intervention seem meager. Militarily, the Soviet presence has
proved far from decisive.
   On Saturday, in the Afghan capital of Kabul, a bomb exploded
inside a truck near reviewing stands built for a ceremony honoring
the departing Soviet troops. Eleven Afghan civilians were reported
killed. Later, three rockets hit a village outside Kabul, killing
four people.
   Since Dec. 27, 1979, when the Kremlin sent tanks and troops into
Afghanistan, Soviet soldiers have been fighting to prop up the
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, but they have failed to
break the back of a nationwide anti-Marxist insurgency.
   Acknowledging the Kremlin's unwillingness to keep bearing the
military and diplomatic costs of the intervention, Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze signed U.N.-brokered accords in Geneva on
April 14 that commit the Soviets to a nine-month pullout, beginning
Sunday.
   As the first of an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops prepare to
come home, one major question is how _ or if _ the Moscow-aligned
regime of President Najib, which claims just 40,000 regular
soldiers of its own, can survive.
   The first Soviets to leave will be from a motor-rifle division
garrisoned at Jalalabad, a dusty provincial town 30 miles from the
Pakistan border, military officials and Soviet media have said.
   Lt. Gen. Boris V. Gromov, Soviet commander in Afghanistan, said
Saturday more than 1,000 soldiers would leave Jalalabad on Sunday
and that a quarter of the entire Soviet contingent would be home by
the time President Reagan visits Moscow on May 29-June 2.
   In recent days, Soviet media have issued alarming reports about
increasing guerrilla activity, perhaps to ready public opinion for
losses during the withdrawal, or to stress that the pullout will
heighten the likelihood of bloodshed among the Afghan factions
locked in a 10-year-old civil war.
   Soviet television took its viewers Thursday to the
Kabul-Kandahar-Herat road, a 650-mile crescent-shaped track that
links three of Afghanistan's major cities, for a taped interview
with a Red Army officer assigned to screen the pullout.
   ``The activity of armed opposition bands has been sharply
increasing,'' said Lt. Col. N.V. Ivanov, who spoke as a truck
convoy crawled along the hilly road in back of him. ``The road will
apparently become an objective for which they will fight till the
bitter end.''
   Guerrilla commanders, who refused to be party to the Geneva
agreements, have vowed to give the Soviets no respite during the
pullout.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, head of the seven-party rebel alliance,
offered a limited amnesty to Afghan forces who surrender within
four weeks after Soviet troops leave their districts.
   He said Saturday in Pakistan that those who surrendered in time
would not be tried for war crimes. But he said those who don't
surrender and are captured will face Islamic courts.
   Gromov, who spoke at a news conference in Kabul, said the rebels
had recently received antitank weapons, but warned: ``If any group
tries to use any weapons, retribution will be quick and severe.''
   Asked if the pullout was a defeat, the 44-year-old commander
said: ``The Soviet Army will return home after fulfilling its
internationalist duty ... During the war, not a single unit
retreated in the face of the enemy, so we cannot speak of a
military defeat.''
   Gromov's remarks were made available to The Associated Press in
a pool report from the British news agency Reuters. The AP was
excluded from the pool because of questions it asked Najib in the
Afghan capital last month.
   Most of the Soviets will be traveling by land, rather than by
airlift. For some convoys, the trek to Soviet border cities like
Termez and Kushka is expected to take three days or more, often
through rugged, mountainous terrain where the rebels have been
active in the past.
   Air cover for the retreating columns may be a crucial problem,
as the insurgents have U.S.-made Stinger missiles, deadly against
low-flying helicopters and planes.
   Fearing the heat-seating Stinger, the Soviets and Afghans in
1986 virtually ceased using their aircraft for ground support
missions.
   As they withdraw, the Soviets will hand over more than 170
military bases with equipment worth $1 billion to their Afghan
allies, Gromov said.
   Najib, 41, a burly, mustachioed Marxist who is a former head of
the Afghan secret police, has scoffed when asked whether the
departure of his Soviet allies will bring about the downfall of his
government.
   However, many of the dozens of posts handed over to his army in
recent weeks reportedly have been overrun by well-armed guerrillas.
   Soviet media reports have said Soviet soldiers believe they have
honorably performed their duty in coming to the support of a
beleagured government, but the media have made no secret of the
men's desire to return home.
   In the television interview, Lt. Col. Ivanov, whose detachment
will protect other units as they withdraw, pointed to his men and
said: ``They say we will certainly envy the first columns that go
home.''

<HEAD>GOP Senate Leaders See Good Chance for Shrinking Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican leaders in the Senate
reassured the nation's top business executives Saturday that the
outlook is good for shrinking the federal budget deficit.
   The Business Council, composed of 61 chief executives of the
nation's largest corporations, heard from Sen. Pete V. Domenici,
R-N.M., and Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., as the group wrapped up a
two-day conference.
   The sessions of the elite council are private, but Domenici told
reporters before speaking to the executives, ``I'm not one of those
who is going to go before this business group and predict gloom and
fear.''
   Domenici is ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee
and a member of a national bipartisan commission that began meeting
last week to devise ways to lower the deficit.
   The business executives, as they opened their twice-a-year
conference at The Homestead, a plush resort in the mountains of
southwestern Virginia, issued a generally upbeat assessment of the
nation's economic prospects this year, but warned that the budget
deficit remains ``disturbingly high'' during such a period of good
times.
   Edmund T. Pratt Jr., chairman of Pfizer Inc., a health care
corporation, said many business leaders enjoying the moderate
economic growth have a sense of ``living on borrowed time'' because
of government red ink.
   ``I think most of us still regard the budget deficit as the No.
1 problem facing us,'' said Robert J. Kilpatrick, chairman of CIGNA
Corp., an insurance company.
   The executives, in a forecast representing a consensus of member
corporation's chief economists, said that the budget deficit would
rise from $150.2 billion last year to $154 billion both this year
and in 1989. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the deficit
will be $157 billion in 1988.
   But Domenici said ``we've made significant strides'' and
predicted the government would ``very easily'' meet the $136
billion, 1989 target of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   He said he did not want to prematurely divulge the positions he
will be taking in the deliberations of the national commission.
   But, he said, ``I don't think it's as simple, as some are
saying, that we ought to just look out there for some big tax, just
so it's not income or corporate income tax.''
   ``We better be guarded about taxes with the American economy
doing as well as it is,'' he said.
   Simpson, who is deputy Republican leader in the Senate, spoke to
the executives Friday night.
   He told reporters Saturday that the government must limit the
growth of federal entitlement programs to achieve any meaningful
reduction in the deficit.
   ``When we deal honestly with Medicare, Social Security,
veteran's benefits, then we'll get something done. All else is
dancing in the night,' he said.
   He said he believed the national commission would propose a
sensible package because the co-chairmen, former Transportation
Secretary Drew Lewis and Washington lawyer Robert Strauss, ``are
pretty gutsy guys.''
   On another matter, Simpson said he was optimistic that Congress,
despite a tight schedule, will pass a second and better trade bill
after President Reagan vetoes the bill sent to him last week.
   Simpson said two key Democratic leaders, House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, were unlikely to let the legislation die because
of strong support in their home state for repeal of the windfall
profits tax on oil, which is included in the massive trade bill.
   The president is expected to reject the legislation because of a
provision that would require companies to give 60 days notice of
plant closings and major layoffs.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter, who went before
the business group on Friday, said the plant closing provision was
``onerous'' because it would provide a legal basis for challenging
virtually every closing or layoff.

   BURJ, India-Pakistan Border (AP) _ As night falls on the rugged
frontier, the rattle of guns of Indian border guards serves as a
warning to potential Sikh infiltrators and arms merchants who try
to cross into India from Pakistan.
   The guards take target practice 500 yards from the frontier to
warm up for the nightlong vigil.
   In the past eight weeks, at least 56 people have died in 47
encounters between Indian Border Security Force and would-be
infiltrators or arms smugglers.
   ``The days of the war game are over. We are faced with a
situation where we must stop infiltration from Pakistan by any
means,'' border force Inspector General Parkash Singh said at the
Burj border post in Punjab state.
   India wants to close the border with fences, men and strict
vigilance.
   The urgency to seal the 348-mile section of border in Punjab
stems from escalating violence in the state, where hundreds of
people have died in Sikh separatist violence this year.
   Sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 for an independent
Sikh homeland in Punjab.
   India's border with Pakistan stretches 1,836 miles, running
through the Indian states of Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat.
   It is a nervous border.
   Both nations station military forces in nearby garrisons in
memory of the three wars they have fought in the last 41 years.
   ``It is like firecrackers strewn all over the place. What is
needed is just a matchstick to start full-scale confrontation,'' a
border official told journalists who were taken to the border on a
government tour for foreign news organizations. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Sikh terrorist campaign has prompted the Indian government
to take drastic steps. India has accused Pakistan of sheltering and
arming the Sikhs, charges repeatedly denied by Pakistan.
   An estimated 15,000 Indian border guards are deployed along the
Punjab sector of the frontier.
   In addition, 40,000 Indian army men are garrisoned in Punjab,
subject to call-up on two hours' notice.
   Reporters saw Indian foot patrols in full combat readiness at
Burj, 26 miles west of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar. At a nearby
100-foot high observation tower, two guards were looking through
binoculars and keeping their foot patrols informed about movement
on the Pakistani side.
   After sundown, the tower guards use night-vision devises.
Whenever a potential infiltrator is spotted, the patrols are
alerted. They first ask the would-be infiltrators to stop and
identify themselves.
   ``We give them a one-minute response time. If they try to run or
fail to respond, we fire,'' said Vijendra Singh Sirohi, the border
force's deputy inspector general for the Punjab sector.
   In an effort to stop infiltration, the Indian government has
started fencing vulnerable sections with barbed wire.
   Senior officers in charge of border operations and intelligence
say Sikh violence can only be contained if infiltration from
Pakistan is checked.
   ``The oxygen for the Sikh terrorists is coming from Pakistan. If
we can stop the oxygen supply, terrorism will die,'' said Saran
Prasad, chief of operations at the border force's headquarters in
New Delhi.
   ``Before we would have hesitated to name Pakistan, but now it is
as clear as daylight _ I mean their help to terrorists,'' Prasad
said.
   Reporters were shown arms and ammunition the officers said were
captured from infiltrators.
   The weapons included rocket-propelled grenade launchers,
Soviet-designed AK-47 rifles and pistols.
   ``It is the AK-47 that worries us the most,'' Prasad said.
   The Border Security Force has nothing to match the AK-47, whose
firepower and light weight make it an ideal weapon for untrained
gunmen.
   Border troops are equipped with single-shot rifles, in addition
to light machine guns that must be mounted before firing.

   Singer Dolly Parton reportedly has been
signed for her fourth movie, ``Steel Magnolias,'' and will cancel a
summer concert tour as a result.
   Mack Newberry, a spokesman for Miss Parton, said no official
announcement has been made because all the parts are not cast.
   The Tennessean, a Nashville newspaper, reported Saturday that
she had been tapped for a part in the movie.
   The Ray Stark production is based on Robert Harling's play about
a beauty shop where a group of Louisiana women let down their hair.
   Miss Parton previously was in ``9 to 5,'' ``Rhinestone'' and
``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.'' She also stars in a weekly
hourly variety show on ABC-TV.

   Iran's Supreme Judicial Council on
Saturday approved a law under which people who offend ``public
morals'' will receive 74 lashes.
   State-run Iranian television, monitored in Cyprus, said the law
would apply to those who take any action ``or pretend to take any
action'' that hurts public morals. It did not spell out the
offenses.
   Under Iran's Islamic government, husbands and wives are
forbidden from kissing or showing physical affection in public.
Such actions are often referred to as offending morality.
   After approval by the council, the law took effect immediately.
The beatings are administered with a metal-cored flexible whip with
an outer covering.
   Men are sometimes beaten in public, women always in private.
   Iran's revolutionary legal code has an elaborate list of
punishments, with precise numbers of lashes given for each category
of offense.

<HEAD>Calls For Death Of Tiger Involved In Fatal Mauling Worry Zoo
Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zoo officials posted an extra guard and took
tigers and other large cats off public display after receiving
telephone calls demanding death for a Siberian tiger that killed a
zoo keeper.
   Houston Zoo officials said Friday that they have no plans to
kill or transfer Miguel, the 450-pound Siberian tiger that fatally
mauled Ricardo Tovar on Thursday.
   No one saw or heard the attack on Tovar, but officials said the
tiger apparently smashed through a reinforced, wire-and-glass
window and dragged Tovar outside before killing him.
   ``This is a wild animal,'' said parks department director Donald
Olson. ``It's not a domesticated animal. One of the purposes of a
zoo is to preserve species, and tigers are not a domesticated
species.''
   The tigers and other cats would be kept off display at least
until Monday, Olson said. ``We're leaving them off display to let
things settle down,'' he said.
   Olson said he didn't know what was said in the phone calls, but
that the calls came from people who wanted the tiger killed.
Officials have said that the animal, which is on the endangered
species list, poses no danger to the public.
   While some were calling for Miguel's death, several zoo visitors
vigorously defended the tiger on Friday.
   ``I'm sorry for the man. But, I don't think he would have wanted
it destroyed,'' said Pat Hodge.
   Suzy Sanders, 23, who has a special interest in big cats and
goes to the zoo regularly, said: ``I don't want to be mean, but I
think it was more human stupidity. They knew that animal was
dangerous. Obviously, I think more caution should have been taken.''
   Larry Warrendorf, 52, a night keeper-watchman at the zoo, said
he heard negative comments from a few visitors walking by the
exhibit area where Tovar was killed.
   ``They were wondering why the cat wasn't killed, among other
things,'' Warrendorf said. ``That's the number one question I hear:
What are they going to do with the cat?'''
   Warrendorf said many people ``seem to act as if they want
revenge.''
   ``We don't know what to expect with the nature of people and the
nature of animals,'' he said.

<HEAD>Debate Rages Over Bringing Quebec Back Into the Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deal between French and English Canada to
recognize Quebec as a ``distinct society'' and bring it back into
the Constitution has bogged down in arguments over minority and
women's rights and the future of the nation's political system.
   Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and other critics want last
year's agreement scrapped. Trudeau, a leader in creating the
nation's new Constitution in 1982, says the pact could lead to the
breakup of Canada's federation of provinces.
   Others want the accord renegotiated. Women's groups, the
country's 500,000 Indians and Eskimos, and language minorities in
several provinces want their rights enshrined in the Constitution.
The Northwest Territories and Yukon claim the deal makes it
virtually impossible for them to become provinces.
   The accord's importance stems from Quebec's refusal to sign the
1982 Constitution because it failed specifically to protect the
province's French culture.
   Despite all the critics, Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa thinks
he can persuade the country to ratify the agreement, which was
signed by the federal government and the 10 Canadian provinces a
year ago at Meech Lake, Quebec.
   But his chief provincial ally, Ontario Premier David Peterson,
says there's only a 50-50 chance. ``I wouldn't bet the family farm
on it,'' he said recently.
   However, Peterson warned that ``the political consequences of
not signing this could be very severe.
   ``It will be an enormous political risk for the country to
refuse it. We don't need it to survive, but we do for political
stability,'' he said.
   The risk of unrest isn't always apparent in Quebec. The mainly
French-speaking province has evolved in the past decade from a
bastion of French separatism into a prosperous society of 6.6
million people.
   The turning point was the rejection, by a 6-to-4 margin, of a
1980 referendum to open talks on a limited form of independence.
   Robert Maule, the U.S. consul general in Montreal, describes
today's sprawling city of 2.9 million as one of entrepreneurs and
yuppies, not political extremists. He said the 81-percent
French-speaking majority feels more secure about its fate on an
English-speaking continent.
   First posted here in 1976, Maule said: ``In those days, if you
went into a store and said ``hello'' to someone, they'd glare at
you. Now, if they greet you first in French, they apologize and say
`hello' right back.''
   Yet it doesn't take much to revive the old Anglo-French
antagonisms.
   About 25,000 French Quebecers marched through the streets last
month to proclaim the inviolability of the province's French-only
language law. The protesters reacted after Bourassa wavered over an
election promise to permit bilingual business signs and after two
Western provinces diluted French minority rights.
   Today's French-speaking Quebecers, who number about 5 million,
descend from settlers who followed on the heels of 16th and 17th
century French explorers. Once called New France, Quebec came under
British control after a defeat of French soldiers on the bank of
the St. Lawrence River in 1759.
   All parties initially hailed Conservative Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney's skillful negotiation of the Meech Lake accord, and the
deal was ratified Oct. 26 by the House of Commons. The pact has
been approved by four of 10 provinces: Quebec, Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island.
   But with a June 1990 deadline for unanimous assent, New
Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna opposes the pact, a minority
government in Manitoba lacks the votes to pass it, and four other
provinces have delayed ratification.
   Meanwhile, the country's main opposition Liberal Party is
sharply divided over Meech Lake and seeks amendments.
   In addition to the ``distinct society'' clause for Quebec, Meech
Lake gives provinces new powers in the appointment of Supreme Court
judges and senators and the right to opt out of national
shared-cost programs.
   Trudeau says such a scenario could shatter the Canadian
federation. Other critics say the phrase ``distinct society'' is
ill-defined and will cause endless litigation over the division of
federal and provincial powers.
   Mulroney says objections can be taken up at later constitutional
talks. ``Meech Lake will pass the way it is. This is an undertaking
we gave to the people of Canada and the people of Quebec,'' he said.
   But Peterson did not close the door to changes. ``I'm prepared
to look at anything,'' he told reporters.
   This pledge upset Bourassa, who argued that unanimous consent
for change is now impossible. He said native rights and other
matters can be dealt with separately and that a constitutional
provision requires consent from only seven provinces or those
representing 50 percent of the population.
   ``In reopening the deal, they will kill the deal and keep Quebec
outside the Constitution,'' he said.

   In the hours after his car plunged off the
bridge at Chappaquiddick, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy wanted to tell
police that Mary Jo Kopechne was alone in the car, according to a
new book about the accident.
   In an account attributed to Kennedy cousin Joseph Gargan,
Kennedy told Gargan and a friend, Paul Markham, the morning after
the accident that ``I'm going to say that Mary Jo was driving.''
Kopechne drowned in the accident, which has shadowed Kennedy's
political career for 19 years.
   The book, by Leo Damore, is ``Senatorial Privilege: The
Chappaquiddick Coverup,'' and is purportedly based, in part, on the
first extensive interviews Gargan has ever given for publication.
Gargan and Markham went with Kennedy to the bridge shortly after
the accident to try to rescue Kopechne from the submerged car.
   A statement issued by Kennedy spokesman Jeff Smith said: ``As
the record shows, no reputable publisher would touch this book. The
charges about senator Kennedy are false. The book is an
irresponsible rehash of all the old rumor and innuendo, and we have
no intention of making any further comment.''
   Gargan, a lawyer who is now a member of the Massachusetts state
Insurance Division's Board of Appeals, did not return repeated
telephone calls over the past week. Contacted recently by the Cape
Cod Times, he said: ``My God, that was 19 years ago. It's just not
worthy of discussing anymore.''
   The book is being published by Regnery Gateway, a conservative
publishing house based in Washington, after being rejected by a
number of New York publishers. Damore, of Old Saybrook, Conn., is a
former Cape Cod resident who has written several books, including a
flattering account of John F. Kennedy's years on the cape.
   Random House had given Damore a $250,000 contract, but cancelled
it, saying an early version of the book was too unwieldy and that
the author failed to provide tape recordings to authenticate the
Gargan interviews. Penthouse magazine canceled an excerpt plan on
ground that Damore couldn't verify key parts of the Gargan
interviews.
   But Jimmy Smith, a former Kennedy campaign aide and now a U.S.
magistrate on Cape Cod, said in a telephone interview that he was
present for nearly all of the Damore-Gargan sessions, in 1983. He
declined to go over specifics, but vouched for the book's accuracy.
Gargan also read the book and made corrections prior to
publication, Smith said.
   According to Damore, Gargan told him Kennedy concocted the
proposal that authorities be told Kopechne was alone in the
senator's Oldsmobile when it plunged off tiny Dike Bridge over an
inlet on the east side of the Massachusetts island.
   The accident occurred the weekend of July 18-19, 1969. Kopechne
was one of six women known as the ``boiler room girls'' who had
worked on Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaigns and who
attended a party Gargan had organized.
   ``Kennedy was having alternative ideas about the situation,''
wrote author Damore. ``Why couldn't Mary Jo have been driving the
car? Why couldn't she have let him off and driven to the ferry
herself and made a wrong turn?''
   ``Kennedy asked to be brought back to the cottage to establish
the story. After a while he could leave. Kennedy suggested that
when he was back (in Edgartown), Gargan could `discover' the
accident and report to police that Mary Jo had been alone in the
car.''
   But Gargan purportedly rejected the idea, noting that the trio
did not even know if Miss Kopechne could drive or had a license.
   The senator testified at an official inquest that he ``had full
intention of reporting'' the accident when the trio returned to the
Chappaquiddick ferry landing and the senator swam back to Edgartown
alone. But he said the tide was pulling him out and ``for the
second time that evening I knew I was going to drown.''
   The next morning Markham and Gargan arrived at the Edgartown
hotel to find a freshly shaven and neatly dressed Kennedy chatting
with several acquaintances about sailing on the hotel balcony. He
had not reported the accident.
   ``I told them about my own thoughts and feelings as I swam
across that channel ... that somehow when they arrived in the
morning that they were going to say that Mary Jo was still alive,''
the senator has said.
   The book said Kennedy did not decide to tell police that he was
driving until speaking by telephone with aide David Burke. It took
about 10 hours for Kennedy to report the accident, an action that
he later called ``irrational and indefensible and inexcusable and
inexplicable.''
   The senator pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of
an accident. He received a two-month suspended sentence and had his
license revoked for a year.
   A manuscript of the book, which is scheduled to be published
June 23, was made available to The Associated Press. Washingtonian
magazine said it plans to run excerpts in its June issue.
   The book quotes Gargan as saying to Kennedy, in 1982, ``I've
given you 30 years of my life and what do I have to show for it?
I'm a fool in the eyes of my own children because of
Chappaquiddick.''
   Markham, who did not talk to the author, declined comment.
   The book, reporting the scene on the night of the accident, said
Kennedy watched Gargan and Markham's rescue operation and called
out: ``Can you see her? Is she in there'?''
   The account continued: ``Gargan saw the senator stretched out on
the bridge on his back. Hands clapsed behind his head, knees drawn
up, the senator was looking into the sky, rocking back and forth,
repeating, `Oh my God. What am I going to do'?''

<HEAD>Accused In-Flight Smoker Denies Tampering With Smoke Detector</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first person arrested under new regulations
banning smoking on short airline flights says he's willing to plead
guilty to smoking but would fight any more serious charge.
   In an interview published Saturday in The Seattle Times, Darryl
Seigel denied an official's suggestion that he may have tampered
with a smoke detector in an airliner restroom during a USAir flight
from Seattle to Reno, Nev.
   Seigel, 38, of Seattle, admitted smoking a cigarette in a
lavatory during the Thursday flight but said he did so
absent-mindedly. He said that if he is charged with ``smoking in
the lavatory, I'll plead guilty, but if it's for anything else I'll
fight it.''
   Regulations that went into effect three weeks ago ban smoking on
domestic airliner flights lasting less than two hours.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elly Brekke said
Seigel is apparently the first passenger to be arrested under the
new rules.
   The lack of an alarm from the lavatory smoke detector caused the
flight crew to suspect it was tampered with, Brekke said. It was
given to maintenance workers for an inspection.
   But Seigel said of the smoke detector, ``I touched it, that's
all, but I did not do anything other than look at it out of
curiousity.''
   Brekke said the investigation should take 60 days, and Seigel
faces three possible charges: Smoking when a no smoking sign is on,
which carries a $1,000 fine; smoking in the lavatory, also a $1,000
fine; and tampering with a lavatory smoke detector, a $2,000 fine.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Focus on Drugs, Nicaragua Misses Latin Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocaine and communism have dominated U.S. relations
with Latin America this decade, while the region's festering
economic and political problems are being neglected, experts warn
in an 84-page report issued here.
   ``Miami Report II'' was prepared by bankers, oil executives,
clergymen and academics led by Ambler Moss, former U.S. ambassador
to Panama. It follows up on the group's first report in 1984, which
accurately forecast a gradually worsening economic crisis in Latin
America.
   ``Without a solution, there will be severe erosion of fragile
democracies in Latin America,'' Moss said in an interview Friday.
He is now dean of the University of Miami Graduate School of
International Studies. ``You can't run a democracy when the economy
is going to hell,'' he said.
   Since the early 1980s, money has steadily flowed out of Latin
America to the United States, depriving the underdeveloped nations
of desperately needed capital, says the study, which was released
Friday. By the end of 1987, Latin America was staggering under a
debt burden of $460 billion.
   The authors say the region is mired in its worst depression
since the 1930s.
   Argentina's elected President Raul Alfonsin, who has had to put
down attempted military coups, frequently warns the United States
that his region's economic troubles threaten its political
stability.
   But U.S. policy has ignored the deeper problems, concentrating
instead on battling communism in Central America, Moss said.
   ``There has been almost an obssession with Nicaragua to the
exclusion of everything else,'' Moss said. ``In the absolute worst
case, we could send troops into Nicaragua _ but we can't send them
into every country in Latin America.''
   The other dominant theme in U.S.-Latin relations has been
narcotics trafficking, says University of Miami professor Bruce
Bagley, who specializes in international relations and prepared the
Miami Report II section on drug trafficking. He pointed to the
inability of the United States to either unseat or prosecute
Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on drug charges.
   ``Our argument is that there are many other problems equally
fundamental,'' Bagley said in a separate interview Friday. ``By
failing to deal with these problems, the Noriegas of the world can
flourish.''
   Even in fighting the traffickers, the Reagan administration has
failed to come up with concrete anti-drug aid to financially
strapped countries, or with programs to cut U.S. demand, Bagley
said.
   But cocaine rhetoric and get-tough policies _ instead of deeper
economic issues _ dominate U.S. relations with the Bahamas,
Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, he said.
   ``This is a lost decade for democracy and development in Latin
America,'' Bagley said.
   The report acknowledges it is timed for the 1988 presidential
elections, and calls on U.S. voters to demand more substance in the
candidates' Latin America policy.
   A section of the report by Msgr. Bryan Walsh of the Miami Roman
Catholic archdiocese also calls for a more realistic immigration
policy, criticizing the government for narrowing its definition of
political asylum to thwart Latin and Caribbean immigrants.
   Miami Report II's main focus is economic, however, and the
authors offer what they say are moderate policies to curb the
departure of capital from the region.
   They call for Latin American nations themselves to adopt
internal policies that reassure investors. Moss noted that
Argentina, with a foreign debt of $53 billion, has ``flight
capital'' of $39 billion deposited outside the country by
Argentines worried about the nation's political and economic health.
   But U.S. policy _ or lack of it _ takes a large share of the
blame, the report says, and must be changed.
   One suggestion is for the U.S. Treasury to lower interest rates
on loans made directly to smaller countries.
   Another is for the United States to increase funding available
for Latin America through the Inter-American Development Bank.

<HEAD>UI Team Helping India Develop Buddhist Sites For Tourism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>URBANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Illinois landscape architects
are working on designs to help the government of India attract more
tourists to key Buddhist religious sites.
   University officials will go to India this summer to present
plans for redeveloping Sarnath, where Buddha delivered his first
sermon more than 2,500 years ago.
   ``It gives our students hands-on experience, and it is an
exciting challenge to develop tourism there,'' said Vincent
Bellafiore, head of the university's Department of Landscape
Architecture. ``People can see a totally different religion and
culture.''
   Sarnath, in the northern part of India, contains landmark
structures such as a temple, a museum and architectural ruins. But,
there also are mud houses, cycle rickshaws, and streets lined with
vendors selling everything from silk to peanuts.
   One goal for the university team was to create designs that suit
both religious and recreational activities at Sarnath and would cut
down conflicts between the two.
   ``Some people come for religious devotion,'' said Bellafiore.
``Others picnic on the grass next to the temple with a
ghetto-blaster and barbecue meat, and that is very offensive.''
   So, the Illinois students and faculty visited Sarnath and
returned with pictures and ideas, then spent months on campus early
this year developing plans for improving the site.
   Graduate student Miki Stuebe concentrated on the zoo, creating
more natural settings for animals in place of the small cages now
used. For example, one of her drawings depicts an island for the
zoo's monkeys.
   ``We want to tie into Buddhist concepts like compassion for all
living things,'' she said.
   One alternative in the plan calls for moving the zoo away from
the key religious area.
   Richard Blume-Weaver, another graduate student, rolled out a
drawing of proposed new footpaths intended to keep people from
walking on the architectural ruins.
   Around some Buddhist structures, the plans show two paths _ one
for religious pilgrims who spend much more time there, and another
for tourists who want to walk past more quickly.
   In other areas of Sarnath, the plans along a main road include
trees more typical of those found during Buddha's time, concepts
for tourist-related market spaces and hedges to restrict the
movement of farm animals into the site.
   For overnight tourists, there are concepts for new housing
designed to blend in with the architecture of the current village.
   ``We don't want a chichi resort in the midst of abject
poverty,'' said Bellafiore, who hopes the housing will be decorated
with pottery and weavings by village craftsmen to help the local
economy.
   The U.S. National Park Service and India's Ministry of Tourism
agreed on this project. The only cost was transportation and food
and lodging in India for the university team, said Bellafiore.
   Bellafiore said he will return to India with other university
officials to deliver the designs that will provide the Indian
government with alternatives that are ``not enormously expensive.''
   ``I think our plans will satisfy India's goal to increase
tourism,'' said Blume-Weaver. ``I'd also like to see the ruins
better preserved, and I'd like to see the place respected more as a
religious site.''
   Similar designs may be developed by the Illinois team for other
Buddhist sites in India.

<HEAD>Michelangelo Scholar Says Artist Had Help Painting Sistine Chapel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michelangelo was not, contrary to popular
belief, an angry loner who spent countless hours lying flat on his
back as he painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, a Washington
University art historian concludes.
   In fact, the Italian Renaissance master did his work standing on
innovative scaffolding, and he had help from as many as 13
assistants, says William E. Wallace, assistant professor of art
history.
   ``One of the larger myths about him is that he was incapable of
working with others,'' Wallace said Friday. ``But the fact is that
for very large projects it was necessary to work with assistants.''
   ``I think of him as something of an entrepreneur ... a fairly
efficient businessman,'' Wallace said. ``It's just another side of
an artist who's constantly surprising us.''
   Depicting the biblical story of creation on the chapel's ceiling
was not without discomfort, however. Michelangelo described his
painting position _ on his feet, head tilted back _ to a friend in
this way:
   ``My beard toward Heaven, I feel the back of my brain upon my
neck.''
   Wallace spent last year in Italy on a grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities researching Michelangelo and studying
the ceiling, which is undergoing a major renovation. Workers are
using a special, mild solvent to remove layers of dirt, candle
smoke and even Greek wine, which was once used to brighten the
colors.
   ``It's truly stunning,'' said Wallace, who climbed the
scaffolding four times, as the restorers worked to bring out the
work's true colors, for leisurely close-up looks.
   ``I think the thing that's most important is the coloration,''
he said. ``Although it comes as a surprise to some people, it's
really probably exactly as Michelangelo intended it.''
   Wallace said Michelangelo used vibrant colors so they could be
seen from the floor, 65 feet below.
   Now that he's back home, Wallace is working on a book about
Michelangelo and the assistants he used on his major works.
   In Italy, he spent hours compiling scattered information on the
Sistine project, which took from 1508 to 1512, and came up with a
list of 13 assistants who helped Michelangelo.
   An architect friend helped design the overhead scaffolding and a
carpenter named Piero Basso built it, Wallace said. Michelangelo
also hired assistants to grind colors, mix paints, trim and clean
brushes, and take care of other mundane tasks, and he recruited
other artists and instructed them in the technique of fresco
painting.
   Some historians have believed Michelangelo had help in the
project, but workers cleaning the ceiling in the 1930s were the
first to notice the tell-tale details, Wallace said. He thinks his
book will be the first to provide an overall picture of
Michelangelo's assistants in the Sistine Chapel.
   ``Examination of the ceiling from the scaffold clearly reveals
the presence of helping hands, especially painting in the
architecture, decoration and many of the secondary figures,''
Wallace said.
   ``Much of the architecture, for example, was a reptititous task
that required competence but no imagination, and the presence of
more than one hand is particularly evident when viewed at close
range,'' he said.
   Wallace said the myths about Michelangelo painting alone will
probably continue, however, because ``they are fictions that
attempt to grasp a superhuman achievement.''
   But knowing he had a little help ``does not in any way detract
from the greatness of the work of art.''
   ``Rather, it is to the credit of his genius that the final
product is a unified work of art.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis was jeered Saturday
as he appealed for votes from homosexual political activists, some
of whom confronted him for supporting a policy making it difficult
for gay couples to be foster parents.
   Dukakis, speaking to several dozen people at a meeting of a gay
political action committee, promised, ``You're going to be deeply
involved in what we do.''
   However, the Massachusetts governor was confronted over a policy
in his state giving low priority to homosexual couples as foster
parents. The policy gives higher priority to heterosexual couples
with children and relatives of the child needing placement.
   Dukakis, campaigning for gay support in California's June 7
primary, was met with some hisses and occasional shouts of protest
as he explained his position on foster care.
   Dukakis also pointed to his record of support for spending money
to combat the deadly AIDS disease, whose chief victims have been
homosexual men. He also said Massachusetts spends more money per
AIDS case than any other state.
   He called AIDS ``the most serious public health problem we've
had in our lifetime.''
   Dukakis said he had vetoed legislation as governor that banned
homosexual couples from providing foster care, but said he backed
the policy in effect that gives first priority to heterosexual
couples with child raising experience, and above that, relatives of
the child in need of care.
   When asked repeatedly why he favored that policy, Dukakis said
``because I think it's best, all things being equal, for a child to
grow up in a household with a mother and father and other
children.''
   Dukakis added that his policy does not prohibit gays from
becoming foster parents if they are best for the child, but Dukakis
aides acknowledged the Massachusetts policy effectively prevents
gays from becoming foster parents in most cases.
   A handful of protesters greeted the Massachusetts governor
outside a hotel. Inside, one man shouted, ``bigot,'' and another
yelled, ``You're anti-gay. Why don't you admit it?''
   Dukakis was warmly endorsed by Jean O'Leary, executive director
of a group called National Gay Rights Advocates.
   ``We have in Mike Dukakis a candidate who is instinctively
supportive, who has a good record on gay rights, who wants our
support and who can win,'' she said. ``Let's stop comparing Michael
Dukakis with Jesse Jackson and start comparing him with George
Bush.''
   Dukakis said he would not support an executive order banning
discrimination based on sexual orientation, but said he believed
such discrimination was already prohibited by the U.S. Constitution.
   Dukakis aides said they were pleased with the meeting despite
the protests.
   ``I thought it was very good, very open. I thought Governor
Dukakis dealt with the community's concerns very honestly,'' said
Alice Travis, the campaign's national political coordinator.
   At a news conference later in Pasadena, Dukakis responded to
criticism from Vice President George Bush, the expected Republican
nominee, who has blasted Dukakis for opposing weapons systems and
said the Democrat's approach to defense amounted to ``wishful
thinking.''
   ``Anybody who sat there and did nothing while we traded arms to
the Ayatollah (Khomeini) had better not be lecturing other people
about naivete and wishful thinking,'' Dukakis said, referring to
Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Dukakis also faced questions on his opposition to the death
penalty as he appeared with Californa Attorney General John Van de
Kamp, who endorsed him.
   The Massachusetts governor said he opposed the death penalty,
``because I don't believe in killing people. There are other ways
of stopping violent crime.''

   Masked Arab youths battled Israeli soldiers in
the occupied territories Saturday after the military lifted a
travel ban. An Arab report said four protesters were savagely
beaten by soldiers and dumped on a highway.
   A 16-year-old Palestinian was shot in the leg in the fighting
between stone-throwing Palestinians and Israeli troops. The clashes
came after Israel ended a 29-hour closure of the Gaza Strip and
eased travel restrictions in the West Bank.
   A top Israeli official said the civil disobedience campaign
against Israeli occupation had failed. ``We certainly noticed some
fatigue,'' said Shmuel Goren, policy coordinator for the occupied
territories.
   Gaza City's Ahli Arab Hospital treated seven Palestinians for
beating injuries after Saturday's clashes, doctors there said.
   An Arab reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear
of reprisals, said four of them were dumped by Israeli soldiers
along Gaza's main highway after they were clubbed.
   The four, ranging in age from 16 to 22, told the reporter they
were detained during protests in Gaza City, then beaten and thrown
out of a truck several miles away.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   Authorities had sealed Gaza and blocked West Bank Arabs from
entering Jerusalem on Friday to prevent Moslems from praying at
Jerusalem's main mosques on the last sabbath of the Moslem holy
month of Ramadan.
   PLO underground leaders, who have orchestrated strikes by Arab
merchants, permitted Palestinian shops to open for several hours
Saturday so Moslems could stock up for the three-day holiday
marking the end of Ramadan.
   In Gaza's Shati refugee camp, soldiers opened fire to disperse
stone-throwing demonstrators, wounding a 16-year-old Palestinian in
the leg, said doctors at Ahli Arab Hospital. The army said it was
checking that report.
   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, about 60 masked Arab youths
erected roadblocks of burning tires and threw stones at soldiers in
the main street. Troops dispersed the crowd with tear gas and
rubber bullets.
   Associated Press photographer Martin Cleaver said he was
attacked by two soldiers when he photographed them arresting a
teen-age Arab demonstrator.
   Cleaver said the soldiers punched him five or six times in the
head and kicked him in the thighs. Cleaver said he was not
seriously hurt.
   The army said it was investigating.
   In a radio interview, Goren acknowledged that the majority of
the Palestinians still backed the uprising, which has entered its
sixth month and claimed the lives of 187 Arabs and two Israelis.
   But he said the main objective of the Palestinian civil
disobedience campaign _ breaking the hold of the military
government in the occupied territories with tax boycotts,
underground schools, and other means _ has failed.
   ``The main goal of the campaign was to establish alternative
systems,'' Goren said. ``This has not happened until today, and we
will not allow it to happen.''
   Israel has occupied the territories since the 1967 Middle East
War.
   Jerusalem spokesman Menahem Raboy announced that schools in
Jerusalem's Arab sector would reopen May 22 after being closed
since Feb. 4.
   Military officials have said they were considering reopening
schools in the West Bank after the end of Ramadan but have not set
a date. West Bank schools have been closed for five months.
   Schools in Arab east Jerusalem and the occupied territories
frequently have been the site of anti-Israeli protests.

   A 70-pound girl whose kite took her
on an unscheduled flight returned Saturday to her liftoff site and
managed to stay on the ground as she launched a new set of kite
safety rules.
   DeAndra Anrig's appearance ended a ban on kite flying at
Shoreline Park after the 8-year-old's kite string snagged on a
passing airplane March 20 and carried her 10 feet off the ground
for at least 100 feet.
   The third-grader from Dublin still has deep bruises on her back
but was so excited about Saturday's event that she couldn't sleep
Friday night, according to her mother, Debbie. She flew a stunt
kite for about a minute before it fell to the grass.
   ``It feels fun,'' DeAndra said shyly to a crowd of reporters,
who outnumbered other spectators. ``It was fun just to get the kite
up in the air and flying it.''
   She warned other children not to fly kites next to nearby Palo
Alto Airport, from which planes were taking off and landing over
the park.
   But, she added: ``I want to fly again even though I was hurt.''
   Glenn Lyles, the city's Shoreline manager, had said it was
appropriate to have DeAndra be the first to officially fly a kite
after the regulations were revised.
   Greeting her today with a pat on the head, he said with a laugh,
``You've caused me a lot of work the last month.''
   The story of DeAndra's flight was relayed around the world by
the news media, which dubbed her Mary Poppins, Winnie the Pooh and
the Flying Nun.
   The plane sustained minor damage in the runin with the kite, but
landed safely.
   The city's new guidelines for kite flying at the park, which is
located near both the airport and Moffett Field Naval Air Station,
include a ban on flying kites higher than 150 feet.
   The Federal Aviation Administration made no ruling as to who was
at fault in March when DeAndra was snagged by the airplane,
according to Lyles. The city's report indicates that the kite was
between 200 and 250 feet in the air, but the pilot who struck the
kite claimed to be at 700 feet, he said.

   Ten gold miners plunged to
their deaths Saturday after a lift hit an obstruction in the mine
shaft, management said.
   The Harmony Gold Mine, honored earlier this year for its safety
record, said the accident occurred shortly before daybreak when
miners being lowered into the mine fell from the door of the lift
after it struck ``an as yet unknown obstacle.''
   The company initally reported that six miners were killed and
later said search teams found four more bodies. The names of the
victims were not released pending notification of relatives.
   Harmony, owned by Rand Mines, is near the town of Virgina in the
Orange Free State, the centermost of South Africa's four provinces.

   People pushing baby strollers, holding
toddlers and carrying union signs gathered Saturday near the
Washington Monument in support of so-called ``family'' legislation
for working parents and the elderly.
   ``Hurrah, hurrah for the American family,'' said Rep. Claude
Pepper, D-Fla., 87, the oldest member of Congress and a champion of
bills to expand job and medical benefits for working parents and
senior citizens.
   The rally was sponsored by a coalition of labor organizations,
and religious, civil rights and women's groups. About 3,000 people
were in attendance, according to Officer Maria Gonzalez of the U.S.
Park Police.
   ``Let us rededicate ourselves to the sanctity, to the nobility
and the well-being of the American family, the base of our great
society, the base and strength of our great America,'' said Pepper,
as rally-goers cheered.
   The event at Washington's big outdoor pedestrian mall featured
entertainment for the children, such as a Chinese lion dance and
trampolines. Adults marched with union signs or set up picnics on
the grass.
   Bills now pending in Congress would require businesses to give
unpaid leave to workers with a newborn, newly adopted or seriously
ill child and provide home health care for the chronically ill.
   The parental and medical leave legislation is opposed by many
business groups, who object to federally mandated workplace
benefits.
   The Reagan administration also contends that such matters should
be worked out between employers and employees, not ordered by
Congress.
   ``Government was not created for defense alone,'' said Rep. Tony
Coelho, D-Calif., the House majority whip. ``This administration
does not understand this message, for they are out of touch with
the needs of everyday working Americans.''
   He told the rally that passage of the bills would signal an end
to the ``long, national nightmare that has been the Reagan years.''
   ``We know that our family and our future do not belong to Ronald
Reagan and the right wing of the Republican Party,'' Coelho said.
``To compete in this economy, our kids need more than a right wing
and a prayer.''
   Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO, said the rally
``celebrates the family values that are advanced and supported ...
by the whole American labor movement, men and women, mothers and
fathers, sons and daughters and grandparents alike.''
   Irene Natividad, president of the National Women's Political
Caucus, urged people to sign petitions in support of the
legislation and to vote in the fall only for lawmakers who worked
for the measures.
   The House Education and Labor Committee last November approved a
family and medical leave bill requiring firms with at least 50
employees to offer up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave over a two-year
period to workers with a newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill
child. Employees with serious medical conditions of their own would
be entitled to up to 15 weeks of unpaid leave over a year's time.
The House leadership has not yet scheduled floor action on the bill.
   In the Senate, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., is sponsoring a
family leave bill that would require businesses with more than 15
employees to offer up to 18 weeks of unpaid leave upon the birth,
adoption or serious illness of a child. The bill, which does not
include medical leave for employees, is pending in a Senate
subcommittee.
   Cost estimates by the General Accounting Office range from less
than $500 million for the Dodd bill to less than $200 million for
the House measure, a compromise worked out by Democrats and
moderate Republicans. Business groups contend the costs would be
higher.

<HEAD>Pope Tells Latin Americans to Show Self-Reliance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   From the heights of the Andes to the
tropical lowlands, Pope John Paul II has carried a message of
self-reliance and prodded Latin Americans to take the initiative in
solving their deep social and political problems.
   From combating drug trafficking and corruption to stemming the
``brain drain,'' the pope has argued that it is up to the people
themselves to do battle.
   Addressing a Mass on Saturday in the Amazon basin city of
Trinidad, the pope insisted that ``constant, intense, honest and
efficient work by everyone'' was needed to overcome poverty.
   ``We can't expect everything from outside,'' he said.
   The 12-day tour of Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay is John
Paul's ninth pilgrimage to a region he calls ``the continent of
hope.''
   Many people along his route have hoped for his help and
blessings. About 20 women occupied a Roman Catholic church Saturday
in Lima, Peru, to ask the pope to intercede for leftist rebels held
in prison.
   The group occupied the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, 12 blocks
from a seminary where the pope was to speak Sunday. Witnesses told
reporters that police took the protesters away in vans. Police
confirmed the incident but said they had no information on arrests.
   John Paul was scheduled to meet there with priests, nuns and
seminary students, as well as celebrate an open air Mass and close
a conference of Latin American bishops, before moving on Monday to
his last stop in Paraguay.
   The Vatican estimates that half the world's Roman Catholics, who
now number 860 million, will be living in Latin America by the turn
of the century.
   The pontiff has been greeted here by wildly enthusiastic crowds.
Entire cities have turned out to see him. Schoolboys have run after
his popemobile in motorcades, and schoolgirls have screamed as if
he were a rock star as he entered a stadium for a youth rally.
   The pontiff has avoided blaming the Latin American people for
their difficulties. At a Mass Friday in tropical Santa Cruz,
Bolivia, for example, he lamented the region's ``excessive
economic, technological, political and cultural dependence.'' In a
social encyclical issued in March, which he often has cited here,
the pope blamed many of the Third World's problems on the East-West
superpower rivalry.
   Meeting with unemployed miners in the high Andean city of Oruro,
Bolivia, and later addressing a Mass in Santa Cruz, the pope
deplored both the excesses of free-market capitalism and Marxism.
   But he also said in improvised remarks in Santa Cruz that the
key for Latin Americans in resolving East-West, left-right
divisions is found ``here, in your human, social and Christian
realities.''
   Drug trafficking emerged as a major theme as the pope visited
eastern Bolivia, where cocaine barons ship narcotics to consumers
in the United States and Western Europe.
   John Paul, while flying to South America, told reporters it was
unfair to punish only poor South American countries for drug
trading. But he challenged his audiences in Bolivia to take on the
traffickers, declaring that the rampant corruption was destroying
their society.
   The pope insisted that an answer lay in following ethical,
Christian values _ not public and private immorality.

<HEAD>Government Says It Defeated Rebel Offensive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>

   Government troops crushed heavily
armed Eritrean rebels who tried to take a strategic northern town
for the second time in a week, the Ethiopian News Agency said
Saturday.
   The official agency said guerrillas of the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front suffered heavy casualties when they attacked Keren
last Wednesday. It gave no figures and did not mention government
casualties.
   But the rebels claimed Saturday in a clandestine broadcast that
they had put 4,000 soldiers ``out of action'' in a ``heavy
offensive'' in the Keren area. It was not clear whether they were
referring to the same battle.
   There was no way independently to confirm either of the claims.
Ethiopia's government rarely comments on rebel claims and both
sides often exaggerate.
   The Ethiopian News Agency said government troops captured
machine guns, rocket launchers, radio equipment, medicine,
documents and large quantities of ammunition.
   It said a number of houses were destroyed in the battle, but
that normal life had returned to the city 56 miles from Asmara,
capital of Eritrea province.
   Rebels have been entrenched in hills surrounding Keren since
April after a three-month offensive in which they captured several
towns.
   Last Monday, the agency reported soldiers had repulsed another
attack on Keren. It indicated the government has begun a
counteroffensive promised by President Mengistu Haile Mariam on
March 31.
   On that day, Mariam acknoweldged the war for the first time and
said his troops were involved in a ``grim struggle'' against the
Eritrean rebels and the Tigre People's Liberation Front.
   Eritrea and Tigre, Ethiopia's northernmost provinces, are the
worst hit by a drought that threatens the lives of 7 million
people, nearly half of whom are in the war zone.
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in Africa's
longest civil war, and Tigrean rebels took up arms 14 years ago.

   Communist premier Branko Mikulic on
Saturday survived calls for his resignation from Yugoslavia's most
Westernized republics when the parliament rejected their plan to
topple his government.
   In a 75-minute speech to the Federal Assembly, Yugoslavia's
national parliament, Mikulic denounced Slovenia and Croatia, the
two most advanced of Yugoslavia's six republics, for demanding a
vote of no confidence in his administration.
   The parliament then held separate closed debates in its two
chambers, the Federal Chamber and the Chamber of Republics and
Provinces. Each chamber voted against even calling a vote on the
Slovenian and Croatian proposals for a no-confidence motion, the
Tanjug news agency said.
   If Mikulic had been voted out of office, it would have been the
first such vote against a Communist government anywhere in Eastern
Europe.
   Yugoslav television said the Federal Chamber voted 125 to 64 in
a show of hands against a no-confidence motion. The vote in the
other chamber was 64 to 23, Tanjug said.
   The Federal Chamber has a total of 220 delegates, and the other
chamber 88 deputies. Some deputies were apparently absent from
Saturday's session, while five Federal Chamber members abstained.
   Yugoslavia has been grappling with a prolonged economic and
social crisis that has recently prompted calls for a multi-party
system to replace the Communists' current monopoly on power.
   In his speech, Mikulic suggested alternative political systems
could eventually be debated, noting that ``our situation is so
serious that we have no right to put off a debate on the true
reasons which caused it and on its eradication.''
   For the moment, however, he said there is ``no political
alternative to Socialist self-management,'' the system of worker
management bequeathed by Josip Broz Tito and now widely blamed for
some of the nation's economic woes.
   Sixteen percent of the workforce is unemployed and the foreign
debt exceeds $20 billion. Inflation touched almost 200 percent
before the government slapped a six-month freeze on wages and
prices last November.
   The freeze was to be lifted Sunday night, but the government
announced Wednesday it would stay in force at least 10 more days
while Yugoslavia tries to raise an emergency $300 million loan.
   That money is needed to stave off virtual bankruptcy before a
new agreement with the International Monetary Fund takes effect.
   The IMF has worked with Yugoslav officials for more than six
months to devise a package of market-oriented reforms aimed at
reducing inflation to 90 percent while rescheduling payments on $2
billion of debt and extending $1.4 billion in new loans.
   By backing Mikulic, parliament signaled that it supports the
reforms.
   Mikulic said the new measures would be harsh but warned that
``even greater stagflation'' and drastic reductions in real wages
lay ahead if inflation exceeds the target of 90 percent.
   The premier blamed ``the antiquity, lack of flexibility and
inefficiency'' of Yugoslavia's current economic system for the
crisis.
   He outlined the new economic reforms in general terms, saying
they aimed to curb import restrictions, open up competition with
the world market and strengthen the role of the National Bank in
monetary policy.
   Mikulic said he agreed with his critics that Yugoslavia's
situation was grave but he defended his government's two years in
office so far, noting that each of its acts had been approved by
the national parliament and republican assemblies.
   Several Slovenian and Croatian deputies argued against this in
what Tanjug termed ``an occasionally very sharp and polemical
debate.''
   Joze Marolt, a Slovene delegate, recalled that in July 1986
Mikulic submitted what was then called an emergency economic
package and warned that Yugoslavia stood before an abyss.
   ``Today, we are not just in front of the abyss, we are in it,''
Marolt said, according to Tanjug.

<BYLINE>By HARRY DUNPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand dissolved the
National Assembly on Saturday and announced that parliamentary
elections will be held June 5 and June 12.
   Mitterrand made the announcement in a nationwide television
address.
   Mitterrand said he made the decision after his new premier,
Michel Rocard, informed him ``that despite his efforts, he did not
believe he could bring together a solid and stable majority that
all governments need to carry out their programs well.''
   Rocard said Friday he had sought support from centrists in the
577-seat Assembly for his government and received a negative
response.
   In his three-minute address, Mitterrand deplored the fact that
``the opening (to the center) that I sought could not be brought
about to the extent that I wished. Therefore, it was my duty to
draw the appropriate conclusions. A few seconds ago I signed a
decree dissolving the National Assembly.''
   He said the two-round election would be held on the first and
second Sundays of June.
   Mitterrand was re-elected to a second term May 8 and appointed
Rocard his premier after conservative Premier Jacques Chirac, who
had run against Mitterrand for president, resigned.
   According to an opinion poll to be published Sunday in the
Journal du Dimanche, 47 percent of the French favored dissolution
of the Assembly, while 28 percent opposed dissolution.
   The poll indicated that the Socialists, the largest party in
France, would get 41 percent of the vote, 24 percent would go to
the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic, and 15 percent would go to
the center-right Union for French Democracy.
   The rest of the vote would go to minor parties on the left and
the right, the poll indicated. Nearly 20 percent of those polled
said they would not vote.
   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a prominent
center-right leader, told Mitterrand earlier he should convene the
Assembly before deciding on dissolution.
   Giscard said in a letter to Mitterrand the action should come
``after a serious discussion on what is possible and what is not.''
   He said he opposed dissolution for two reasons.
   ``The French now will have to vote five times in 15 months'' in
various elections, which Giscard described as ``great waste of time
and energy.''
   He also said that the central problem facing the country was how
to get the left and the right to work together.
   ``How can we achieve this if the first decision, before any
attempt to work together, is to send the two camps face to face
against each other in every electoral district in France.''
   Mitterrand acted six days after winning a second-seven year term
with 54 percent of the vote. He also dissolved the Assembly after
winning his first term in 1981 and was rewarded with a victory by
the Socialists in the legislative elections that followed.
   The last dissolution before that was pronounced by Charles de
Gaulle on May 30, 1968 after the student uprising in Paris.

   Scientists, educators and other
intellectuals Saturday formed communist Hungary's first new trade
union in 40 years.
   It was not known whether the Democratic Union of Scientific
Workers would be independent of the government-approved union
structure, said a participant who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``You certainly cannot compare the (union) with the Polish trade
union Solidarity, because it is a non-political organization,'' he
said. Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent union
federation, was banned in 1981.
   The participant said about 400 people attended the founding
session and elected a 59-member steering committee.
   The meeting was to take place at the Science Faculty of
Budapest's Eoetvoes Lorand University, but it had to be shifted to
the Metro Club, a cultural club, because the university rector
withdrew an earlier permit granted by the dean.
   The new union includes representatives of natural, social and
technical sciences, higher education and research institutes. Other
members include laboratory assistants and unemployed researchers.
interests were ignored by the official public employees' union.
Spokesmen said it would fight to improve members' working
conditions, increase funds for research and reduce layoffs.
   ``They intend to campaign for a science policy that consistently
upholds their common interests and for eliminating restrictions
hindering science and education,'' government radio said.
   Participants at the meeting voted to maintain contact with the
official Central Council of Trade Unions. Steering committee member
Csaba Oeri said the union ``is part of the existing Hungarian trade
union movement.''
   But he did not say whether the new union would join the council.
Two council members attended the session but did not address it.
   Gyoergy Kerekes, another steering committee member, said council
president Sandor Gaspar told him it was not hostile to such
initiatives but did not want the meeting to take place.
   Other prominent steering committee members include sociologist
Elemer Hankiss, Julia Szalai, a sociologist and mathematician,
Peter Hanak, one of Hungary's best known historians and Eva Ancsel,
a philosopher and member of the Academy of Sciences.

   Admiral Sergei Gorshkov, the man credited with
turning the Soviet Union into a modern naval power, has died, the
Soviet news agency Tass said Saturday. He was 78.
   Gorshkov, who was replaced in December 1985 by Vladimir N.
Chernavin, died Friday following a ``severe and prolonged
illness,'' Tass said. It did not specify the cause of death.
   In his 29 years as naval commander, Gorshkov ``showed a talent
of organization and deep knowledge of the naval science,'' Tass
said, quoting an obituary signed by the Central Committee of the
Communist Party, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Soviet
Council of Ministers.
   ``Gorshkov had a feeling for the new and showed creative
approaches in his work, and in a combat situation he displayed
courage, will and fortitude,'' it said.
   It credited Gorshkov with making a ``big contribution to the
development of the Soviet navy.''
   A Western military attache said at the time of Gorshkov's
retirement that he had been ``an extraordinary naval officer of our
time.''
   The admiral was appointed to head the Soviet navy in 1956 by
Nikita S. Khrushchev, who considered Josef V. Stalin's emphasis on
large surface vessels to be impractical because of their
vulnerability to rocket attacks.
   In a book titled ``Sea Power of the State,'' Gorshkov said the
Soviet navy's development of a fleet of submarines and
missile-launching warships had frustrated ``illusory hopes of
imperialist aggressors that in the sphere of armed conflict at sea
they would have no strong opponent.''
   He also argued that nuclear modernization was as important as
the initial acquisition of nuclear weapons to end the
``unreachability of the American continent.''

<TEXT>
   The government said Saturday
it has threatened to pull out of peace talks with Angola unless the
Angolans' Cuban allies halt a military advance in the war zone.
   South African officials also said Angola should close training
camps of the African National Congress, the main guerrilla group
fighting white-minority rule in South Africa.
   South African and Angolan officials met Friday in Brazzaville,
Congo, and discussed how to resolve Angola's 13-year civil war and
end South African rule over South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia.
   Both sides said the talks produced progress and would lead to
further meetings soon involving the United States and Cuba. All
four countries participated in the initial round of talks May 3-4
in London.
   The South Africa Broadcasting Corp., which adheres closely to
government positions, said that before the talks can resume, Angola
``will have to give assurances that the present southward advance
of the Cuban forces in Angola will be halted.''
   It said Angolan negotiators were told that South Africa ``was
fully informed about the Cuban advance, which apparently was under
the direct command of President Fidel Castro.''
   An estimated 40,000 Cuban troops are in Angola supporting the
Marxist government against the pro-Western Union for the Total
Independence of Angola and its South African allies. Most of the
fighting is in southern Angola.
   The South African Press Association quoted South African
officials as saying the South African delegates ``feared a Cuban
ploy to have a last hard strike in order to make their subsequent
withdrawal diplomatically more palatable.''
   Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha, who led the South African
delegation, ``apparently stressed that if this was the intention
... Angola would pay a heavy price and the Cubans would be severely
punished,'' the press association reported.
   In Lisbon, Portugal, the independent weekly Expresso Saturday
quoted unidentified sources as saying 8,600 Cuban soldiers landed
in Angola by plane and ship in a two-week period at the end of
April and the beginning of May.
   The report said the reinforcements included 2,000 elite Cuban
soldiers known as rangers, a force that previously has not sent
troops to Angola, and 200 helicopter pilots.
   Expresso said the Cubans landed in the Angolan capital, Luanda,
and five other towns without the knowledge or approval of Angolan
authorities, including President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.

   A bomb Saturday ripped through a truck
parked near reviewing stands to be used for ceremonies marking the
withdrawal of Soviet troops. Eleven Afghans, including a baby, were
killed.
   Residents said three rockets later hit a village on the
outskirts of Kabul, killing four people and wounding four others.
The official Soviet news agency Tass put the death toll at three.
   Tass, monitored in Moscow, blamed both attacks on Afghan
guerrillas and said one of those responsible for the 5:45 a.m.
truck attack was arrested.
   Soviet Communist Party Central Committee official Vladimir
Sevruk reported that 11 people were killed and 12 injured in the
explosion.
   The blast killed a baby and an 11-year-old girl, and all the
casualties were Afghan civilians, according to a Western
photographer on the scene.
   Most appeared to have been occupants of nearby homes destroyed
by the impact of the explosion, he said.
   ``When the bomb exploded some of the houses nearby just
collapsed,'' said the photographer.
   The blast was so great that it shattered the windows of a bus
depot across the river, 300 yards away and left a crater 20 feet
wide and 10 feet deep.
   Soviet troops arrived afterward, the photographer said by
telephone.
   The blast demolished embankment walls on both sides of the river
that threads through this ancient capital.
   Blood was visible on the gates of a nearby factory and personal
belongings, including carpet slippers, were scattered in the street.
   The bomb had been planted in a large truck that lay badly
mangled at the scene.
   Last month, six people were killed and 49 wounded in another
bomb blast along the river on the 10th anniversary of the April
1978 revolution that brought a Marxist government to power in
Afghanistan and triggered widespread insurrection.
   Tass said the rockets Saturday hit the village of Chamane
Baraqi, killing an old man and two children. Residents said one
rocket hit a hut, killing two children inside and that an elderly
man and another child were killed by debris. The village is located
about a half-mile from the British Embassy.
   At a news conference for foreign journalists who gathered for
the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal, Afghan President Najib said
his government will survive because it offers peace. He added that
he will address the U.N. Special Session on Disarmament in New York
next month and planned trips to Czechoslovakia and Cuba.
   ``We can state confidently that we will last because we strive
and struggle for peace,'' he said. ``Our opponents offer the Afghan
people war, and the people hate this.''
   Also at a news conference Saturday, the head of the Soviet
military contingent in Afghanistan said the anti-Communist rebels
were taking their toll on the Soviet and Afghan troops but that
rebel attacks will not deter the withdrawal, which begins Sunday.
   ``The opposition may have some effect on us, but not much, and
certainly they will not be able to frustrate the timetable,'' Lt.
Gen. Boris Gromov told reporters. ``We have the means at our
disposal to fulfill the timetable.''
   The comments by Gromov and Najib and the report of the rocket
attack were carried in a Reuters news agency pool report from
Kabul. The Associated Press was excluded from the pool because of
questions it asked Afghan President Najib last month.
   Under an accord signed in Geneva on April 14, the Soviets will
complete their withdrawal within nine months. Half of the Soviets
must be out by Aug. 15, according to the peace agreement.
   Soviet soldiers entered the war in December 1979 to help the
allied government fight off the insurgents, and about 115,000
remain here to back forces loyal to President Najib.

officials as saying the South African delegates ``feared a Cuban
ploy to have a last hard strike in order to make their subsequent
withdrawal diplomatically more palatable.''
   Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha, who led the South African
delegation, ``apparently stressed that if this was the intention
... Angola would pay a heavy price and the Cubans would be severely
punished,'' the press association reported.
   In Lisbon, Portugal, the independent weekly Expresso Saturday
quoted unidentified sources as saying 8,600 Cuban soldiers landed
in Angola by plane and ship in a two-week period at the end of
April and the beginning of May.
   The report said the reinforcements included 2,000 elite Cuban
soldiers known as rangers, a force that previously has not sent
troops to Angola, and 200 helicopter pilots.
   Expresso said the Cubans landed in the Angolan capital, Luanda,
and five other towns without the knowledge or approval of Angolan
authorities, including President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.

<HEAD>Sharansky Recalls Joke On KGB In New Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky recalls in a
new book how he forced KGB agents out of his building and into the
cold in Moscow in 1974 by threatening to call the police.
   It is one of the lighter moments in Sharansky's book, ``Fear No
Evil,'' excerpted in the May 23 issue of U.S. News & World Report.
   In the years before his arrest in 1977 on suspicion of passing
secrets to the CIA, Sharansky was a prominent dissident who had
been repeatedly refused permission to emigrate from the Soviet
Union.
   He was often followed by the KGB and says he sometimes found
them a source of amusement. He says ``the most fun'' he had at the
KGB's expense was on Nov. 7, 1974, a Soviet holiday, when Sharansky
had been assigned to work at the Institute for Oil and Gas to take
care of emergencies.
   ``Three tails followed me to work, but because no outsiders were
allowed in our building, they had to remain in the car. A little
later, the security guard called from downstairs to report that a
group of men had come into the lobby to warm up,'' Sharansky said.
   He called the KGB, identified himself and said he was in charge
of the building that day.
   ``Downstairs in the lobby are three KGB men who are following
citizen Sharansky ... did you give them permission to enter?''
There was a long pause, Sharansky said, and the voice asked his
identity.
   ``Sharansky,'' he replied.
   ``You're making fun of us. It's only noon and you're already
drunk!'' the voice said, and hung up.
   Sharansky said he called the building security guard and ordered
him to tell the three men he had spoken to their boss who didn't
approve of their being in the building.
   ``If they don't leave ... I'll notify the police,'' Sharansky
said.
   He said he walked to the window later and saw they were back in
the car.
   ``I always treasured that moment, that wonderful feeling of
having the KGB obey me,'' he writes.
   Sharansky was convicted by a Soviet court in 1978 of being a
spy. He was freed in February 1986 in an East-West prisoner
exchange and joined his wife in Israel.
   The magazine is scheduled to publish additional excerpts in next
week's issue, in which Sharansky details his 90 months in Soviet
prisons and a labor camp.

<HEAD>Thieves Steal Shrubs from Charleston Gardens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents are blaming a different kind
of garden grub for nipping their spring in the bud.
   Devious defoliators have been stalking the gardens of this city
by night to steal shrubs and trees.
   ``It's just so awful,'' said Barbara Schaeufele, who had five
rhododendrons stolen from her yard on Mother's Day.
   ``I waited four years to get them. You could just croak.''
   ``A person has to be pretty low to steal someone's shrubbery,''
said a residential developer who lost 10 freshly planted dogwood
trees. The trees, worth $150 each, were uprooted on May 2 from a
neighborhood dotted with homes worth about $300,000 to $500,000.
   Burglars also snatched six shrubs from the city's posh South
Hills district on April 21, police said.
   In Spencer, about 35 miles northeast of Charleston, police
arrested a man late last month who allegedly held an elderly man at
gunpoint while two others stole a month-old $385 garden tiller.
   State Police Cpl. R.J. Strobbe said the tiller was taken to
Charleston and sold.
   Charleston residents who have had their plants pilfered believe
they are being sold on the green market also.
   Audra Cooper, Barbara Schaeufeles' neighbor, said her 2-year-old
rhododendron was preparing to bloom when it was stolen on Mother's
Day.
   ``I never heard of them just walking into the yard and digging
up a plant,'' Cooper said. ``I know several other people down the
street lost shrubs, too.''
   The wave of thefts has surprised residents in some of the city's
finer areas, where crime is relatively rare, but police say there
is not much they can do.
   ``It's a crime of opportunity,'' said Sgt. Dallas Staples,
adding that plant larcenies crop up every spring.
   ``It's kind of hard to do anything,'' Staples said. ``Where do
you begin? How do you put identification on a plant?''

<TEXT>
   Relatives and friends of the
37 sailors who died when the USS Stark was hit by two missiles in
the Persian Gulf will gather here on the first anniversary of the
attack to remember their fallen loved ones.
   A ceremony is scheduled for Tuesday at the Stark Memorial,
located on the dock where the Stark departed in February 1987 for
the routine deployment, and where the burned-out guided missile
frigate returned six months later to a subdued heroes' welcome.
   More than 140 relatives and friends of those lost in the attack
are expected to attend the service.
   ``Our chapel keeps them regularly in our prayers and they are a
regular part of our prayer life,'' said Navy Chaplain Bill Perry,
who will conduct the ceremonies. ``We still hold these families in
our prayers and thoughts.''
   This Navy community was shattered last May 17 when two missiles
fired by an Iraqi warplane slammed into the Stark. Iraq said later
the attack was an accident.
   The reason for gathering on the first anniversary is written
right on the memorial, Perry said. ``You will not be forgotten!'',
it reads.
   ``That's the whole reason for getting together on the 17th,''
Perry said.
   Following a dockside ceremony, family members will board a
sister ship of the Stark for a wreath-laying ceremony in the
Atlantic.
   The USS Stark itself is still undergoing repairs in a
Pascagoula, Miss., shipyard. It is expected to return to Mayport in
August.
   Perry said families of those who survived the attack also have
been invited.
   ``The trauma of that week is theirs,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The luxury yacht Monkey Business, which
ferried former presidential candidate Gary Hart to the Bahamas with
model Donna Rice, was seized Saturday when U.S. Coast Guard
officers found marijuana on it, officials said.
   ``They found one gram of marijuana, that's one-twenty-eighth of
an ounce. According to `Zero Tolerance,' if we find enough to test
positive it's enough to seize the vesssel,'' said Petty Officer Dan
Vogeley.
   The 82-foot yacht was boarded during a routine safety check
about 22 miles northwest of the Bahamian island of Bimini, and a
member of the boarding party spotted rolling papers used to make
marijuana cigarettes.
   ``We consider that probable cause,'' said Vogely. A search
uncovered a single joint of marijuana in the pocket of a jacket
hanging in a closet; the cutter Cape Shoalwater then escorted the
yacht to the Coast Guard base here.
   During a dockside search, Coast Guard Lt. Jim McCauley said his
men found an additional 8 grams of marijuana in another garment
hanging in a closet.
   The four people on board, whose names were not released, have
not been arrested because the marijuana has not been linked to
anybody, Vogeley said.
   Vogeley said the yacht, worth at least $1 million, is currently
registered to Turnberry Isle Marina, and the four crewmembers were
wearing Turnberry Isle t-shirts.
   When Hart, his friend William Broadhurst, Ms. Rice and her
friend Lynn Armandt took their trip in March 1987 to Bimini, about
55 miles east of Miami, the chartered yacht was owned by
millionaire developer Donald Soffer and kept at Turnberry Isle in
North Miami Beach.
   Soffer has an unlisted number; a woman who answered the phone at
Turnberry Isle said the club would have no comment.
   Hart withdrew from the race for the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination on May 8, 1987, only weeks after he had announced his
candidacy, when The Miami Herald revealed his liaison with Ms. Rice.
   Hart, who also had Ms. Rice as a weekend guest at his home in
Washington, maintained that the relationship and the trip to Bimini
were innocent. He eventually re-entered the race, but did not do
well and finally withdrew again.
   The multidecked, aluminum-hulled motor yacht with a hot tub and
a bar adorned with an Oriental rug has a flashy history beyond
presidential politics.
   Celebrities who have visited the Monkey Business'
rosewood-paneled staterooms include Elizabeth Taylor, Jack
Nicholson, Lucille Ball, Elton John, Julio Iglesias and James Caan.
   Zero Tolerance is the Reagan administration's new get-tough
policy under which any drug conveyance can be confiscated and may
be auctioned off after a hearing. The quantity of drugs does not
matter.
   For example, the $2.5 million, 133-foot Ark Royal was
confiscated off Key West on May 7 when less than a teaspoon of
marijuana was found aboard.
   The yacht was returned last week after Michael Rogerson,
president of the California-based company that owns the boat, paid
a $1,600 fine.
   The Zero Tolerance policy was announced in Miami two weeks ago
by Transportation Secretary James Burnley. It has been in effect
since April 11.

   A school bus driver apparently was chasing two
youngsters who had thrown rocks at her bus when it collided with a
truck, killing one man and injuring at least nine children,
witnesses said.
   Many of the children aboard the bus said driver Patsy Windom,
34, was chasing two youths who fled in a car after throwing rocks
at the bus. The bus ignored a yield sign just before colliding with
the truck, witnesses said.
   Arthur Moreno, 24, driver of the truck, was crushed when the bus
rolled over and came to rest atop the truck. The truck was knocked
about 30 feet by the impact, tearing a fire hydrant out of the
ground.
   Nine-month-old David Lawrence Moreno, Moreno's son and only
passenger, was pulled from the mangled truck with minor injuries,
saved by his child-safety seat.
   Ms. Windom, a bus driver for 12 years, and eight children were
taken to hospitals, all with relatively minor injuries, Emergency
Medical Services Director Paul Pepe said.
   Police investigator W.T. Johnson said officers have talked to a
woman who was driving the car in which the two youths drove away
after the rock-throwing incident. The woman said the youths had
been throwing rocks at each other and one hit the bus, he said.
   The officer said investigators had not yet talked to the
youngsters or the bus driver, and no charges were filed.

<HEAD>Patricia Hearst Presents Film About Her Kidnapping at Cannes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FIONA GLEIZES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patty Hearst was the center of attention
Saturday at the Cannes Film Festival, where a film directed by Paul
Schrader told the story of her 1974 kidnapping by an urban
terrorist group.
   ``I've not completely lost the feeling of anger and I doubt if I
ever will,'' Ms. Hearst said at a news conference. ``But I don't
carry this through my whole life.''
   The film ``Patty Hearst'' recounts how the granddaughter of
newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst was kidnapped by the
Symbionese Liberation Army in San Francisco.
   She was blindfolded, held prisoner in a cupboard for 57 days and
subjected to revolutionary re-education. Renamed Tania, she took
part in an armed bank robbery and stayed with the SLA for 18 months
before the FBI arrested her in 1975.
   The film covers the five years from the kidnapping to February
1979, when President Carter granted her a pardon from her
seven-year prison sentence.
   Ms. Hearst said she felt no personal responsibility for the
criminal act she committed.
   ``Nothing would have happened if the kidnapping had not taken
place,'' she said.
   Ms. Hearst said she had read the screenplay that was based on
her own account of the affair, ``My Voyage in Hell,'' published in
1978.
   She said she been asked for her comments while the film was
being made, but she stayed away from the production ``because it
may have been uncomfortable for personal reasons.''
   Ms. Hearst was pleased with the film when she saw it.
   ``I was afraid it would be sex, guns and rock 'n roll but it
wasn't,'' she said.
   Schrader, who also has directed ``Hardcore'' and ``American
Gigolo,'' said he saw the events from Ms. Hearst's point of view.
   ``The film portrays the visions and sentiments of Patty,'' he
said. ``It was never intended to be a sociological film or a
comment on the times, but rather the view of a 19-year-old girl who
had led a sheltered life.''
   Her character was played by British actress Natasha Richardson,
the daughter of actress Vanessa Redgrave.
   ``Miss Hearst was never acting of her own volition. She was a
person acted on,'' Schrader said. ``It was difficult dramatically
to have a passive protagonist.''
   Ms. Hearst now lives quietly with husband Bernard Shaw, her
former bodyguard, and their two daughters Lydia, 3, and Gillian, 6.

<HEAD>Major Railroads Sue Minnesota Over New Occupied Caboose Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten major railroads are suing Minnesota
to challenge a new state law requiring an occupied caboose on
freight trains of a certain length carrying hazardous materials.
   The suit, filed Friday in federal court, contends that the law,
which goes into effect Aug. 1, is pre-empted by Federal Railroad
Administration regulations that allow freight trains to operate in
interstate commerce without occupied cabooses.
   The railroads also say federal law governing the efficient
interstate transportation of hazardous materials pre-empts the
caboose law.
   They say the new law discriminates against interstate
transportation because it exempts certain local runs carrying such
commodities as grain.
   Among the railroads seeking to have the federal court void the
state law are Burlington Northern, the Soo Line, Chicago & North
Western and the Duluth, Missabe & Iron Range Railway.
   Minnesota's new law states that trains more than 2,000 feet long
that have cars marked as carrying hazardous materials must have a
caboose at the end of the train and it must be occupied by at least
one train crew member.
   Violations of the law would permit the state attorney general's
office or a county sheriff to seek a civil penalty against the
offending railroad.
   The stated purpose of the law, which was pushed by railroad
labor unions, was to promote rail safety by helping to spot
equipment failure or problems with track beds. But opponents said
it was merely an attempt by the railroad unions to preserve jobs no
longer needed.
   ``A caboose is just no longer needed,'' Al Wiegold, spokesman
for Burlington Northern Railroad, said Saturday. He said there are
computerized trackside monitors that indicate problems.
   Money also is a factor in dropping the caboose, Wiegold said.
``It's costly to keep those cabooses on there.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of tank-led Syrian troops
rolled down from Lebanon's central mountains Saturday and prepared
to enter the slums of south Beirut, where Western hostages are
believed held by pro-Iranian extremists.
   By nightfall more than 4,000 soldiers and 250 tanks and armored
personnel carriers were deployed at the edge of the 16-square-mile
slum area, buttressing 7,500 Syrian troops already in west Beirut,
military sources said.
   ``The buildup is expected to be completed sometime Sunday,
perhaps at daybreak or a little later, after which the forces will
move in,'' one source said on condition of anonymity.
   The guns fell silent in the embattled slums when the Syrians
arrived, police said.
   The move followed the conquest of the slums by fundamentalist
fighters of the Iranian-allied Hezbollah, or Party of God, in nine
days of savage fighting with the pro-Syrian Amal Shiite Moslem
militia. Police said 211 people were killed.
   Police estimate Hezbollah has 3,000 combatants fighting Amal,
which has thrown about 6,500 militiamen into the battle.
   The vanguard of the incoming Syrian forces Saturday rumbled
across south Beirut's Ouzai coastal highway at 5 p.m. in 48 T-55
Soviet-made tanks with gunners atop their swinging turrets.
   They were led by Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's military
intelligence chief in Lebanon, and Maj. Gen. Saeed Beirakdar,
commander in chief of the Syrian forces in Lebanon.
   They headed the battalion in a chauffeured, bulletproof, dark
blue Mercedes. Truckloads of infantrymen and ammunition and jeeps
mounted with 106mm recoilless guns streamed in afterwards.
   Hundreds of plainclothes Syrian secret servicemen at all
gateways to the slums blocked reporters and photographers from
entering.
   Kenaan and Beirakdar, flanked by senior aides, met for an hour
with Amal's chieftain Nabih Berri, who is also Lebanon's justice
minister, at his heavily fortified house in west Beirut Saturday
night.
   ``They have agreed that the Syrians will go into the slums but
not into the nearby Palestinian refugee camps'' where rival
factions also have been fighting, a Berri spokesman said later on
condition of anonymity.
   A high-ranking Lebanese military source, also speaking
privately, said the Syrian reinforcements were ``going to move in
peacefully under an agreement being worked out by the presidents of
Iran and Syria.''
   The reinforcements were coming from the Bekaa Valley, where
Syria maintains the bulk of 25,000 troops stationed in eastern and
northern Lebanon, the source said.
   The move came on the heels of a Syrian threat of ``immediate and
drastic treatment'' after Hezbollah's forces stormed through the
last Amal stronghold.
   ``After advancing across half of Shiyah, Hezbollah now controls
90 percent of south Beirut,'' reported a police spokesman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police said 20 people were killed and 41 injured Saturday in the
house-to-house inter-Shiite Moslem combat and other factional
clashes in south Beirut. The latest casualties raised the toll in
area fighting to 211 killed and 586 wounded since May 6.
   The thud of exploding shells echoed across west Beirut as
Hezbollah militiamen advanced across Shiyah and Amal fighters
withdrew toward Syrian lines in west Beirut.
   As Hezbollah and Amal dueled in Shiyah, rival Palestinian
guerrilla factions battled with howitzers and mortars for control
of the nearby Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp.
   At the refugee shantytown, seven people were killed and 16
wounded in clashes that broke out early Saturday between guerrillas
of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah
faction and Col. Saeed Mousa's Syrian-backed Fatah-Uprising, police
said.
   The south Beirut slums are where most of the 18 foreign
hostages, including nine Americans, are believed held by kidnappers
affiliated with Hezbollah.
   The Beirut-based magazine Ash-Shiraa said Friday the hostages
had been moved from an exposed Hezbollah barracks to the home of
Hezbollah's spokesman Sheik Ibrahim Amin to prevent their
liberation.
   Ash-Shiraa broke the story of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in
November 1986.
   Hezbollah said in a statement Saturday it had also occupied
Amal's military headquarters on the Beirut airport highway in a
fierce overnight assault.
   Helmeted Syrian troops manned checkpoints along all roads
connecting south Beirut with the city's western sector, police
said. The Syrian move was aimed at preventing the Amal-Hezbollah
confrontation from spreading to Syria's sphere of influence in west
Beirut, they said.
   South Beirut remains outside the jurisdiction of the Syrian
contingent that deployed in west Beirut in February 1987 after a
month of bloody clashes between Amal and Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 25,000 troops
in the Bekaa and in north Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Syrian troops Friday shot and killed five Hezbollah fighters who
tried to cross into the Syrian-policed Ouzai seaside district. It
was the first clash between the two groups in south Beirut.

<HEAD>13 Couples Get Married In Stadium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SOLOMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attracted by the slogan, ``We'll provide
the diamond if you provide the bride,'' 13 couples married Saturday
at home plate before a minor league baseball game.
   The couples came from neighboring Illinois to avoid the expense
or bother of an AIDS test, which has been mandatory in their home
state since Jan. 1.
   Players from the Kenosha Twins and the Rockford (Ill.) Expos
lined paths at Simmons Field that led the brides and grooms to a
portable chapel at home plate.
   ``This is to be entered into seriously, honorably, advisably
and, in this case, with good sportsmanship,'' Kenosha County Court
Commissioner Jon Mason said to open the ceremony.
   Some brides wore traditional wedding gowns while others were
dressed in more casual attire. One groom wore a black top hat and
tuxedo, and next to him stood another prospective husband wearing
an open collar shirt and slacks.
   ``We did not want to spend $200 or $300 to get a marriage
license,'' Jane Smith of Park Forest, Ill., said after she married
Floyd Claiborne Jr. of Richton Park, Ill.
   ``We looked at Indiana and Wisconsin before, and then this came
up, and it was just perfect,'' she said.
   Smith's bridesmaid, Gwendlyn Kirkland, said the ceremony was
perfect for non-traditional and ``economic minded couples.''
   Kenosha charges $50 for a wedding license but does not require
any test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Illinois charges
$15 for a license, but it also requires a blood test for AIDS and
syphilis, which can cost between $20 and $120 a person, depending
on the laboratory.
   Bob Lee, general manager of the Kenosha Twins, said he thought
of the mass wedding after watching county clerk Nancy Principe
discuss on a news show the sudden rush of Illinois couples applying
for Wisconsin marriage licenses.
   ``If you look at baseball, it's a tradition. And marriage, well
it's a tradition also, so it makes sense to have it here,'' Lee
said. ``I'm sure these wedding couples will remember this for a
long time to come.''
   Andy Harter, an infielder for the Twins, said the ceremony was
enjoyable, ``but I think we're all wondering who would get married
on a baseball diamond. Maybe the real question isn't whether `I
do,' but `Why here?'''
   Team officials said 14 couples registered for the wedding, and
all but one showed up. The missing couple was from Wisconsin.
   The couples ranged in age from early 20s to late 50s.
   Corinne Kozak, 47, and Norman Dennis, 56, both of Arlington
Heights, Ill., said the wedding ceremony was the first time they
had ever been on a baseball field.

   Ousted Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham was
elected Saturday as a GOP national delegate as the state Republican
Party held its first convention since his removal from office.
   Mecham won on his second attempt to win a seat to the party's
national convention, trying first without success to be picked from
his own congressional district and then as a delegate at large. He
was not claimed by any presidential candidate.
   His stormy, 15-month governorship tore the state GOP, and former
Sen. Barry Goldwater, in a keynote address greeted by several
standing ovations, urged Republicans to try to ``heal the wounds.''
   ``If we keep picking away at each other ... the state's going to
become a one-party state again,'' Goldwater added.
   He urged members to settle their differences at election time
and ``let bygones be bygones or at least be patient and wait until
election time to make corrections that you feel may be needed.''
   ``I have done very little work,'' Mecham said when asked to
assess his chances before the balloting. ``If I win, it'll be
because people decide I should go. It's not a big thing.''
   Mecham, who was removed as governor by a Senate court of
impeachment last month, is facing criminal charges in Maricopa
County Superior Court next Thursday.
   The thought of Mecham going to the Republican National
Convention as one of Arizona's 33 delegates drew open disdain from
other politicians in the state.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had said he would be ``inclined not
to attend'' the national convention if Mecham were a delegate.
   On Saturday, however, McCain said he was certain he would attend
whether or not Mecham was a delegate.
   ``I am sure we will want to do that. I never changed my mind. I
said that I was thinking long and hard about it _ I never said that
I wasn't going,'' McCain said.
   Vice President George Bush has won enough delegates nationwide
to be clinch the nomination in New Orleans and was expected to
control the state convention as well after receiving majorities in
24 of 37 pre-convention caucuses and tying with former television
evangelist Pat Robertson in one.
   Mecham, one of the 717 delegates to Saturday's convention, said
before the voting started that he believed he had ``strong
support'' from rank-and-file party workers.
   He said Saturday he would support Bush and would concentrate on
who Bush's running mate would be.
   Officials of the Bush and Robertson campaigns said Mecham would
not be on their list of recommended delegates, but Robertson's
campaign said its recommended slate would stop at 32 to enable
Mecham backers to fill in his name as the 33rd delegate if they
wished.
   Mecham, who faces criminal trial next Thursday on charges he
failed to report properly a $350,000 campaign loan, was removed
from office last month after the Republican-controlled Senate
convicted him in a civil proceeding of misusing state money and
obstructing an investigation into allegations that a campaign aide
threatened the life of a former aide.

<HEAD>Laos Waiting For Aid Before Continuing MIA Search
^By DENIS D. GRAY
^Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should give Laos
humanitarian aid if it wants the country to account for Americans
missing in the Indochina war, a senior government official said
Saturday.
   ``We have fulfilled our obligation with the excavation,'' said
Vice Foreign Minister Soubanh Srithirath. ``We are awaiting the
humanitarian gesture from the U.S.A.''
   Soubanh was referring to a joint excavation in southern
Savannakhet province for the remnants of a U.S. aircraft shot down
in 1966 with two crewmen aboard. U.S. and Laotian soldiers
completed the dig Wednesday but found no remains.
   Soubanh spoke in an interview with a group of Western reporters
taken on a rare tour of Laos, a largely isolated nation ruled by a
communist government since December 1975.
   The United States is trying to account for 555 Americans missing
in action in Laos, many of them airmen downed during missions
against Laotian and Vietnamese communist positions.
   Under an agreement in August last year, Laos ended a long period
of inactivity on the MIA issue while the United States said it will
consider Vientiane's calls for humanitarian aid.
   That was virtually identical to an agreement with Vietnam, Laos'
close ally where nearly 1,800 Americans are reported missing.
Vietnamese officials recently have been demanding that America
honor its pledge of humanitarian assistance.
   The United States has given Laos some food aid in recent years.
After the Savannakhet dig, the U.S. team donated medicine and
equipment worth about $13,000 to a local hospital as an expression
of America's concern, said Ross Petzing, spokesman for the U.S.
Embassy in Bangkok.
   Soubanh suggested the United States give more medical aid,
including construction of a hospital in Savannakhet.
   In another development, Soubanh said Vietnam has withdrawn a
significant number of its troops from Laos, where he says they have
been helping with national security and economic development for
more than a decade.
   Soubanh declined to give numbers but said the pullout began in
mid-1987. The troops returned home because Laos' relations with
China have improved and the Laotian government's own military
forces were adequate, he said.
   ``We feel that our security is less threatened,'' he said.
   Some Western diplomatic sources in Vientiane speculate that less
than half the estimated 50,000 Vietnamese troops have left. Others
say they believe more than 40,000 have pulled out.
   Vietnam formally stations troops in Laos under a 25-year
friendship treaty signed in 1977. But most Western sources believe
some of the Vietnamese forces that helped the Laotian communists
battle the U.S.-backed regime in Vientiane remained in Laos after
the communists took power in 1975.

   Sunny skies heated much of the Mississippi Valley into the 90s
Saturday while scattered showers hit parts of the southern Atlantic
Coast, the southern Appalachians and the central Plains.
   A low pressure system centered over south central Canada drew
warm air well up the Mississippi Valley, bringing record-setting
90-degree weather as far north as Iowa.
   Des Moines, Iowa, set a record high for the date of 93. Other
records included 89 degrees at Kansas City, Mo., 91 at Memphis,
Tenn., and 92 at Baton Rouge, La.
   Thunderstorms rumbled over coastal areas of Georgia and the
Carolinas and the southern Appalachians from eastern Tennessee and
western North Carolina to West Virginia, bringing scattered rain.
   A few thunderstorms also hit eastern Wisconsin and south central
Minnesota and there were scattered showers from the Texas Panhandle
into the central Plains.
   There were no reports of significant rainfall, defined as
one-half inch or more, in the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Sunny skies prevailed in most other parts with temperatures in
the 70s and 80s over Florida and much of the California coast, and
in the upper 50s and 60s in the Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes,
Pennsylvania, New York and New England.
   Temperatures ranged from the 90s to 105 in the Southwest's
deserts, down from peaks of around 110 in the past few days.
   Scattered showers were forecast Sunday for the coast of the
Carolinas, the Great Lakes and the eastern portion of the upper
Mississippi Valley. Cloudy skies were predicted for the Oregon
coast and sunny skies were expected to prevail over much of the
rest of the nation.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 60s over upper Michigan, much
of Minnesota and North Dakota, and from the Idaho Panhandle to the
northern Washington coast. Highs were predicted to be near 90 in
eastern Texas, in the 90s in western Texas, and from the 90s to
near 110 degrees in the desert Southwest.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 70s and 80s over most of the
rest of the nation.

   A gunman shot two female campers, one
fatally, in a desolate area near the Appalachian trail, state
police said Saturday.
   Rebecca Wight, 29, of Blackburg, Va., was killed Friday night at
a remote camping site and Claudia Brenner, 31, of Ithaca, N.Y., was
shot once in the face, state police dispatcher Clifford Whitmoyer
said.
   Whitmoyer said the women were hikers on the Appalachian trail
and had set up camp in the Michaux State Forest. He said the man
appeared at the site, pointed a gun at the women and shot and
killed Ms. Wight. Investigators had not determined a motive, he
said.
   Ms. Brenner, though wounded, made her way to Hershey Medical
Center, where nursing manager Kathy Cerullo-Frick said no
information was available Saturday on her condition.

<HEAD>Jackson Calls for Ocean Sanctuary to Stop Oil Drilling off
California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MENDOCINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson pledged Saturday that if
elected president he would ``end for all times'' plans for
exploratory offshore oil drilling along California's picturesque
North Coast.
   ``This plan to drill for oil, pollute the ocean, and dirty the
air is environmental violence, it's economic violence,'' Jackson
said, using a solar-powered sound system to address the crowd.
   Despite polls showing him far behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, Jackson drew large and enthusiastic crowds as he crossed
California campaigning for the last and biggest Democratic
presidential primary on June 7. There are 336 delegates at stake.
   Acknowledging the long odds against his campaign, in which he
trails Dukakis by 655 delegates with just 512 still to be elected,
Jackson told the cheering crowd: ``Why do I run against these odds?
I've faced odds all my life ... we cannot surrender, we the people
can win, we really can win.''
   Jackson attacked the Reagan administration and Vice President
George Bush on a wide range of issues, but his focus Saturday was
on environmental and educational concerns.
   He received his most enthusiastic response to a pledge to
support a congressional proposal to create a permanent ocean
sanctuary that effectively would forever bar oil drilling off the
California coast. In particular Jackson promised his opposition to
Lease Sale 91, a proposal by the Interior Department providing for
oil drilling.
   Standing beneath a clear sky on a bluff overlooking the Pacific
Ocean at one of the most scenic spots on the California coast 150
miles north of San Francisco, Jackson said the oil drilling plans
for that region amount to a ``drain America policy at any
environmental price.
   ``A Jackson administration will end for all times Lease Sale 91.
There will be no drilling for oil on the North Coast (of
California) under a Jackson presidency,'' he told a rally of more
than 1,500 at the remote, sparsely populated resort area.
   Later, Jackson repeated familiar themes supporting education and
providing equal opportunities for minorities at a rally of several
thousand supporters at Stanford University.
   ``You will make the world better. You will make the world
better. You are the hope,'' he told the crowd.
   Before about 5,000 supporters at Stanford, Jackson repeated his
proposal to freeze defense spending at current levels and use that
money for housing, health care, student aid and other social needs.
   ``Our future is in co-existence, not co-annihilation. Enough of
this false security'' from building more weapons, he said. ``Let's
go another way, let's invest in people, let's use some of that
money to keep America strong and make America better.''

<HEAD>Former Pilot Defector Seeks Bigger Gold Reward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Chinese air force pilot who
defected to Taiwan in a jet bomber in 1965 said Saturday the
government should have given him a bigger gold reward.
   In a petition to the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's highest
lawmaking body, Col. Lee Hsien-pin said he was living in hardship
and asked the government to give him the shares of the gold rewards
that were given to two technicians who flew to Taiwan with Lee.
   Technicians Lee Tsai-wang and Lien Pao-sheng did not deserve any
share of the reward of 330 pounds of gold, Col. Lee said, claiming
the two technicians were merely his captives.
   The reward was paid in cash and Col. Lee received about $70,000,
or 50 percent of the reward, while Lee Tsai-wang and Lien split the
other half.
   The government said the reward for Lien, who died of severe
injuries when the Ilyushin-28 bomber crash-landed at Taoyuan air
base in northern Taiwan, would be handed to Lien's relatives in
China when the Nationalists regain the Chinese mainland.
   Lee Tsai-wang went to the United States after he retired from
Taiwan's air force in 1975.
   Vice Defense Minister Chou Hsueh-tsun on Saturday told lawmakers
the rewards also went to Lee Tsai-wang and Lien because they helped
Lee Hsien-pin in flying to Taiwan.
   Chou also argued the government has taken good care of Lee, who
Chou says owns three houses and earns a monthly salary of $1,700.
   Taiwan has a sliding scale of rewards paid in gold for defecting
Chinese servicemen that depends on the type of military aircraft or
ships brought out of China. A jet bomber is worth 330 pounds of
gold.
   Officials say 13 military personnel have defected from China to
Taiwan since 1949, when the Nationalists fled to this island after
losing a civil war to the Communists on the Chinese mainland.

<TEXT>
   Voters here may become the first in
the nation to shut down an operating nuclear power plant when they
consider rival ballot measures to decide the fate of the
problem-plagued Rancho Seco plant.
   A measure sponsored by a group called SAFE, or Sacramentans for
Safe Energy, would order the permanent closure of the 14-year-old
plant, one of the few publicly owned nuclear power plants in the
country.
   An alternative plan put on the June 7 ballot by the Sacramento
Municipal Utility District, which owns Rancho Seco, in effect asks
the district's voters to give the the plant 25 miles southeast of
here another chance.
   The utility district, which comprises Sacramento and surrounding
areas with a combined population of more than 420,000, has
struggled with operating problems at the plant for years.
   In addition, district consumers have struggled with electricity
rates that have gone up nearly 85 percent in three years, and
critics blame Rancho Seco for that, too.
   ``The thing has such a history of running so poorly and being
unsafe that no one would believe it won't do the same thing in the
future,'' said Bob Mulholland, political director of Campaign
California, an environmental and consumer's group working on the
shutdown effort.
   ``We figure that the odds of Rancho Seco operating above the
industry average are about the same as winning the California
lottery,'' said Karl Ory of Campaign California.
   Rancho Seco managers say the plant deserves another chance.
   ``We're champing at the bit to show the public we can do it,''
said Steve Redeker, deputy operations manager. ``For the first
time, we have an attitude of do it right.''
   Ed Smeloff, the only one of the five utility district board
members who wants to shut down Rancho Seco, said passage of the
measure could indirectly influence the private utilities that own
the vast majority of the nation's nuclear plants. Even though those
utilities are not under the control of the voters, as the
Sacramento utility is, they are sensitive to public opinion, he
said.
   ``It certainly does, I think, set a tone if a local electorate
doesn't want a nuclear plant,'' he said. ``It would worry other
utilities across the country even if the electorate doesn't have
the final say.''
   The plant, built for $375 million by Babcock and Wilcox Inc.,
has a reactor design like that of Three Mile Island reactor No. 2,
the site of the nation's worst commercial nuclear power plant
accident in March 1979.
   From the day of its dedication in October 1974, the plant has
been plagued by malfunctioning equipment and operator errors that
forced more than 100 outages, including a shutdown that lasted from
December 1985 to last month.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission called the overcooling
accident that led to that shutdown one of the dozen worst problems
suffered by U.S. plants in 1985.
   The agency gives the plant one of the worst efficiency ratings
of any in the nation. Federal investigations have concluded that
the plant had a history of mismanagement, poor or non-existent
maintenance, poor operator training, inattention to detail, and
failure to learn from past mistakes.
   A federal investigation of a 1985 overcooling accident also
found that an important monitor was set at a level that would
underestimate escaping radiation.
   Proponents of the shutdown, dubbed Measure B on the ballot,
include Mayor Anne Rudin and a majority of the Sacramento City
Council. They argue that the plant will never be adequate or
reliable and will require an endless stream of money for scheduled
modifications and unforeseen repairs.
   Proponents of the alternate measure, Measure C, argue that the
utility has spent $400 million to overhaul the plant, is hiring an
outside company to manage it, and deserves a chance to prove Rancho
Seco's viability. But the proposed hiring of another manager has
provoked another dispute because the company, Duke Power Co. of
North Carolina, contributed $100,000 to the Measure C campaign.
   Measure C includes a provision that would call for the district
to shut down Rancho Seco any time after Dec. 31 if the plant fails
to operate at more than 50 percent of capacity for four consecutive
months.
   In the past, the plant has managed to operate at an average of
just 40 percent of capacity. The 50 percent requirement, however,
could be overridden by four of the utility's five directors.
   Opponents of the plant question how legally binding Measure C
would be.
   ``It's my legal opinion that Measure C in no way restricts the
board from doing anything they want,'' said attorney Michael Remy,
SAFE chairman. Whatever voters decide on June 7, the issue will
almost certainly end up in court, Remy said.

<HEAD>With AM-Pope, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alan Garcia has named a new Cabinet,
including a retired admiral as interior minister, the government's
official gazette reported Saturday.
   The 15-member Cabinet resigned en masse a week ago after
strident criticism from opposition parties that accused Garcia and
his ministers of failing to halt Peru's economic decline or control
guerrilla violence.
   Garcia, who announced the appointments late Friday, named
retired Adm. Juan Soria Diaz, who has served as president of the
joint military command, as interior minister, La Cronica reported.
He replaced Jose Barsallo.
   The government's fight against leftist guerrillas, whose
eight-year insurgency has cost more than 10,000 lives, is directed
by the interior ministry.
   Garcia's naming of Soria Diaz was viewed by analysts as a sign
the government will implement tougher anti-insurgency policies.
   Sen. Armando Villanueva, 72, a long-time leader of the
center-left Aprista Party, was named prime minister, replacing
Guillermo Larco Cox.
   Garcia named eight new ministers, while the seven others were
renamed to their posts, the government daily said.
   It was the second Cabinet shakeup since Garcia took office in
July 1985.
   In other key changes, Luis Gonzales, former ambassador to the
Organization of American States, was named to head the foreign
ministry, while Cesar Robles was tabbed finance minister, La
Cronica said.
   Other appointments were: Guillermo Arteaga as industry minister;
Romulo Leon Alegria as fishing minister; Luis Pinillos as health
minister and retired Gen. Francisco Maury as transportation
minister, La Cronica said.
   The full Cabinet also resigned a year ago, following an internal
party dispute between Garcia and then Prime Minister Luis Alva
Castro. Most minister at that time were renamed to Cabinet slots.

<HEAD>Springfield Lays Claim To Breakfast Crown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Springfield laid claim Saturday to the
breakfast crown of America after serving pancakes to more than
31,000 people at a table that stretched seven blocks down Main
Street.
   The event was part of this western Massachusetts city's 352nd
birthday celebration and continued a 12-year contest with Battle
Creek, Mich., which touts itself as the cereal capital of the world.
   Spokeswoman Amy Barron said a total of breakfast guests reached
31,279, exceeding by more than 800 the number served at Battle
Creek's annual breakfast last summer.
   ``We had a perfect day for a perfect event,'' Barron said. ``The
first (pancake) hit the grill at 7:25 (a.m. EDT) and they didn't
stop serving until 11:45.''
   City workers and residents pitched in for kitchen detail and
area businesses donated most of the food, she said.
   The recipe for 64,000 pancakes: 3,000 pounds of flour, 660
pounds of egg yolk, 225 pounds of butter and 400 gallons of water.
   The pancakes were topped with a ton of butter and 200 gallons of
maple syrup and served with 600 gallons of coffee and 600 gallons
of orange juice.
   A radio station dished out blueberries for topping.
   The theme went beyond food. About 100 volunteers unfurled an
85-by-45-foot American Flag that flew over Mt. Rushmore for the
landmark's 50th anniversary. The flag was mounted on top of a crane
in front of city hall.
   The ``Breakfast Bowl'' was launched in 1956 to mark the 50th
anniversary of the Kellogg Co. plant in Battle Creek when that city
set a world record for the longest breakfast table.
   In 1976, Springfield bested Battle Creek for the longest table
with a pancake breakfast as part of its celebration of the nation's
bicentennial. But the Michigan city quickly regained the crown and
continues to hold it, with the exception of brief interruptions by
Springfield in 1986 and 1987.
   Last May, Springfield fed 27,067 people at a 3,600-foot table,
confident that Battle Creek couldn't do better because its Main
Street isn't long enough.
   But one month later, Battle Creek bent a 3,700-foot-long table
for 30,413 around a street corner to reclaim the title.
   This year, former Springfield Mayor William C. Sullivan gave up
on table length and focused on numbers served. The strategy worked,
although this year's table stretched a mere 2,000 feet.
   Springfield may not hold the title for long _ Battle Creek has
its annual cereal breakfast June 4.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Japanese terrorist group Red Army
demanded that authorities release a co-member arrested recently or
face a ``fitting reprisal,'' a newspaper reported in its Sunday
editions.
   In a telex dispatched Saturday from North Korea to the
newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, the group said Yasuhiro Shibata, an
alleged Red Army faction member, went to Japan ``to pioneer the way
for us to return.''
   Unless the Japanese government and police took immediate action
to release Shibata, the Red Army was prepared to retaliate, faction
members said in a message titled, ``An Urgent Statement on the
Unfair Arrest of Comrade Yasuhiro Shibata.''
   In the telex sent to the newspaper's Tokyo headquarters, the
group also claimed Japanese authorities were ``repressing'' groups
in Japan sympathetic to the Red Army cause and demanded that such
action be stopped on threat of reprisal, Yomiuri reported in both
its Japanese and English-language editions.
   On May 6 police arrested Shibata, 34, near his apartment. He is
one of nine alleged Red Army terrorists suspected of taking part in
the 1970 hijacking of a Japan Air Lines passenger jet to North
Korea.
   At the time of his arrest, Shibata was carrying a passport
issued in the name of Akira Nakao, a Japanese who had assumed North
Korean citizenship and was residing in his adopted country.
   Yomiuri also reported that in a follow-up telephone conversation
with Red Army member Morisuke Wakabayashi in Pyongyang, North
Korea, the suspected terrorist replied in the positive when asked
if seven faction members were based in that country.
   Yomiuri said it contacted Wakabayashi, one of the leaders of the
1970 hijacking group, as he was dispatching the telex to Tokyo from
the Pyongyang International Post Office.
   Wakabayashi denied any role by North Korean officials in
planning the message.
   ``We conferred among ourselves and wrote a 4,000-character
message at first. Then we cut it in half to 2,000,'' the newspaper
quoted him as saying.
   The group's message said Shibata returned to Japan because he
was homesick and discounted as slanderous Japanese reports that the
faction member was planning a terrorist attack or was spying for
North Korea.

had been using heroin shortly before his fatal fall from a
third-floor hotel window, police said Saturday.
   Baker, 58, had a history of drug abuse and died early Friday
near Amsterdam's heroin district.
   The trumpeter, famed for his appearances with the Gerry Mulligan
Quartet in the 1950s, had been scheduled to go on a tour of the
Netherlands, West Berlin and France.
   ``The way it looks, he had just been using'' heroin, police
spokesman Klaas Wilting told The Associated Press. Traces of heroin
abuse were found in Baker's hotel room, he added.
   ``Maybe he started acting funny ... He was alone and shoved the
window open himself and either fell or jumped out ... I don't
suppose we'll ever find out which,'' Wilting added.
   A receptionist at the Prins Hendrik hotel, where Baker checked
in Thursday, recounted how the musician ``was a little nervous''
when he arrived. He did not elaborate.
   The receptionist, who refused to give his name, added that the
window of the room Baker was in slides open vertically, leaving a
10-inch gap at most.
   ``How he got through there, I don't know,'' the receptionist
said.
   Born as Chesney H. Baker in Yale, Okla., in December 1929,
Baker's career got into full swing when he joined British
saxophonist Mulligan and his quartet.
   Known to jazz buffs as the initiator of the ``cool school'' of
jazz, Baker was renowned for the thin, cool tone of his trumpet
playing and spent most of his time in Europe.
   Baker, who appeared frequently in the Netherlands, was beset by
arrests and heroin problems throughout most of his later career and
was sentenced to a 16-month prison term for drug offenses in Italy
in the early 1960s.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis was heckled Saturday by gay political
activists over his stand on their rights to be foster parents,
while Republican George Bush fended off a corporate executive's
criticism of Reagan administration policies on taxes and trade.
   Both parties' presidential front-runners were spending the
weekend campaigning in the West, where the the bulk of the final
round of primaries will be held in the next two weeks.
   Dukakis, speaking to several dozen homosexual activists at a
political action committee meeting in Los Angeles, promised,
``You're going to be deeply involved in what we do.''
   But the Massachusetts governor was challenged over a policy in
his state giving low priority to homosexual couples who want to be
foster parents.
   Dukakis said he favored the Massachusetts policy ``because I
think it's best, all things being equal, for a child to grow up in
a household with a mother and father and other children.''
   His defense of that policy was met with some hisses from the
crowd and occasional shouts of protest. One man shouted, ``bigot,''
and another yelled, ``You're anti-gay. Why don't you admit it?''
   Dukakis later shrugged off the hostile reception, saying, ``It
was lively. That's what democracy is all about.''
   His aides, nevertheless, were pleased with the way the meeting
went. ``I thought it was very good, very open,'' said Alice Travis,
national political coordinator for the campaign.
   Meanwhile, Bush toured an Intel microchip plant in Oregon, where
the company's board chairman, Robert Noyce, told the vice president
of a need for higher taxes and for President Reagan to sign the
trade bill.
   ``I don't think that there is any chance of a balanced budget
without new taxes,'' said Noyce.
   Reagan on Saturday repeated his vow to veto a trade bill passed
by Congress because of a provision requiring large companies to
notify employees in advance of plant closings.
   ``The plant-closing aspect of the trade bill does not seem
onerous to us,'' Noyce said. ``It is no less than we would do in
any case.''
   Bush said he was not swayed by Noyce's arguments.
   The vice president also sought to take the high ground on the
issue of the environment, saying, ``For too long we have given away
the playing field to the Democrats on the environment. I want to
make the environment a Republican issue.''
   Jesse Jackson, campaigning in California, took the environment
as his theme, saying he would seek a ban of exploratory offshore
oil drilling along the state's north coast forever.
   Jackson addressed an enthusiastic crowd in Mendocino using a
solar-powered loudspeaker.
   ``This plan to drill for oil, pollute the ocean, and dirty the
air is environmental violence, it's economic violence,'' Jackson
said.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, speaking in Portland, Ore., on
Saturday, said he believes Dukakis will win the Democratic
presidential nomination but will need Jackson's help to win in
November.
   ``A Jesse Jackson who is an impassioned part of the effort to
support Mike Dukakis if Mike wins, and that's the way it looks,
that would be helpful, absolutely,'' Cuomo said.
   The next two weeks mark the close to the primary season with
Oregon's primary on Tuesday, followed a week later with primaries
in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana.
   Meanwhile, other states were wrapping up the final rounds of
their delegate selection with state and district conventions over
the weekend.
   In Arizona, ousted Gov. Evan Mecham, who was removed from office
by a state Senate impeachment trial and faces still another trial
on criminal charges, was selected as an at-large delegate to the
Republican National Convention. No presidential candidate was
claiming him, and other state politicians were openly hostile
toward his candidacy.
   Mecham, who earlier lost in his bid to be one of the three
delegates from a congressional district, said he would support Bush
and would concentrate on the Republican's choice for vice president.
   Delaware Republicans picked 17 national convention delegates on
Saturday, including former Gov. Pete du Pont, who withdrew from the
race for the GOP presidential nomination.
   Dukakis and Jackson each made slight gains in Maine and
Michigan, where Democrats wrapped up their delegate selections on
Saturday.
   Conventions also were being held this weekend by Democrats in
Iowa and Alaska.

<HEAD>Art Institute Apologizes For Furor Over Portrait Of Lingerie-Clad
Mayor</HEAD>

   An art school apologized in newspaper
advertisements Sunday for exhibiting a student's portrait of late
Mayor Harold Washington in lingerie, but criticized the way it was
removed by black aldermen.
   ``All educational institutions encourage students' freedom of
expression,'' the School of the Art Institute said in full-page ads
in the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune.
   ``Regrettably, in the use of his freedom, this student created a
work that had the effect of insulting the memory of an important
leader, Mayor Harold Washington.''
   The student, David Nelson, depicted Washington in a frilly white
bra, panties, garter and stockings, holding a pencil and frowning.
Washington died of a heart attack last November.
   The painting was hung in a students' exhibition at the school
but was confiscated by police Wednesday when black aldermen stormed
in and said it disgraced the city's first black mayor and
threatened public order.
   ``We do not approve of the method used by members of the City
Council who entered a private space within the School and forcibly
removed the painting from the wall, even though we recognize the
intensity of feeling on the part of those aldermen in this
situation,'' the ad said.
   The ad was addressed ``To The Chicago Community'' and carried
the names of Marshall Field, president of The Art Institute of
Chicago's board of trustees, and Tony Jones, president of the
School of the Art Institute.
   Nelson has not given interviews since the dispute began and did
not attend his class' graduation ceremonies at the school Saturday.
Eileen Harakal, a spokeswoman for the art institute, said his
diploma would be mailed to him.
   The painting has been returned to him, but the American Civil
Liberties Union has said it would file a civil rights lawsuit
challenging the police department's authority to remove the piece.
   The portrait has been a rallying point for blacks all week.
Washington supporters scheduled _ and then canceled _ a march
Saturday from City Hall to the art school.
   ``We thought it best to let things cool off for awhile,'' said
Chuck Kelly, a former aide to the late mayor. ``We are going to
continue to monitor the situation ... but I think the Art Institute
has seen the error of its ways.''
   Reporters who arrived at a plaza opposite City Hall to cover the
scheduled march instead found art students who also canceled a
planned rally of their own.
   Joe Medosch, a student at the school, said students wanted to
``avoid a confrontation'' with blacks.
   ``We didn't want to see anyone hurt,'' Medosch said. ``We're not
backing David (Nelson), we're backing our rights.''

   Republican nominee-to-be George Bush, intent
on discussing high technology Saturday at the Intel microchip
plant, instead heard about the need for higher taxes and President
Reagan's signature on the trade bill.
   Bush was quick to disagree with Intel board chairman Robert
Noyce, who said the semiconductor industry needs the trade bill and
higher taxes can help balance the budget. Noyce had shown the vice
president the company's semiconductor manufacturing facility
outside of Portland.
   High technology and the environment were the topics for the
third day of Bush's Western swing in advance of the Oregon primary
on Tuesday and the California primary three weeks hence.
   The Republican heir-apparent donned a ``full FAB bunny suit,''
in which he was garbed from head to toe in special overalls that
keep dust at a minimum, as he viewed the sophisticated Intel
facility.
   Later, when Noyce briefed the vice president on the company's
situation, taxes and a provision of the trade bill _ the 60-day
notification of a plant closing _ came up.
   ``I don't think that there is any chance of a balanced budget
without new taxes,'' Noyce told Bush, saying he is worried about
the supply of capital for investment in America. ``That's not a
popular subject this year ... We need to promote savings.''
   Bush said his mind has not been changed.
   ``It didn't at all. I don't think the next president has to,
provided we get a grip on spending ... I disagree with him on
that,'' he told reporters after a speech to Intel employees.
   Noyce also said the semiconductor industry needs the proposed
trade bill, brushing aside Reagan's criticism of the measure. The
president, in his weekly radio address, repeated his vow to veto
the bill, citing the plant-closing provision.
   ``The plant-closing aspect of the trade bill does not seem
onerous to us,'' Noyce said. ``It is no less than we would do in
any case.''
   Bush again disagreed, backing Reagan on the issue.
   ``I was very interested in his position. It doesn't change my
mind,'' he said.
   But the vice president praised the Massachusetts plant-closing
law, which his likely Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis uses as
an example to support the call for a federal law.
   ``It's not a big problem for companies like this, but what you
don't want to see is disincentives to start new businesses,'' Bush
told reporters. ``In Massachusetts, they have a plant-closing law.
It's voluntary. It's not like the federal government imposing it.''
   At his last event of the day, Bush criticized the furlough
program in Massachusetts _ backed by Dukakis _ that allowed some
criminals weekend breaks from jail.
   ``Believe you will never see from me a program like the one in
Massachusetts to let these murderers out of jail ahead their
sentence running out so they can go out and kill again _ like one
of them did in that state,'' Bush told a crowd at a rally in
Medford.
   The state legislature recently eliminated that furlough program.
   On the subject of the environment, Bush said the Republican
Party needs to take the issue back after years of allowing the
Democrats the right to lay claim to it.
   ``For too long, we have given away the playing field to the
Democrats on the environment. I want to make the environment a
Republican issue,'' he told the cheering crowd of about 800
Republicans late Friday night in Portland.
   ``I would like to be remembered the same way as Teddy Roosevelt
_ next to the national security, it's the condition of the Earth
that you will leave to generations to come. We can do better,'' he
said.
   Bush was scheduled to visit a tree nursery near Medford, Ore.,
on Saturday, take a raft trip Sunday and visit a tree research lab
in Washington on Monday.

<HEAD>CDC Official Warns Educators Of Need For Prevention</HEAD>

   The AIDS virus will reach epidemic proportions
among young people, educators were told Saturday, unless a
comprehensive prevention program on the disease is implemented in
every school, at every grade level.
   Health officials at the national Centers for Disease Control
believe adolescents experimenting with sex and drugs seriously risk
contracting the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, said
Dennis Tolsman, the CDC's director of health promotion and
education.
   ``We can't think (AIDS prevention) can be carried out through a
pamphlet or a 15-minute lecture,'' Tolsman told an audience of more
than 100 educators attending a conference on AIDS and education.
   ``We need a comprehensive program taught in health education
classes by trained health education personnel to fight this
problem,'' he said. ``We need your help to make sure adolescents
understand what AIDS is and how it is prevented.''
   CDC officials teamed with the National Education Association to
sponsor the three-day conference, which concludes Sunday.
   Educators received guidelines for educating students about AIDS
and discussed AIDS infection among teenagers.
   The guidelines propose efforts at all grade levels, including
early elementary school programs that reduce fears of an epidemic
and teach students that the disease is not spread through casual
contact.
   Late elementary and middle school programs should inform
students about the disease itself, and junior and senior high
school students should be told of the risks of contracting AIDS
through sex or intravenous drug use, say the guidelines.
   Some educators expressed reservations about the plan.
   ``School health officials cannot do this alone,'' said Jennifer
Jo Hugstad-Vaa, a biology teacher from Burnsville, Minn. ``AIDS is
an epidemic and it covers every thing from biology, home economics
(and) social studies to economics.
   ``It's not just a health problem,'' she said.
   James Williams, director of the NEA Health Information Network,
added that the entire school staff should receive AIDS training
because children often receive advice from their bus drivers,
janitors and cafeteria workers.
   In the United States, AIDS has affected 973 children under age
13, 260 teenagers and more than 61,000 adults, according to the
CDC. The disease has killed more than 34,000 people.
   ``The numbers in these groups (children and teenagers) are tiny
when compared to adults, but still the numbers are staggering,''
said Dr. Peter Droutman, medical epidemiologist for the CDC.

   The infant who provided the five
vital organs transplanted into 3-year-old Tabatha Foster had been
murdered by her father, police charged.
   Earl F. Shirks, who originally told authorities his 7-week-old
daughter was injured in an automobile accident, was charged with
first-degree murder in the death of Heather R. Orick, Lee County
Sheriff Robert Chadwell said Friday.
   Heather's vital organs were donated to Tabatha, who was the
longest survivor of a five-organ transplant until her death
Wednesday of organ failure caused by a blood infection.
   Authorities said Saturday there was no link between the timing
of Tabatha's death and the murder charge being filed against
Shirks, 44, of Pennington Gap.
   ``Just a coincidence,'' said Betty Janeway, a dispatcher for the
sheriff's department.
   Chadwell refused to discuss the cause of Heather's Oct. 30 death
on Friday, and could not be reached over the weekend. He was said
to be out of the office and dispatchers would not give out his home
number.
   Shirks took his daughter to Lee County Community Hospital on
Oct. 8, and she died 22 days later at the Children's Hospital at
Fort Sanders Hospital in Knoxville, Tenn.
   The infant's vital organs were flown to Pittsburgh, where
Tabatha received the liver, pancreas and small intestine and parts
of the stomach and colon during a 15-hour operation that ended Nov.
1.
   In an interview after his daughter's organs were donated to the
Madisonville, Ky., girl, Shirks said Heather was in a small seat on
the console of his car when he slammed on his brakes to avoid
another vehicle coming toward them in a curve. Shirks said his
daughter struck her head on the car's gear shift.
   He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis didn't win Iowa's
first-in-the-nation caucuses last February, didn't even come in
second. But now that he's the likely nominee, slightly embarrassed
Iowa Democrats are falling in line behind the Massachusetts
governor.
   Not the least on their minds is 1992, and the prospect of losing
the status of putting the first mark on the primary season.
   ``That's a key factor,'' said Iowa party chairwoman Bonnie
Campbell, who admits her endorsement of Dukakis last week was
partly designed to curry favor with him in hopes he'll look kindly
on Iowa in 1992. ``Naturally, I give great thought to that.''
   Dukakis came in third in the Feb. 8 caucuses, behind winner
Richard Gephardt and runner-up Paul Simon. But Missouri Rep.
Gephardt dropped out of the presidential race March 28 and Simon,
the senator from Illinois, suspended his campaign on April 7,
leaving Dukakis and Jesse Jackson to battle for the nomination.
   About 3,000 Democratic activists were trooping to congressional
district conventions Saturday to begin picking a slate of delegates
that will bear only a passing resemblance to the much-ballyhooed
outcome of the precinct caucuses.
   At those meetinngs, Dukakis claimed 12 of the delegates elected,
while Gephardt forces won nine technically uncommitted delegates,
most of whom are expected to endorse Dukakis during the next month.
   Jackson claimed seven delegates, while Simon was awarded six.
   Gephardt's backers had hoped to maintain their status as a group
in hopes of electing their leaders to delegate slots, but most are
epxected to turn to Dukakis.
   That isn't surprising, party leaders say, because a certain
amount of flexibility has always been a trademark of Iowa Democrats.
   ``We have to realign probably more than any other group of
Democrats,'' said Campbell. ``It requires us to be quite facile and
most Iowa Democrats are, in fact, pretty flexible.''
   ``Our delegation's makeup follows the idiosyncrasies of what's
happening on the campaign trail and matches what's happening,''
said Democratic Party spokesman Phil Roeder. ``Part of the good
thing about the four-step system we have is there are points along
the road where people can step back, change their allegiances and,
in a way, go with the flow.''
   Iowa was the launching pad for the Democratic presidential race
three months ago, but the rest of the nation wasn't buying the
direction the state wanted to head.
   Ms. Campbell said Iowa Democrats don't have to be told twice
that it's time to switch gears, and they were moving to do that
Saturday. She traveled to conventions in all six of the state's
congressional districts urging activists to elect national
convention delegates loyal to Dukakis.
   ``I think it sends a pretty strong message that it's a good time
to start thinking about November,'' said Jerry Crawford, a Des
Moines lawyer and Dukakis backer.
   Party rules call for Iowans to pick 34 of the state's 61
delegates to the Democratic National Convention at those district
conventions.
   The only suspense was whether Gephardt's loyalists could hang
together long enough to elect their leaders to cherished delegate
slots, technically uncommitted but Dukakis backers in reality.
   ``Most of them are Gephardt people, but I think you'll see a lot
of them commit to Dukakis even before the state convention,''
Roeder said.
   Iowa's delegate selection process is a complex affair, and only
the first stage is shoved into the nation's political limelight.
The precinct caucuses were essentially a straw poll of whom was
favored among the 100,000 or so activists who showed up and elected
delegates to the next step, conventions in all 99 counties.
   Delegates aren't actually elected until the district
conventions, and the race routinely has changed by that point. The
final 18 delegates are chosen at the party's June 25 state
convention.
   Ms. Campbell spoke as if she expected the shift all along.
   ``Dukakis did remarkably well here,'' she said. ``Those folks
were very close together in reality. Those three people did very
well.''

   Army and civilian rescuers chipped
away at concrete slabs Saturday to try to reach two people still
missing in a building collapse that killed at least 15 people,
officials said.
   A state communique said the death toll from Thursday's collapse
rose to 15 on Saturday and may go as high as 17. The Red Cross
listed 19 dead, Juan Diaz Andrade, in charge of special services
for the local agency said.
   Rescuers believe they have located the body of one of the
missing and believe the second also is dead, said the communique
issued Saturday.
   Fifty-seven people were injured in the accident and 12 of them
hospitalized, the report said.
   The governor of Aguascalientes, Miguel Angel Barbarena Vega,
visited the site Saturday and said an investigation to determine
why the four-story building collapsed will be stepped up Monday.
   The building housed a furniture factory on the ground floor and
part of the three-level basement area. It gave way as concrete was
being poured during construction of three more floors that were
being added on.
   It is common in Mexico for buildings to be occupied during
construction of upper floors.
   Jesus Maria Romo, owner of the furniture factory in this state
capital 320 miles northwest of Mexico City, said paperwork for
indemnization for relatives of the victims will begin Monday, the
government news agency Notimex reported.
   He estimated damage at about $225,000, Notimex said.

   Joseph Zambelli, the ``Grandfather of
Fireworks'' whose talents shone during great national celebrations
such as the Statue of Liberty's centennial, has died of a heart
attack. He was 80.
   Zambelli's family said he died Thursday at his home in New
Castle, about 40 miles northwest of Pittsburgh.
   The family's New Castle-based company claims to be the country's
largest and oldest maker and exhibitor of fireworks, putting on
more than 5,000 displays a year worldwide. Zambelli was vice
president of production at Zambelli International America.
   He put together displays for six U.S. presidents, including
fireworks at the inaugurations of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.
   His fireworks also have been used in celebrations for the Statue
of Liberty's centennial in 1986, a Washington, D.C., welcome home
party for American hostages held in Iran and a salute to Pope John
Paul II.
   Zambelli was known as a tireless worker, frequently working
seven days a week well into his 70s, said his nephew, George
Zambelli Jr. This year, he visited the factory two or three times a
week, he said.
   ``Even when he wasn't working he would sit and try to come up
with new ideas for the business,'' the younger Zambelli said.
   Zambelli began working full time in the factory, established by
his father, at the age of 13, his nephew said.
   His parents, Antonio and Maria Zambelli, immigrated to the
United States from Naples, Italy, at the turn of the century.
   Zambelli is survived by his wife, Mary; two sons, Anthony of New
Castle and John of Pittsburgh; two brothers, George and Louis, both
of New Castle; two sisters, Rita Iris of New Castle and Connie
Tomelleo of Beaver Falls; and three grandchildren, Matthew, Erik
and Abbey.

who temporarily relinquished his duties for health reasons on May
4, has been admitted to a Phoenix hospital, officials said Saturday.
   Kathy Pitts, a supervisor at Barrows Neurological Center at St.
Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center here, said no word on
Presser's illness or condition would be released.
   However, the Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal reported Saturday that
Presser was diagnosed last week as having brain cancer and was
transferred to Barrows from the Cleveland Clinic.
   Presser, 61, previously has undergone surgery for a malignant
tumor in his lung.
   Meanwhile, the Teamsters union executive board is set to meet
Monday in Phoenix amid reports of a power struggle stemming from
the health problems of Presser, who has been Teamsters president
since 1983.
   Weldon L. Mathis, the 1.6-million-member union's secretary
treasurer who has taken over Presser's duties, called Monday's
meeting, but some board members are considering a boycott, the
Beacon-Journal and The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported.
   The board is made up of 16 vice presidents and Mathis.
   Don West, an international vice president from Birmingham, Ala.,
confirmed the meeting but would not comment on it, The Plain Dealer
said.
   The newspaper quoted a union source as saying the meeting was
called because of Presser's letter to Mathis announcing his
decision to step aside for four months. Other sources were quoted
as citing concern about who would take over should Presser resign
or die.
   ``Some people feel (Teamster lawyer John R.) Climaco encouraged
Jackie to sign it (the letter) to give Weldon a leg up,'' The Plain
Dealer quoted the source as saying.
   Climaco on Friday denied manuevering to set up Mathis as the
next Teamsters president, the newspaper reported.
   ``Anyone who takes the time to read the international
constitution knows that it provides that the general
secretary-treasurer assumes the duties anytime the general
president is unavailable,'' he said.
   Presser is scheduled to stand trial July 12 in U.S. District
Court in Cleveland on embezzlement and racketeering charges.
   In court papers, Presser's attorneys have said their client does
not want to postpone the trial, but he was too ill to attend a
hearing called this week by U.S. District Judge George White to
discuss Presser's health.
   The hearing was rescheduled for June 3.
   Presser is accused, along with two other Teamsters officials, of
siphoning $700,000 in union funds from Teamsters Local 507 in
Cleveland. Presser remains secretary-treasurer of Local 507.
   Presser has pleaded innocent to the charges. His attorneys say
Presser was a government informant and that the fraud scheme was
authorized by the FBI.

   Ousted President Ferdinand E. Marcos
pledged his support to President Corazon Aquino on Saturday and
promised that if she let him come home for his mother's funeral, he
would not try a coup.
   About 5,000 people rallied to demand that Marcos be allowed to
attend the funeral of his mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died
May 4. She was 95. No date for the funeral has been set. Family
members have been hoping Mrs. Aquino would change her mind about
Marcos attending.
   Mrs. Aquino ruled out allowing Marcos to return. The government
also said Saturday that Marcos must repay the billions he allegedly
stole during his 20 years in power before he can come home from
exile in Hawaii and ordered its consulate in Hawaii to block his
return.
   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad read Marcos' statement by
telephone from Hawaii, where Marcos lives in exile. In the
statement, broadcast by Manila radio stations, Marcos promised he
would not exploit his return to undermine her government.
   ``I reiterate that I oppose violence, that I have no intention
of mounting a coup d'etat or causing a civil war,'' the Marcos
statement said. ``I, therefore, advise my supporters and those who
are fighting for the very same democratic principles that I stand
for not to engage in any disruptive and more violent activities.''
   But in a telegram to the Philippine consulate in Honolulu, the
presidential palace said Mrs. Aquino remained convinced Marcos'
return would undermine national security.
   Marcos supporters have been linked to several attempts to topple
the Aquino government.
   The telegram, released by the palace to news organizations, also
said Mrs. Aquino would ``allow him to come back if he returns all
the wealth he stole from the country.''
   Mrs. Aquino's government claims Marcos and his associates
siphoned off up to $10 billion during his 20-year administration
before he fled after a February 1986 popular uprising.
   Marcos' statement also urged his supporters to ``join forces
with Madame Aquino'' to oppose communist rebels and others who
``challenge the stability of the current government.''
   The ousted president said that allowing him to return would
``not only adhere to the noble principle of humanitarianism but
also would unite various political forces ... into an overpowering
force which would prevent bloodshed ... and at the same time solve
the present economic sufferings of our people.''
   On Friday, Marcos claimed he was negotiating with Manila and
Washington to return for the funeral.
   Mrs. Aquino's spokesman, Teodoro Benigno, said Friday's
statement was meaningless, and U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt told
reporters that American officials ``just haven't been involved at
all'' in negotiations regarding Marcos' return.
   Marcos loyalists gathered in 100-degree weather Saturday and
marched to the Mendiola Bridge about 300 yards from the
presidential palace. March leader Salvador Panelo said they would
remain there until Mrs. Aquino reversed her decision or Marcos
appeared before them. But by sundown, the crowd had largely
dispersed.
   Protesters carried banners reading ``Give Us Marcos or Give Us
Death.'' Others claimed Marcos was the only one who could stop the
communist insurgency, which erupted and spread nationwide during
his administration.
   Also Saturday, a bomb exploded at military headquarters, killing
one soldier, officials said. The building has been vacant since
being set ablaze during an August coup attempt.
   Navy Lt. Anselmo Cabingan, a military spokesman, said the victim
was believed to be a member of a roving guard force and apparently
picked up an explosive device left after the coup plot failed.
   ``It's an accident,'' Cabingan said. ``It`s not connected with
anything political or whatever. It's just a simple accident as we
see it.''

   John Hunsberger hopes nobody is embarrassed
by his wife's little anniversary prank, because even she was
surprised when the fake cop she hired to ticket him began taking
off her uniform at a church league softball game.
   ``See, it was all in fun,'' Hunsberger said. ``But she (wife
Debbie) thought it was only a thing of where I would get a
citation. She didn't find out about the Strip-O-Gram _ or whatever
_ part of it until it was too late.''
   As it happened, the shortstop for the other team, Manoa
Presbyterian, doubles as that church's pastor, and he didn't find
it entirely humorous.
   ``The pastor saw it, and came over to our coach to express his
concern about it all,'' Hunsberger said. ``I mean, after all, it is
a church league.
   ``See, it was all supposed to happen after the game _ when the
other people had left. But people were still around, and there were
even some kids there ... it all happened so fast.''
   Hunsberger said nothing offensive was intended and he hopes
nobody gets in trouble with league or sponsoring church officials
over it.
   Some had an inkling before it happened. Hunsberger's brother,
Billy, gave John an emphatic ``Stop'' sign from the third-base
coaching box as John rounded third after hitting a grand slam.
   But poor John didn't get it, until the ``policewoman'' arrived,
nattily attired in a blue uniform and badges, searching for ``the
owner of that red Cavalier over there.''
   ``He thought it was real at first,'' said Hunsberger's teammate
Paul Azarian. ``But after about 30 seconds he figured it out.''
   Azarian said the woman stripped down to a bikini.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II arrived Saturday evening in
poor, terrorism-plagued Peru and heard a plea from President Alan
Garcia to reach out to ``those who are sick with hate and who kill
and destroy with violence.''
   John Paul, on a 12-day, four-nation mission to South America,
arrived from neighboring Bolivia on an antiquated Aeroperu DC-8 jet.
   At Lima's airport he expressed his sympathy with ``the huge
multitude that has experienced grief, violence, abandonment and
hunger'' in Peru.
   Later Saturday evening, scattered blackouts attributed to
leftist sabotage hit Lima while the pope was addressing priests,
nuns and seminary students but did not affect the downtown area
surrounding the colonial-era cathedral where he was.
   Outside the cathedral in Lima's central plaza the pope
consecrated a Peruvian version of the Virgin Mary. Tens of
thousands of people cheered, waved white handkerchiefs and shouted,
``Viva,'' Spanish for ``long life.'' Then the pontiff retired for
the night in the Vatican Embassy.
   Small dynamite charges exploded in at least four spots in the
city during Saturday night's papal activities, but police said no
one was hurt. Authorities attributed the blasts to insurgents.
   Earlier in the day about 20 women disrupted a Mass in a Roman
Catholic church in Lima, the capital, and appealed in the pope's
name for respect for the rights of leftist rebels held in local
prisons. Guerrillas in a mountain town ambushed an army convoy and
killed three soldiers.
   A military intelligence officer, who spoke to The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity, said two men posing as police with
automatic rifles were arrested on the papal motorcade route from
the Lima airport to downtown. He said there was an order to shoot
and kill any armed suspect near the pope.
   Echoing a theme he stressed before in Bolivia and Uruguay, the
pope cited Peru's ``hunger for bread'' and called on its citizens
to build ``a more fraternal and just society.''
   Garcia, a nationalistic social reformer who has halted virtually
all payment of Peru's $14.6 billion foreign debt, demanded a fairer
shake for poor nations of the Third World.
   ``We reject the usurious terms of the foreign debt,'' the
president told John Paul at the airport.
   John Paul, left the tropical Bolivian city of Santa Cruz for
Peru earlier Saturday.
   ``Don't go away, holy father. Don't leave us,'' Bolivian vice
president Julio Garrett Ayllon told the pope during a farewell
ceremony, repeating a chant heard throughout the pontiff's five-day
Bolivian stay.
   Addressing a Mass on Saturday in the Amazon basin city of
Trinidad, the pope insisted that ``constant, intense, honest and
efficient work by everyone'' was needed to overcome poverty. ``We
can't expect everything from outside.''
   It has been three years since the pope has been to Peru, a
country bloodied by an unrelenting leftist insurgency. When he was
here in 1985 he pleaded with rebels to abandon their armed struggle
to overthrow Peru's elected government.
   But the violence is worse than ever and the country is submerged
in a serious economic crisis.
   Inflation expected to top a record 400 percent this year year
and the country has virtually no dollars left in reserves to
maintain imports and economic growth.
   On Sunday the pope planned to celebrate an open air Mass, meet
with church officials and business and cultural leaders and close a
conference of Latin American bishops. Monday he continues on to
Paraguay, his last stop.
   Police said the women who occupied the church Saturday
surrounded a priest saying Mass and held a large banner reading:
``John Paul II, intercede for our brothers, political prisoners.''
   Witnesses said police took the protesters away in vans. Police
confirmed the incident but said they had no information on arrests.
   The women identified themselves as relatives of prisoners
accused of belonging to the pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement, a small rebel band active since 1984.
   The government President Garcia, who took office in 1985, is
also plagued by the fanatical Mao-inspired Shining Path, which
launched its insurgency in May 1980.
   Shining Path guerrillas Saturday ambushed an army convoy near
the Ayacucho town of Huancasancos, killing three soldiers wounding
three others, the military said in a communique.
   More than 10,000 people have died in the violence since 1980,
including rebels, policemen, soldiers, public officials and
civilians. More than half of Peru's population of 21 million people
live under states of emergencies in different parts of the country.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite months of U.S. sanctions and
a crumbling economy, Gen. Manuel Noriega is hardening his position
and preparing for months or possibly years more of confrontation
with the United States.
   A confident Noriega on Friday sallied into the provinces, where
he was cheered by peasants and hailed by small-town officials.
Accompanied by several colonels in a show of military unity,
Panama's defiant leader, accused in the United States of drug
trafficking, dismissed prospects for a negotiated settlement with
the United States.
   Noriega's comments to journalists indicated he considers himself
and Panama a test case of historical proportions and that he is
determined to rise to the occasion and challenge U.S. might.
   ``Everything fell apart,'' he said in La Negrita, 90 miles west
of the capital, when asked about recent U.S-Panamanian talks aimed
at resolving Panama's political crisis over Noriega's leadership.
   The Washington Post, citing unidentified sources, reported in
its Sunday editions that negotiations were at a delicate stage and
that administration officials believed a deal would be struck
within a few days or the talks would collapse.
   The administration is offering to drop drug-trafficking charges
against Noriega if he relinquished office Aug. 12 and left the
country, the newspaper said. In addition, the administration would
continue to recognize ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle but
also would allow Solis Palma, Noriega's handpicked chief of state,
to continue as Panama's acting president through the May 1989
elections, the newspaper said.
   The Post said there were conflicting reports on when Noriega
could return to Panama under the deal, but one source said it would
be after the elections.
   On Wednesday, U.S. media also reported that a Washington-Noriega
deal was nearly complete. They said it involved Noriega stepping
down and accepting temporary exile in exchange for dismissal of the
drug charges.
   His lawyers plan to appear in court to request dismissal of the
drug charges in about a month. They contend the charges are
politically motivated.
   ``The general isn't going anywhere,'' his spokesman, Maj.
Edgardo Lopez, told The Associated Press in Rio Hato, where
small-town mayors met with Noriega. A document signed by 505 mayors
called Noriega ``the incarnation of Panama's struggle against
imperialism'' and praised him ``for walking among the humble and
speaking their language.''
   Noriega, a mestizo of lower middle-class origins, has tried to
present the crisis as a conflict pitting a domineering Washington
allied with local rich white ``sellouts'' against Panama's
darker-skinned and poorer majority.
   The military commander, whose fortune is estimated at up to $1
billion, and his propaganda machine have succeeded to some degree
in selling that version locally and in Latin America.
   A divided opposition has been hamstrung by carefully applied
repression that gets the job done without deaths. All opposition
media have been closed.
   ``Panama's dignity is not negotiable while there are foreign
troops on our territory, humiliating our soil, while there is
economic aggression, as long as there are threats, as long as there
is psychological war,'' Noriega told reporters in Rio Hato, adding,
``and as long as (U.S.) Ambassador Arthur Davis doesn't get out.''
   About 10,000 American soldiers are stationed in Panama as part
of the U.S. Southern Command.
   The month of August, when Noriega completes 25 years of military
service, has been mentioned as a possible retirement date. But he
said Friday the date of his retirement is none of Washington's
business.
   Lopez said nothing prevents the general from commanding the
Defense Forces for several more years if he and the high command
see fit.
   Michael Kozak, the U.S. State Department envoy who has been
talking with Noriega's representatives in recent weeks, was still
in Panama on Saturday.
   Lopez, who described the talks as stalled, said Kozak might go
home this weekend. But he also said it was in the Reagan
administration's interest to make it appear that negotiations were
continuing, even if they offered scant hope of progress.
   ``In the middle of an election campaign, President Reagan, who
is backing (vice president) George Bush 100 percent, has to save
face because of the big bungle they've made,'' he said.
   Lopez's assessment of prospects for the talks was bleak.
   ``Kozak comes each time with the same plan _ the original plan a
little more elastic. It is a deadline for (Noriega) resigning his
post, a deadline for leaving the country.'' he said. ``It is a plan
that the general and the Panamanian republic cannot accept.''
   Noriega told reporters: ``The experiment of (U.S.) aggression
that exists in Panama is a testing ground that later could be
applied to Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica or any country.''
   The general faces other pressures, however, beyond those from
Washington. The country's economy is collapsing under the strain of
the crisis.
   A team of five respected economists published a study this week
saying production was half of normal because of U.S. sanctions and
banking restrictions. They said more than a quarter of the work
force will be unemployed within months, even if the political
crisis were resolved tomorrow.
   They raised the specter of hunger and said it would take at
least two years of intensive recovery measures and massive
international aid to get the economy back to a semblance of what it
was a year ago.
   They said recovery cannot even begin until the political crisis
stemming from Noriega's hold on power is settled.
   But that appears further off with each passing day.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the Christian Democratic
Party, is one of the few opposition leaders who has not gone
underground or into exile.
   He said Thursday that, though there are no more anti-government
street demonstrations and other protest has been quashed, ``The
crisis has deepened in that society simply refuses to function.''
   He said he believes Noriega realizes he cannot hold on
indefinitely.

   Atlantic Records celebrated its 40th birthday
Saturday with a marathon concert featuring performers from its
early years as a pioneering rhythm-and-blues label to its latest
pop and rock stars.
   A full house at Madison Square Garden heard the Coasters kick
off the show with a lively ``That is Rock 'n' Roll,'' then settled
in to hear the likes of Crosby, Stills & Nash, Roberta Flack,
Wilson Pickett, Phil Collins and Robert Plant.
   The Bee Gees and The Average White Band revived their dance hits
of the 1970s, and Yes and Foreigner pounded out the music that made
them mainstays of Atlantic's stable in the '70s and '80s.
   Debbie Gibson, the 17-year-old pop star from Long Island, said
she was excited to represent Atlantic's ``new generation'' and sang
a medley of her songs.
   Atlantic's roots in R&B and soul music were represented by
Wilson Pickett, LaVern Baker, Carla Thomas, Ben E. King and others,
as well as a tribute to the late Otis Redding. Baker called it a
``family reunion.''
   Pickett, on hand to perform his hits ``Land of 1,000 Dances''
and ``In the Midnight Hour,'' said the best part of the day was
``getting to see some of my old friends, like Ruth Brown. This is
really a gas for me.''
   After the Coasters' upbeat opening song, the show pulled back a
notch with ballads from Collins, Flack and Stephen Stills and
Graham Nash.
   But within an hour, the arena was cooking again to the British
soul of The Average White Band, the jumping jazz of Bobby Short and
the rich and rolling blues of Miss Brown, one of Atlantic's first
big stars.
   Atlantic's great contribution to the music world, Collins told
the audience, was ``showing it was all right for white kids to
listen to black music.''
   David Crosby, Stills and Nash teamed up for renditions of
``Wooden Ships,'' ``Our House'' and ``Carry On'' that were received
enthusiastically.
   Ken Ehrlich, producer of the extravaganza, said the influence of
early R&B artists are evident in Atlantic's younger rockers.
Saturday's show featured both ``the roots and the fruits'' of the
independent label, he said.
   All 11 hours of the show were sold to the British Broadcasting
Corp. for live transmission and Home Box Office scheduled about
four hours of the show Saturday night.

   Impeached former Gov. Evan Mecham, facing
trial this week on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan,
proclaimed faith in his innocence but uncertainty about whether he
will be acquitted.
   Mecham remained in the spotlight Saturday, attending his state
party convention and narrowly winning a seat at the Republican
National Convention.
   Mecham, who was removed from office April 4 by the Legislature,
could be sentenced to up to 22 years in prison if found guilty on
all six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing
false documents.
   His brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, Willard Mecham, will be
tried on three similar counts.
   The legal woes did not stop delegates to the state Republican
convention Saturday from picking Mecham to be one of the state's 33
delegates when the party convenes this summer in New Orleans.
   Mecham finished 17th in the balloting for 18 at-large delegates
after losing a bid for one of the delegate seats allocated by
congressional district.
   Mecham, one of the 717 delegates to his state party convention,
said before voting that he believed he had ``strong support'' from
rank-and-file party workers. Mecham supports Vice President George
Bush, but Bush campaign officials said Mecham was not on their list
of recommended delegates.
   Told the results by reporters, Mecham said ``Hurrah'' and thrust
his right fist upward. ``Well, for not being on a slate, that's not
too bad,'' he said, adding ``this was not a referendum on me.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., placed 10th in the at-large balloting
with 296 votes to Mecham's 271, and said he would attend the
convention despite earlier reluctance to serve in a delagation with
Mecham.
   ``Amazing,'' McCain said of the vote. ``I respect the decision
of the convention. I have no other comment about it.''
   In the criminal case, Mecham and his brother are accused of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan from Tempe developer Barry
Wolfson by failing to report it on Evan Mecham's personal or
campaign financial statements.
   ``I have committed no crime,'' Mecham, 64, said in a telephone
interview last week. ``I should be found innocent because I don't
feel myself guilty as far as I can see.''
   However, Mecham shied away from predicting he will be exonerated
by a Maricopa County Superior Court jury and indicated he still may
be open to a plea agreement if it didn't involve pleading guilty to
a felony, a condition that prosecutors have rejected previously.
   Mecham's 15-month governorship was a stormy one, beginning with
his cancellation of a Martin Luther King holiday for state workers
and ending with his repeated claims that his political and legal
problems were the result of a massive conspiracy.
   He was removed from office when the Senate convicted him of
trying to thwart an investigation into an alleged death threat and
misusing $80,000 from a protocol fund by loaning it to his auto
dealership.
   The Senate dismissed a charge stemming from the campaign loan
after some senators argued that voting on it would prejudice
Mecham's criminal case.
   On Monday, attorneys were set to present oral arguments before
the state Court of Appeals on a defense request to throw out the
indictment. If they fail there, defense attorneys plan to go to the
state Supreme Court.
   If there is no delay, jury selection is scheduled to begin
Thursday.
   In insisting that he broke no laws, Mecham has advanced several
arguments:
   _ That the October 1986 loan was actually reported properly
because it was lumped with other funds and listed as a $465,000
loan from Mecham to his campaign. The funds were lumped together as
a ``time-saving matter,'' Mecham said.
   _ That the failure to report the loan was an ``honest mistake''
by Willard Mecham, who filled out the financial reports ``the best
he knew how.''
   _ That Mecham is the victim of selective prosecution because
other public officials have amended their reports without facing
criminal charges.
   _ That in any case, whether the loan was properly reported or
not, there was no criminal intent to hide it.
   The prosecution, however, is expected to point to a letter from
Mecham to Wolfson in which he promised the loan would ``remain
confidential.'' Another key piece of evidence is a November 1986
receipt that showed a $350,000 contribution to the campaign from
Mecham, although he acknowledged he made no such contribution.
   None of the attorneys involved _ prosecutors Barnett Lotstein
and Michael Cudahy, Mecham defense lawyer Michael Scott and
Willard's attorney, Joe Keilp _ is tipping his hand on trial
strategy.
   But among the witnesses expected to be called are a number of
key players inside and outside the Mecham administration, including
former top aide Donna Carlson. She was one of several co-signers of
the Wolfson loan and later was the object of the alleged death
threat that became the centerpiece of Mecham's Senate impeachment
conviction.
   The governor's successor, Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, was
subpoenaed by the defense to testify about her knowledge of the
campaign finance reporting law. She herself is under investigation
for omissions from her reports, which she recently corrected.
   If the trial begins as scheduled, jury selection will start with
distribution of a questionnaire designed to ferret out people with
obvious bias.
   For his part, defense attorney Scott said, ``I'm confident that
he should be acquitted.'' But he added, ``I'm not confident that it
will happen.''

   Prominent mystery writers Friday auctioned off
everything from character's names to dinner with a novelist who
just signed a $10 million contract.
   The auction at the New York Public Library raised more than
$2,100 for the Mystery Writers of America, which is holding its
annual conference here this week.
   The highest bid was $320 for dinner with Mary Higgins Clark, who
recently signed a $10.1 million deal with Simon & Schuster to write
four novels and a book of short stories.
   Clark, 60, of Saddle River, N.J., has published five mystery
novels, including the recent bestseller ``Weep No More My Lady,''
since receiving a $3,000 advance for her first one in 1976.
   One of the most heated bidding wars developed over the right to
have the bidder's name included in Donald E. Westlake's next novel
and to write a line of dialogue. Justin Scott, 40, of New York, won
with a bid of $260.
   Scott said he is a good friend of Westlake's and wants a little
good-natured revenge because the author visited him recently for a
weekend _ and spent the time working on the first chapter of his
next novel.
   ``I paid $260. He will pay blood,'' he said.
   Signed, limited editions of books also were sold, as were movie
posters and a collection of Sherlock Holmes memorabilia.
   Judith Norton, 27, of Bethpage, got one of the best deals,
bidding $25 to attend a June writer's workshop in Illinois. The
workshop and hotel lodging were estimated to be worth $175.
   She also will receive a free manuscript critique by author Sara
N. Paretsky.
   ``Now I have to figure a way to get to Evanston'' where the
hotel is situated, she said. ``I think it's invaluable to go
somewhere else and meet successful writers.''

   Two Chinese men who hijacked a jetliner from the
mainland to Taiwan were air force veterans who had worked as radar
operators, the official China Daily said today. Taiwan said it was
weighing charges against the men.
   The report indicated that the hijackers' knowledge of air routes
foiled an attempt by the pilot to fly the Boeing 737 to Hong Kong
rather than land in Taiwan, seat of the rival Nationalist
government.
   In Taiwan, the country's chief security agency recommended today
that the two hijackers be prosecuted. The Taiwan Garrison Command
said the two violated Taiwan's civil aviation code.

hard to fashion trade legislation to scuttle it after President
Reagan's expected veto.

   In the hours after his car plunged off the

police that Mary Jo Kopechne was alone in the car, according to a
new book about the accident.
   In an account attributed to Kennedy cousin Joseph Gargan,
Kennedy told Gargan and a friend, Paul Markham, the morning after
the accident that ``I'm going to say that Mary Jo was driving.''
Kopechne drowned in the accident, which has shadowed Kennedy's

   The book, by Leo Damore, is ``Senatorial Privilege: The
Chappaquiddick Coverup,'' and is purportedly based, in part, on the
first extensive interviews Gargan has ever given for publication.
Gargan and Markham went with Kennedy to the bridge shortly after
the accident to try to rescue Kopechne from the submerged car.

<HEAD>Steel Workers' Struggle Wins Sympathy of West Germans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RHEINHAUSEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It wasn't typical for postwar
West Germany _ steel workers staging wildcat strikes, seizing a
bridge, setting up vigils, storming a corporate meeting.
   For six months the workers struggled to keep the Rheinhausen
Krupp steel mill from closing down, a victim of economic decline in
the Ruhr, the long-time industrial powerhouse of Germany.
   In the end, the workers lost their fight, widely covered by
newspapers and television, but they won hearts all across an
astonished nation.
   Celebrities, politicians, students, right wingers and left
wingers, even groups in the Soviet Union and East Germany, raised
voices of support.
   Donations of money came from around the country for workers
involved in West Germany's worst labor unrest in years.
   ``During the winter, wealthy women started collecting toys and
clothes for what they called `those poor Krupp children','' said
the Rev. Dieter Kelp, a Lutheran pastor.
   ``But I said, this isn't the Third World, and there hasn't been
any war or bombing. It's just a question of jobs.''
   Kelp had joined the workers in their vigils outside the plant's
front gate, sometimes standing in front of a cross with the word
``Solidaritaet'' (Solidarity) on it.
   ``Solidarity'' became part of the local vocabulary.
   ``Our workers' Solidarity fund got contributions from all over
Germany,'' said Rheinhausen's village manager, Hans Kleer. ``They
came from Flensburg in the north to Passau in the south.''
   West Germany's tiny Communist Party donated 260,000 marks
($160,000), the much larger Social Democrats roughly the same,
while businesses, ``average people'' and a host of others brought
the total to 1.3 million marks ($828,000), Kleer said.
   ``You have to be amazed at that much support.''
   The workers' representatives nevetheless admitted defeat May 3,
coming away only with a promise that the plant will stay open until
the end of 1990 and that efforts would be made to find other
opportunities for the 5,300 workers.
   Only a massive and unexpected reversal in the steel industry's
fortunes could keep Krupp from shutting the mill down after 1990.
   Company officials say the mill, 18 miles northwest of
Duesseldorf, has lost more than 1 billion marks ($613 million)
since 1980.
   ``The fight is over. It's a real defeat for us,'' said Mafred
Bruckschen, chairman of the Rheinhausen mill's works council, the
workers' representative body that agreed to the compromise.
   A Krupp spokesman, Hans-Juergen Berg, called it ``a victory of
reason.''
   The compromise provides for job placement at a nearby mill for
some workers, rehirings outside the steel industry, newly created
jobs and early retirements.
   But Bruckschen said workers now must concentrate on making sure
the new jobs come about. Many people have expressed doubts about
that, he said.
   During the workers' struggles, the word ``Rheinhausen'' became
synonymous with the economic decline of the Ruhr Valley.
   In the last two years, the area around Duisburg, the city that
includes Rheinhausen village, has lost 20,000 jobs, most of them in
the steel industry.
   Unemployment in Duisburg stands at 17.6 percent, compared with
the nationwide average of 8.9 percent.
   The work force in the steel industry, centered in the Ruhr, has
fallen to 150,000 from a peak of 500,000 in the 1960s.
   The Rheinhausen works was built in 1897, joining the Krupp
empire that later provided the German industrial muscle for two
world wars, and helped rebuilt the country over the past four
decades.
   Like other Ruhr steel plants, Rheinhausen has been hurt by
declining demand and competition from countries with low labor
costs.
   ``People have now realized how powerless politicians are,'' said
Herbert Leimkuehler, a member of the Krupp works council and a
Communist Party member. ``They've seen how just a handful of
managers can pass judgment on an entire region.''
   Mehmet Aslan, one of about 700 Turks working at Rheinhausen,
also talked of the politicians.
   ``The politicians say, `Go south and get work in Bavaria,''' he
said. ``But I know young people who've done that ... and couldn't
find apartments.
   ``Some of them wound up sleeping in cabins in the woods.''

<HEAD>Battle Over Public Education Divides Oregon County</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Oregon, which relies more than almost
any state on local property taxes to pay for schools, there's more
than money at stake in the acrimonious fight over one county's tax
vote Tuesday.
   Residents of southern Oregon's Josephine County are debating the
future of public education itself.
   One group, People United for Responsible Education, has
suggested leasing public schools to a private corporation, saying
the schools are too costly and inefficient.
   Supporters of the proposed multimillion-dollar property-tax
measures for the Grants Pass and Josephine County school districts
say the local economy is suffering because of uncertainty about
school funding. They believe children will suffer if the tax
measures are rejected.
   ``Public education is not the only means of achieving
education,'' argues Signe Carlson, president of the Josephine
County Taxpayers Association. ``We have a lot of private schools in
the county, a lot of parents who are involved in home schooling.''
   A political consultant enlisted to help pass the measures, C.
Montgomery Johnson, says the tax fight is the most divisive he's
seen in Oregon.
   ``I don't think the system of public education in Josephine
County is going to survive without constant support on the part of
folks, many of whom have given up,'' he says.
   Oregon's school-financing woes long have been blamed on the
state's dependence on the local property tax. The National
Education Association ranks Oregon third nationally in its reliance
on local revenue: 66.6 percent of its school financing comes from
property taxes. Oregon has no sales tax.
   ``The great, progressive state of Oregon ought to stick its head
under the pillow,'' Johnson says. ``It ought to be ashamed of the
way it funds public schools.''
   Josephine County voters are known for their strong anti-tax
sentiment, born of the 1970s tax revolt and maintained by the
well-organized and vocal taxpayers' association. Many residents
moved to the county to escape high land values and taxes in other
states.
   But many, too, consider public education the foundation of
democracy.
   ``We've had some professional people refuse to move here because
of the situation,'' says Susan Allen, a leader of a pro-schools
group formed several months ago in response to the anti-tax forces.
``We've had people putting their houses on the market because if
the tax bases do fail, they won't be able to sell them.''
   Carlson dismisses Johnson's claim that her association is out to
destroy public education. A teacher who left the profession in
1960, she insists the schools could be run more efficiently.
   ``We have the lowest per-capita income of any county in the
state, and yet the public employees, the teachers and
administrators, want the same salaries and benefits of everywhere
else,'' Carlson says.
   State figures, however, show the Josephine County district will
spend $3,335 per student this year while Grants Pass will spend
$3,627, well below the state average of $4,007.
   ``They're not on the bottom, but they're close to the bottom,''
says Walter Koscher, a statistician for the Oregon Education
Department in Salem.
   Oregon used to force schools to close when voters repeatedly
rejected tax measures. Last year Oregon voters approved the
so-called ``safety net'' law, which allows districts to levy the
previous year's property tax if voters won't approve more money.
   The safety net has its holes, however. If other revenue sources
decline and expenses rise, the previous tax levy quickly becomes
inadequate.
   Josephine County's school districts and their 9,800 students
face major staff and program cuts next fall if they fall into the
safety net again.
   The districts in recent years already cut staff, closed schools,
increased class sizes, and postponed equipment purchases. Some
school buses in Grants Pass have been on the road since 1959,
superintendent Dale Smith says.
   Smith says his school board will begin work on a $1.5 million
budget cut Wednesday if voters reject the city district's proposed
$12.2 million tax base.
   John Mayfield, county schools superintendent, says his district
faces a $2.5 million cut if its $14.3 million tax base is turned
down. That could mean 25 teacher layoffs and elimination of
extra-curricular activities and field trips, among other cuts, he
says.
   ``I'm embarrassed that the state would allow a district to do
the things we're looking at doing, the cuts in staff and
programs,'' Mayfield says. ``I'm embarrassed to live in a state
that would let that happen.''

   When Indiana Jones sought the Temple
of Doom in India, he was really doing it in Sri Lanka. Likewise,
when Tarzan romped through the jungle he was not in Africa but near
the Sri Lankan hill town of Kandy.
   The late filmmaker Sir Carol Reed once referred to Sri Lanka as
``the most natural and complete outdoor set,'' and this island
nation, despite its long war by Tamil militants for a separate
homeland, continues to lure American and British moviemakers.
   The fight by Tamil guerrillas for an independent nation for
their minority people broke out in 1983. The Tamils, who are 18
percent of the island's 16 million people, claim they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese.
   Since 1980, at least seven major films have been produced around
the lush mountains, dense jungles, rivers and waterfalls near
Kandy, barely a three-hour drive into the hills from the capital of
Colombo.
   Villages near Kandy, once the capital of a Buddhist kingdom,
have been villages everywhere from Vietnam to Africa in various
movies.
   ``Sri Lanka has managed to cheat as countries like India,
Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines,'' said Asoka Perera,
managing director of Sri Lanka Film Locations Limited.
   Perera's company helps scout locations for movies, and he said
Sri Lanka's success in drawing filmmakers is due to a lack of red
tape involved in shooting here.
   One of the first major movies made in Sri Lanka was in 1956 when
director David Lean filmed his hit movie ``Bridge on the River
Kwai'' on the island, then known as Ceylon. The film about British
POWs in Burma who are forced to build a bridge for the Japanese
during World War II, won six Academy Awards.
   The movie was set partly here, so when William Holden escaped a
Japanese prison on Burma and made his way through fierce jungle and
across sun-baked seas to a British base on Ceylon, he was really
just around the corner from where he started.
   Paramount's ``The Purple Plain'' with Gregory Peck, also about
the Burma campaign during World War II, and ``Elephant Walk''
starring Elizabeth Taylor in a movie about a Ceylon tea plantation,
were both made in 1954.
   But Sri Lanka lost out as a location for foreign movies from
1970-77 when the pro-socialist government led by the Sri Lankan
Freedom Party viewed anything coming from the West as decadent.
   It was not until 1980 that the trend was reversed when John
Derek's ``Tarzan the Apeman'' was filmed starring his wife, Bo
Derek, and Richard Harris.
   Since then, movies shot in Sri Lanka have included the George
Lucas-Steven Spielberg ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'';
``Mountbatten _ the Last Viceroy''; ``Light Over the Water,'' which
was set partly in Australia; ``Further Adventures of Tennessee
Buck,'' in which Sri Lanka masquerades as Africa; and ``Jungle
Heat,'' in which the country plays itself.
   ``Iron Triangle,'' about an American troop operation in Vietnam,
completed production here in February and is to be released later
this year. It stars Beau Bridges and Haing S. Ngor, who won an
Academy Award for supporting actor in Roland Joffe's critically
acclaimed ``The Killing Fields.''
   Jayantha Jayatillaka, of Sri Lanka Film Locations Limited, said
films made here earn the country needed foreign exchange and give a
boost to the tourist industry. Expenditures on filming in Sri Lanka
were reported to be $8 million for ``Indiana Jones,'' $5 million
for ``Tarzan the Apeman'' and $3 million for ``Iron Triangle.
   Sri Lanka's mix of cultures also helps producers find ``extras''
for their projects, thus reducing their costs, Jayatillaka said.
   ``For the making of `Iron Triangle,' Sri Lankans of Chinese
descent and those who were descendants of traders from Malaysia
were recruited to play Vietnamese,'' he said.
   But Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict, born from that same cultural
mix, has blocked filming on some parts of the island, Perera said.
   ``Some of the scenes of `Tarzan the Apeman' were filmed at the
beaches in eastern Trincomalee district in 1980 before the violence
broke out,'' he said. ``Since 1983, we have to stay clear of the
north and east despite the fact there are some beautiful locations
there.''
   But Perera said spectacular scenery and miles of palm-lined
beaches exist elsewhere on the island.
   The island is being considered for a movie about a journalist in
the Philippines during the overthrow of President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The movie's star, Rebecca Gilling of the Australian TV series
``Return to Eden,'' was recently in Colombo with producer Bob
Markowitz. Keeping with the international spirit of moviemaking
here, the production is being handled by an Australian company.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boasting experienced and cheap
crews and what it says are the biggest film studios in Europe,
Czechoslovakia lures Western producers to make movies they say they
could barely afford to film at home.
   The latest foreign films being made in Czechoslovakia are an
American-West German co-production starring Faye Dunaway and
Klaus-Maria Brandauer, and a British family fantasy ``The Wolves of
Willoughy'' featuring American soap opera queen Stephanie Beacham.
   According to Mark Forstater, producer of ``Wolves,'' he saved
about $2.8 million, or 40 percent of total production costs, by
making the film in Czechoslovakia and not in Britain.
   Other advantages were guaranteed snow _ not often seen in
southern England in March _ and a manor house near the Bohemian
town of Hradec Kralove that Forstater said was a perfect 1850 copy
of an English manor house.
   He also had the good, cheap craftsmanship of the setmakers at
Prague's Barrandov studios, billed as the largest in Europe.
   In March, the second tract of the studios was transformed into a
huge and gloomy Victorian laundry with an enormous cauldron in one
corner. Ragged orphans, played by some of the 100 Czech children
chosen to take part in the movie, washed clothes on a set that gave
the feeling of stepping into a Charles Dickens novel.
   Beacham said in an interview that she was embarrassed by the
disparity of wages between herself and the Czech crews.
   ``We work long hours, but we get paid for it,'' she sighed.
   There are five categories for remuneration of local actors. A
senior Czech actor can get up to $90 a day, but most crew members
would get much less. Overtime is not paid.
   What Beacham did enjoy was not being known or recognized in
Prague streets. ``It's lovely; it's great freedom,'' she said.
``When I get a wolf whistle, it's for me and not for my TV role.''
   The biggest complaint on the set was the scarcity of vegetables.
   Forstater said the crew sent a bus to West Germany once a week
to get produce. ``Usually when I ask people what I'm to bring when
they are on location, they ask for chocolates. Here they want
carrots and cauliflower,'' said food consultant Sara Keen.
   The language barrier also sometimes posed a problem. Czech
handlers for the 16 Alsatian dogs dressed up to look like wolves
had to get their commands translated from English, and then
instruct the dogs.
   But the Czechs are used to coping with such difficulties.
Prague's state-owned film company first made a film for the West in
1958, when Walt Disney Productions hired them to produce ``Popeye,
the Sailor Man'' and ``Tom and Jerry.''
   In 1964, the West Germans made the first full-length feature
film shot by Westerners in Czechoslovakia. Business slowly built
up, until Czechoslovakia had a $3.4 million turnover in
co-productions and foreign orders by the end of the 1960s.
   Now, five or six full-length foreign features, mostly West
German, about 30 short films and 10-15 TV films are made each year.
   The most famous films made in Czechoslovakia in recent years
include ``Slaughterhouse Five,'' the film version of Kurt
Vonnegut's anti-war fantasy novel made in 1971; ``All Quiet on the
Western Front,'' a remake of the 1930 classic shot in derelict
miners' houses and open cast mines in 1979; Barbra Streisand's
``Yentl'' in 1982; and the Academy Award-winning ``Amadeus'' in
1983.

<HEAD>Cuban Detainees Find Freedom or Frustration in Wake of Riots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STRAT DOUTHAT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after desperate Cuban detainees took
138 hostages and seized control of federal prisons in Atlanta and
Oakdale, La., the government is paroling them in unprecedented
numbers.
   But the government program baffles some of the inmates and their
lawyers. They complain that the parole policy is incoherent and
inconsistent, quickly releasing scores of men yet keeping hundreds
with sometimes minor criminal records behind bars without apparent
reason.
   According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 1,093
detainees have been freed since the uprisings, compared with 92
released in the six months preceding the riots. INS officials deny
the uprisings prompted the accelerated release policy.
   In all, since the riots ended in early December, 2,224 Cubans
have been recommended for release and 1,208 have been deemed unfit
for the streets, said Duke Austin, spokesman for the INS in
Washington. Twenty-four detainees have been marked for deportation,
and 300 more will have their fates decided in panel reviews by May
31.
   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III promised the full reviews
as part of an agreement that ended the riots, in which one Atlanta
detainee was killed and several others were injured. None of the
hostages was injured.
   The 2,400 men in detention at Atlanta and Oakdale last fall had
committed crimes after arriving in this country from the Cuban port
of Mariel in 1980, when Fidel Castro allowed 125,000 Cubans to
leave.
   At the time of the riots, however, the detainees had served
their sentences and were being held indefinitely at the behest of
the INS.
   Some had been held in this legal limbo for more than four years
when they learned that the State Department and Cuba had
reactivated a 1984 agreement for deportation of ``excludable''
immigrants.
   The Oakdale center erupted in flames on Nov. 21; the Atlanta
prison fell to the Cubans two days later. The Justice Department
would later lay partial blame for the riots on the scant four-hour
notice given prison officials by the State Department.
   The Louisiana siege ended after eight days, but Atlanta's
uprising went on until Dec. 4, becoming one of the longest in
federal prison history. Damage at the two prisons was estimated at
$64 million.
   The prisons were shut down, and the detainees, some of whom
insisted they would rather die than return to Cuba, were scattered
to prisons across the country. Since then, most of have been held
in ``lockdown'' status, confined to special seclusion areas 23
hours a day.
   ``They just sit in those cells, waiting and getting depressed,''
said Linda Serrano of Atlanta, whose common-law husband, Manuel
Casalis Noy, was approved for parole in November but has yet to be
released.
   Despite the release statistics, some advocates for the detainees
_ including Bishop Augustin Roman of Miami, who helped end the
sieges _ maintain the government has not completely lived up to its
promise.
   ``The detainees aren't being given full reviews, they're just
being interviewed. What's more, the government doesn't even make an
official record of these panel reviews, something you must have if
there is to be an effective appeal process,'' said Karen Ellingson,
a Legal Aid attorney in Minneapolis who has sat in on more than 70
interviews conducted by the 20 two-person INS review teams.
   The pace of the reviews has stepped up since the riots, detainee
advocates say.
   Late last month, U.S. Justice Department spokesman Patrick
Korten said the accelerated, post-riot releases reflected a more
liberal parole policy. However, Craig Raynsford, associate counsel
at INS, said, ``I assure you these people are not being more
favorably treated because they rioted.''
   He said the number of parolees has risen sharply because the
review procedure implemented last June was slow and laborious, and
only recently began to bring about large numbers of releases.
   ``There's a cumulative effect at work here,'' he said. ``Our
parole approval rate remains slightly above 60 percent, the same as
it was before the riots.''
   Gary LeShaw, an attorney who works with the Atlanta-based
Coalition to Support Cuban Detainees, said his office is still
swamped with calls for help. More than 1,100 men approved for
release remain in prison ``for one reason or another, such as a
shortage of halfway houses or lack of sponsors,'' he said.
   Supporters of the detainees note that, prior to the riots, all
but about 20 of the releases were to halfway houses. Since
December, hundreds of detainees have been freed directly to their
families and sponsors.
   ``Some detainees are being released right away, almost pushed
out onto the street, while others, including some who have good
prison records and committed far less serious crimes, remain behind
bars for months,'' said LeShaw. ``Nobody seems to know what's going
on.''
   Although the 20 review teams might differ in style and approach,
Raynsford said all look for the same thing in making
recommendations: ``Whether the detainee is presently non-violent
and likely to stay that way, whether he is likely to present a
threat to the community, and whether he is likely to violate his
parole.''
   He also noted that a special appeals tier had been created for
detainees who are turned down for parole. Even those who have been
scheduled for ``repatriation'' to Cuba can appeal.
   ``But these are just paper appeals,'' said Ms. Ellingson. ``You
don't get to face your accusers. Besides, it's just another case of
the INS, which has been responsible for the incarceration of the
detainees, acting as their judge and jury.''
   She gave a recent experience as an example of why the process is
so frustrating:
   ``Officials of Dismas House, a non-profit facility in Kansas
City, recently interviewed 45 detainees who had been approved for
parole. The halfway house took 18 of them and left the others
stranded in prison, not even knowing why they weren't selected,
much less when they would be released.''
   Asked why, the director of Dismas House, the Rev. Everett
Thornton, said he had room for only 18 detainees. ``We try and look
for motivation, that's the most important thing,'' he said.
   But Ms. Ellingson said other factors are involved, such as a
detainee's appearance and his ability to speak English, ``things
that really shouldn't matter that much.''
   Even some detainees who have been released question the fairness
of the INS process. One of them is Mario Ochoa of Brooklyn, who was
released in March, just three weeks after his panel hearing.
   ``I think I was released so quick because my wife went to
Washington several times and talked to congressmen and reporters
about my case; she really worked hard for me,'' said Ochoa, who
finished serving 26 months in 1986 for possession of a deadly
weapon with intent to use it.
   ``But,'' he added, ``I'm one of the lucky ones. There are others
still in lockdown who have good records and committed lesser crimes
than I did. I really can't figure out what's going on.''

   The resurrection of the Oakdale Federal
Detention Center is under way, six months after it was nearly
destroyed by rioting Cubans and none too soon for many Allen Parish
residents.
   ``If it reopened tomorrow, it would be six months too late,''
said Sandy Strother, a 25-year-old resident of this south central
Louisiana town of 7,200.
   ``I'm ready for it to reopen,'' she said. ``In fact, I've
applied for a job there.''
   Last Nov. 21, the 1,000 Cubans held here pending federal
decision on their future went on a rampage at the news that some
would be deported to their native land. They burned 10 of the 14
buildings at the $17 million center and took 28 guards hostage.
   Two days later, Cubans at the federal penitentiary in Atlanta
followed suit. That uprising lasted until Dec. 4, while the siege
at Oakdale ended after eight days.
   Assistant Warden Art Espinoza, a 25-year veteran of the U.S.
Bureau of Prisons, arrived at the Oakdale center the night before
the Cubans rioted.
   ``I've been through riots, but I've never been to a place before
where they burned the place down,'' Espinoza said.
   A pair of dormitories, which escaped with only broken windows
and some minor damage, serve as temporary administration offices
and housing for about 45 inmates maintaining the site.
   Inside, bright white, orange and yellow paint makes the
dormitories nicer than those on some college campuses. There are no
steel-gray cells with bars and wire mesh here.
   ``If you would have walked in the first day after it was over,
you would never have believed people who lived here would have
destroyed it, as nice as it was,'' Espinoza said.
   Despite the destruction, Espinoza said he had no animosity
toward the Cubans. ``Inmates are inmates. Just because they burned
the place down we can't say we don't want those types here,'' he
said.
   A Justice Department report released earlier this month placed
some of the blame for the Oakdale and Atlanta riots on prison
officials. It said they failed to recognize signs of impending
trouble.
   The report also said placing Cubans at the Oakdale facility, a
low- to medium-security alien processing center, was a ``calculated
risk.''
   Espinoza said rebuilding the center will cost more than $13
million and should be finished by Oct. 1. The prison should being
taking new inmates by November.
   Oakdale Mayor George Mowad said he'd been assured by federal
officials that the prison would not again be home to a large group
of a single type of illegals, such as the Cubans from the 1980
Mariel boatlift.
   ``Any concentration of Cubans, our people would be upset with,''
Mowad said. ``The people of Oakdale were very proud of that
facility. And then to go out and see it destroyed ... it was hard.''
   Mowad says those worries aren't enough to keep the town from
eagerly anticipating the prison's reopening. ``We had 100 percent
support for it before it burned. After the riot it dropped to about
90 percent, but we've got most of those people back.''
   After the Oakdale center is rebuilt, a second phase called
Oakdale II is tentatively scheduled to open in November 1989, Mowad
said. With both facilities operating, the 500 federal jobs would
make the detention center the city's No. 1 employer.
   Each month since the riot, Oakdale has lost $6,000 in water,
sewer and sales tax revenue, Mowad said.
   A few reminders of the uprising remain. The once landscaped
grounds and paths at the prison now have patches of bare earth
glaring in the sun.
   In some areas not yet scrubbed and repainted, slogans remain,
such as ``Muertos No Cuba'' _ ``Death, Not Cuba.''

   These days, a visitor can drive directly through
wide-open iron gates and park within 20 yards of the U.S.
Penitentiary's front steps.
   Those are the same steps descended by 89 hostages when they
poured out of the prison last Dec. 4, ending an 11-day uprising by
more than 1,100 Cuban inmates.
   The penitentiary then was less a prison than a badly damaged
fortress under siege. The front steps, patrolled constantly by
armed federal officers, led to a building only partly controlled by
authorities. The rest was in the hands of Cuban detainees, who
rioted at word of a deportation agreement with Fidel Castro.
   When it was all over, the prison was emptied of all inmates for
the first time since it opened in 1902 and officials began cleaning
up the damage. Officials estimated the damage here and in Oakdale,
La., where Cuban inmates staged a similar uprising, at $64 million.
   Now, 600 inmates, all Americans, are housed at the prison,
compared with about 200 Americans and 1,400 Cuban inmates at the
time of the takeover. In two years, the number is to reach 800 to
850. So far, there are no plans to bring Cuban detainees to
Atlanta, said Mike Caltabiano, executive assistant to Warden Joseph
Petrovsky.
   The riot interrupted a $63 million, five-year renovation
project, but many of the areas damaged were to be razed in the
renovation anyway, Caltabiano said.
   The only real loss, he said, was the burned-out prison
industries building.
   A temporary industries unit has been set up in a former
gymnasium. There, inmates repairing mailbags and making mattresses
and meteorological parachutes earned $500,000 for the prison in
April, Caltabiano said.
   A 20-foot-high chain link fence is being erected to cut the
prison almost in half. Behind it, most of the construction will go
on. The first phase of the renovation project is to be completed
next year.
   Elsewhere, vandalism in the dining hall and chapel has been
repaired.
   ``It's been the positive attitude of the staff that's made it,
by putting this kind of thing behind them and saying, `OK, we're
going to see how we can rebuild Atlanta,''' Caltabiano said.
   The prison is ``Atlanta'' or ``USP (U.S. Penitentiary) Atlanta''
to its employees. It was known as the ``Big A'' to decades of
inmates, including the famous and the infamous.
   At the dawn of the 1920s, the ``Big A'' was home to Socialist
presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs, who was imprisoned for a
speech condemning war in World War I. It held Al Capone in the
1930s, Soviet spy Rudolph Able in the 1950s and Mafia informant Joe
Valachi in the 1960s.
   In the late 1970s, there were 16 slayings at the prison, many
described as professional ``hits'' related to drug sales. By 1978,
a report by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons suggested closing the
penitentiary because its old design and deteriorating structures
made security impossible.
   The prison was to have been closed by the fall of 1984.
   But the number of Cuban inmates, detained during the Mariel
boatlift because of their records in Cuba or imprisoned later for
offenses in the United States, mounted.
   Violence again was a problem. The Bureau of Prisons reported the
Atlanta pen had less than 10 percent of all federal prisoners, but
almost 20 percent of all assaults on inmates or guards.
   The Cubans frequently protested prison conditions but more often
complained that they were being detained at all. The final uprising
was triggered by word that deportations to Cuba would resume.

   Scott Sutterfield spends his nights at the federal detention
center in Oakdale, La., trying to forget the nightmare he lived
through last fall, when he felt like a pawn in an eight-day
stalemate between rioting Cuban inmates and federal officials.
   Sutterfield was one of 28 hostages taken Nov. 21 by Cubans who
rioted at Oakdale after a State Department announcement of a pact
with Cuba to return some of the detainees to their homeland.
   Twenty-six of the hostages were held until the siege ended Nov.
29. Sutterfield was among them.
   ``That's a feeling you never forget,'' Sutterfield said. ``You
just try to forget and get back to work.''
   Dentist Jack Belchinsky, chief medical officer of the federal
penitentiary in Atlanta, was among 108 people taken hostage there
two days after the Oakdale uprising. His freedom came 11 days later.
   He said he decided to jump right back into work as his way of
dealing with the ordeal. But in a recent interview, he lashed out
at the State Department for ``ill-advised ... stupid remarks''
regarding the deal with Cuba, and for giving prison officials so
little notice of the pact.
   Of the 108 guards and other prison workers taken hostage in
Atlanta, 91 have returned to work with the Bureau of Prisons,
although not all of them in Atlanta. Mike Caltabiano, executive
assistant to the warden, said 16 had yet to return to work and one
had resigned.
   Authorities declined to say how many of the Oakdale captives
have returned to work.
   After the riot, Sutterfield went to a temporary duty post at a
federal prison in Denver. He is now back at Oakdale supervising
inmates on the graveyard shift.
   Although he's eager for reconstruction to be completed at the
prison so it can start receiving inmates and he can get back to
being a guard, he says he still remembers fearing for his life
during the riot.
   ``Every time the helicopters would come up, (the inmates) would
handcuff us to chairs and stand ready to kill us,'' he recalled.
``Even today, hearing a helicopter _ that's one thing that brings
it back.
   ``Having to deal with dying so many times over, you got to the
point where you thought, `If it's going to happen, let's get it
over with,''' he said.
   ``A lot of people still have a problem with it. They still have
nightmares.''
   Lt. Douglas Howington, who as captain of the guard at the time
of the Atlanta riot was the highest-ranking hostage, said he was
more frightened after the episode after ``hearing that there were
so-called death squads out'' to get him. ``That even bothers me
now.''
   ``In that 1,600 Cuban group, there were 300 or 400
incorrigibles, no doubt about that,'' Belchinsky said. ``But thank
goodness the other 1,200's opinion kind of pervaded and kept those
guys down.''
   Sutterfield, 22, said counseling with others who'd been held
hostage had helped him.
   ``I don't have any bad feelings towards the Cubans,''
Sutterfield said. ``I sympathize with their cause, but the way they
went about achieving their goals I hold against them.
   ``It's hard to say whether I could work with (Cuban inmates)
again. I'd have to give it a try.''
   U.S. Bureau of Prison officials say they have not decided what
the mission of the Oakdale center will be after renovation is
finished.
   Belchinsky and others held hostage in Atlanta say government
officials must stand by pledges made or implied to the Cubans.
   ``Hopefully they'll come through with them,'' he said, ``because
there are other Cubans in the system and if they see that Uncle Sam
doesn't keep his word, it could be maybe a problem for other staff
in other institutions, saying `Hey, they lied to us the first time.
If we get control again, we might kill people.'''

   The letters pour in, 30 to 50 a day, from federal
prisons in Colorado, Michigan, Kansas, Virginia.
   Some of the letters to Roman Catholic Bishop Agustin Roman begin
with a cheery ``Hello, Agustin.'' But they quickly turn into
desperate pleas for help.
   Six months after he helped end riots by Cubans detained at
federal facilities in Oakdale, La., and Atlanta, Roman cannot
understand why hundreds of them, even those with jobs and families
waiting outside, sit in federal prisons throughout the country,
fearful they will be deported to their Communist-governed island.
   ``I don't think the government has broken the agreement they
signed,'' Roman said in a recent interview. ``But they have not
kept the spirit of the agreement.''
   The soft-spoken 60-year-old Roman, who was expelled from Cuba
after Fidel Castro's takeover and became the highest-ranking
Cuban-born priest in the Miami archdiocese, was the key guarantor
of the pact that helped end the fiery uprisings in Atlanta and
Oakdale.
   Roman, already well-known in Miami's Cuban community, was called
to the Oakdale negotiations by prison rioters. When he arrived, he
told the inmates, may of whom wept at the sight of him, to lay down
their arms. They obeyed.
   Inmates in Atlanta and their supporters in Miami then demanded
Roman negotiate at the penitentiary as well. But nervous government
officials said they were reluctant to bring him in, fearing that if
he failed the riot would turn uglier.
   Instead they negotiated an agreement with the inmates by
promising to have Roman monitor the agreement. Roman attended the
signing ceremony that ended the siege.
   The agreement promised that prisoners would have their cases
reviewed in exchange for releasing their hostages. The inmates were
dispersed, and the prisons closed.
   Roman helped set up a task force to monitor the pact; he meets
each Monday with its members for the latest news. For the most
part, it hasn't been good.
   Roman points to the file of a prisoner officially given his
release in November, but still waiting inside a federal prison.
   ``These are people who have completed their sentences, sometimes
as much as three years ago,'' he said. ``They have families, they
have jobs waiting, but still they are not free.''
   He shows a computer printout containing more than 1,000 names of
prisoners he says could be released immediately, yet are hung up in
red tape.
   The riots followed news of an agreement between the United
States and Cuba for the deportation of ``excludable'' immigrants.
   ``What started all this is the terror of deportation,'' Roman
said. ``Terror of deportation to a country that we know does not
respect human rights _ and that terror continues.''
   He and members of his committee feel the promises made during
the uprising are fading. Even though Cubans are gradually being
released under a review program, Roman says his committee doesn't
understand ``why some people without families are being released to
the streets, while those with families are not.''
   The situation is especially frustrating to families who must
painstakingly look for jobs for their loved ones before the inmates
can be released. Sometimes, the jobs are gone before the government
has acted.
   Those who do get out are a good bet to stay out, the bishop
says. He runs a special 15-week counseling session for released
prisoners and their families. They recently had a mass meeting of
members of the program, and Roman says every ex-prisoner had a job.
   Despite the publicity that dogged him during the riots, Roman
said his life remains the same.
   ``For a clergyman, for a bishop, when one problem ends, another
one begins,'' he said. ``We know clearly that we are on a trail of
troubles our whole life, a very narrow trail.''

   Linda Serrano is philosophical when she talks
about the bureaucracy of the U.S. Immigration And Naturalization
Service, but there's an underlying current of anger in her voice.
   ``I've tried and tried to find out why they won't let Manuel
come home but so far nobody has explained it in a way that makes
sense,'' she said in an interview.
   Her common-law husband, 46-year-old Manuel Casalis Noy, an
inmate at the federal prison in Lompoc, Calif., is one of some
1,100 Cubans in federal detention who have been approved for parole
but are still awaiting release.
   Jorge Figueiras has been paroled. But his wife, Reyna Ordonez,
still fears he might be deported because of the damage done by the
Cubans during the uprisings last fall at prisons in Atlanta and
Oakdale, La.
   ``The United States is not going to let this go by,'' said
Ordonez. ``Some way, I think they'll make them pay.''
   Casalis Noy arrived in this country in the 1980 Mariel boatlift
and later served eight months in a California prison for possession
of cocaine. When his time was up, however, the INS sent him to the
federal penitentiary in Atlanta, where some 1,400 other Cubans with
criminal records waited to learn what lay in store for them.
   ``Manuel was brought to Atlanta in December 1985, and we came
here from California, three months later,'' said Serrano, who lives
with her two children from a previous relationship and works as a
nanny-housekeeper for an Atlanta family.
   While trying to get paroled, she said, her husband worked in
prison industries and kept out of trouble.
   ``He was sending us money, up to $100 a month there for a
while,'' she said. ``And we could see him every week. Then, last
November, he finally was approved for parole. Everything looked
great, I even had a job lined up for him.''
   Then came the riots. The Cubans detained in Atlanta and Oakdale
were moved to prisons throughout the country.
   ``That messed everything up,'' Serrano said. ``But when I
finally tracked Manuel down in late December I was told he was
going to have to go to a halfway house somewhere.''
   Serrano said she began trying to get her man sent home instead.
After numerous dead-ends, she said, she reached a Bureau of Prisons
official working with the INS in Washington, D.C.
   ``She told me Manuel couldn't come home because he was on the
list to go a halfway house,'' Serrano said. ``But I told her I had
made a good home here and that I know a lot of detainees are being
sent home and they did crimes a lot worse than Manuel did. Besides,
there's a long wait to get into the halfway houses.''
   In the six months since the riots, the INS has sent hundreds of
detainees home. Some, like Mario Ochoa, were paroled within a few
weeks of their interviews by a two-person INS panel.
   Ochoa, who served 26 months for possession of a dangerous weapon
with intent to use it, said he was released and sent home to
Brooklyn, N.Y., just three weeks after his interview.
   He credited his quick release to his wife's contacts with
congressmen and reporters.
   He said he was puzzled that some Cubans convicted of lesser
crimes remain behind bars. INS officials refuse to discuss the
cases of individual detainees with reporters.
   Figueiras was transferred to a federal facility in Kansas City,
Kan., after the riot. He has since been released to a halfway house
and now has his own apartment in a Kansas City suburb, his wife
says.
   Figueiras must serve his eight-month parole in the area. Ordonez
has sent two of her children to be with him and says she will make
the trip with her remaining two children when she saves enough
money.
   ``It's good news that he's out, but right now we're going
through hard times,'' she said.
   Ordonez is the only one who remains of a small group of Cuban
women who had moved to Oakdale to be near their husbands and
relatives inside the prison.
   ``The people here (in Oakdale), they still don't like us,'' she
said. ``My older kids, they were always crying, `We want to leave
here.'
   ``For me, I'm still afraid,'' she said. ``The small children
play together, but I stay inside by myself.
   ``If I had the money in my hand I'd be gone right now.''

<HEAD>The Right To Write: Should Regan Have Kissed And Told?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington was talking last week about two
things: what Donald Regan said and whether he should have said it.
   Beyond the spate of jokes produced by his revelations about Mrs.
Reagan's fascination with astrology and the president's passive
management style, there arose a debate over the ethics of
kiss-and-tell books.
   ``If you want to contribute to history, it won't hurt to wait
until the administration is over,'' said Sheila Tate, Mrs. Reagan's
former spokeswoman.
   But George E. Reedy, former press secretary to President Lyndon
B. Johnson, said administration figures should be able to tell
their stories whenever they wish.
   ``Speech in this country is free,'' says Reedy, who teaches
journalism ethics at Marquette University. ``Unless those people
had agreed that they would not do anything like this, I can't see
it as being unethical.''
   Regan's book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street to
Washington,'' is a biting account that some feel weakens an already
lame-duck presidency. He portrays a choeographed president,
manipulated by aides and by a wife who depends on an astrologist
for guidance in fixing the president's schedule.
   President Reagan has denounced the book as ``a bunch of
falsehoods'' and a ``breach of confidence'' but not given a
detailed rebuttal.
   Being kissed by the heady power of the White House and then
publicly telling the story, especially when the president still
sits in the Oval Office, is to some dishonorable, to others a
valuable contribution to history.
   The president's former chief of staff, ousted from the White
House last year in a move widely believed engineered by Mrs.
Reagan, says he never considered delaying his tale.
   ``I didn't set the time of my leaving this administration and I
don't know why I should hold up ... Many people have left this
administration and told their stories. Why not my book?'' he said
in an interview.
   His is one of several negative accounts by former Reagan
officials.
   Former White House spokesman Larry Speakes offered damaging
characterizations of former colleagues in his book, ``Speaking
Out.'' He says he may have overstepped ``the bounds of propriety in
some instances'' but addes: ``I apologize not for the truth in my
book _ nor the telling of it.''
   David Stockman, Reagan's former budget director, caused a furor
two years ago with ``The Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan
Revolution Failed,'' which lays out errors in judgment and
miscalculations Stockman says were responsible for adding $1
trillion to the national debt.
   ``I wrote the book because I have an ax to grind,'' he said
then, and to correct ``a gigantic mishap of governance.''
   Ironically, one of those who warned Stockman against being too
candid was Regan, then treasury secretary.
   Just why the Reagan-era books have been so angry and revealing
is a provocative question.
   Reedy says he has never encountered books ``as violent'' as
those spawned by the Reagan presidency and adds: ``There is
obviously something in that White House that is filling people with
a sense of rage.''
   Mrs. Tate, the first lady's former spokeswoman, dismisses that
theory.
   ``This is not a problem peculiar to the Reagan administration,''
she says. ``There's big money being offered and staff have become
more powerful. It's the cult of the personality. A lot of people
who worked in the White House in the '50s were nameless and
faceless. In the '80s they have high-profile jobs that bring a lot
of personal attention to them.''
   James David Barber, a Duke University political science
professor who studies presidential character, notes that the Reagan
books have a ``remarkable consistency in the picture they convey of
this White House.''
   ``Where is the book that overwhelmingly corrects these
supposedly false and unjust smear jobs ... that straightens it all
out, that shows that the president was really in charge?'' he asks.
   He believes such books help citizens learn how policymakers do
their jobs and whether their ``values are right.''
   That thought is echoed by historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who
says these memoirs are a ``venerable genre in American political
literature'' that should not be withheld.
   ``How else can history be written if those who make it take vows
of silence?'' he said.
   Samuel Kernell, a political science professor at the University
of California at San Diego who is studying the White House staff,
says the proliferation of such books reflects ``the growth of the
White House and the centralization of power'' in unknown people
making vital decisions.
   He notes that the White House staff has grown from about 40
people in 1939 to nearly 500 today. Those people ``have tremendous
influence on American policy. So we're naturally curious about
them. That's why they get on the cover of Time magazine and why
their books are marketable.''
   On the other hand, telling how an administration operates while
it is still operating can put a damper on administration programs.
   ``The proposition that there even are going to be kiss-and-tell
books does erode the sense of collegiality within government,''
says Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution scholar who served on
the Eisenhower and Nixon staffs and has studied the presidency and
the press.
   ``If you sit there at a table and you know that everybody is
going to run back and write in their diary, it will affect what you
can say and how you say it,'' Hess says. ``It becomes simply an
ethical consideration, based on each person's moral code, whether
they're going to tell tales out of school. It tells you something
about those people.''
   Some have suggested presidents ask incoming aides to sign a
promise not to write until later.
   ``What ever happened to the First Amendment?'' Regan says in
response. ``Don't we have as much right to write? I could see if
that applied to state secrets. But I don't describe how to make an
atomic bomb.''
   Jody Powell, President Carter's press secretary who wrote a book
targeting the Washington press corps, says he promised his
administration colleagues ``they weren't ever going to have to see
their top-of-the-head statements and analyses tossed back at them
years later'' in one of his books.
   Powell says the promise was his idea and was not put into any
formal agreement. Many feel such agreements, probably unforceable
in any case, would only underscore an atmosphere of distrust.
   There may always be people who put loyalty to the president
behind the prospect of financial gain, celebrity status or avenging
some real or imagined slight.
   ``Presidents get what they deserve. They either generate a sense
of loyalty among the members of their staff or they don't,'' says
Reedy.
   Regan bristles at the notion that he has been disloyal and
recalls how he was ``hounded out of my office.'' Loyalty, he says,
is a two-way proposition.
   In the end, says Regan, ``I could either write this book and
tell the whole truth or not write the book at all. I chose to write
the book.''

<HEAD>Eric Roberts Stars in Drama Behind Vietnam Veterans Wall</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Eric Roberts says he first saw the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial at daybreak as he re-created the story of how the
wall became a reality in the NBC movie ``To Heal a Nation.''
   ``I'd never seen it before and I got there just as the sun came
up,'' said Roberts. ``I was the first person that day to walk its
length. Halfway, I saw my reflection. I narrowed my focus to just
one name.
   ``The wall became very dear to me. It has the names of
50,000-plus boys who died serving our country, for better or worse.
I was devastated and very proud to portray the man responsible for
the fact that it was standing there.''
   Roberts plays Jan Scruggs, the former Army infantryman who led
the effort to build a memorial to his fellow veterans in hopes of
healing the nation's wounds. Working with Scruggs were Robert
Doubek and John Wheeler.
   The memorial, 493 feet of black granite set into the ground in a
giant V, polished to a mirror-like finish and inscribed with 58,156
names, was designed by Maya Ying Lin, a New York architect who was
a 21-year-old Yale architectural student when her dramatic vision
was selected from among 1,421 entries. It attracts up to 20,000
visitors a day, making it the most-visited memorial in Washington,
D.C.
   The two-hour movie, a special GE Theater presentation based on a
book by Scruggs and Joel L. Swerdlow, will be televised Sunday. It
also stars Glynnis O'Connor, Marshall Colt, Scott Paulin, Lee
Purcell, Laurence Luckinbill, Linden Chiles, Brock Peters and
Gloria Carlin. Lionel Chetwynd wrote the screenplay, and Michael
Pressman directed.
   Roberts said when he started the film he looked into Scruggs'
military record and talked to people who knew him.
   ``I held off meeting him until I was halfway through the
picture,'' he said. ``He is an incredibly decent man. My belief is
he pursued the Vietnam Memorial for all the right reasons. I admire
him and I'm proud to portray him.
   ``He had no illusions of grandeur. One of my favorite lines from
the film is, `This is not a monument, it's a memorial.' It's not a
memorial to the war in Vietnam. It's a memorial to the 50,000 young
men who died there.''
   Roberts said he sees Scruggs, who is now attending law school,
as ``a living definition of the American dream come true.''
   ``He wanted to get something done and he pursued it. It got done
and it will live forever. It's wonderful for everyone in this
country to pursue his own vision. It's worth it, I think.''
   This is a rare television appearance for Roberts, who was
nominated for an Oscar for his role in ``Runaway Train.'' He was
also in such movies as ``Star 80,'' ``The Pope of Greenwich
Village,'' ``Raggedy Man,'' ``Nobody's Fool'' and the upcoming
``Blood Red.'' He made his TV debut in the soap opera ``Another
World'' and has been in several PBS dramas.
   ``I don't go by the media,'' he said. ``What attracts me is the
script. I liked this and I came running. Limiting myself to one
medium is like limiting myself to redheads. I took this part
because of the script, because of my friendship with three Vietnam
veterans and because people my age were too young to be for or
against the war. Now that I'm an adult I think it's about time we
said, `Welcome home, guys.'''
   His upcoming movie, ``Blood Red,'' is a Western due out in July.
It also stars Burt Young, Dennis Hopper and Giancarlo Giannini, who
plays Roberts' father.
   ``It's loosely based on the time the railroad came to the Napa
Valley,'' he said. ``It came to this particular vineyard and the
Italian immigrant who owned it wouldn't sell a right-of-way. He
died suspiciously. I, as his son, take to the hills. He holds up
the railroad so long they go around the Napa Valley. It saved the
Napa Valley for wine growing.''
   This fall he plans to star in a movie called ``Centrifuge,''
based on a novel by J.C. Pollock.

<HEAD>Bond Market Weathers Interest-Rate Storm, Treasury Auctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices showed resilience in the face of a
stormy week, when fears of higher interest rates swept through
financial markets like a hurricane.
   And the bond market, which also had to contend with three major
Treasury auctions this past week, is bracing itself for more
turbulence ahead. Interest rates, which move inversely to bond
prices, are widely expected to continue climbing.
   ``In the short run, we still think rates are headed higher,''
said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist for Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co.
   Anxiety about inflation _ which erodes the value of fixed-income
investments like bonds _ had been building for some time. It was
heightened by a May 6 government report on the nation's
unemployment in April, which registered a 14-year low and was
viewed as showing underlying strength in the economy.
   In the aftermath of that report, the Federal Reserve nudged
short-term interest rates higher, and on Wednesday, major U.S.
banks raised their prime lending rates by half a percentage point
to 9 percent.
   The hike in the prime rate _ the first since October's stock
market collapse _ proved anti-climactic, though, since it had
already been foreshadowed by a rise in bond-market rates spurred by
the Fed's tightening.
   ``The prime rate (increase) really was old history,'' said Maria
Ramirez, a managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   A far more exciting event for the bond market was the Treasury's
series of three quarterly refunding auctions. The sales of $26
billion in Treasuries on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, aimed at
helping the government finance the $2.5 trillion national debt,
were fairly well received by investors.
   There had been concern recently that the growing inflationary
fears, by keeping bond prices depressed, could jeopardize the
auctions. The bond market had been worried that investors _
especially the Japanese _ could shy away from the Treasury sales if
they detected a trend toward higher interest rates.
   As it turned out, foreign investors did jump in to the auctions.
They accounted for about 40 percent of the bond purchases over the
three days, Ms. Ramirez estimated.
   The bond market rode out the interest-rate tempest and the
auctions fairly calmly. Some market analysts suggested the credit
markets may have been cushioned by a ``flight to safety'' on
Wednesday, as skittish investors pulled their funds out of the
tumbling stock market and plowed them into bonds. The anxiety over
interest rates and the hike in the prime sent the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials down 37.80 points that day to 1,965.85, a
three-month low.
   Many observers expect the rate on the key 30-year bond to rise
to around 9.50 percent by the end of June, as inflationary
pressures continue to mount.
   Friday's Labor Department report on wholesale prices in April,
showing only a moderate rise of 0.4 percent, was encouraging news
for bond traders at the end of an unnerving week. But the market is
looking forward with trepidation to a string of economic statistics
for April due to be published this coming week: industrial
production on Monday, factory capacity in use on Tuesday, housing
starts on Wednesday, and consumer prices and real earnings on
Friday.
   The nation's trade deficit for March is also scheduled to be
reported, on Tuesday. The trade figures have been a powerful
influence on the bond market in recent months, as disappointing
trade performances have pushed the dollar lower and weakened bond
prices in turn.
   If the reports provide further evidence of economic strength,
the inflation fears could accelerate.

   Lawrence Weiss was about to book an order for
100 shares of Chrysler Corp. and 100 shares of Black & Decker Corp.
this past Wednesday when his customer happened to ask how the
market was doing.
   Weiss mentioned that the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was
off 35 points _ and the customer promptly canceled his order.
   That is the kind of experience that drives brokers crazy. Retail
business in stocks is off 30 percent or more on Wall Street because
the October crash and the subsequent gyrations have shaken the
confidence of individual investors.
   ``They're frightened,'' said Weiss, president of Odd Lot
Securities Ltd., who said his own discount brokerage's business is
off 50 percent.
   To many Americans, Wall Street is just another roll of the dice,
especially in light of the 508-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrials on Oct. 19. That came across in a sampling of opinion
around the country this past week.
   ``I think it depends on your personality more than anything
else. Some people like to gamble,'' said Thomas H. Egan, traffic
and purchasing manager for General Latex & Chemical Corp. in
Cambridge, Mass.
   ``It's a little bit like the race track. ... Influence controls
it as much as anything,'' said Marshall Webb, who manages the tool
and die shop at Lacy Tool Co. in Novi, Mich.
   ``I favor other investments that are more dependent on my own
ability to judge investment potential, like real estate,'' said
Gary Studdard, general manager of John B. LaGarde, a concrete
company in Anniston, Ala.
   Small investors accounted for only 23 percent of shares traded
on the New York Stock Exchange in January and February, down from
29 percent just before the crash, according to the Securities
Industry Association.
   Many investors are turning to safer havens such as certificates
of deposit and Treasury bonds, whose value is up sharply since the
crash in spite of some recent weakness.
   ``People are starting to invest based on their nocturnal habits.
Will this investment keep me staring at the ceiling at night?''
said Philip Waxelbaum, national sales manager for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Computerized program trading has emerged as a villain in the
public's mind, and even brokerage firms that say program trading is
not to blame for upsetting the markets are curbing the practice
anyway.
   This past week five major brokerage houses said they would stop
conducting a form of program trading known as index arbitrage for
their own accounts. They were Bear, Stearns & Co., Morgan Stanley &
Co., Salomon Brothers Inc., PaineWebber Inc. and Kidder Peabody Inc.
   Merrill Lynch & Co., among others, had curbed the practice
earlier, to the relief of many of its brokers.
   ``I'm frankly thankful. It took me off the hook with clients,''
said Gene Foster, a broker in the Rochester, N.Y., office of
Merrill Lynch.
   Scott Bowles, a 78-year-old retiree from Procter & Gamble Co.
who lives in Wyoming, Ohio, said he is keeping half his net worth
in stocks even though ``like everybody, I got whacked on Meltdown
Monday.''
   But he said his confidence is being sapped by inexplicable moves
in the market. ``The standard perceptions of value are way the hell
off. It's unnerving.''
   Alice Tarailo, a secretary in Watsonville, Calif., said she was
ready to buy stock in H&R Block Inc. in January but was worried the
market had not stabilized. She is glad she held off: After a brief
run-up, the stock is off about $4 from its January level.
   ``I think the stock market boom is over,'' she said.
   To some Americans, trouble in the stock market is part of a
broader crisis.
   ``I have seen the time when I felt safe anywhere I was,'' said
Webb, the Michigan tool and die man, who is a 60-year-old
ex-Marine. ``It's not that way anymore. Whether you're talking
money, or safety of anything.''
   But there are still optimists in places such as Spanish Fork,
Utah. Vaughn Erickson said program trading and the possibility of a
bear market do not greatly concern him because he has more than 20
years before retirement and is holding for the long term.
   ``There's a lot of room for growth in the United States, and the
stock market is the best place to take advantage of it,'' said
Erickson, vice president for finance at Nature's Sunshine Products
Inc.

   John Vogel of Lexington, Ky., said he and his wife, Gail, have
about a third of the money in their retirement plan devoted to
stocks. At age 33, he feels he can afford at least that much risk.
   ``I consider it more or less a sense of gambling,'' Vogel said.
``But the greater the risk, the more potential you have to gain.''
   Most investors who owned stocks haven't given up on them
entirely. Rather, they are letting their cash build up so stocks
become a smaller percentage of their overall portfolio, said John
Markese, vice president and research director for the 90,000-member
American Association of Individual Investors.
   Markese said a survey in March found 80 percent of the group's
members favored restrictions on program trading. Sixty-three
percent favored coordination betwen agencies regulating the stock
markets and futures markets.
   ``I'm surprised and I think a lot of people are surprised at how
little has been done'' so far to fix things, he said.
   In other business and economic news the past week:
   _Major banks raised their prime lending rates for the first time
since the stock market crash, pushing the key rate to 9 percent and
heralding a period of more expensive borrowing.
   _The steepest energy price gain in 15 months pushed wholesale
costs up 0.4 percent in April, the government said. Food prices
were modestly higher. In other reports, business sales shot up 1.9
percent in March, the biggest advance in more than a year, while
business inventories rose 0.3 percent.
   _Retail sales fell 0.6 percent in April, the first setback in
six months. The decline was blamed on an early Easter, bad weather
and a bigger federal tax bite for some people. A private study said
consumer confidence rebounded in April, suggesting spending will be
strong in coming months.
   _The Agriculture Department said farmers soon will be harvesting
a winter wheat crop estimated at 1.62 billion bushels, up 4 percent
from last year's production.
   _Los Angeles businessman Burt Sugarman raised his tender offer
for Media General Inc. to about $2 billion or $70 per share. The
battle is expected to come to a head at a shareholders' meeting May
20.
   _Gulf & Western Inc. and Western Publishing Group Inc. ended
talks about a possible takeover of Western Publishing, a children's
book publisher and commercial printer. Gulf & Western later
announced its third stock buyback program in five years.
   _Lorimar Telepictures Corp. agreed to be acquired by Warner
Communications Inc. in a $1.18 billion stock-swap deal. Investor
Marvin Davis later renewed his bid for Lorimar.
   _USG Corp. claimed victory in a proxy battle, saying
shareholders had voted for a management-backed directors slate over
one supporting Desert Partners' $2.2 billion hostile takeover bid.
   _Local union members narrowly ratified a United Auto Workers
contract covering 66,000 Chrysler Corp. employees despite
objections from skilled-trades workers.
   _Pan Am Corp. Chairman Thomas Plaskett told shareholders the
airline was in dismal financial condition and must get concessions
from its labor unions.
   _A report from a private consultant hired by Union Carbide Corp.
said sabotage by a disgruntled employee, not negligence, caused a
deadly gas leak at the company's Bhopal, India, plant four years
ago.
   _The Federal Reserve Board issued rules requiring banks, savings
institutions and credit unions to meet strict check-clearing
deadlines. On another matter, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan urged the
House to follow the Senate's lead and pass legislation to give
banks new securities underwriting powers.
   _A deal between entertainer Merv Griffin and investor Donald
Trump to divide up Resorts International Inc. collapsed, renewing
the millionaires' battle for ownership of the hotel-casino company.
   _American Medical International Inc. said it would sell 37
hospitals in 10 states to an employee group in a transaction valued
at $910 million.
   _Irving Bank Corp. said it set up a committee of independent

<HEAD>Wall Street's `Contrary' Optimists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you apply an old Wall Street principle known
as contrary opinion, the outlook for the stock market would seem to
be pretty healthy.
   Hardly anybody these days is able to work up much enthusiasm
either for stocks or for the business outlook over the next year or
two.
   And from long experience, students of the investment scene will
testify, whenever a large majority of people agree on what the
financial markets are likely to do, they are probably wrong.
   The extent of the pessimism now holding sway among investment
managers, analysts and economists shows up in the results of the
latest poll of more than 300 ``decision makers'' conducted by
Richard Hoey at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   For the stock market, Hoey reports, the bears outnumbered the
bulls by 2-to-1. On bonds, the ratio was an even more lopsided
3-to-1 in favor of the pessimists.
   Anecdotal evidence abounds to support that heavy negative bias.
The talk on Wall Street these days is that interest rates have
nowhere to go but up.
   And the slow and halting recovery in stock prices since the
crash last year is just about universally labeled a ``bear market
rally'' that will soon run its course.
   ``The most comforting thing about today's experience is that
many analysts believe the stock market rally cannot be sustained,''
observed Vincent Agnew at CTT Investment Management Group, a firm
that manages more than $2.5 billion.
   ``The reason this is comforting is because whenever the crowd is
anticipating one set of events, the market has been known to
perversely confound everyone by doing exactly the opposite.''
   As simple as contrary opinion sounds, though, it can be very
difficult to practice. For one thing, in trying to determine what
the real consensus is in order to go against it, you sometimes have
to try to separate what people say from what they really feel.
   Lately, for example, some standard statistical measures of
investor sentiment suggest stocks have not been beaten down to
bargain-basement extremes like those seen on some past occasions.
   Price-earnings ratios of several leading market indicators
lately have hovered between 14-to-1 and 15-to-1. The multiple is
down from better than 20 last year, but still nowhere near the
single-digit levels it reached at times in the 1970s and early
1980s.
   The market did not do much for optimistic ``contrarians'' in the
past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at
1,990.55, down 16.91 points from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell .58 to 145.30;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market 6.94 to
372.48, and the American Stock Exchange market value index 3.87 to
297.94.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 153.07 million shares a day,
against 151.13 million the week before.
   The market's weakest moments in the past week did not exactly
occur in a vacuum. Major banks raised their prime lending rates
from 8.5 percent to 9 percent.
   What's more, a good many traders might have been reluctant to
bid aggressively for stocks before the government's monthly report
on international trade, scheduled to be released this Tuesday.
   ``So we go on to the next number, the dreaded trade statistic,''
observed Michael Sherman at Shearson Lehman Hutton in his latest
market commentary.
   ``Is this the way we were supposed to invest, hanging from week
to week on every flick of data? Can't we find some more stable
criteria on which to judge the direction of the markets?
   ``We think that if you step back a little bit, you can. To our
mind, the market today is dominated by fear, and that fear will
ultimately prove overdrawn. Upon such realization will come an
improvement in stock and bond prices.''

   Oil futures prices settled slightly higher to
end the week with another slow trading day.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for June delivery
of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade of crude oil,
closed Friday at $17.49 per 42-gallon barrel, up 1 cent from
Thursday's close.
   Among refined products for June delivery, contracts for
wholesale unleaded gasoline settled .42 cent higher at 52.34 cents
per gallon, while wholesale heating oil rose .24 cent to 47.47
cents per gallon.
   John Azarow, an analyst at the Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
securities firm, said the session amounted to ``a total non-event.''
   ``Volume was down,'' he said, mainly because of a lack of any
news able to move prices one way or the other.
   Also restricting volume, Azarow said, was a reluctance by some
traders to trade too heavily before the upcoming meeting of oil
ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
beginning June 8 in Vienna, Austria.
   At the meeting, the OPEC ministers are expected to try to find a
way to restrict production in order to drive prices higher.

<HEAD>Energy Prices Fueled Moderate Boost in Wholesale Prices in April</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A moderate rise in wholesale prices during April despite a big
jump in energy prices has prompted economists to conclude that
inflation worries may have been overstated.
   The Producer Price Index rose a moderate 0.4 percent in April,
down from a 0.6 percent advance in March, the Labor Department said
Friday.
   Analysts noted that if the volatile energy and food sectors were
removed, the April price advance was a minuscule 0.1 percent.
   ``It is hard to make a real scare story that inflation is taking
off based on these kinds of numbers,'' said David Wyss, an
economist with Data Resources Inc.
   For the first four months of the year, wholesale prices have
risen at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, not much changed from the
2.2 percent increase for all of 1987.
   The report sparked a rally in the bond markets as investors
concluded there will be no additional pressure on the Federal
Reserve to drive interest rates higher to dampen demand.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose as much as $5 for each
$1,000 in face value to yield 9.17 percent. On Thursday the
bellwether 30-year issue's yield jumped to its highest point this
year at 9.22 percent.
   Other economists, however, insisted that the April price report
contained some troubling signs that price increases will be
accelerating in the months ahead.
   ``It would be a mistake to look at this report and say
inflationary pressures have abated,'' said Michael Evans, head of a
Washington forecasting firm. ``I don't think this relief is going
to last.''
   Energy prices, which had posted sharp declines from September
through February, accounted for half of the increase in the overall
index in April, rising 3.1 percent.
   Gasoline costs advanced 0.7 percent, while home heating oil shot
up 5.2 percent. Natural gas, which had declined in price in five of
the last six months, rose 4.3 percent.
   Food costs rose 0.4 percent in April as a sharp 16.3 percent
drop in the price of eggs and smaller declines in the price of
fruit, fish and beef offset price increases for pork, chicken,
vegetables and coffee.
   The financial markets took the economic news in stride. On Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 22.55 points to
close at 1,990.55.
   Brokers noted that there were no unpleasant surprises in the
producer price index and instead drew inspiration from falling
interest rates and a steady dollar.
   In another economic report Friday, the government said total
business sales surged 1.9 percent in March, the biggest advance in
more than a year, while business inventories were up a modest 0.3
percent.
   Analysts said the combination of rising sales and small declines
in inventories should translate into continued strong industrial
production in the months ahead.
