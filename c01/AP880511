   A teen-ager testified Wednesday in a $2.6
million lawsuit against the heavy metal rock group Motley Crew that
flying pieces of dry ice from a flaming special-effects pot on
stage split his lip during a 1985 show.
   ``I could feel straight through to my teeth,'' said 19-year-old
David Wright. On Tuesday, the second plaintiff in the case,
17-year-old Robert Miller, said lost an eye to flying debris during
the concert in Huntsville.
   Named as defendants in the suit are the band, the city of
Huntsville, the Von Braun Civic Center and Nashville, Tenn.,
promoter of the concert.
   Attorneys for Wright and Miller contend illegal fireworks were
used as special effects, and that city and civic center officials
were negligent in allowing their use.
   About 30 teen-agers cut class to catch a glimpse Wednesday of
the band's bass player, Nikki Sixx. Sixx needed a police escort to
reach his car after testifying Tuesday. Some 300 fans stood outside
as he departed that day.
   Wright testified that he was standing about 20 feet from the
stage when the accident took place. He said Motley Crue had just
begun the song ``Shout to the Devil'' when he saw flames shoot up
on either side of the drummer.
   Then, he said, ``something come out and hit me,'' splitting his
lip before he could cover his face.
   He said when he looked down, he saw blood and what looked like
crushed ice. When he stepped on it, he said, his foot slipped as if
the object were melting.
   Miller testifed Tuesday that he heard a ``big boom'' and saw
flames just before something object struck him in the face during
the concert.
   Miller, 14 at the time and attending his first rock concert,
said his first thought was that the lights at the arena had been
turned off. ``But when I reached up and felt my eye,'' he said,
``there was nothing there.''
   Sixx testified Tuesday it was ``impossible'' that the teen-agers
were injured by the band's special effects.
   Sixx said the band continued to use the pyrotechnic displays in
concerts after the incident in Huntsville. ``I do three to four
hundred shows with the stuff right next to me. It has to be safe,''
he said.

   Johnny Carson returned to television
Wednesday despite a writers strike, giving a monologue of his own
making in which he wisecracked that astrology in the White House
finally explains ``the loony tunes things that have been coming out
of Washington.''
   ``The Tonight Show'' had been in reruns since shortly after the
Writers Guild of America struck the film and TV industry March 7.
   Carson announced last week that reruns of the show would end and
he would return to the air, writing his own monologues. Carson, who
is not a member of the guild, said at that time possibilities of
reaching an agreement with striking writers had been exhausted.
   On Wednesday, he said the real reason for coming back stemmed
from the brouhaha over revelations about the influence of astrology
in the White House.
   ``I just could not stay away any longer from all things that are
going on in the country. I was compelled to come back,'' Carson
said. ``I'm a Scorpio on the cusp. .... You know, we finally have a
clue now as to what the hell (are) the loony tunes things that have
been coming out of Washington.''
   Carson referred to revelations by former White House chief of
staff Donald Regan that first lady Nancy Reagan regularly consulted
an astrologer to determine the timing of President Reagan's
movements.
   Carson said he had not been aware there was a new Cabinet
position, Secretary of Health, Education and Soothsaying.
   He also made brief mention of the strike in both a sincere and
joking tone.
   ``We're glad to be back. As far as the writers strike we're not
going to discuss it,'' he said. ``I have a lot of friends who are
writers. We hope they join us soon. It is not fun to come to work
when you see your friends who you've known for many years standing
out on a picket line.
   Then he quipped, ``And it's a weird picket line. The writers are
out there holding up these signs and there's nothing on them.''
   Carson explained to out-of-towners that there had been
excitement in Los Angeles because of persistent rumors that
Nostradamus, a 16th century astrologer, forecast an earthquake for
a city widely believed to be Los Angeles.
   ``He was a flim-flam man of the 16th century,'' Carson observed.
``If Nostradamus were alive today he would be Geraldo Rivera,'' he
said, referring to the TV personality who opened Al Capone's vault
to great hype but found next to nothing.
   Carson's production company, Carson Tonight Inc., was rebuffed
in efforts to get either a waiver from the guild or reach an
independent agreeement that would permit the writers to return to
work.

<HEAD>Administration Wants to Sell F-18 Fighter-Bombers to Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration intends to sell
advanced F-18 fighter-bombers to Kuwait, a deal that would make the
tiny Persian Gulf state the first Arab country to have them, The
Washington Post reported Thursday.
   Citing unidentified sources in the Defense and State
departments, the Post said Kuwait wants to buy 40 of the aircraft
and the administration will notify Congress soon of its intention
to proceed with the sale.
   The deal could be worth $680 million to the manufacturer,
McDonnell Douglas Co., said company spokesman Robert J. O'Brien.
   Several State Department officials contacted by The Associated
Press on Wednesday night said they were unaware that any decision
had been made.
   One noted that Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy
had told a congessional panel Tuesday that ``there was a request
from Kuwait to look at the possibility of selling F-18s.''
   Another source, who also spoke on condition that he not be
named, said, ``I'm not aware that any decision is imminent.''
   ``There's no more than the possibility of a sale,'' he said,
adding that he was skeptical that such a decision would have been
made so quickly.
   ``I would doubt it very seriously,'' he said. ``There's
interest, but a lot of discussion needs to go on before any
decision like that would be considered. I think it's awful early. I
would be very surprised if it's true.''
   The source noted that Kuwait has talked to several countries,
including France, about the possibility of buying advanced aircraft.
   Murphy had told the congressional panel Tuesday that the
administration had alerted Congress that Kuwait was interested in
the F-18s and might prefer them to the less sophisticated F-16s.
   Congress could block the sale.
   The United States is selling F-16s to Bahrain, but it hasn't
sold F-18s to any Arab nation, the Post said.
   The United States and Kuwait have created an increasingly close
security relationship since last year, when the United States
committed naval forces to protect U.S.-flagged ships traveling
through the war-torn Persian Gulf.
   Initially, 11 Kuwaiti ships were re-flagged under this policy
and were given protection by the Navy. The United States recently
revised its policy in the gulf, announcing that it would offer help
to other ships that were attacked by combatants in the 7{-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.

<HEAD>Church Universal and Triumphant: A Threat in Paradise Valley?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Here in a mile-high valley called
Paradise, a religious group is building its home, a retreat for
thousands that some local people say threatens the pristine
environment bordering Yellowstone National Park.
   The group is the Church Universal and Triumphant, a ``New Age''
sect that moved its headquarters in late 1986 from California to a
12,000-acre ranch it had bought five years earlier in southwest
Montana's Paradise Valley.
   With that move came 200 followers, doubling the number already
there, construction plans for a self-sufficient community, and the
promise of more church members moving into a valley with a
population of about 1,000.
   Next door is Yellowstone, whose wildlife herds often migrate
into the valley during the winter.
   ``This is a place of international significance,'' says Hank
Rate, a local resident. ``If they do what they say they want to do,
that value is going to be diminished _ not only for our time, but
for all time.''
   Rate and others fear the group's building plans and its summer
conclaves that attract thousands will cause environmental damage in
the valley.
   Some critics say they're uncomfortable with the group's beliefs.
   The church was founded 30 years ago in Washington, D.C., by Mark
Prophet, who said he received messages from spiritual figures of
the past, including Christ, Buddha and Pope John XXIII. Upon his
death in 1973, his widow, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, became the
leader.
   Church members believe a human soul is continuously reincarnated
until people realize the God within themselves. They use praying or
chanting to attempt to influence world conditions or personal
concerns. Tobacco, alcohol and drugs are forbidden.
   Ms. Prophet, 47, says her visions suggest a war between the
United States and the Soviet Union before the end of this century.
The church supports President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative
and a nationwide civil defense system.
   ``We have a lot of down-home, nice type of folks on this ranch
who are just like the people that are our neighbors,'' Ms. Prophet
says. ``I don't think that all the hullaballoo that's been made in
the press is the reality here.''
   Critics draw comparisons between Paradise Valley and the tiny
town of Antelope, Ore., taken over in the early 1980s and then
abandoned by followers of the Baghwan Shree Rajneesh.
   Church Universal and Triumphant bought some modular housing from
the defunct Rajneeshee community, but church leaders say the
similarities end there.
   Since the church bought the ranch in 1981, its leaders have hit
the local Rotary and Kiwanis club circuit to calm fears that it is
a far-out religious cult bent on political control.
   Church vice president Ed Francis, married to Ms. Prophet, says
church members' political persuasion generally resembles that of
the area _ conservative and Republican.
   Not everyone is reassured.
   ``I'm concerned about the numbers,'' says Leonard Sargent, whose
2,000-acre property borders the church's Royal Teton Ranch. ``No
matter what they happen to believe, it's still an awful lot of
people to bring into a fragile area.''
   Church officials counter that they chose the valley because of
its natural beauty, which they want to preserve.
   The church bought the Royal Teton Ranch in 1981 from magazine
publisher Malcolm Forbes for a reported $7 million.
   Since then, the church has purchased an additional 21,500 acres
in the Paradise Valley, including 5,200 acres of hilly prairie near
Emigrant intended for settlement by church members, about 25 miles
north of the Royal Teton Ranch. It also owns a printing shop in
Livingston that employs 100 people.
   The church won't reveal its income but says it comes from
members' donations and various business ventures, largely the sale
of religious books and videotapes. It also leases land to members.
   The church has advertised the ranch to its members as a
spiritual retreat offering protection from economic collapse, civil
disorder or war. Thousands of followers gather each summer for an
annual conclave in a spectacular mountain valley called the ``Heart
of the Inner Retreat.''
   Ms. Prophet and Francis say the Royal Teton Ranch will become a
monastic, self-sufficient community for 500 or so church members.
   With the help of ranch ``staff'' _ church members who receive
room, board and small monthly salaries _ the church has installed
an extensive irrigation system, grows a wide variety of vegetables
and grains, operates a dairy and raises 2,500 head of cattle and
sheep.
   Members also began work in 1986 on the development's central
complex. Located near the west bank of the Yellowstone River
several miles north of Yellowstone Park, it would include housing
for 260, a church, school, kitchen, dining hall and recreation
facilities.
   But that work halted in November 1986 when the state, prodded by
local residents, launched an environmental review.
   A draft of the review, completed in March, said the project
should be able to proceed without damaging wildlife, water quality
or aesthetics, as long as the church takes several steps to cushion
impact of the development. The state found no threat to the
environment that would justify denying sewage and water permits, if
the conditions were met.
   Following a public comment period _ ``We were overwhelmed with
comment, both for and against,'' said Steve Pilcher, chief of
Montana's Water Quality Bureau _ the state is completing a final
report.
   The draft said the church should build a bear-proof fence around
a tree farm and vegetable fields, monitor groundwater, maintain
minimum flows in three creeks crossing ranch property and postpone
any use of a geothermal spring near the Yellowstone River.
   The church wants to pump water from LaDuke Hot Springs for use
at its central complex. Park officials are concerned the pumping
might affect Mammoth Hot Springs nine miles to the south.
   Francis says the church is willing to accept the
recommendations, but a number of groups have suggested the state
review is inadequate.
   Since the 1970s, the church has occupied and later abandoned
land in Colorado, Idaho and California _ ``a series of steps to get
here,'' Francis says, adding that the church has no intention of
moving again.
   But critics say the church has not been forthcoming about its
plans in the past.
   ``Basically, Ed Francis' credibility with me is zero,'' says
Richard Parks, owner of an outdoor equipment shop in nearby
Gardiner and a member of the Bear Creek Council, a local
environmental group. ``If he told me it was Thursday, I'd check the
calendar.''
   When Church Universal and Triumphant bought the ranch, Francis
said its rural nature would not be changed.
   Francis maintains he has been largely consistent: ``I feel that
a 1 percent use of property in this area for anything other than
open space and wildlife is appropriate and not something that
should cause a lot of alarm.''
   Parks says the church ``changes the ambience of the whole
area,'' bringing the impact of a development but no direct economic
benefits.
   Francis contends that what's really bothering the critics is
simpler: They just don't want others to have a piece of their
paradise.

<TEXT>
   Habib Bourguiba's statue still dominates a
square in central Tunis, but the man who towered over Tunisia for
32 years has slipped into oblivion six months after his ouster.
   His successor as president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, has
proclaimed a ``new era'' for the North African nation, appealing to
the nation's Islamic and Arabic heritage, a stand that has won him
immediate widespread support.
   Bourguiba, who had set the nation on a Western course after he
won independence from France in 1956, now is 84 years old and
confined to a chateau outside Tunis. He was declared no longer
capable of governing when he was removed from office Nov. 7.
   Ben Ali took power during a tense crackdown on Islamic
fundamentalists and is universally credited, even by political
opponents, with sparing the nation from a more serious upheaval.
   He has sought to make peace with the Islamic fundamentalists and
others in the Bourguiba opposition.
   Newspapers once banned by Bourguiba are back on newsstands. Many
people say they no longer fear the police. Tunis University,
disrupted three days a week last year by demonstrations, is quiet.
   About 5,000 prisoners, many of them members of an outlawed
Islamic fundamentalist group, have been pardoned.
   The national legislature, dominated by Bourguiba's ruling party
since Tunisia's independence in 1956, has moved toward pluralism
with a new law on political parties.
   In his most risky move, however, Ben Ali has extended a hand to
the growing Islamic fundamentalist movement, Bourguiba's chief
target in his waning years.
   Television and radio now broadcast the five daily calls to
Islamic prayer.
   Islam has alway been the official state religion, but Bourguiba
maintained a secular character in government and daily life.
   Ben Ali, a military man once in charge of the crackdown on
fundamentalists, invokes Allah (God) at the start of his speeches.
   ``It's life that's changed, not just politics,'' said Chakib
Douss, a brassware merchant in the Tunis bazaar. ``Now everyone is
free. We feel it every day, every minute. It's not something you
read about in the newspaper. It's something you touch.''
   Many in the opposition approved of the new climate, if only for
now.
   ``Incontestably, Nov. 7 was a comfort to everyone,'' said a
leading member of the Socialist Democrat Movement, the largest
opposition party, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``It's still the honeymoon, so everyone feels obliged to
publicly approve him,'' commented M'hamed Jaibi, editor-in-chief of
the weekly Maghreb, reopened in September after being shut down
four years ago.
   ``I hope this is a temporary situation,'' he said of Ben Ali's
popularity. ``Otherwise, we'll be back in the old system with a
president who thinks he is infallible.''
   That was an allusion as well to Bourguiba, who had become so
dominant that he was declared president-for-life, a benign dictator
in charge of a nominal democracy. His Destourian Socialist Party
controlled all seats in the National Assembly. None of the three
legal opposition parties had a meaningful voice.
   But Ben Ali has promised that his new era would ``open the
horizons to a truly democratic and evolved political life.''
   Since taking office, he has moved to abolish the lifelong
presidency, change the electoral code and press laws, dismantle the
feared state security court and given Amnesty International, the
London-based human rights group, a permit to operate here _ its
first in the Arab world.
   Ben Ali has also restored diplomatic relations with neighboring
Libya and stresses closer ties with the Arab world.
   While citizens appear won over by the changes, some opposition
politicians remain cautious and fundamentalists are reserving full
judgment.
   The final year of Bourguiba's leadership was marked by a battle
against the fundamentalist Islamic Tendency Movement, culminating
in a trial in September of 90 fundamentalists on charges of
plotting against the state.
   ``The Islamic dossier remains the hottest one on Ben Ali's
desk,'' said Hassen Ghodhbani, an Islamic lawyer who defended some
of the 90 in the trial.
   He contended the measures taken by Ben Ali remain insufficient.
   ``Islam isn't just prayer and pilgrimage. It's an entire life
system,'' he said.
   In late April, the legislature quashed any hopes that the
Islamic Tendency Movement might become a legal opposition party _
one of its demands. A new law allowed new political parties but
forbade those based on religion, language, race or region.
   ``The government has adopted a double attitude toward Islam,''
said the opposition politician who spoke anonymously.
   ``It is a position both clever and dangerous.''

<TEXT>
   South Korea's shipbuilding orders
decreased more than 40 percent so far this year from the same
period in 1987 because of a rapid appreciation in the country's
currency, industry officials said today.
   Orders received so far consist of 626,300 gross tons of export
ships and 800 gross tons of domestic ships, the officials said.
   But they added that despite the sluggish orders, local
shipmakers still have a combined outstanding order of 6 million
tons, enough to keep them busy until the first half of next year.
   The value of the South Korean won has risen 7.43 percent against
the U.S. dollar so far this year. A higher won makes South Korean
exports more expensive abroad while lowering the prices of foreign
imports.

<TEXT>
   NBC won back first place in the A.C. Nielsen
Co. television ratings from CBS and became the first network in
more than seven years to claim the nine top shows.
   Because of the May sweeps, NBC, CBS and ABC broadcast mostly
original programs for the week that ended Sunday. They face summer
reruns and a drought imposed by the scriptwriters' strike.
   NBC finished more than four ratings points ahead of CBS in
gaining its 28th victory in 33 weeks. CBS won the previous week
largely on the strength of the final episode of ``Magnum, P.I.''
   NBC also won the top nine places, the first time a network has
done that since CBS for the week of Nov. 3, 1980.
   ``Cheers'' took first place. The only non-NBC show to make the
top 10 was ABC's ``Who's the Boss?''
   Besides regular series, the NBC movie ``The Taking of Flight
847: The Uli Derickson Story'' was seventh and the first half of
the miniseries ``Something Is Out There'' was ninth.
   ABC's ``The Bourne Identity'' was in 11th place with its opening
chapter. It teamed up with the NBC Sunday show ``Something Is Out
There'' to send the CBS drama ``The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' to
58th place.
   NBC's average rating for the week was 15.6; CBS' was 11.5 and
ABC 11.2. The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6
million households with televisions.
   In the May sweeps, which helps determine advertising rates for
local stations, NBC took over first place from CBS. The ratings in
the Nielsen sweeps for April 28-May 8: NBC 14.9, CBS 13.1, ABC
10.4. The Arbitron sweeps for April 27-May 8: NBC 14.8, CBS 12.9,
ABC 10.7.
   ``The Cosby Show'' was the only rerun in the top 10 and, in fact
the only one in the top 36 shows last week. More than half the
shows in the bottom half of the ratings also were new.
   Here are the top 10: ``Cheers,'' ``A Different World,'' ``Night
Court,'' ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Golden Girls,'' ``L.A. Law,'' NBC
Monday Movie, ``The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson
Story,'' ``Amen,'' NBC Sunday Movie, ``Something Is Out There,''
Part I, all NBC, and ABC's ``Who's the Boss?''
   ABC kept its lead among the evening news shows. The ratings: ABC
10.2, CBS 9.3, NBC 8.6.

<HEAD>Argentina To Take Part In U.S. Naval Games</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina will take part in naval
exercises with the United States for the first time since the 1982
Falklands War.
   Raul Alconada Sempe, secretary of foreign affairs, said on
Tuesday that Argentina will participate in ``Operation America,''
with United States and several of the Latin countries that once
took part in ``Operation Unitas.''
   Argentina quit the Unitas war games after the Falklands conflict
to protest what it said was U.S. assistance to Britain. The 74-day
war over the islands Argentina calls the Malvinas killed 712
Argentine and 256 British soldiers.
   Final details of the exercises next year are to be completed
this week in the United States while Navy commander Adm. Ramon
Arosa is visiting Washington and Norfolk, Va., Alconada Sempe said.
   Naval vessels from the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Chile
and Peru took part in the Unitas exercises.

<HEAD>Customs Dispute Resolved Ending Delays At Italian Border Points</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and union negotiators settled a labor
dispute involving customs officials that had backed up freight at
border points.
   The settlement was reached Tuesday by Finance Minister Emilio
Colombo and union leaders. Colombo said Italy's customs
administration will be reformed to grant customs officers a pay
raise and to redefine their duties.
   Thousands of trucks were backed up at the crossing points with
Switzerland and Austria last week after Italian officers refused to
work overtime to clear customs documents. An official at the
Italian-Swiss border point of Chiasso said the situation was back
to normal after the settlement was announced.

   Four people were found shot
to death in a ransacked villa near the Adriatic beach resort of
Rimini, police said.
   The victims, whose hands and feet were bound, were killed with a
shot through the head, police said.
   They were identified as Luigi Pagliarani, 60, and his wife,
Patricia Schfield, 58, and Sergio Galassi, 66, and his wife Silvana
di Vita, 59.
   Police in the nearby town of Riccione said a relative of
Pagliarani discovered the bodies Tuesday in the living room of the
small villa. The safe was empty and the house had been ransacked,
police said, adding that it appeared the couples were victims of a
robbery.

<HEAD>Agnes de Mille's `The Informer' Ballet Opens in NY</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs Planned</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Informer,'' a new ballet choreographed by
Agnes de Mille for American Ballet Theater, is a gripping anti-war
work certain to become a favorite of audiences for years to come.
   It's a strong ballet, crisp, clear and deeply felt, with light
moments and ominous ones, danced against sets with glowering gray
skies. Based on the 1935 movie about strife in Ireland between 1916
and 1921, it is set to Celtic songs, and every wave of the hand,
flip or sweep of a scarf and every jig-like jump is identifiably
Irish.
   The New York premiere Tuesday at the Metropolitan Opera House
was danced with muscular eloquence. Victor Barbee danced the
wounded veteran, Johan Renvall the young fighter and red-haired
Kathleen Moore the girl. A corps de ballet of 20, as Dubliners,
danced superbly.
   Miss de Mille had Mary Beth Griffith as Irish step-dancing
consultant. The choreographer used the timing of quick Irish dance
steps, as well as the way feet turn and legs cross each other.
   The story is crystal clear, almost all of it in dance with very
little relying on mime. The young fighter, whose steps are
carefree, likes the girl _ and other girls. She likes him but when
he leaves with somebody else she flirts with the veteran, who holds
one gloved hand, presumably artificial, close to his waist. The
veteran is self-conscious, has intense feeling for the girl _ he
lifts her with one hand _ and is jealous. So he points out the
young fighter to unseen English soldiers.
   Women mourn the young fighter, heads thrown back then down,
mouths silently screaming. In one enormously effective scene, the
veteran is alone as dawn comes, revealing silhouettes of men hanged
by the English. The veteran tries to strut but is stiff, unable to
free his body from his realization of what he did.
   In the next scene, the girl finds consolation dancing with the
veteran. But he confesses to her and she runs in horror to her
friends. They shun her at first but take her into their measured
line dancing. When the veteran arrives, there is a long silence
before two men walk him into the wings.
   At the end of the half-hour dance Tuesday, Miss de Mille, who
suffered a stroke in 1975, walked on stage arm in arm with company
artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov. The audience, which had
watched the ballet in rapt silence, stood to applaud, and bravos
rang out.
   ``The Informer'' was premiered in Los Angeles in March.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 employees stopped
work at a construction plant in southern Yugoslavia and demanded
their March wages and a pay increase, the Tanjug news agency
reported.
   Three hours after the stoppage began Tuesday at the Ramiz Sadiku
plant in Pristina, its director, Nijazi Hoxha, and union leaders
told the workers that March wages would be paid but they would not
receive a pay increase.
   Tanjug said some workers were satisfied with that offer but that
others threatened to continue the strike.
   Officials said a record 365,000 workers took part in more than
1,570 strikes in Yugoslavia last year. The government is planning a
new economic program to make the centrally run economy more market
oriented.

   A Japanese monkey on the loose for 10
months in southern Indiana is feasting on bananas, peanut butter
and cat food this week while authorities try to figure out how to
capture the wily fugitive.
   ``He's been here twice today so far,'' said Janice Rodgers, who
spotted the Japanese macaque last week and began feeding it.
   ``He ate peanut butter sandwiches yesterday because I was out of
bananas,'' she said Tuesday. ``He liked them real well, except he
got real disgusted when he got peanut butter between his _ I guess
you would call them his fingers.''
   The Japanese macaque, dubbed ``Jack the Macaque'' by Mrs.
Rodgers, stands about 3{ feet tall, weighs about 30 pounds and has
a silky, tan coat.
   Macaques are generally found in southern Asia and the East
Indies. Jack, a resourceful little primate, survived the winter
apparently by foraging.
   Conservation officers say he runs away as soon as someone in
uniform appears. ``He's a pretty smart monkey,'' said Gary Ault,
conservation officer at Paynetown. ``He's kind of allergic to
uniforms.''
   He escaped about 10 months ago from the Reptile Kingdom in Brown
County, about 35 miles from Mrs. Rodgers' home here near the
Hoosier National Forest.
   Attempts to recapture the monkey have failed. On Friday, Jack
turned up his nose at three tranquilized bananas in favor of a dish
of cat food behind the Rodgers' house.
   ``He hadn't done that before,'' said Mrs. Rodgers. ``Then he
went out and sat down by the bananas and took a couple of bites and
spit them out.'' Jack was a little woozy, but made it back to the
woods.
   When Mrs. Rodgers first saw the monkey last Wednesday she called
her husband, Sam, who was at work. While he phoned the sheriff's
department, she offered Jack some apples, carrots and bread.
   ``He just kind of looked at me like, `Oh, please.' I didn't
really know what to do,'' she said. ``I didn't want to scare him
away, so I did what I thought (ape researcher) Jane Goodall would
do, I squatted down low so that I was about his size.''
   When the police car pulled up, the monkey grabbed an apple and
carrot and ran for the woods.
   The animal isn't considered especially dangerous, though Mrs.
Rodgers said owner Thomas Tilton told her the monkey might attack
if he felt threatened.
   ``He's just as cute as he can be,'' said Mrs. Rodgers, adding
that she won't be too disappointed if future attempts to recapture
the monkey also fail.
   ``I know the owner wants him back,'' she said. ``But I just
couldn't stand for them to drug him.''

   Five Mississippi ninth-graders who beat
200 other teams playing a stock market simulation say they used the
strategies and tactics of real investors to reap a $110,723 ``paper
profit.''
   And just like real investors they had a fearful day when the
market crashed on Oct. 19. As the stock market plummeted 508
points, they were left holding a handful of cheap stocks that no
one wanted to buy.
   ``We lost $34,000,'' said Auburn Wessman of Bailey Alternative
School. ``We wanted to buy some penny stocks because they go up a
higher percentage. But the crash came along, and they just went
down, down, down.''
   The 15-year-old is one of five Bailey ninth-graders who played
the stock market in a 10-week game sponsored by McLarty & Co. and
The Clarion-Ledger-Jackson Daily News.
   More than 200 Mississippi teams competed with others across the
nation in the game, developed by the Securities Industries
Association and coordinated by the American Enterprise Center.
   Each team started with an imaginary $100,000 and a $100,000 line
of credit. They bought and sold stocks according to daily closing
prices, and even paid imaginary broker fees.
   The Bailey group, led by government teacher Johnny Gilbert,
followed stocks in USA Today and watched business reports daily.
They met for two hours every week to make plans to buy and sell.
   Their strategy was to short-sell an engineering stock, get rid
of two others at a profit, and hold onto the earnings with stable
IBM.
   Gilbert wanted his six teams to learn how to take risks and how
to recover from mistakes. He offered advice but didn't force the
teams to follow it.
   ``I just told them to ask, `What companies might make some
money?''' Gilbert said. ``It's hard to teach the risk, but I told
them it's like a big crap game.''

   An American Airlines jetliner carrying
90 people on a flight from New York to Puerto Rico made an
emergency landing in Bermuda after the plane's fuel pump
manfunctioned, an airline spokesman said.
   No injuries were reported when the Flight 699 landed on the
British island Tuesday, said an official at the Civil Aviation
office in Hamilton, who spoke with The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
   Steve McGregor, an airline spokesman in Houston, said without
elaborating that the pilot decided to land the plane in Bermuda
after reporting a malfunction of the plane's fuel pump.
   McGregor said a DC-10 was sent to Bermuda from New York to
pickup the stranded passengers and fly them to Puerto Rico.

   After 23 years of living in sin, an
84-year-old cancer patient married his 74-year-old companion in a
hospital ceremony arranged and attended by his nurses a day before
surgery.
   Emma Jones stood beside Charlie Vickers in a wheelchair and
legally tied the knot Tuesday in a Glades General Hospital lounge
as 25 nurses and doctors looked on, hosital spokesman Kerry F.
Aunce said. Palm Beach Circuit Judge Don Adams performed the
marriage.
   ``I don't believe the doctor is going to be able to get me
through this, and I want to get my soul ready for the Lord,''
Vickers said of his colon surgery. ``We've been together for 23
years and if something happens, I want us to be married.''
   Vickers said he gave up drinking moonshine when he was younger
and gave up cigarettes after a colostomy a year ago.
   ``Smoking is a sin and sleepingwith someone you're not married
to is a sin,'' he said. ``It doesn't do any good to quit one if
you're not going to quit it all, so I wanted to get married and
quit it all.''
   Vickers, who is scheduled for surgery today, also wanted Ms.
Jones to be able to collect his Social Security should he die in
surgery, Aunce said.

   A man accused of killing 16 people, including
14 family members, grinned as he squeezed off shots during a
45-minute rampage at four businesses, according to people he
allegedly shot or tried to shoot.
   R. Gene Simmons, a 47-year-old retired Air Force master
sergeant, is being tried in the fatal shootings of former co-worker
Kathy C. Kendrick, 24, and James D. Chaffin, 33, Dec. 28 in
Russellville. Four people were wounded.
   Simmons is scheduled to face a separate trial July 18 in the
slayings of 14 relatives.
   Prosecutor John Bynum, who told the jury he would ask for the
death penalty, said in his opening statement that Miss Kendrick, a
legal secretary, was shot at least four times in the head as she
sat at her desk.
   Officials have said she had spurned Simmons' advances a year
earlier.
   Police have said Chaffin was a chance victim of shooting several
minutes later at Taylor Oil Co., several blocks from the law
office. Simmons had once worked at the oil company and had been the
boss of Russell Taylor, whom he allegedly wounded there.
   David Salyer, shot in the forehead at a small market he owned
and where Simmons had once worked, said that when Simmons
``squeezed the first shot, he was grinning.''
   A witness in the convenience store shooting, Tony Carta, said he
saw Simmons lean over a counter of the market and shoot cashier
Roberta Woolery in the face. The bullet went in her mouth and out
her jaw.
   Both Salyer and Taylor, who showed their scars to the jury,
identified Simmons as the man who shot them.
   Simmons surrendered after another shooting at a motor freight
company, where he allegedly wounded a woman who once had been his
boss.
   Earlier, Juli Money, who worked with Chaffin at the oil company,
testified that she saw Chaffin shot on what was her first day at
work. She said she heard shots, then saw a door fly open as Chaffin
reached for it.
   ``I saw an arm raise up through a window in the door. It shot
and Jim went down,'' she testified.
   Ms. Money said she was trying to see what was going on and
``wondering whether it was a practical joke'' when ``Simmons
stepped over his body, took a stance, and pointed the gun at me. I
screamed, `No,' and dived behind some boxes.
   ``He was grinning. He had a horrid grin _ it looked like he had
false teeth _ and his eyes were wide open.''
   She said she grabbed her head because ``I thought I had been
shot because I felt the heat from the bullet'' as it whizzed past.
She was uninjured.
   After Simmons surrendered, the bodies of his wife and 13 other
relatives were found on his property in Dover, 47 miles east of
Ozark.
   If convicted of murder, Simmons could be sentenced to death or
life in prison without parole.
   Bynum asked for the maximum penalty on all charges, while
Simmons' attorney, Robert E. ``Doc'' Irwin, urged that the jurors
``not be bullied by public opinion, by what the press may say or by
what the public may say.''
   Irwin asked jurors to consider conflicting statements given by
witnesses in describing the gunman.
   Brenda Jones of Atkins testified Tuesday that she was in the law
office on business when Simmons came in and stood in front of Miss
Kendrick's desk.
   The man had his hands in his pockets but jerked his right arm up
and started firing a pistol, she testified. ``He missed her at
first,'' she said. ``She just stood there. He kept shooting.
Finally, he hit her.''
   Mrs. Jones said she was afraid to move and put her head down.
When she looked up, Simmons glanced at her and walked out, she said.
   Asked by Irwin why she had not identified Simmons when she saw
him at the police department on Dec. 28, Mrs. Jones said Simmons
had kept his head down. She identified Simmons on Jan. 13 from
photographs.
   About 60 spectators were in the courtoom, including relatives of
some of Simmons' family members.
   Pat McNulty, 36, of Bryant, whose brother was among the dead
family members, said, ``We've got our grief to deal with and Gene
Simmons has got God to deal with.''
   Viola O'Shields, 51, sister of Simmons' late wife, Becky, and
Roger O'Shields, 53, both of Fort Payne, Ala., said they sat in the
front row because they wanted to make certain that Simmons saw them.
   ``It's hard for us not to have some hate,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Votes For Panel To Determine Military Closings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Senate has decided to create a buffer
against the political consequences of deciding which of the
nation's 3,600 military installationver the proposal that was tacked onto
a Pentagon budget bill.
   Studies by the Pentagon and the Senate Armed Services Committee
have estimated that between $1 billion and $5 billion a year can be
saved if unneeded bases can be closed.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., summed up the political dilemma
Tuesday when he told colleagues: ``The real issue is one that
concerns each of us _ and that is the potential loss of jobs in our
states and resulting economic dislocations. These are very real
concerns.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said, ``There is a perception in the
country, and I think it's accurate, that Congress cannot act to
close a single base because of the political ramifications.''
   The Pentagon has not closed any major U.S. installations since
1977, when Congress erected a series of stiff legal barriers to the
periodic attempts to pare down the nation's military infrastructure.
   The Pentagon last proposed closing bases in 1985, when it said
22 facilities could be shut down. But that idea ran into a storm of
opposition on Capitol Hill and was later dropped.
   As it works through the bill, the Senate is also trying to
answer another politically tricky question of whether to have the
military more deeply involved in the anti-drug fight.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said Tuesday he opposes such
moves. ``I do not believe law enforcement, making arrests, is
appropriate'' for the military, he told a Senate subcommittee. ``I
think it is unwise to get the military into the law enforcement
question. ... Do we shoot people? Do we shoot down planes?''
   The House voted 385-23 last week to order President Reagan to
have the military seal U.S. borders against drug traffickers and a
similar plan is expected to be offered to the Senate.
   Senate leaders are searching for a compromise on some type of
anti-drug plan, much as the base-closing commission proposal was
hammered out among congressional and Pentagon officials in recent
months.
   Legislators agreed that base closings should be considered in
the effort to stretch increasingly scarce dollars in the federal
budget, but wanted to be sure they had a say in the process.
   The original commission plan proposed a nine-member panel, but
Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., opposed that, saying it would give
``absolute power to the Department of Defense.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., agreed, noting that ``the publics in
our communities rely on these bases. ... When these bases are
closed, it better not look political.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas admitted that closing
bases, and the resulting loss of jobs, is politically sensitive.
But he added that ``I hope we can close some. ... I know there are
some that are unneeded.''
   The 15-member commission would include the nine members already
announced by Carlucci and six more Carlucci will appoint with the
approval of key legislators.
   The commission is supposed to finish its work by Dec. 31, and if
it proposes a list of installations to be closed, Carlucci will
have to accept or reject the entire list. His decision can be
blocked only by a vote of both the House and Senate.
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., said, ``In light of our current
budgetary deficit, the need to save $2 billion a year is clear and
obvious.''
   The commission proposal is not in the House version of the
Pentagon budget measure, but that chamber is expected to consider a
separate bill which includes the commission.
   The competing bills that will be approved in the House and
Senate eventually will go to a conference committee to reconcile
differences, including the base-closing plan. Both bills authorize
$299.5 billion in defense spending for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Administration Lowering Expectations for Summit</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is adopting a
``What, me worry?'' attitude on whether Senate inaction on the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty will cloud the Moscow
summit due to start May 29.
   And according to several private experts, the stance may be
justified.
   Not more than two weeks ago, summit planners were confident that
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev would be
able to crown three years of summitry by exchanging the final,
fully ratified documents of the INF treaty the superpowers had been
negotiating off and on since 1981.
   After all, the pact had run the gantlet of hearings, past
senators eager to hack away at the treaty, and it emerged with only
a few dents. Head counters expected that only a dozen or so
senators would vote no on final ratification and that the vote
could occcur before the summit.
   To complete the INF process in time for the Moscow meetings
seemed doubly important because it had become clear that Reagan and
Gorbachev were still far from reaching their goal of a 30 percent
to 50 percent cut in long-range missiles and bombers _ the
so-called START agreement.
   The leaders would be saying, in essence, ``Well, we've stumbled
a bit on START, but let's not dwell on it; signing this final,
ratified, INF pact will give us a chance to remind the world we can
make progress on arms control.''
   In the past two weeks, however, glitches have emerged in the INF
treaty, mostly over the meaning of verification provisions, and the
Senate has decided to postpone ratification work indefinitely. The
administration is optimistic it will clear away the differences in
time for the summit, but that is unlikely to leave the Senate time
to act.
   Is the administration worried the failure will hurt the summit?
   ``Of course not,'' State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman
said on Tuesday.
   Like other U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity,
Redman said the differences between the United States and the
Soviets are merely technical and will be resolved. If the Senate
fails to act in time for the summit, it can do the work afterward
and the ratification documents can be exchanged later in the year.
   The treaty will eliminate ground-launched missiles with ranges
between 315 miles and 3,125 miles.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz was in Geneva today to meet
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to try to resolve
the INF differences and the administration officials predicted that
if Shultz and his negotiators are willing to shake hands on a
settlement, the Senate will go along.
   Janusz Bugajski, an expert on Eastern Europe who works at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes that with
the failure of the superpowers to reach agreement on long-range
systems, the spotlight at the summit will be on human rights and
regional issues rather than on arms control.
   Theoretically, Gorbachev could try to win propaganda points by
raising the Senate's ratification delay as an alleged example of
U.S. hesitancy to end the arms race, Bugajski said.
   ``But that's not likely, because Gorbachev wants the summit to
be a success for domestic and international reasons,'' Bugajski
said.
   ``We don't need an INF treaty ratified in time for the summit,
we just need it not to be scuttled and that's not going to
happen,'' said Andrew C. Goldberg, a RAND Corp. consultant and
expert on Soviet military affairs.
   ``Remember, the vast majority of people in the Senate want to
ratify the INF treaty eventually,'' Goldberg said.
   James T. Hackett, a foreign policy analyst at the conservative
Heritage Foundation, asserted that the Senate's inaction on the INF
treaty reflected members' unease with the treaty despite
overwhelming constituent support for approval. The last-minute
disagreements over verification ``give them a chance to keep
nit-picking so they don't have to ratify it.''
   Hackett added: ``Gorbachev wants the summit to show his nation
he is a commanding figure on the world stage. Reagan wants to put
on a show to keep his approval rating high for as long as he can.
   ``If they can't sign an INF treaty they'll find something else
to do with some pizazz.''

<HEAD>Plastic Handgun Ban Clears House, Prospects Good in Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to ban undetectable plastic
firearms could clear the Senate Judiciary Committee this Thursday,
just two days after the House approved a similar bill with a calm
that rarely accompanies gun control measures.
   A smooth ride for the legislation was virtually assured two
weeks ago, after Attorney General Edwin Meese III and law
enforcement groups agreed to a compromise version _ and the
National Rifle Association went along.
   The NRA agreed to avoid a bruising gun control battle in
Congress when it became clear that no existing handguns would be
prohibited under the agreement.
   Plastic guns are not yet a reality, but chief House sponsor
William J. Hughes said Tuesday the firearms could be a weapon of
choice for terrorists in the future. His colleagues agreed, passing
the bill 413-4.
   The Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, meanwhile
cleared a similar bill by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum for action by
the full committee. The full panel meets again on Thursday, and the
gun bill is on the agenda.
   The Hughes bill would make it illegal to manufacture, import,
sell, transfer or possess a plastic firearm, defined as a weapon
with less than 3.7 ounces of metal.
   Maximum penalties would be five years in prison, and fines of
$250,000 for individuals and $1 million for organizations.
   The bill contains a ``sunset'' provision that would repeal the
criminal provisions after five years, enabling the law to keep pace
with any advances that may occur in firearms detection technology.
   Voting against the House measure were Republican Reps. Dick
Cheney of Wyoming; Philip Crane of Illinois; Norman Shumway of
California and Barbara Vucanovich of Nevada.
   Hughes' bill was introduced before the administration-police
compromise, but embodies the same concept.
   The more precise language is in the Senate version, which would
establish a detectability standard that would permit detection of
the same weapons as the Hughes bill. However, it does not provide
for a minimum content of metal in the gun.
   Both measures would detect all existing hanguns, thus keeping
them legal for law-abiding owners. But plastic weapons that failed
to meet the same metallic standard would be prohibited.
   Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, called the House vote ``a major step in the
right direction. I look forward to working with Congressman Hughes
to make sure the Congress sends the president the strongest bill
possible,'' he said Tuesday.
   Hughes said he saw no problem in working out a compromise
between the House and Senate language.
   A Winter Park, Fla., company that claims to be the leader in
plastic firearms technology says it has no plans to produce plastic
handguns.
   Dwight C. Brunoehler, vice president of Red Eye Arms Inc., said
the company was working on a plastic machine gun grenade launcher
that it hopes to sell to the Marines.
   ``We see the military business as where we want to be,'' he
said, adding the company will be working on that project for at
least the next two years. He said the company also has pledged
never to make an undetectable plastic weapon.

<HEAD>Wheat Harvest Forecast Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1988 winter wheat harvest could be around
1.62 billion bushels if the Agriculture Department's initial
forecast is borne out, up 4 percent from last year's production.
   Based on surveys May 1, the average yield of this year's harvest
is expected to be 40.7 bushels per acre, compared with 39.8 bushels
per acre in 1987 when winter wheat output was 1.56 billion bushels.
   Farmers are expected to have about 39.8 million acres for
harvest this year, up 1 percent from 39.3 million in 1987.
   ``As of May 1, over 60 percent of the winter wheat in the major
producing states rated in good or better condition,'' said the
department's report Tuesday. ``Another 28 percent is rated in fair
condition.''
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following
summer. It makes up about three-fourths of total U.S. wheat
production.
   The outlook for wheat prices at the farm also has brightened,
reflecting brisk export demand and a reduction in once-awesome U.S.
wheat stockpiles.
   In a related supply-and-demand report, the USDA projected total
wheat production this year, based on historical trends, at 2.17
billion bushels, up slighly from 2.1 billion bushels in 1987. That
would include winter wheat and other kinds planted this spring for
harvest later in the year.
   The report also projected the U.S. wheat stockpile is expected
to decline further to around 796 million bushels by the end of the
coming marketing year on May 31, 1989, compared with more than 1.23
billion bushels of old-crop wheat expected to be carried over this
June 1.
   Carl Schwensen, executive vice president of the National
Asssociation of Wheat Growers, said the expected reduction in U.S.
wheat inventories will mean tighter supplies in the year ahead.
   Does that mean the United States is running low on wheat after
the recent years of huge surpluses?
   ``That's relatively correct,'' Schwensen said. ``And if we're
going to stay in the world market, we're going to have to have
adequate supplies for our customers. That's why we feel the acreage
reserve level can be relaxed and farmers can have the opportunity
to market more bushels in the 1989 season.''
   Schwensen referred to a farm law provision that limits USDA to
no more than a 20 percent land-idling requirement when the wheat
stockpile is projected to drop below a billion bushels. At a
projected 796 million bushels on May 31, 1989, that would be well
below the mark.
   For the last two years the USDA has required wheat farmers to
idle 27.5 percent of their base acreage in order to qualify for
supports and other federal benefits. Schwensen said the association
wants to see the 1989 requirement reduced to between 10 percent and
20 percent.
   Wheat market prices were projected for 1988-89 at an average
range of $2.80 to $3.20 per bushel, compared with $2.55 estimated
for 1987-88.
   The indicated production of winter wheat, based on May 1,
prospects, are listed here. The first numbers show the total
production in thousands of bushels. The second numbers are the
average yields per acre for the major states.

   The Soviet Union may be headed for another
bumper grain harvest, which the Agriculture Department says could
dampen import requirements if wheat quality improves from the last
couple of years.
   In its first forecast of this year's Soviet grain production,
the USDA said Tuesday that 1988 production could be 215 million
metric tons of grain, up 2 percent from last year's bumper output
of 211.4 million tons.
   The department said the harvests could include 92 million tons
of wheat, 109 million tons of coarse grains such as rye, barley,
oats and corn, and 14 million tons of miscellaneous grains and
pulses, which include peas and beans.
   Officials said the harvest outlook could mean a cutback in grain
imports, particularly wheat. The United States has been selling the
Soviets huge quantities of wheat lately, all of it at subsidized
prices under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   If the 1988 harvest turns out as forecast, it would be the third
year in a row that Soviet grain production has exceeded 200 million
tons, an unprecedented feat for that country.
   It also would be the third largest Soviet grain output, exceeded
by the record crop of 237.4 million tons in 1978 and the 1976
harvest of 223.8 million tons.
   However, officials said the 1988 forecast is ``highly
tentative'' and that it ``will be modified as the season progresses
by both positive and negative factors, including weather
developments.''

   A record catch of 6.9 billion pounds of fish
and shellfish was landed by U.S. fishermen last year, breaking the
previous record of 6.5 billion pounds set in 1980, the government
reports.
   The 1987 catch, valued at $3.1 billion, was up 865 million
pounds from the 1986 total of 6 billion pounds, worth $2.8 billion,
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday.
   Louisiana led all states in volume with a catch of 1.8 billion
pounds. It was followed by Alaska, with 1.7 billion pounds;
Virginia, 709.6 million pounds; California, 451.7 million pounds;
and Mississippi, 436.7 million pounds.
   By value, Alaska was first with a catch of $941.7 million,
followed by Louisiana, $315.9 million; Massachusetts, $278.9
million; Texas, $199.7 million; and California, $173.2 million.

   By the end of the century there will be a need
for a new civilian transport plane capable of carrying 247
passengers on 5,000-mile trips at two to three times the speed of
sound, says a new study.
   That will open a $200 billion-plus market for the country which
first manufactures the new generation of supersonic planes for
civilian use in the years 2000 to 2010, said the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The agency, however, recommended against building a production
transport faster than three times the speed of sound, saying that
would involve ``too great a price and with too great a delay in
reaching operational service.'' At Mach 2.7, an airplane could fly
from Los Angeles to Tokyo in under four hours.
   A body traveling at Mach 1 would be traveling at the speed of
sound, and Mach 2 would equal twice the speed of sound.
   The study said growth in travel across the Pacific will justify
designing and building a supersonic transport. The United States
had such an effort under way in the 1960s, but abandoned it because
of noise-pollution problems and the high cost of fuel.
   ``Many technologies are much more advanced today,'' the NASA
study said. ``Weight reduction and aircraft shaping are the best
methods of reducing the sonic boom heard at ground level. New
design methods for shaping are just now becoming avialable.''
   The aircraft eventually would fly twice as far as the European
Concorde, which has a range of 3,350 miles.
   The new generation of airplanes would not be the ``Orient
Express'' that President Reagan envisioned in his State of the
Union message two years ago when he announced research for a plane
capable of flying 25 times the speed of sound and thus able to go
into orbit.
   NASA and the Defense Department jointly are now carrying out
research for such a hypersonic plane and a decision will be made in
1990 on whether to build it at a cost of $3.3 billion.
   ``NASA program managers believe research for the long-range
commercial market should now focus on getting the highest speed
possible out of a conventionally fueled, high-speed transport,''
the agency said.
   Two studies were performed for NASA's Langley Research Center in
Virginia by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, the only U.S. firms
building large transports.
   ``The Boeing studies indicate that, by the year 2000, a fleet of
1,200 large, subsonic aircraft would be needed to carry the
estimated worldwide, long-range traffic of 315,000 passengers per
day,'' NASA said. ``By comparison, less than 800 supersonic
transports, each carrying 247 passengers as far as 5,000 nautical
miles, could serve the same markets.''
   Timeliness in providing a viable and competitive vehicle is
important if the United States is to capture a major portion of the
high-speed transport market, estimated to be over $200 billion,
NASA said.
   It added: ``This market could be an important factor in the U.S.
sustaining a positive balance of trade in the aerospace market.''
   The federal government would not be a financial partner in
building an SST, but NASA said it has a clear charter to pursue the
technologies and reduce the financial risk to aircraft builders.
   ``It then would be up to industry to build and sell the
high-speed, civil transport on their own,'' the agency said.

<HEAD>Fisheries, Environmentalists Agree On Truce Over Coastal Fishing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Environmental organizations and a segment of
the U.S. fishing industry say they will ask Congress to allow the
incidental killing of marine mammals by fishermen to continue into
the 1990s.
   Spokesmen for the two normally combative groups announced
Tuesday they had reached a three-year truce in their long-standing
tussle over the killing of sea mammals off the U.S. coast.
   ``They're going to give us a three-year lease on life,'' said
Dayton Alverson of Natural Resources Consultants, who said he was
speaking for commercial fishing interests in Alaska.
   Alverson and Bo Bricklemyer, a Greenpeace lawyer speaking for a
coalition of environmental organizations, said the pact is designed
to end the threat that recent court decisions could put many U.S.
fishermen out of business in 1989.
   The court rulings said that the Commerce Department could not
issue new 1989 permits to fishermen to kill mammals unless it could
demonstrate that this would not deplete the population of a
specific mammal.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the
Marine Mammal Commission say they lack adequate information to make
such declarations on a number of air-breathing sea creatures.
   The agreement, if it is accepted by Congress, would allow
continued issuance of permits for the incidental killing of many
mammals through 1991 in return for commercial fishery cooperation
in obtaining data on their populations.
   The plan also calls for limits on the numbers of northern fur
seals and northern sea lions that can be taken by fishermen, who
often find portions of their catch snatched away by sea mammals
before they can be landed.
   The agreement, which deals with coastal fishing, does not
address the problem of dolphins killed by tuna fishermen in the
eastern Pacific.
   Part of the agreement calls for outside observers to be on
fishing boats. Alverson said he wants the federal government to pay
the $2 million to $2{ million needed each year to hire 35 observers.
   Bricklemyer said environmentalists agreed to the three-year
hiatus in return for the fishing industry educating its members
about mammal protection and collecting data that can be used to
make decisions about whether a particular mammal is facing
depletion.
   ``We had two choices: shut down the industry, which nobody
wanted to do, or find out what's going on,'' said Bricklemyer,
adding that Alverson's group and the environmentalists would work
together to get Congress to overturn the court rulings.
   Alverson said: ``There is a growing recognition in the fishing
community that we have to live with the interests of the
environmental community. ... You can't keep going on flailing at
each other.''
   The agreement was announced shortly before the start of a
hearing on marine mammal protection by the House Merchant Marine
and Fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation
and the environment.
   Asked his opinion of the agreement, subcommittee chairman Gerry
Studds, D-Mass., said: ``I don't know. I haven't looked at it yet.''
   A wildlife lobbyist, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that environmental groups made the deal in order to try to salvage
something from expected action by Congress this year to overturn
the court rulings.

   The national panel created to solve the
national budget problem is quickly learning that balancing the
government's checkbook first means decoding some artful accounting.
   ``If we did this in business, they'd lock us up,'' said
commission member Lee Iacocca, the Chrysler chairman, after the
National Economic Commission on Tuesday held its first public
hearing on federal budget practices.
   Experts told the commission the history of the convoluted budget
process and the scope of the deficit problem, which has already
saddled taxpayers with paying back principal and interest on more
than $2.5 trillion in debt.
   The tone among the commission members was often jocular in
reaction to testimony about federal budgeting oddities.
   Timothy Muris, a George Mason University professor who until
last year worked at the Office of Management and Budget, described
how a ``cut'' can really be an increase in spending.
   That's because budget writers work from projections of inflated
program costs instead of current spending levels.
   ``I thought I was pretty good when I was in government, but I
was a rank amateur,'' said Washington lawyer Robert Strauss, a
Democrat who is co-chairman of the commission.
   ``Think of it as a 20 percent cut from a 50 percent markup,''
quipped Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO.
   But former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger made clear he
didn't think the concept was funny when it applied to Pentagon
spending. Cutting the military short of inflationary increases is
``a very real reduction,'' he said.
   ``There is nothing in the world situation which justifies that
kind of cutback,'' he said, referring to recent budget restraints.
``That is a reality and it is a very unhappy reality for the United
States.''
   Weinberger said the first task of the commission should be to
streamline the budget process, but the witnesses did not agree.
   Commission co-chairman Drew Lewis, President Reagan's former
Transportation secretary and currently the head of the Union
Pacific Railroad, announced that the group intended to produce its
recommendation by Dec. 21, more than two months ahead of its
statutory deadline.
   The revised schedule would give the 12-member commission a great
chance of influencing policies of the next president, who will get
to appoint two more commission members after November's election.
   ``We are not looking at this as a partisan mission,'' said Lewis.
   Carol Cox, executive director of the Committee for a Responsible
Federal Budget, told the commission that reducing the deficit will
be a difficult task and efforts so far have had mixed results.
   ``It seems like we're on a treadmill _ we're running to stay in
place,'' she said.
   But Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., was optimistic. ``We're
talking about a situation that's within our capacity to solve.''
   Cox said the budget mechanisms have worked well when there's a
consensus to be carried out. Presidents Carter and Reagan both used
it to achieve their initial legislative successes when they took
office, she said.
   Stanley Collender, director of federal budget policy for the
firm of Touche Ross & Co., said procedures could be improved but
``the budget process is not the problem.''
   ``It will always be subservient to politics,'' he said.

<HEAD>Product Liability Lawsuit Bill Clears First Test</HEAD>

   Legislation setting new ground rules for
filing damage suits against manufacturers of hazardous products
survived its initial test in a House committee, but its chances of
passing Congress this year are still considered minimal.
   Consumer activists suffered a setback Tuesday when the House
Energy and Commerce Committee rejected two proposals by Rep. Henry
A. Waxman, D-Calif., that would have expanded the product liability
bill's narrow list of legal grounds available to victims seeking to
recover damages.
   Then, after four hours of bickering, the committee postponed
until Thursday any further action on what Rep. James J. Florio,
D-N.J., called a ``complex and extremely controversial'' measure.
   The bill would establish a uniform federal standard of product
liability that would pre-empt conflicting state laws. Consumer
activists vigorously oppose the measure on the ground that it would
weaken the legal rights of victims of unsafe consumer products.
   It was the first time that the House bill, first introduced in
1979, had advanced to the full committee. Even if it reaches the
House floor, which is uncertain, the bill is virtually assured of a
hostile reception in the Senate, where it was filibustered to death
in late 1986.
   Two consumer groups called it ``a radical bill that would
immunize the manufacturers of defective goods, deprive victims of
compensation for their injuries and expose American consumers to
more hazardous products.''
   Business support for the bill has become increasingly lukewarm
with each revision aimed at meeting consumer demands. ``This is a
watered-down bill,'' said Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., ``but it is
better than none.''
   Other committee Republicans said the bill represented an
important step toward discouraging ``frivolous'' damage suits,
reversing the escalating cost of liability insurance premiums and
bolstering the competitiveness of U.S. products on world markets.
   The committee's first day of debate focused on a compromise
plan, drafted by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., at the request of Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., the panel's chairman, which was aimed at
making the bill more acceptable to consumer groups and moderate
committee Democrats.
   Charging that ``we are about to emasculate the product liability
system,'' Waxman tried unsuccessfully to restore some of the legal
grounds for damage suits in the states that would be pre-empted by
a uniform federal standard.
   Dingell voted with opponents in defeating Waxman's pair of
consumer-backed amendments by roll call votes of 29-12 and 30-12.
   Under the bill approved by Florio's commerce subcommittee last
December, a manufacturer could escape liability for damages if he
did not know _ or could not know _ of a design defect with
knowledge ``reasonably available'' to him, or if there were no
feasible alternative design.
   This restriction would not apply if the consumer could establish
that the product was egregiously unsafe, that an ordinary consumer
would not know of the product's risks and if the product had little
or no usefulness.
   The Synar plan would require only that the plaintiff prove that
the product was so unsafe compared with its usefulness that it
should not have been marketed. Synar also would put the burden of
proof on the manufacturer to show that a design defect could not be
discovered and that an alternative design was not feasible.
   Leaders of four consumer organizations complained to Dingell on
April 27 that Synar's plan ``still falls far short of protecting
the legal rights of individuals injured by unreasonably dangerous
and defective products.''
   Underscoring the bill's poor prospects, Rep. Jim Bates,
D-Calif., drew laughter at one point in the debate by referring to
Synar's plan as ``a killer amendment to a bill that's already
dead.''

never going to be able to live out my dream.''
   Instead, Winkler went on to graduate from college, and earned a
master's degree in drama at Yale University. The rest is TV history.
   ``I dreamed of doing what I do now,'' said Winkler, who works
primarily as a producer of the TV series ``MacGyver.''
   Winkler was among the hosts Tuesday at the Los Angeles Unified
School District's ``Youth Recognition Day'' for outstanding
students ranging from fifth to 12th grade.

<HEAD>Bennett Describes Self as Education Department's Savior</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett says
his department is now much less likely to be eliminated, and that
he deserves the credit.
   Bennett's boast came Tuesday during a typically contentious
appearance before a congressional committee, replete with the
taunts and tantrums that have marked almost every Capitol Hill
exchange between lawmakers and the education secretary.
   One day after Bennett announced plans to step down in
mid-September, Sen. Lowell Weicker accused him of having shirked
his responsibilities to poor and handicapped students aided by
federal programs.
   ``In the course of your tenure, you have chosen to go ahead and
ravage these programs,'' said Weicker, R-Conn., referring to budget
cuts sought on a nearly annual basis by the department.
   ``Why didn't you concentrate on what was your responsibility?''
Weicker asked. ``I have difficulty understanding your preoccupation
with everybody else's business. ... I find it incredible that
nothing has been achieved in your specific charges.''
   Bennett defended his interest in state and local education
efforts during what he termed probably his final appearance before
the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on education and other
agencies. ``The best federal program is the program that's deployed
well at the local level,'' he sid.
   President Reagan came into office pledging to dissolve the
Education Department and Bennett conceded under questioning that he
still does not see a real need for it, other than to spark debate.
   What, asked an irritated Weicker, would you think of teachers
who see no real need for their jobs?
   ``They shouldn't be in a classroom,'' Bennett replied.
   ``Well, you shouldn't be in the Department of Education,''
Weicker snapped. ``What kind of commitment does that show?''
   ``I made a hell of a commitment. You just didn't like the
direction,'' Bennett retorted. ``I was damn successful. You're mad
at me because we were a lot more successful than you thought we'd
be.''
   In fact, Bennett said, he has done such a good job that the
question of the department's future is probably moot.
   ``It's much less likely you'll see abolition of the Department
of Education in the future, largely because of me,'' he said. ``A
lot of people think the department's been transformed.''
   Bennett contended he had as much responsibility to lead ``an
intense national conversation about education'' as to oversee
federal programs.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., the subcommittee chairman, has been
highly critical of Bennett but defended the secretary's conception
of his job. When he voted in favor of creating the department,
Chiles said, ``I hoped there would be a national spokesman ... I
quite agree with you that that is your role.''
   The administration has sought deep cuts in education spending
for every fiscal year except 1985 and 1989 _ the years for which
proposals were submitted during presidential election campaigns.
   Bennett repeatedly has lectured lawmakers about the need to
restrain spending and told them more money does not necessarily
produce better education. For their part, lawmakers have blasted
Bennett for consistently agreeing to cuts far deeper than those
proposed for any other department.
   The result has been a continuing series of stormy, sarcastic
sessions with various congressional panels, including the one
Tuesday.
   ``Mr. Secretary, I know you're going to miss these lovefests,''
said Chiles.
   Bennett indicated later that lawmakers may not have seen the
last of him. He said he wouldn't rule out returning to a Cabinet
post _ even possibly education secretary _ in a future Republican
administration.

<HEAD>House Approves Tougher Penalties for Contract Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A unanimously passed House bill would raise
penalties against contractors convicted of defrauding the federal
government, and its chief sponsor predicts the measure will stop a
flood of such cases.
   ``Procurement fraud is robbing the government of hundreds of
millions of dollars a year, and in some instances costing peoples'
lives,'' chief sponsor William J. Hughes, D-N.J., said following
Tuesday's 419-0 vote.
   The measure, which now goes to the Senate, would apply to any
procurement contract of $1 million or more in which the government
was bilked out of at least $250,000. Procurement contracts are
those providing a product rather than a service.
   Hughes said the bill would apply to some 10,000 existing
contracts.
   The legislation would establish a maximum prison sentence of 10
years, and a minimum two-year sentence for cases involving a
foreseeable and substantial risk of personal injury.
   Hughes said the risk could result from substitution of inferior
products by contractors, especially in military parts.
   Current law permits fines based on the monetary gain to the
defendant or the loss to the federal government.
   The House bill would add a new fine of up to $10 million in
cases in which the risk of injury is involved.
   A reward system would permit payments of up to $250,000 from the
criminal fines for information leading to a conviction.
   The measure also contains protection for government
whistleblowers who provide information leading to convictions.
   Fraud in procurement contracts has involved overcharges,
malfunctioning equipment and product substitution, Hughes said.
   The General Accounting Office reported in January that based on
known cases, the estimated loss to the government in procurement
fraud was $387.4 million in a one-year period ending March 31, 1986.

<HEAD>Postal Service Cuts Could End by Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Post office window service and collections
could be back to normal by the end of summer, but that won't mean
the end of the agency's financial struggles, according to
Postmaster General Anthony Frank.
   Frank said Tuesday that he is committed to restoring service
that was cut earlier this year in the face of congressionally
imposed budget restrictions.
   But reopening counters and restoring Sunday sorting and
collection means finding $9 million a month in savings somewhere
else, he said.
   With luck, he said, that can be accomplished by late summer. But
he added that services will be restored only when he is sure that
they can be kept open.
   Hundreds of construction projects for new postal facilities also
were canceled or delayed to save money.
   ``Long after people forget about the windows being closed,''
building projects will still be delayed, land will have been sold
to someone else and construction costs will be even higher, Frank
said.
   Frank, who took over as postmaster on March 1, said that
explaining the need for service cuts at the same time rates are
rising has been difficult.
   The rate increases imposed on April 3 don't help, he said,
because the accounting system mandated by Congress results in the
increased income being counted as a reduction in the national debt,
not as extra money for the agency.
   On other topics, Frank said:
   _A system may be considered in which notices would automatically
be sent out for people filing change or address forms.
   _The agency should help serve as a go-between for other federal
agencies and the public, such as by making catalogs of Government
Printing Office booklets available in lobbies. The current program
to deliver an AIDS booklet to every home is a good example, he said.
   _It is ``amazing'' how many suggestions for new stamps he
receives. He said he doesn't see anything wrong with issuing a
stamp to honor singer Elvis Presley, although so far the
independent committee that makes the final choices has turned down
that idea.
   The budget problems may be eased by a House bill that would
remove the Postal Service from the federal budget. The agency had
not been part of the budget until 1985.
   ``You really can't include us in the budget process, when we
don't use taxes,'' Frank said. Direct subsidies to the agency were
ended several years ago.
   In addition to restoring the services that were cut earlier,
Frank said he wants to find ways to add other services.
   For example, automated postal tellers now under development
could be placed in shopping malls, more markets and other stores
encouraged to sell stamps at their checkouts and automation
improved to speed post office lobby service.
   Frank said battling for renewed public confidence means both
improved service and improving perception of that service.
   He described a program in which postal carriers placed specific
items in home mailboxes and, later, asked the residents to fill out
forms indicating whether those items had been received.
   When the item was a large white envelope, only 0.3 percent
reported that it had not been delivered, he said. But when it was a
commercial catalog, 11 percent of the people who received it
reported that it had not arrived.
   ``We know the items were delivered'' but the perceived value of
the item makes a difference, he said.

   A representative of Democratic presidential
front-runner Michael Dukakis says the party must avoid ``simply
listing the hopes of every group in America'' in its 1988 platform.
   ``The document then becomes meaningless,'' said Michael Barnes
after his appearance Tuesday before the Democratic Platform
Committee.
   But while the Dukakis camp was advising caution, a leader of the
Jesse Jackson campaign said the platform should call for tax
increases on the rich.
   The 30-member platform committee, chaired by Michigan Gov. James
J. Blanchard, received its marching orders last month from party
chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr., who wants a streamlined platform that
``every Democratic candidate is going to be proud to stand upon'' _
not one that provides ammunition for the GOP.
   Blanchard said the platform must be ``hard-hitting, progressive,
future-oriented, idealistic, readable and inspiring. If our
platform is going to be taken seriously, it must not hide in the
mush of verbosity, buzz words or the easy promise.''
   Walter Fauntroy, representing the Jackson campaign, exhorted the
platform-writers not to make ``the mistake of a generalized,
against-sin and for-motherhood platform.''
   ``There comes a time when the rubber's got to hit the road,''
said Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's non-voting representative
in Congress.
   ``We need to call for tax increases'' on the wealthy, for
freezing military spending and for using pension funds to help
rebuild America, Fauntroy said.
   Barnes, a former congressman from Maryland who played a role in
drafting the last three platforms, said the new one should ``help
to unite all Democrats (and) bring us a resounding victory in
November.''
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, a co-chair of the committee, asked
Fauntroy, the Jackson representative, to provide the ``bottom-line
principles that (Jackson) feels must be in the platform.''
   Fauntroy promised to provide such a list.
   Lawmakers, lobbyists, mayors, labor and civil rights leaders
urged the party not to gloss over specific commitments to women's
issues, education spending, a tough stance on narcotics and other
causes.
   Kristina Kiehl, chair of a pro-abortion rights political action
committee called Voters for Choice, said that with the Republican
Party opposed to abortion, it is imperative for Democrats again to
include ``a plank supporting reproductive freedom, including
abortion funding'' for the poor.
   ``It has been suggested that our platform be a succinct,
compelling statement of principles,'' she said. ``Let us be clear:
it isn't the length of the document that will move people. ... It
is the degree of commitment to those principles.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, the leadoff witness, said:
``We've had a challenge from our chairman to keep it short, and
ever since that time people have been running from the word
`short.' So we use other words: brief, concise, compact, terse,
round and firm and fully packed and all those kinds of things.''
   Wright said the Democrats must articulate a vision for the
future repudiating Reagan administration policies that he said have
brought ``downward mobility'' to families struggling to own homes
or send children to college.
   The platform committee will hold a hearing Friday in Norfolk,
Va., on defense and foreign policy. Other forums will be held on:
families, in Columbus, Ohio, on May 19; young Americans, on May 26
in Austin, Texas; jobs, on June 2 in both Los Angeles and Detroit,
and new leaders, at a time and place to be determined.
   A 15-member drafting committee will huddle on Mackinac Island,
Mich., June 9-13 to produce a draft. The full committee will take
up the final document later in June, several weeks before the party
convention opens in Atlanta on July 18.
   The convention delegates will pass judgment on the platform on
July 19.

   ``I've worked my butt off,'' she said. ``I've been out at the
studios day and night for six weeks.''
   Ms. Lynn also is writing a sequel to her 1976 best-selling book,
``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' which was made into a hit movie in 1980.

   Gov. Ray Mabus bet on the winner and
runner-up in the Kentucky Derby, but only won about $33, his aide
says.
   Mabus spokesman Kevin Vandenbroek said the governor went
unannounced to Louisville, Ky., for the derby while legislators
were racing to adjourn their 1988 regular session Saturday.
   Traditionally, governors visit the House and Senate on the
closing day of sessions and several lawmakers expressed surprise
that Mabus did not come by.
   Vandenbroek said he thought Mabus bet on Winning Colors, the
winner, and the runnerup, Forty Niner. ``I want to say he won
something like $33,'' Vandenbroek said.
   In the past, Mabus has not supported proposals to legalize
racing and betting.

   The life sentences and possibility of parole
given a once-condemned killer for his role in killing six members
of the Alday family have left ``a lot of broken hearts'' in
southwest Georgia, said one family member.
   Wayne Carl Coleman was sentenced Tuesday to six life prison
terms after the jury that convicted him deliberated almost a week
without voting the death sentence prosecutors won in his trial 14
years ago.
   By law, the life sentences were automatic because the jury could
not agree. The 11 members of the Alday family present when the
sentence was announced broke into tears.
   ``We do know we had some friends on the jury and we certainly
appreciate them,'' said Bud Alday, brother of two victims, who
discovered their bodies. ``We had some enemies, too, and they're
going to have to live with it.''
   ``Everybody down here is just as sick as they can be. There are
a lot of broken hearts in Seminole County,'' Bobby Alday, nephew of
victims Ned and Aubrey Alday, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   Ned and his brother Aubrey, along with Ned's sons Jimmy, Jerry
and Chester, were shot to death in Jerry Alday's mobile home on May
14, 1973, after they walked in on a burglary.
   Jerry's wife, Mary Alday, was repeatedly raped, then driven to a
wooded area, where she was again raped, sodomized, shot and left to
die on an ant hill.
   Coleman, Carl Isaacs and George Dungee _ who had escaped from a
Maryland prison camp _ were convicted in Seminole County of the
murders and sentenced to death. The convictions were overturned in
1985 by a federal appeals panel that said pretrial publicity
influenced the original trial jury.
   ``It's been awful hard. We've been waiting for 15 years to see
justice,'' said Ernestine Alday, widow of Ned and mother of Jimmy,
Jerry and Chester. She said faith in God has sustained the family:
``He's going to be the judge.''
   Coleman was retried during the past several weeks in DeKalb
Superior Court. Isaacs was convicted in Perry in January and again
sentenced to die; Dungee faces a retrial later this year in
Columbus.
   Coleman is immediately eligible for parole review under a 1964
law requiring a review after seven years in prison, and will go
before the state Board of Pardons and Paroles next month, said
board spokesman Silas Moore.
   But State Attorney General Michael Bowers disagreed, saying
Coleman is covered by a 1983 law that would require him to serve 30
years before a parole hearing.
   Coleman's attorney Tom West said the life sentences were
justified. ``We can only assume that if Wayne had had a fair trial
15 years ago, he would have gotten a life sentence,'' he said.
   ``Wayne is satisfied that his life has been spared,'' West said.
   Faded ``Remember the Aldays'' bumper stickers still can be found
on a few cars in Seminole County, a sparsely populated area where
most people are farmers. They don't like that their tax dollars
have financed such a long judicial process, said Bobby Alday, who
was not in court Tuesday.
   ``I think Seminole County is tired of getting these people TVs
and tennis rackets,'' he said. ``Without a doubt, these people,
they don't deserve a second chance. They've not shown a bit of
remorse.''
   Alday said the numerous appeals and lengthy debate in the case
since the murders took place have placed a strain on the closeknit
family, whose ``big family reunions and such'' have now ``gone by
the wayside.''
   ``Most people down here would like to move on and put this
behind them, yet it'll be years to come before everybody down here
can move on with their lives,'' Alday said.
   ``When your family's been wiped out, it's not easy to put it
aside,'' he continued. ``It's been a long hard road for everybody
down here.''

<HEAD>Irving Berlin Planning Quiet 100th Birthday</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with 75 people serenading
Berlin, picking up 4th graf ``Any list...''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 75 people gathered outside the home of
Irving Berlin early Wednesday, serenading the composer of dozens of
famous songs on his 100th birthday.
   Berlin planned a quiet day at home with relatives Wednesday
avoiding the limelight as he has for decades.
   The group assembled outside the five-story Manhattan townhouse
at midnight Tuesday to sing ``Happy Birthday,'' Berlin's ``Always''
and ``The Songs of Irving Berlin,'' an original composition by
neighbor, songwriter and fan John Wallowitch.
   ``Sing softly with great love,'' Wallowitch instructed, and the
group crooned:
   ``Over the years, through laughter and tears, while strolling
down memory lane, we sang all the songs of Irving Berlin and we'll
sing them all over, again and again.''
   ``It's one of the few songs he doesn't own the copyright to,''
Wallowitch, who organized the caroling, said earlier.
   Berlin did not appear.
   Any list of the 20th-century's most popular songs would be
filled with Berlin's contributions, including ``God Bless
America,'' ``White Christmas,'' ``Easter Parade,'' ``Alexander's
Ragtime Band,'' ``Russian Lullaby,'' ``There's No Business Like
Show Business,'' ``Puttin' on the Ritz,'' ``Blue Skies,'' ``Cheek
to Cheek,'' ``Always'' and ``What'll I Do?''
   Altogether, Berlin has written about 1,500 songs, some of which
will be heard again Wednesday night when the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers holds a tribute at Carnegie Hall.
   Among performers scheduled to appear are Frank Sinatra, Willie
Nelson, Jerome Robbins, Isaac Stern, Ray Charles and Garrison
Keillor. Berlin is a charter member of ASCAP, founded in 1914.
   Nonetheless, ``He won't be at Carnegie Hall,'' his secretary,
Hilda Schneider, said. ``His birthdays are always spent very
quietly with family.''

<HEAD>Rise In Foreign Fruit Could Mean More Pesticides On American
Tables</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Leon E. Panetta says a surge in produce
imports intensifies concerns that foreign fruit and vegetables are
arriving on U.S. dinner tables with a pesticide residue.
   Panetta says he's also concerned that burgeoning imports may
hurt domestic producers, who asked the California Democrat for
protective trade legislation at a hearing Tuesday.
   Panetta chairs the House Agriculture subcommittee on domestic
marketing, consumer relations and nutrition.
   Panetta released a General Accounting Office study showing fruit
imports more than tripled, $482 million to $1.6 billion, while
vegetable imports more than doubled, from $783 million to $1.6
billion, between 1980 and 1986.
   Panetta said those increases heighten concerns about consumer
safety because the Food and Drug Administration's enforcement
efforts are already weak.
   He cited a GAO study that found the FDA tests less than 1
percent of all food shipments and uses laboratory methods that can
detect only half the pesticides available on world markets.
   Ronald Bown, executive director of the Chilean Exporters
Association, testified that the Chilean fruit and vegetable export
industry ``is in conscientious compliance with (pesticide)
regulations in force in all countries.''
   ``Each exporter maintains strict control over the use and
management of pesticides by each of his producers,'' Bown said.
   And Antonio Berentsen _ of Covemex, S.A., of Celaya, Mexico, a
broccoli and cauliflower exporter _ said Mexican growers use the
same pesticides and herbicides as their U.S. counterparts, and
apply them in the same manner.
   Domestic growers saw it otherwise.
   ``We need to enforce pesticide regulations on imports, because
right now they have an open door to anything they want to use and
there is a lot of abuse going on,'' said David Gill, president of
NorCal-Crosetti Foods Inc. of Watsonville, Calif.
   Other witnesses representing growers testified the wave of
imports could end up sqeezing them out of business and called for
trade protection legislation.
   The GAO study found that the import shares for major fresh and
frozen fruits rose from about 26 percent in 1980 to about 33
percent in 1986, and for major fresh vegetables, from about 5
percent to about 7 percent.
   The study said consumers benefited from the increase in greater
supplies and variety, and in some instances, lower prices. Some
producers and domestic processors have been hurt, while
distributors and some processors benefited.
   But Jeffrey Garguilo, president of the Florida Fruit and
Vegetable Association testified: ``If nothing changes, we see more
domestic production lost to foreign production. This will result in
lost jobs, lost agricultural land, and injury to the economy of
rural America.''

<TEXT>
   Activists Abbie Hoffman and Dennis Banks, who've run afoul of
the law in bucking the system, say they've also learned how to make
a buck during their years as political gadflies.
   Hoffman, the antic activist who once offered a pig as a
presidential candidate, says he's been cutting it up long enough to
know how to work an audience as a comedian, rather than just as an
advocate who uses humor.
   Banks, the former Indian activist, noted that something good has
come of all his economic development work in South Dakota. He and
his wife have decided to open a limousine service there.
   Hoffman speaks at more than 50 university campuses a year at
$3,000 an appearance, but the 51-year-old former Yippie was in San
Juan Capistrano, Calif., on Tuesday for a comedy gig at the Coach
House.
   ``This isn't new, this comedy stuff, because I was a bit of a
stand-up comedian during the '60s,'' said Hoffman, who gained
notoriety as one of the Chicago Seven defendants charged with
inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic national convention.
   ``The difference is that, in the '60s, they shot and threw bags
of garbage at me, so this seems pretty tame by comparison,'' he
said.
   Banks said recently he plans to open a limousine stall at the
Rapid City Regional Airport terminal and operate a shuttle between
there and Rapid City and Pine Ridge. He also wants to add one or
two 15-passenger vans to the business.
   Banks' Limousine Service,``specializing in your taste for the
finer things in life,'' will offer free roses or a bottle of
non-alcoholic champagne to customers.
   His market will include airport travelers, tourists who want a
private ride through the Black Hills and Indian, and government
officials who travel regularly between Pine Ridge and Washington,
D.C., Banks said.
   ``I thought there was a market there because I had been
experimenting with economic development in the past two or three
years since I got out,'' said Banks, referring to his release from
prison in South Dakota.
   Banks, 56, became famous during the tumultuous days of American
Indian Movement activism, which peaked in 1973 during the
occupation of Wounded Knee. He served about one year in prison in
connection with the 1973 riot at the Custer County Courthouse.

<HEAD>Iran's Growing Influence A Cause Of Recent Fighting In Lebanon</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAQOURA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's growing influence in southern
Lebanon has made it a target for attack by rival Shiite Moslem
militiamen and Israel's army.
   Over the past year, Iran has mounted an ambitious program to
finance religious centers, medical clinics and anti-Israeli
guerrillas. Israeli officials estimate Iran is spending up to $100
million a year on such projects.
   The vehicle for planting the seeds of Iran's revolution has been
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, which until recent
weeks had been operating openly in southern Lebanon.
   Officials of the rival militia Amal, which means Hope, claim
Hezbollah's influence has been eliminated in the south after a
series of clashes. But analysts say Hezbollah guerrillas have not
been neutralized, only driven underground where they are harder to
find.
   The Iranians remain in the south despite the recent destruction
of their office in the port city of Tyre by Amal guerrillas.
   An official with the United Nations observer force who demanded
anonymity said about 30 Iranian Revolutionary Guards are stationed
in the south, providing military planning and intelligence for
village-based Hezbollah militiamen.
   Hezbollah, which Israeli and foreign diplomats estimate can
field 400 to 500 guerrillas, carried out more than half the 75
attacks on Israeli forces in southern Lebanon in April. Three
Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen and six Hezbollah fighters were
killed in April.
   The Iranians, who also have about 800 Revolutionary Guards based
in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley, stay in the background in
the south but are closely involved in the planning and tactics of
fighting, officials say.
   ``They never participate directly, but they do plan and control
the attacks, providing the reconnaisance and drawing up the attack
plans,'' the U.N. official said.
   Uri Lubrani, the Israeli government's coordinator of Lebanon
policy, said Israel knew the Iranians had been ``tactically
involved'' in the clashes in south Lebanon.
   Lubrani, a former Israeli ambassador to Teheran, said in an
interview that Iran was spending up to $100 million annually in
Lebanon, much of it in the south, where more than 70 percent of the
300,000 residents are Shiite Moslems.
   Most of Iran's 44 million people are Shiites, a minority sect
within the Moslem world, where most faithful are Sunni Moslems.
   Lubrani said Iran was investing in schools, mosques and training
centers in a calculated policy of establishing long-term influence.
   ``They want to buy the souls of the new generation,'' Lubrani
said in his Defense Ministry office. ``It is amazing that Iran
would have the gumption to do all these things and fight a war
against Iraq in the (Persian) Gulf.''
   Israel has targeted Hezbollah because the group has fired
rockets into northern Israel and ambushed troops and allied
militiamen in Israel's self-declared ``security zone'' in Lebanon.
The zone is a six-to-10-mile-wide strip north of the Israeli border.
   Israel also accuses Hezbollah of helping Palestinian guerrillas,
who infiltrate from the Bekaa Valley. Two Israeli soldiers were
killed and six wounded in four such raids in April. Ten guerrillas
also died.
   Such attacks made Hezbollah's base at Maidoun the target of a
two-day Israeli incursion last week in which 1,500 Israeli troops
and allied militiamen drove out the gunmen. The battle claimed the
lives of three Israelis and 40 guerrillas. Hezbollah reported four
of its men missing and presumed captured by Israel.
   A foreign diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said
there were unconfirmed reports of Iranian advisers being present in
Maidoun, a village in southeastern Lebanon.
   The United Nations observer said the attack, along with recent
clashes with Amal, had reduced Hezbollah's strength.
   ``Hezbollah's power is much less. The situation is looking a lot
better,'' said the observer, who is based at the headquarters of
the 5,800-member U.N. peacekeeping force in the town of Naqoura on
the Lebanese-Israeli border.
   The diplomat said Iran's influence was apparent in the tactics
of the Hezbollah fighters.
   Orders to carry out attacks are delivered by couriers to small
groups of militiamen in a half-dozen villages, the diplomat said.
The fighters rendezvous at a staging area where weapons are
stockpiled, and are not aware of their targets until just before
the operation begins.
   ``When it's over they go back to their villages, dressed in
civilian clothes, without arms,'' the diplomat said. ``It makes
them a very elusive enemy for anyone trying to find them.''
   Starting in early April, Hezbollah guerrillas also were targeted
by Amal, which has the support of the vast majority of villages in
the south.
   In recent clashes, Amal drove Hezbollah fighters out of villages
where they had established control, Israeli officials and foreign
diplomats say.
   Lebanese journalists in south Lebanon said that in the past few
days 175 Hezbollah supporters had been rounded up, and three
pro-Iranian religious leaders had been expelled from the area.
   Hezbollah, which is directed by Iranian advisers and religious
sheiks, seeks to create an Iranian-inspired Islamic Republic in
Lebanon in which Shiites dominate other religious sects.
   Amal takes a more moderate line, supporting the traditional
multi-community system. Amal's policy also is to limit carefully
attacks against Israeli forces to the buffer zone and not to attack
Israel proper to avoid severe reprisals.

   The bodies of four members of a family
were discovered in their home Tuesday night, and authorities
believed the deaths were the result of murder-suicide.
   Police were called after a relative looked in a front window and
saw two bodies on the floor.
   Police identified the victims as Chester Duchow, 35; his wife,
Doris, 34; and their children, 7-year-old Tom and 9-year-old Frank.
The parents appeared to have died of gunshot wounds and the
children apparently were strangled with pieces of cord, police said.
   Lt. David Haun of the Springfield Police Department said
authorities believed the father, Chester Duchow, killed his wife
and children and then killed himself. A note outlining personal and
family problems was found in the house, Haun said.
   ``It is a reasonable assumption this is a case of triple
homicide and suicide,'' said Dr. Erwin Busiek, medical examiner for
Springfield and Greene County.
   Busiek said the children may have been dead 12 to 24 hours.
Police said they believed the children were killed first and Mrs.
Duchow was killed when she came home from shopping.
   The bodies of the parents were found in the living room of the
northwest Springfield home, Haun said. The children's bodies were
discovered in a loft in an upstairs bedroom. All were found shortly
before 9 p.m., police said.
   Police said a relative stopped by the house and saw the bodies
through a window.
   Donna Wagner, who lives across the street, said the husband had
been unemployed for some time.

<HEAD>Committee Considers Immunity To Get North Diaries In Drug Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will
consider granting Oliver L. North limited immunity to get him to
turn over 2,848 pages of notes he took while a key White House
operative in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said such immunity is among the
options the panel will consider as it seeks to wrap up its probe of
connections between U.S. aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels and Latin
American drug trafficking.
   Other possibilities include subpoenaing North's Washington
lawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., and enlisting the help of
executive branch agencies that should rightfully have the
documents, say Kerry and his aides.
   At a hearing Tuesday, Sullivan appeared on North's behalf and
invoked his client's Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination in refusing to turn over the dozens of
spiral-bound notebooks North compiled while running President
Reagan's covert Contra aid program.
   North, who retired this month as a Marine lieutenant colonel,
did not appear.
   North is one of several targets in a broad conspiracy case that
charges he illegally diverted profits from the sale of arms to Iran
to aid the Contras.
   At the White House, President Reagan responded with an emphatic
``no'' when asked whether he had ruled out granting pardons to
North and to his former national security adviser, John M.
Poindexter.
   Reagan did not elaborate, but his answer came a day after he
told columnist Carl Rowan it would be wrong to grant pardons before
the trial is over, and suggested he would be out of office when
that happens.
   Previously, the president has hinted he is leaning toward a
pardon for North and Poindexter, saying he did not think they were
guilty of any crime and that he doubted any jury would convict them.
   Portions of North's notebooks previously given to congressional
investigators are sprinkled throughout with references to drugs,
drug traffickers, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA.
But large segments _ committee aides said about half the contents _
have been blacked out by Sullivan or by White House censors.
   ``It's the first time I ever heard of in history that an
attorney who is not code-cleared, classified-cleared or even any
security clearance whatsoever, sits as the custodian of documents
that have been walked out of the workplace of the most highly
sensitive government agency that we have,'' said Kerry, chairman of
the panel's narcotics subcommittee.
   ``It's unheard of, and I think it's inappropriate,'' he said.
   Kerry said Sullivan, in a closed-door meeting of the committee,
presented an affidavit from North acknowledging the subpoena for
his notebooks but citing his constitutional right not to
incriminate himself as justification for withholding them.
   Kerry said the committee will meet again soon to decide what to
do next.
   It took 10 days for U.S. Capitol police to deliver the subpoena
to North, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. Police who were
outmanuevered by North at his Virginia home and elsewhere, finally
threw the papers into his car last Saturday while the former Marine
was stopped at a traffic light near his house, the Post said,
citing unnamed Capitol Hill sources.
   Kerry said he does not know what the notes might reveal of
importance to his investigation, but believes his subcommittee must
have the documents in order to be sure it has done a thorough job.
He promised that if turned over, the documents would be kept secret.
   ``Why does the name of someone involved in narcotics appear in
Ollie North's notebook?'' he asked. ``These are unanswered
questions that still tell me there is a lot that has not yet come
to light.''
   North, a former National Security Council staff member, directed
much of the operation that sent arms to Iran and raised money to
supply the Contras at a time when Congress barred such aid.
   He and Sullivan also have declined to provide the notebooks to
Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent counsel who is prosecuting North
and others on charges stemming from the Iran affair.
   Kerry said he has spoken to members of Walsh's staff about the
matter, and ``it's clear they don't know as much as we do'' about
the case.

<TEXT>
   The astrologer who advises first lady Nancy
Reagan said Tuesday that Southern Californians anxious about a
four-centuries-old prophecy of a huge earthquake this month should
stop worrying.
   Joan Quigley said the French seer Nostradamus had incomplete
data when he made his prediction in the 1500s.
   ``Centuries ago, the positions of Uranus and Neptune and Pluto
and all those planets weren't known,'' she said. ``He (Nostradamus)
knew about Saturn being where Saturn was. But he didn't know that
Uranus was right there with it.''
   She said she had predicted a big quake May 5 and had returned
home Saturday from a month in Europe after it did not materialize
and said she was confident any danger was past.
   Southern Californians have swamped earthquake information
hotlines, left the region or taken other earthquake precautions in
reaction to a vague prediction by Nostradamus and a 1981 movie
``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' now sold on videotape.
   The film, narrated by ``War of the Worlds'' prankster Orson
Welles, claimed Nostradamus said the area would be wrecked by a
huge quake this month. Some astrologers have said a big quake is
most likely this week.
   A slight quake did materialize in northern California near
Salinas early Tuesday, but there were no reports of damage.
   The earthquake hit at 5:32 a.m. with an estimated magnitude of
3.0 on the Richter scale, according to Willis Jacobs, a
geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center in Golden, Colo. He
said the epicenter was between Salinas and Watsonville. Any quake
under 3.5 on the scale is considered slight.
   Mrs. Reagan's interest in astrology was disclosed in a book by
former White House chief of staff Donald Regan, who said the first
lady used astrological predictions to influence the president's
schedule.

   House and Senate conferees are getting down to
the final rounds in their effort to resolve differences over a
measure to protect the 31 million Medicare recipients against
financial devastation from serious illness.
   After months of behind-the-scenes negotiations, the full
conference met for the first time publicly on Tuesday to discuss
the first major expansion of the program in its 23-year history.
   The House and Senate both passed legislation on catastrophic
health insurance by overwhelming margins last year. Although more
encompassing and expensive, the legislation is built on a basic
framework devised by Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R.
Bowen and embraced by President Reagan.
   While no formal timetable was set, the conference committee is
expected to shape a final bill for presentation to the two houses
later this month with an eye toward having the legislation ready
for President Reagan's signature next month.
   On Tuesday, both sides agreed on only two points: that major
disagreements still separate them and that the time has come to
resolve them.
   Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, head of the Senate Finance
subcommittee that did preliminary work on the Senate bill,
cautioned against adopting a final version too expensive for the
elderly to bear. He expressed particular concern about including
the more expansive House version of a new prescription drug benefit.
   ``We can always expand these programs, but it is very hard to
contract them,'' said Mitchell.
   But Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., suggested a prescription drug
program probably would be to the only additional benefit realized
by millions of Americans who will not face a lengthy hospital stay.
``They've got to see something out of this legislation,'' he said.
   The differences concern the level of additional protection the
legislation will provide and how the costs are to be spread among
the 31 million Medicare recipients who will have to pay for the
Although the measures are substantially more expansive, and
expensive, than proposed by the administration,
   The legislation does not provide long-term nursing home care
under Medicare _ a complicated and even more expensive issue put
off until next year _ but would shield Medicare beneficiaries
against annual out-of-pocket doctor and hospital bills.
   The cap would be $1,043 in the latest House suggested compromise
and $1,370 in the Senate compromise offer now on the bargaining
table.
   Medicare now covers only the first 60 days of a hospital stay in
a given year and pays only 80 percent of doctor bills, no matter
how high they range.
   The major disagreement on the benefit side is over prescription
drugs _ how much to pay and how soon to start paying.
   On the cost side, the major disagreement is how to distribute
the additional premium Medicare enrollees will have to pay _
particularly the so-called supplemental premium that is tantamount
to an income tax increase for the estimated 50 percent of retirees
who would be subject to it.
   The only other additional cost for the estimated 50 percent of
the elderly not now subject to income tax would be a flat monthly
premium of about $8 to $10 per month, depending on the shape of the
final legislation.

<HEAD>Dukakis Supported Across Ideological Spectrum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis found broad
ideological backing along with support from one-time Reagan
Democrats in the West Virginia and Nebraska primaries, both of
which could provide important boosts in a general election campaign.
   Ideologically, ``Dukakis is a Rorschach test,'' said ABC News
poll analyst Doug Muzzio. ``Voters of different ideologies look at
Dukakis and are seeing what they want to see. In a sense he's all
ideologies to all voters.''
   ABC's exit polls of voters Tuesday found that a majority of
liberals, a majority of moderates and a plurality of conservatives
said Dukakis' views were ``just right'' as opposed to too liberal
or too conservative.
   ``Certainly he has not been painted among these two electorates
as a liberal,'' a likely Republican tactic, Muzzio said. Instead,
Dukakis seemed acceptable to voters across the spectrum of
ideologies in his party.
   One reason for pause in the Dukakis camp, Muzzio suggested, was
that about 30 percent of the voters said they were not sure of
Dukakis' ideology. But while that could suggest a lack of
self-definition, it also could be turned into an advantage in a
general election campaign, he said.
   Another good sign for November was Dukakis' support from
Democrats who voted for President Reagan in 1984. Twenty-three
percent of the Democratic voters in West Virginia and 22 percent in
Nebraska were Reagan Democrats; 73 percent of them in West Virginia
and 78 percent in Nebraska said they would vote for Dukakis over
George Bush, ABC found.
   ``Dukakis could bring home the Reagan Democrats,'' said Muzzio.
The finding has been consistent, he noted, since ABC started asking
the question in its Connecticut primary exit poll March 29.
   ABC's poll said Jackson in Nebraska on Tuesday scored one of his
best showings of the primary season with white voters, winning 24
percent. He has done better only in Vermont, where he ABC had him
winning 32 percent.
   Jackson, who appealed to distressed farmers in Nebraska for
their votes, won majorities there in two issue groups _ voters who
cited the poor and elderly as a key issue, and those who cited the
ability to bring changes.
   Still, Dukakis won all white subgroups in Nebraska and won
overwhelming majorities of voters of all groups other than blacks
in West Virginia. The key issue to the most voters in both states
was job protection, and Dukakis won a majority of that group.
   Dukakis made some inroads into the small bloc of black votes,
winning 32 percent of the black vote in West Virginia and 11
percent in Nebraska. Blacks made up 4 percent of the total in West
Virginia and 5 percent in Nebraska, and the margin of sampling
error is high for such a small group in a poll.
   Among all voters, the error margin was 5 percentage points in
the surveys.

<HEAD>Dukakis Hopes To Clinch Nomination In Next Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, with two
more primary wins, says he hopes to clinch the Democratic
presidential nomination in the final month of the primary season.
   ``I hope by the 8th of June we are at or closing in on the
nomination,'' Dukakis said. The last round of Democratic primaries
is June 7, and includes the big states of California and New Jersey.
   ``I'm working hard, vigorously and I hope successfully, to see
if we can wrap it up,'' the governor told reporters here Tuesday
night.
   Dukakis was spending most of today at the Statehouse in Boston
before heading to New Jersey for a fundraiser.
   Despite his successes in West Virginia and Nebraska, where he
scored landslide wins over Jesse Jackson, Dukakis was not writing
off his remaining Democratic rival.
   ``We're taking none of these primaries for granted,'' he said of
upcoming races. ``They're all very, very important.''
   With primaries set next Tuesday in Oregon and a week later in
Idaho, followed up by the primaries of June 7, ``It's going to be a
very lively month,'' Dukakis said.
   Montana and New Mexico also hold their primaries on the final
day of the Democratic season.
   Dukakis, looking toward the fall, predicted he could be the
``unifier'' who would enable Democrats to put one of their own in
the White House.
   ``I sense a greater desire on the part of rank and file
Democrats and party leaders across the country to unify and come
together,'' he said at a news conference at Marymount Manhattan
College.
   ``I think we sense that victory is out there to be won and we've
got one of the best chances we've had in years to win a
presidential victory. And I'm somebody who is a unifier.''
   Dukakis says his recent string of victories ``reflects a desire
on the part of the people of this country for ... very strong
economic leadership, leadership that's committed to uniting this
country and to building a very strong future of full employment and
real opportunity for all of our citizens.''
   ``That's what I stand for and I think that's why we're doing so
well,'' he said.
   Dukakis also took a dig at President Reagan even as he expressed
a bit of sympathy over the flap created by the book written by
former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan.
   ``Like most people who've been in public life for a long time, I
abhor kiss-and-tell staff people,'' Dukakis said.
   Asked whether he believed the public had a right to know about
Nancy Reagan's reported reliance on astrology, the governor
answered: ``I can only speak for my own first lady ... she
appreciates the stars, but she doesn't consult them.''

   A Boy Scout who crafted a California condor
puppet to feed the dying species' first captive-bred chick says he
won't mind if the project doesn't help him earn scouting's highest
rank, Eagle Scout.
   Jason Schmuckle, 17, of Vista, worked about 20 hours to make the
2-foot-long puppet, which has a fiberglass beak and skull covered
by deerskin and painted to match the condor's distinctive red and
black markings.
   Condor keepers at the San Diego Wild Animal Park are using
Schmuckle's puppet to feed Molloko, the 2-week-old chick that was
the product of the first captive mating in the history of the
critically endangered species.
   Schmuckle, a nature enthusiast who has ambitions of becoming a
wood craftsman, said he began his puppet making in December when he
was looking for a project to earn the Eagle Scout rank.
   ``I was going to do it whether they accept it as my Eagle Scout
project or not. I like the condor,'' he said. ``I really enjoyed
doing it. It makes me happy I could help the condor baby survive.''
   The latest addition to the captive condor flock at the park was
introduced last week to the hand puppet, which also is used to
preen the chick as its parents would in the wild.
   The chick has increased its weight to just over 12{ ounces, up
from the April 29 birth weight of 6} ounces. A tiny bandage
successfully corrected a leg development problem and has been
removed, officials said Tuesday.
   Condor keepers say the puppet is crucial to the success of a
breeding program to return the species to the wild. Only 28 birds
are known to exist, all in captivity _ 15 at the Wild Animal Park
and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The chick will be fed with the hand puppet until it is about 5
months old, when it will be released into the company of other
juvenile birds, said condor keeper Don Sterner.
   ``It's very important,'' Sterner said of the puppet. ``The whole
idea is we don't want the birds to relate human beings to food.
That would bring an identity crisis. ... The condor will think it's
a human or think humans are condors.
   ``Because of the breeding program, it is important that he, she,
or it be able to socialize with other birds and not with humans.
More importantly, when the birds are released out in the wild we
don't want them to be used to humans and fly in and be shot by
hunters.''
   Hand puppets were used in raising 13 condor chicks hatched from
eggs taken from nests in the wild, he said.
   In the previous puppets, the skulls and beaks were made of
fiberglass molded from castings of a real condor skull and beak at
the Natural History Museum in San Diego.
   Deerskin was cut, glued and painted to simulate featherless skin
on the neck and head. Bands of black and white fake fur stand in
for feathers at the bottom of the bird's neck. Eyes donated by a
taxidermy shop were set in the skull.
   Sterner said Schmuckle improved on the former design, using a
tougher deer hide and devising a better jaw hinge for the lower
beak that made the puppet easier to manipulate.
   Sterner also praised the detailed painting of the deer skin to
resemble a true condor's coloring. ``It's the closest thing to the
real thing. It should do the job,'' Sterner said.
   Schmuckle completed a second puppet this week and is working on
a third.
   To earn the Eagle Scout rank, he must log more than 150 hours on
the project, supervise someone else during its execution and use
only donated materials. The project also must benefit a non-profit
organization.
   He has yet to submit documents of his project _ which officially
benefits the non-profit California captive-condor breeding program
_ to a local Eagle Scout board for consideration.

<HEAD>Worker Says Dismissal Violates Government's Own Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A former Justice Department employee with AIDS
says he was fired despite a new federal policy touted as
``enlightened and compassionate'' that prohibits discrimination
against government workers with the disease, according to a
published report.
   The Washington Post reported today that Mark Gregory was fired
from the department's Community Relations Service on April 25,
several weeks after the Office of Personnel Management announced
employees with acquired immune deficiency syndrome would be treated
the same as those with other serious illnesses.
   ``The only reason they fired me is because I'm sick and because
I have AIDS,'' said Gregory, 30, who is undergoing experimental
treatment at the National Institutes of Health.
   Gregory, who lost his health insurance when he was fired, is
appealing the dismissal.
   Federal guidelines on workers with AIDS were issued in March,
when OPM Director Constance Horner said, ``The federal government,
as an enlightened and compassionate employer concerned with the
health and welfare of its employees, has an obligation to show the
way in addressing the realities of the AIDS epidemic.''
   The Justice Department says Gregory was fired not because of his
illness but because of the 30 days work he has missed since he was
hired as a clerk-typist last July. Gregory says most of the missed
days were spent participating in the experimental NIH program.
   ``He's not being singled out,'' said department spokesman Brad
Marman. ``He was discharged because he could not perform the job on
a full-time basis adequately.''
   Marman told the Post that Gregory was considered a probationary
employee when he was hired, although both he and Gregory's
supervisor would not talk in detail about his case.
   Diagnosed as having AIDS-related complex in October 1987,
Gregory said he took 10 days leave without pay on the advice of his
supervisor and another 14 days to participate in the NIH program.
He took another six days off after his lover died.

   Jesse Jackson brushed aside two more
primary losses to Democratic presidential rival Michael Dukakis and
looked ahead to the races remaining in the final month of the
primary season.
   Jackson was campaigning today in Oregon, which holds its primary
next Tuesday.
   ``Oregon is very important to us,'' Jackson said as he arrived
in the state. ``One must come to Oregon on the way to June 7.''
   June 7 is the day that California and New Jersey, along with
Montana and New Mexico, hold their primaries. Jackson offered
Dukakis congratulations for his wins on Tuesday in Nebraska and
West Virginia, but vowed to fight on for the nomination.
   ``We will take it all the way to the end,'' Jackson said. ``The
race is on, and the race is live.''
   Jackson told a news conference that Dukakis may have the lead in
the race for the nomination but ``I represent the people.''
   Jackson planned to spend three days in Oregon, far more than
front-runner Dukakis. The two will be fighting for a share of the
45 Democratic national convention delegates at stake in Oregon.
   ``We know the people of Oregon are an independent-thinking
people. We expect a tremendous response from the people of
Oregon,'' Jackson said. ``For too long, the great Northwest has
been ignored and abandoned in national politics.''
   At an airport news conference, Jackson called for freezing
military spending for five years and using the money for social
programs.
   He also said immediate steps need to be taken to attack the
country's serious drug problem.
   ``The No. 1 threat to our existence is the flow of cocaine and
crack and heroin,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson also campaigned Tuesday in Montana, visiting the
Flathead Indian Reservation.
   ``It is still a close race _ much closer than it is being
portrayed,'' Jackson told a cheering crowd.
   He was accompanied to the reservation by actress Margot Kidder,
who campaigned with him a day earlier in Nebraska.
   In Oregon, a statewide poll of Democrats, taken in mid-April,
suggested Dukakis was favored over Jackson, 48 percent to 28
percent.

<HEAD>Breeding With Overseas Livestock Could Lower U.S. Meat Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELTSVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exotic livestock breeds including Soviet
sheep that reproduce much more quickly than American breeds could
lower U.S. meat prices if they were available here, an Agriculture
Department official says.
   The American public should therefore demand that the government
establish a program to gather and evaluate different breeds of
livestock from abroad, said the official, Keith Gregory of the U.S.
Meat Animal Research Service, part of the department's Agricultural
Research Service.
   ``It is in the public interest to have such a program,'' Gregory
said Tuesday.
   The Agriculture Department is spending $26 million this year in
an ongoing effort to gather, store and evaluate cultivated and wild
plants so that breeders will have a kind of library of genetic
traits to choose from in developing improved food crops, Gregory
said.
   Such a program has never been developed to provide what can be
thought of as ``gene banks'' for livestock breeders, Gregory said.
   The federal government should step in because commercial
breeders have neither the capital nor the expertise to collect and
evaluate exotic livestock species, Gregory said. He spoke at a
press conference held in conjunction with the Agricultural Research
Service's annual scientific symposium in Beltsville.
   The department's efforts to conserve plant ``germplasm'' _
genetic material that can be used to regenerate plants _ has been
criticized as inadequate.
   Department scientists agree that the plant germplasm collection
and storage system should be expanded, but they say it is difficult
to convince other government officials and the public of the need
for additional funds.
   The Office of Management and Budget recently acted to hold next
year's budget equal to the current $26 million, said Henry Shands,
coordinator of the National Plant Germplasm System. Officials had
hoped for an increase.
   ``USDA has not developed the clientele to insure that these
programs get the support they require,'' said Lawrence Busch, a
sociologist at the University of Kentucky who specializes in
agricultural issues.
   Of the various animals raised for meat in the United States, the
turkey is the only one native to this country, and it was bred in
Europe before becoming established here, Gregory said.
   He noted, for example, that Romanov sheep from the Soviet Union
and Finn sheep from Finland reproduce much more quickly than
traditional U.S. breeds.
   ``Those are two sources of genes that might enable us to
increase the breeding rate,'' Gregory said. A higher breeding rate
means lower production costs, and ultimately lower costs for the
consumer.
   The two breeds have their drawbacks _ they produce less wool and
it is of lower quality, he said. Nevertheless, their genes could be
useful in the development of improved breeds, he said.
   Bringing such animals into the country involves expensive
quarantining procedures that can last years, Gregory said.
   In the case of sheep, for example, the animals must be kept in
complete isolation for five years to be certain they don't carry
the scrapie virus, a potentially devastating disease. Only then can
breeding experiments begin.
   Recent advances in biotechnology now allow sperm and embryos to
be frozen, providing new means of storing genetic resources.
   Research also suggests that it might be possible to wash frozen
embryos so that they are free of viruses, thus eliminating costly
quarantines, Gregory said.

<HEAD>Government Accused of Withholding Critical Report on Alaskan Oil
Drilling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Interior Department report says there has
been environmental damage from oil drilling in Alaska but
apparently nothing to scuttle an administration request to open the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to petroleum development, a
congressional aide says.
   The report has been withheld from Congress, however, and the
copies of the report have been made available only through
unofficial channels, say aides to Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.
   Miller is chairman of the House Interior water and power
resources subcommittee considering the administration request to
allow oil rigs in the nation's largest wildlife refuge.
   In April 1987, Miller had requested a report from the Fish and
Wildlife Service on the environmental impact of drilling in
Alaska's North Slope.
   Miller's aides said Tuesday the report prepared by the service's
Fairbanks office was completed and sent to the Interior Department
last December but never sent to Miller.
   Philip Million, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service,
said Tuesday night he had not seen the report, but said he had been
told ``that it was a regional report prepared in Alaska and there
were disagreements within the regional office on the conclusions
reached in that report.''
   Million said the report either has been or is being modified,
but that he didn't know what conclusions the final version will
draw.
   The report deals with existing drilling activities at Prudhoe
Bay, about 70 miles west of the refuge, and the Trans-Alaska
pipeline.
   The information from the report did not represent any ``smoking
gun'' that could, by itself, torpedo the administration's request
for permission to drill in the refuge, the aide said.
   ``What makes this such a big deal is they sat on it,'' said the
aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Another aide commented: ``The real issue is whether Congress is
being told the whole story. They're not.''
   The new report by the Fairbanks office supports some testimony
given to Congress that populations of predators like bears and
wolves have diminished since Prudhoe opened. The decline has been
blamed on the arrival of an industrial complex and illegal hunting.
   But the document also said the caribou herd in the area has
grown during development of Prudhoe and that no major oil spills
had occurred.
   The report said air pollution has been a problem at Prudhoe, but
said that dust has been more of a problem than chemical pollutants,
the Miller aides said.
   They added that the report cited pollution of fresh water
because of drilling operations and alterations in natural fresh
water flows because of construction.
   In testimony before congressional committees considering the
future of the refuge, Interior Department witnesses have
acknowledged problems at Prudhoe with environmental protection and
enforcement but they said Prudhoe has improved in recent years and
those lessons would be applied to any drilling in the refuge.
   Miller's aides related that another section of the report said
22,500 birds were lost or displaced from Prudhoe.
   The aides noted, however, that the report did not tell another
side of the Prudhoe story: It has produced 5 billion barrels of oil
and brought about $100 billion worth of economic benefits to the
nation.
   Miller's subcommittee has tentatively scheduled another round of
hearings on the refuge question for early next month. Bills to open
the refuge have been approved by the House Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee.
   The Reagan administration and the oil industry have been pushing
Congress since the start of 1987 to allow development on the
refuge, which they say may hold oil deposits to rival Prudhoe Bay's
and which could help alleviate the nation's growing dependence on
imported oil.

<HEAD>Major Initiatives Unlikely At June Economic Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson, the
Oct. 19 stock market crash was a bracing ``tap on the shoulder''
but there is no cause for alarm about the world economy.
   The Economic Summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized
countries, to be held in Toronto on June 19-21, is therefore likely
to reaffirm current policies rather than adopt sweeping new
initiatives, Wilson told a group of foreign correspondents Tuesday.
   ``I wouldn't look for major new statements, major new
decisions,'' he said.
   But in another pre-summit briefing, the government-funded
Economic Council of Canada took a much gloomier view of economic
realities.
   The council's deputy chairman, Harvey Lazar, said failure to
correct the ``fundamental disequilibrium in the world economy'' _
evidenced by continued huge U.S. deficits _ points toward another
economic shock. He feared a ``hard landing'' in which interest
rates will soar along with unemployment.
   ``We've gotten off relatively easy so far,'' Lazar said of the
surprising resilience of major economies following the market
crash. ``The question is whether between now and the election of a
new U.S. government, the world can somehow muddle through. There
remains a serious risk we may not.''
   He said the United States must either raise taxes or slash
spending to attack its deficits, but either course is unlikely in
the final months of Ronald Reagan's presidency.
   With that major problem untackled, Lazar said, the summit's
``scope is pretty limited.''
   Wilson maintained that since the October crash, the Group of
Seven countries _ the United States, Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada _ have patched up differences and
cooperated to stabilize markets.
   He also pointed to a clear shift in the U.S. economy from
consumption to exports, while Japan and West Germany have moved to
increase imports to shave their trade surpluses.
   ``Inflationary pressures on a worldwide basis aren't there,'' he
said, adding that the recent ``upward creep'' of interest rates
should not derail Group of Seven policies.
   But senior forecaster Ross Preston of the independently-run
Economic Council said: ``We're still lacking a true consensus about
how to manage international economic policy.''
   He said that since the mid-1970's, ``people have been resistant
to face up to the fact that real growth has declined.''
   With ``macroeconomic'' fiscal and monetary policies fixed,
Canadian officials said the summit will likely focus on
``microeconomic'' structural factors such as tax reform,
deregulation and privatization.
   Reform of land prices and the goods distribution system in
Japan, the extension of shopping hours in West Germany and tax
incentives to boost the level of bank savings in the United States
are examples of ``micro'' initiatives that could have a major
impact, Sylvia Ostry, Canada's ambassador for multilateral trade
negotiations, told reporters.
   She said summit leaders may discuss a proposal for the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which governs world trade, to
monitor microeconomic factors in the same way the International
Monetary Fund surveys macroeconomic policies.
   Wilson said he saw no need for changes in Canada's interest rate
or other economic policies, despite the latest figures showing
domestic growth stalled in January and February, after 3.9 percent
real growth in the gross domestic product last year.
   ``We're still nicely on track and I see no reason to change,''
he said.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega met with
his American lawyers to discuss fighting U.S. drug trafficking
indictments against him. One said the general was encouraged at how
the case is going.
   Two Florida attorneys met on Tuesday with the general, who has
survived U.S. economic and other pressures aimed at forcing him to
resign as head of the nation's 15,000-strong Defense Forces and
leave Panama.
   The lawyers are Raymond Takiff and Frank Rubino, who were
contracted by Noriega after he was indicted in Florida in February.
   After the meeting, Rubino described Noriega, the power behind
the civilian government, as ``very encouraged'' by developments in
the case and ``very confident'' about having weathered U.S.
pressure to oust him.
   According to Noriega, the Reagan administration wants him out
because of his opposition to what he calls efforts in the United
States to retain control of the Panama Canal. Under the 1977 canal
treaties, the United States must relinquish control of the canal by
midnight Dec. 31, 1999.
   Noriega won his first legal battle last month when U.S. District
Judge William Hooveler ruled he did not have to appear in court in
Florida for hearings on his challenge of the indictments.
   The U.S. government has imposed economic sanctions on Panama and
encouraged domestic dissent in an effort to force the ouster of
Noriega.
   Washington still recognizes the presidency of Eric Arturo
Delvalle, who has been in hiding since his ouster Feb. 26, a day
after he tried to fire the general, who has led the Defense Forces
since 1983.

<HEAD>Indian Leaders Begin Talks With Sandinistas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan Indian rebel leaders, their
support from the United States shrinking, resumed peace talks with
Sandinista government officials aimed at restoring some of their
native rights.
   ``We have sought dialogue with the Sandinista government because
our people are in a very difficult situation and because aid
approved by the American Congress has diminished,'' said Brooklyn
Rivera, a leader of the Yatama organization of Nicaragua's
Caribbean coast Indians.
   ``In Honduras, the government has closed our rearguard and has
adopted a hostile attitude against our organization while the
Americans say we are acting against our own interests and have cut
aid,'' Rivera told The Associated Press on Tuesday, when talks
resumed.
   Rivera began negotiating in February with Interior Minister
Tomas Borge, who heads a national commission on autonomy for the
Caribbean coast. They failed to reach concrete agreements in a
meeting in March ``but we delved deeper into the proposals'' made
by both sides, Rivera said.
   Yatama, which claims to have 2,000 guerrillas, has fought the
Sandinistas for regional autonomy along the coast. The Indians also
resisted any exercise of authority over them by the rightist,
pro-American Somoza dynasty which ruled Nicaragua for 42 years
until the Sandinistas came to power in 1979.
   The Indian organization does not belong to the Nicaraguan
Resistance, the umbrella group of the Contras, as the largest rebel
group is known. The resistance is engaged in separate peace talks
with the leftist government.
   Wicliffe Diego, one of five Yatama directors, was suspended for
forming an alliance with the resistance, said Stedman Fagoth
Muller, another Yamata leader.
   Yatama arose from the disintegration of Misurasata, an
organization of Miskito, Sumo and Rama Indians. Factionalism has
marked the Indian struggle against the Sandinistas since fighting
began in 1981, when the government tried to impose authority on the
isolated, traditionally independent coastal region.
   Rivera noted that the Sandinistas formerly viewed autonomy talks
as ``counterrevolutionary,'' but said their attitude had changed.
Still, the two sides differ over the definition of Indian self-rule.
   ``What the Sandinistas propose is decentralization of power, but
through its representatives in the region,'' Rivera said.
   ``We want to elect our own authorities and organize the Indian
nation according to our customs and tradition,'' he added. ``We
want our community borders to be as our grandfathers made them and
not in a mechanical form.''
   Yatama presented Borge with an autonomy proposal on Monday
``that is basic to talks for a permanent cease-fire,'' Rivera said.
   The talks are due to end Thursday.
   Rivera said a truce signed a week ago by a few Yatama leaders
was not significant and was not authorized.

<HEAD>Caller: Contra Dissidents Demand Resignation Of Rebel Commanders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDDY CUEVAS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A telephone caller said 200
dissident Nicaraguan rebels have declared they will no longer take
orders from the insurgents' military commander, Enrique Bermudez.
   The call to The Associated Press on Tuesday reflected divisions
among the U.S.-backed insurgents during stalemated negotiations
between the rebels, known as Contras, and the leftist Sandinista
government.
   It could not be determined if the caller, who did not identify
himself, represented a substantial number of guerrillas opposed to
Bermudez.
   He said the dissidents also demanded the removal of eight other
military leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the main
8,000-strong rebel force that fought the Nicaraguan government
before a recent truce.
   Before he left Miami for Honduras on Tuesday, Bermudez
acknowledged to reporters that there had been a rebellion and
hinted forceful action might be needed to end the mutiny, The Miami
Herald reported in today's editions.
   A Contra official in San Jose, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told the AP on Tuesday it was believed Bermudez would
come to meet with the dissidents.
   The caller did not say where the dissidents were located, but
The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that up to 3,000 dissident
rebels have been holed up at a Honduran base camp since Saturday.
It said the camp is in Yamales, a tiny Honduran village three miles
from the Nicaraguan border.
   There has been constant friction among Contras who served in the
national guard of the late right-wing President Anastasio Somoza
and groups who had fought to overthrow Somoza.
   The Sandinistas gained power after defeating Somoza's national
guard in a civil war that ended in July 1979. Many Somoza
supporters fled into neighboring Honduras, where they established
military camps, and were later joined by Nicaraguans who said the
Sandinistas had betrayed the revolution.
   Members of both groups formed the Nicaragua Resistance about
eight years ago and began guerrilla operations inside Nicaragua.
   The telephone caller said the dissidents were demanding the
resignations of Bermudez and eight other rebel military commanders
because: ``We disavow them as corrupt ... and assure the Nicaraguan
people that we, the workers, campesinos and students who form the
army of the resistance will not allow corrupt and dishonest people
in our ranks who want to return to the past.''
   The caller said the dissidents recognized the authority of rebel
military leaders Diogenes Hernandez Membreno, Walter Calderon
Lopez, Encarnacion Valdivia and Tirzo Roman Moreno.
   Calderon Lopez, Valdivia and Roman Moreno were among seven
Contra leaders expelled from Honduras on Friday after demanding
that Bermudez resign.
   Bosco Matamoros, a Nicaraguan Resistance spokesman in Honduras,
declined comment on the telephone call.
   Earlier, he denied the Post report that up to 3,000 Contras
taking orders from Hernandez Membreno had been holed up in a
Honduran base camp since Saturday and were refusing to take orders
from the resistance leadership.
   Matamoros said on Monday that Contra political and military
representatives met on Sunday at a camp ner the Honduran-Nicaraguan
border to try to resolve the disputes among the Contras.
   Bermudez reportedly opposes the 60-day cease-fire agreement
signed March 23 by Contra and government representatives.
   The pact calls for additional negotiations to make the truce
permanent. The last peace talks ended April 30 in Managua and no
date or location has been set for another round.

<HEAD>Iowa Democratic Chairwoman To Endorse Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iowa Democratic Chairwoman Bonnie
Campbell, abandoning months of neutrality in the party's
presidential nomination race, planned to endorse Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis today, an associate said.
   The move is a signal that the party's establishment considers
Dukakis an almost certain bet to win the nomination and is closing
ranks behind him.
   The endorsement comes on the eve of the party's congressional
district conventions Saturday at which 34 delegates will be picked
to attend the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   It gives a boost to the Dukakis forces who have been quietly
trying to build support in the state since their candidate finished
third in the Feb. 8 precinct caucuses.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who won the caucuses, has
dropped from the race and second-place finisher Sen. Paul Simon of
Illinois has suspended his campaign.
   Ms. Campbell scheduled a Statehouse news conference to make the
announcement. She will be joined by at least two other party
officials who are also to endorse Dukakis.
   Ms. Campbell's associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said her endorsement is aimed at unifying the state party behind
Dukakis.

<HEAD>Dukakis Accepts Secret Service Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis is using
Secret Service protection beginning today, after relying for more
than a year on local police on the presidential campaign trail.
   Campaign aides said the timing was the result of several
considerations, including Dukakis' increasing prominence near the
end of what has become a two-man Democratic race with Jesse Jackson.
   The Massachusetts governor said there have been no incidents or
threats that prompted the change. However, he said, ``there comes a
point in all of this when Secret Service protection is necessary,
and in my judgment I've arrived at that point.''
   In addition, aides said there was some concern inside the
campaign about the potential for violence in California,
particularly in light of recent publicity marking 20 years since
the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy after his victory in the
1968 California Democratic primary.
   The protection, provided round the clock at taxpayer expense, is
to begin today as Dukakis leaves for a campaign trip through New
Jersey and Washington, D.C., en route to California.

   Rep. Douglas Applegate invited other Democrats
from Ohio's congressional delegation to a meeting today to push for
support for Sen. John Glenn as a vice presidential candidate.
   Jim Hart, Applegate's administrative assistant, said the meeting
would take place would take place in Washington.
   ``At this point, it's time we probably turn our heads as to who
will be the vice presidential nominee. Mr. (Michael) Dukakis
appears to have the nomination in the back pocket now. One of Mr.
Applegate's main themes has been that we need someone in White
House who will be a friend to us, to look out for our benefit. He's
always been a big supporter of John Glenn,'' said Hart.
   Asked if Applegate has told Glenn about the meeting, Hart said,
``Not to my knowledge.''
   Glenn, who failed in a bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1984, has not discouraged speculation about the No. 2
spot on the ticket.
   Dukakis has refused to be talk about who he might choose as his
running mate if nominated for president.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA is confident that the first
post-Challenger space shuttle flight will go off as scheduled now
that a test-firing of a full-size booster rocket has been
successfully completed.
   Royce Mitchell, project manager of the booster program at the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said on Tuesday
the April 20 test showed nothing that would stand in the way of the
flight scheduled for August.
   The redesigned rockets must pass two more full-duration firings,
one in June and one in July, before they receive final
certification. The boosters, built by Morton Thiokol Inc., are
tested at that company's plant in Utah.
   A faulty Morton Thiokol booster rocket was blamed for the
January 1986 disaster in which the Challenger was destroyed and its
crew of seven killed.
   Mitchell spoke at a news conference from Huntsville that was
carried by television to National Aeronautics and Space

   A union official says an appeals court ruling
that local officials must inspect school buildings for
cancer-causing asbestos is ``a tremendous victory for the health of
children and school employees.''
   Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Council of
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said the
government regulations upheld by a federal court here Tuesday
should be applied in all public and commercial buildings.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed a challenge to the
Environmental Protection Agency regulations by a trade group that
complained the rules failed to set a safe level of exposure to
airborne particles of asbestos.
   ``This argument is meritless,'' a three-judge panel said.
``Congress explicitly recognized that experts presently disagree
over what levels of exposure are safe.''
   EPA's regulations require schools to conduct visual inspections
of asbestos-containing building materials to determine if they are
damaged. Undamaged asbestos is not believed to pose a health risk.

<HEAD>Koch: Drug Conference `A Farce,' War on Drugs `A Joke'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Mayor Edward I. Koch says the head of
the White House Conference for a Drug-Free America is under orders
not to embarrass the Reagan administration, and as a result, the
panel is ``a farce.''
   Conference Chairwoman Lois Haight Herrington is ``doing her job,
she's under orders and she's carrying them out very effectively,''
Koch said Tuesday outside a meeting of the conferees.
   Asked if he believed those orders were coming from the White
House, Koch said: ``or whoever is in charge of making sure that
this commission doesn't rock the boat, that this commission doesn't
fix responsibility and that this commission doesn't make requests
of the Reagan administration that they don't want to engage in.''
   And the mayor complained to fellow conferees that they had not
been given a draft report.
   ``If we are now dealing with the single most important issue in
America _ everybody says that _ and here we are in this small,
little, uncomfortable room, not having had the material presented
to us _ it's a farce,'' Koch said.
   After pointing out the failure of the current efforts to stem
the flow of drugs, Koch exclaimed, ``This is not a war on drugs _
this is a joke.''
   Herrington responded to Koch's criticism by saying, ``If I was
mayor of the biggest city with the biggest drug problem in the
world, I'd be frustrated, too.''

<HEAD>Europeans Report Transplanting Parts Of Same Liver Into Different
Humans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's first two reported successful
attempts to transplant parts of the same liver into different
patients are big steps toward overcoming the chronic donor organ
shortage, say transplant surgeons.
   Dr. Henri Bismuth, a liver transplant surgeon at Paul Brousse
Hospital in Paris, reported here Tuesday that he had no choice but
to divide the liver of a 40-year-old brain-dead man for two women,
both unconscious and near death.
   The procedure, performed May 1, is believed to be the second in
the world, according to Dr. Christoph E. Broelsch, professor of
surgery at the University of Chicago. The previous one was
performed in February in West Germany.
   ``This is one way to increase the donors. If you have patients
who are terribly ill and in equal need, it's one way out,'' said
the University of Pittsburgh's Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who performed
the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967.
   ``I can see this happening at our institution anytime soon if we
have the appropriate setting,'' Broelsch said in a telephone
interview.
   About 450 people are awaiting liver transplants in the United
States, according to Arthur Harrell of the American Council on
Transplantation. About half are children.
   In this month's transplant, the donor had been rushed to France
from Switzerland and was a suitable match for either the 40- or
54-year-old woman.
   Unable to choose between the women, Bismuth transplanted half
the liver into each patient. Because the liver is the only organ in
the body that can regenerate itself, it grows naturally along with
the body after being reduced in size.
   Bismuth told about 100 physicians from around the world gathered
in Pittsburgh for a conference on liver disease that both of his
patients' transplanted livers are functioning well.
   One of the women, however, is still critically ill because of
kidney and lung complications she suffered before surgery.
   On Feb. 2, Dr. Rudolf Pichlmayr of the University of Hannover's
Medical School in West Germany performed a similar split-liver
transplant.
   Pichlmayr said he, like Bismuth, was desperate to save two
patients' lives even though just one liver was available. As a
result, he split the liver of a 23-year-old man and transplanted
half into a 2-year-old boy and the other half into a 63-year-old
woman.
   Both recipients are back home and doing well, Pichlmayr said in
a telephone interview from West Germany early today.
   ``I guess the risk for both recipients will be a little bit
higher. So I think it's a step forward, but it's only a step
forward if one cannot manage the donor problem,'' Pichlmayr said.
   ``It's an enormous need for livers in our country,'' he said.
``We have too few donors, so we have to take all the maneuvers to
get more livers, particularly of course for the small children.''
   In recent years, Pichlmayr and other doctors in Europe and the
United States have trimmed livers so the organs can fit into
transplant patients, particularly children for whom donor organs
are most scarce.
   ``It's of course a pity to throw away the other half of the
liver,'' Pichlmayr said.
   Split liver transplants are more complicated than simply paring
down the organ because doctors need to divide a common artery and
bile duct, Pichlmayr said. As a result, half the split organ is
often weaker than the other.
   Broelsch said the one-year success rate is about 50 percent to
60 percent for children who receive reduced-size livers, compared
with 80 percent to 90 percent for those who receive an entire organ.
   The risk for split-liver transplants will likely be even greater
and, until more is known, will remain a method of last resort,
doctors said.
   ``Nevertheless, it's a big step,'' Starzl said.

   The U.S. dollar finished lower today in dealings
against the Japanese yen, while stock prices fell back
substantially.
   The dollar closed at 124.24 yen, down 0.39 yen from its finish
on Tuesday. It remained little changed from its opening at 124.23
yen, hovering between the 124.17 and 124.35-yen level.
   ``Trading was mixed in selling and buying, but generally it was
a quiet day without incentives to direct the market,'' said an
official of a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of

   There was also a wait-and-see attitude among investors in regard
to the completion of the refunding auction of U.S. Treasury bonds,
which began Tuesday in the United States, and the pending
announcement in Washington next week of U.S. trade figures for
March, he said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 147.95 points Tuesday, lost 251.20
points, or 0.92 percent to close the day's trading at 27,161.05.
   Share prices fell sharply during the afternoon session on a news
report that British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said
there could be an internationally coordinated boost in interest
rates, traders said.
   The report by a Japanese news service quoted Lawson as saying a
coordinated effort to raise short term rates by West Germany, Japan
and other leading nations is ``certainly possible.''
   An official of a securities house, speaking anonymously, said
there were no changes in fundamentals, however.
   Volume on the first section trade was estimated at 1.1 billion
shares, down up from 700 million shares Tuesday.
   Losers included electricals, shipbuildings and machineries.
Papers, chemicals, constructions and foodstuffs were also lower.
Among the winners were steels and rubbers.

   A voodoo-practicing death-row inmate
who wanted to die was denied a last meal of sacred earth, and
gritted his teeth and mumbled when his execution was stayed less
than six hours before it was to take place.
   James Smith won a reprieve from the U.S. Supreme Court on
Tuesday evening, after his mother filed an appeal claiming he was
mentally incompetent. No vote among the justices was released.
   Alexzene Hamilton of Indianapolis also contended that mitigating
evidence in his case was not allowed to be considered by jurors who
sentenced Smith to death.
   ``I'm praising God right now,'' Mrs. Hamilton said after hearing
of the stay. ``That's all I can say, I just thank God.''
   Smith, waiting in a holding cell next to the death chamber,
gritted his teeth and said something inaudible upon hearing the
news, said Texas Department of Corrections spokesman Charles Brown.
   He was later transferred back to his death-row cell at the
prison's Ellis I unit. Smith, 37, was convicted of the 1983
robbery-slaying of Houston insurance office manager Larry Rohus.
   Testimony at his trial showed he was tackled by witnesses while
fleeing the shooting scene and that a gun he was carrying was
linked to the slaying.
   Smith has no attorney and resisted attempts for legal help from
capital punishment opponents.
   ``I don't understand all this clinging to life,'' Smith said in
a recent interview. ``Life is a temporary situation. The spirit
moves on. Death is like eating a prune in the morning. It's a
natural function.''
   Tuesday morning, he requested ``Rhaeakunda dirt'' for his final
meal later in the day, a request prison officials did not honor.
Texas A&M University soil experts said the dirt is believed to be
eaten in voodoo rituals.
   Smith, a former tarot-card dealer in New Orleans, has said he
believes in and has practiced voodoo.
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Raymond Rohus, the victim's
brother. ``He was caught red-handed. I don't know what else they
can do besides go ahead and take care of their obligation to get
rid of the guy.''
   ``Hopefully the judges will reconsider,'' Rohus said.

<HEAD>China Condemned on Tibetan Rights While Vice-Premier at White
House</HEAD>

   Charges against China of genocide and
repression of Tibetans were aired by congressmen even as a Chinese
vice premier was meeting President Reagan and other U.S. government
officials.
   The Congressional human rights caucus heard the accusations of
abuses in Chinese-ruled Tibet during a hearing that, in an apparent
coincidence, began at the same hour Tuesday that Chinese Vice
Premier Tian Jiyun was at the White House talking with Reagan.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reagan-Tiang
meeting centered on trade, but Fitzwater did not say whether human
rights issues were raised. The State Department said also said a
meeting Tuesday between Tiang and Secretary George Shultz centered
largely with economic matters.
   Reps. Ben Gilman, R-N.Y., and Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., told the
human rights panel they are introducing legislation for economic
sanctions against China linked to human rights abuses in the
Himalayan region of Tibet.
   Gilman said his bill would ban U.S. support of credit for China
from international lending agencies and would provide for Voice of
America broadcasts in the Tibetan language and for U.S. aid for
Tibetan refugees and for preserving Tibetan culture.
   The U.S. recognizes Tibet only as a part of China and the State
Department does not require its officials in the region to have a
knowledge of the Tibetan language. McCloskey said that leaves the
U.S. ``indirectly aiding and abetting in the extinction of Tibetan
culture,'' McCloskey said.
   Actor Richard Gere, president of New York's Tibet House, told
the panel China has ``an ugly solution'' for the Tibetan problem
providing for ``total annihilation of the Tibetan people as a race,
as a culture ... probably within one generation.''
   The 35 years since the entrance of Chinese forces into the
Himalayan territory have brought ``one of the most devastating
genocides we have had in history ... on the order of Cambodia''
under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, said Gere.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., co-chairman of the caucus, said he
hopes the Reagan administration raises human rights with Chinese
leaders because the issue will not disappear.
   ``The cost of human rights violations to the Chinese will be
increased year after year after year until they realize it will be
not only in the interest of the Tibetan people but of the Chinese
themselves to put an end to those barbaric practices,'' he said.
   After the hearing _ and while Tian was having lunch with U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter _ members of the caucus and
Thubten Jigme Norbu, brother of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan
spiritual leader in exile, inaugurated a Tibetan art, antiques and
photographic exhibit at a congressional office building. Norbu is a
professor at the University of Indiana.

   Glasnost and an afternoon tea with Raisa
Gorbachev have led Sotheby's to arrange the first modern
international art auction in the Soviet Union.
   When Sotheby's gavel falls at the July 7 auction in Moscow,
Soviet artists whose works weren't officially recognized three
years ago will find themselves in the distinctly capitalist
position of selling their work to the highest bidder.
   ``They all saw this as an opportunity to get international
exposure, and were quite titillated to have their work auctioned by
Sotheby's,'' said Simon de Pury, Sotheby's managing director in
Europe, who will serve as auctioneer.
   In addition to 100 works by 29 living artists, 18 paintings by
five artists from the Russian avant garde period of 1910-1940 will
be on the block.
   With price estimates ranging from $3,500 to $35,000, Sotheby's
expects the sale of contemporary art alone to total about $1
million.
   ``Many of the artists, until a year or two ago, were
`unofficial' artists, who had difficulty exhibiting and exporting
their work,'' said de Pury, who proposed the sale. ``This has all
changed with glasnost.''
   Ronald Feldman, a Manhattan art dealer, said that with Mikhail
Gorbachev's policy of openness, ``You can now step in and buy
paintings. Before, everyone was in the smuggling business ...
   ``In many ways, this is a revolution going on here.''
   The distinction between ``official'' and ``unofficial'' artists
has faded and the auction virtually erases it, he said.
   Sotheby's was well positioned to be the first auction house to
be allowed to set up at least for one auction in the Soviet Union.
   De Pury had worked with Soviet cultural officials in his former
capacity as curator of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection in
Switzerland, arranging exchanges with the Soviets.
   In August, at tea with Mrs. Gorbachev, he broached the subject
of an auction. ``When I mentioned the possibility the first time,
to my amazement, they were intrigued, and said it was worth
exploring. There was a definite interest,'' de Pury recalled.
   De Pury said he had a free hand in selecting the contemporary
works for the auction, and he roamed Moscow and other cities,
visiting studios and picking paintings.
   ``It's a very lively, vital group of artists whose works have
been fought over by museums and collectors in the West,'' he said.
   For the artists, Feldman said, ``The prices they may get are
secondary to their desire to have their work seen in the West, to
be known in the West.''
   Soviet officials presented a list of avant-garde works that
could be sold, and Sotheby's selected from that.
   Highlights of the collection will be shown for five days in New
York starting Saturday; then in London (May 22-24); Paris (May
26-27); Cologne (May 31-June 3); and Zurich (June 9-15).
   Customers planning to attend the auction in Moscow can sign up
for a special program of visits to the artists' studios, as well as
lectures, museum tours and evening entertainment.
   Among the more established contemporary artists whose work will
be sold are Ilya Kabakov, Ivan Chuikov, Vladimir Yankilevsky and
Edward Steinberg.
   The avant-garde section includes seven works by Alexander
Rodchenko and four by Varvara Stepanova. The most valuable on sale
are Rodchenko's ``Line,'' estimated to sell for about $200,000, and
a gouache composition of his from 1916 which Sotheby's thinks will
fetch about $130,000.
   ``We will have to see how the sale goes,'' de Pury said. ``It
could possibly lead to other auctions _ this could be an annual
event, or biannual.''
   Nearly all of the contemporary artists represented in the
auction live in Moscow, though artists from Leningrad and Soviet
Georgia also have their works up for sale.

<TEXT>
   Cartoonist Charles Schulz was
confronted in his home by two masked gunmen who fled as deputies
arrived in squad cars and helicopters, a newspaper reported today.
   The Santa Rosa Press Democrat said the break-in occurred Sunday
and the sheriff withheld the news at the urging of Schulz, creator
of the popular ``Peanuts'' comic strip.
   ``At the request of Mr. Schulz, we are not issuing a press
release,'' said Sgt. Gary Henshaw. He said the directive came from
Sheriff Dick Michaelsen and was intended to discourage copy-cat
crimes.
   Schulz, 65, declined comment.
   ``We've talked it over with police officers and we've decided
not to say anything,'' Schulz said.
   Neighbors of the cartoonist said the two men entered the home
about 10 p.m., shortly before Schulz's daughter, Jill, came up the
driveway of the hilltop home, the newspaper said. The daughter saw
what was happening and raced to the home of a neighbor, who called
for help.
   Deputies arrived and police set up a road block to check all
cars leaving the area.
   Law enforcement officers searched the hillside area near the
Schulz home for more than an hour, aided by searchlights directed
from helicopters hovering overhead.

   A California company's claim to have isolated
an elusive virus responsible for a type of blood transfusion
disease called non-A, non-B hepatitis received a mixed greeting
from a pair of government scientists.
   ``A number of researchers over the years have claimed to have
found it (the virus), but it has never been confirmed,'' said Dr.
Palmer McCurdy, assistant director of blood disease research at the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a part of the National
Institutes of Health.
   Robert Purcell, a hepatitis specialist at the NIH, told The
Washington Post the company's announcement ``is very important if
it holds up, and the data looks like it will.''
   Both scientists were responding to the announcement Tuesday from
Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif. The biotechnology firm also
announced its scientists are developing a test for the virus that
can be used at blood banks.
   If the test proves successful, it could allow blood contaminated
with the virus to be detected and thus prevent transmission of the
disease through blood transfusions.
   The company said the finding eventually could lead to a vaccine
to combat the disease.
   Non-A, Non-B hepatitis is known as ``transfusion'' hepatitis
because it causes about 95 percent of the hepatitis that is
associated with blood transfusions.
   About 3 million people a year are infected with the disease, but
it often goes undiagnosed, said McCurdy, because, unlike hepatitis
A or B, it often does not cause jaundice.
   He said up to 2 percent of those who develop chronic cases of
``transfusion'' hepatitis develop serious, and often fatal, liver
damage.
   McCurdy said he had not seen the Chiron findings published in
any scientific journal and was not aware of the company's
discovery. He said most such discoveries are not considered valid
until they are confirmed in other labs, or examined by other
experts prior to publication in a process called ``peer review.''
   A Chiron announcement said the research results would be
published ``in the near future.'' The company also said it had not
yet filed application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
for investigative research of its blood test kit, but plans to do
so later this year.
   ``I think they have got it this time,'' Purcell was quoted as
saying. ``This is a first-rate group at a good company and they
have been working on it for six years with very sophisticated
molecular techniques.''
   Chiron announced that the non-A, non-B virus was isolated by
removing all of the genetic material from a chimpanzee blood sample
that had a high level of the virus. The genetic material was then
inserted into laboratory bacteria which, following instructions
from the transplanted genes, produced proteins.
   Antibodies from the blood of hepatitis patients was then placed
in the protein broth. These antibodies attached themselves to the
proteins that originated from the non-A, non-B virus genes. The
researchers then detected this attachment, indicating that the
virus had been isolated.

<HEAD>Former Governor Ogilvie Dead at 65 after Heart Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Richard B. Ogilvie, who won a battle
for Illinois' first income tax only to lose the state's highest
office after one term, has died at age 65.
   Ogilvie, a lawyer and the state's GOP governor from 1969 to
1973, died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital on Tuesday, a day
after he underwent emergency surgery for a massive heart attack.
   ``He always spoke his mind and had the strength of character to
stand behind issues he believed in, such as the state's first
income tax,'' said Gov. James R. Thompson.
   Oglivie's wife, Dorothy, daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband
were at the hospital when he died.
   Funeral plans were not announced.
   Ogilvie's 1972 re-election loss to Dan Walker was attributed in
part to the 1969 enactment of the state's first income tax, which
established a 2.5 percent tax rate for individuals and a 4 percent
rate for corporations.
   ``He made very tough decisions. He didn't measure the political
effect of them many times, and some of them hurt him,'' former Sen.
Charles Percy, R-Ill. said late Tuesday.
   Walker, who edged Ogilvie with 51 percent of the vote, is
serving a seven-year federal prison sentence for bank fraud that
occurred after he left office.
   Ogilvie took office a year after the 1968 riots at the
Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
   In his final State of the State address to the General Assembly
in 1973, Ogilvie listed among his accomplishments the enactment of
the tax, reorganization of the government and the curtailment of
civil disorders.
   Among his failures, he said, were the inability to secure the
enactment of merit selection of judges, and a lag in enforcement of
anti-pollution rules for Lake Michigan.
   In recent years, Ogilvie had become much sought-after in
untangling complicated legal matters, including the Milwaukee Road
bankruptcy proceedings, considered one of the most successful rail
bankruptcy reorganizations.
   He was named trustee of the Chicago Missouri & Western Railway
Co., which has been under federal bankruptcy reorganization since
April.
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer had been preparing to name Ogilvie chairman
of the Chicago Housing Authority, the city's troubled public
housing agency.

   U.S. Sen. David Karnes won a battle for the
GOP nomination, but faces the beginning of another tough contest
today as he looks ahead to the general election campaign against
Democrat Bob Kerrey.
   Karnes defeated Rep. Hal Daub, a four-term Omaha congressman, in
a Republican race in which each said his record had been
misrepresented by the other.
   Republican State Chairman Norm Riffel said it might take time
for the wounds to heal.
   Kerrey, who served one term as governor and declined to seek a
second, overwhelmed Ken Michaelis in Tuesday's Democratic primary.
   Republican Vice President George Bush and Democratic Gov.
Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts won predictable victories in their
respective primaries. Neither candidate spent more than a few hours
campaigning in Nebraska.
   Dukakis easily outdistanced Jesse Jackson, the only presidential
hopeful who visited the state twice. However, Jackson appeared to
win votes sufficient to give him seven of Nebraska's 25 delegates.
   With 1,850 of 1,870 precincts reporting, or 99 percent, Dukakis
had 104,264 or 63 percent, while Jackson had 44,079 or 26 percent.
   Bush, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting, had 136,593 or
71 percent. Sen. Robert Dole had 23 percent while Pat Robertson had
5 percent.
   Nebraskans also gave a special victory to its one-house,
nonpartisan Legislature, approving lawmakers' first pay raise in 20
years. The constitutional amendment will boost salaries from $4,800
to $12,000 annually.
   In the Omaha-dominated 2nd Congressional District, former state
Sen. Peter Hoagland scored an upset over Cece Zorinsky for the
Democratic nomination.
   Mrs. Zorinsky, widow of U.S. Sen. Ed Zorinsky, had been favored
by as much as 45 percentage points in early polls.
   With all precincts reporting, Hoagland had 33,155, or 55
percent; Mrs. Zorinsky 28,377 or 43 percent; two other candidates
also were on the ballot.
   Jerry Schenken won the Republican nomination in the 2nd
District, defeating three challengers.
   With all precincts reporting, Schenken had 22,927 or 38 percent;
state Sen. Chris Abboud 18,162 or 30 percent; Ally Milder 18,096 or
30 percent; and Carl Jennings 1,945 or 3 percent.
   Hoagland and Schenken will meet in November for the seat being
vacated by Daub.
   Incumbent 1st District Rep. Doug Bereuter was unopposed in the
GOP race, while Corky Jones easily defeated Marlin Pals for the
Democratic nomination.
   With 603 of 658 precincts reporting, Jones had 29,844 or 92
percent, while Pals had 13,172 or 31 percent.
   U.S. Rep. Virginia Smith was unopposed for the GOP nomination to
an eighth term in the 3rd District. Democrat John D. Racek was
unopposed for the Democratic nomination.
   In the Senate race, Kerrey and Republican Gov. Kay Orr
acknowledged that he would likely be the front-runner in the early
stages of the campaign. Kerrey said he'd work to keep it that way;
Mrs. Orr said Kerry's gubernatorial record would make a profitable
target.
   Kerrey, 44, lost part of a leg and won the Medal of Honor as a
Navy commando in Vietnam. He returned home to build a successful
restaurant business. In his first bid for office, he ousted
Republican Gov. Charles Thone in 1982.
   With 1,857 of 1,870 precincts reporting, Kerrey had 152,505 or
92 percent, while Michaelis, a disbarred lawyer, had 13,909 or 8
percent.
   Karnes, at 39 the youngest U.S. senator, won his first election
Tuesday. Mrs. Orr appointed Karnes, a political unknown, to fill
Zorinsky's seat in March 1987. Daub had been among the party
regulars lobbying for the job.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Karnes had 114,232
or 55 percent while Daub had 93,416 or 45 percent.
   ``We did it!'' Karnes told supporters. ``And the thing that I am
so proud about is that we did it the old-fashioned way _ we earned
every single vote.''

<HEAD>Another Yacht Seized As Ark Royal Leaves Key West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. authorities released one luxury yacht
seized under the ``zero tolerance'' anti-drug policy, but announced
the seizure of a similar vessel also found with minuscule amounts
of drugs on board.
   The 133-foot Ark Royal was released Tuesday afternoon after
Michael Rogerson, president of the California company that owns the
vessel, paid $1,600 in fines and fees and agreed not to hold the
government responsible.
   The Ms. Mindy, a $600,000, 52-foot sportfishing boat owned by
the Cigarette Racing Team of North Miami, was seized Monday as it
returned from the Bahamas and docked in Port Salerno, the Coast
Guard announced Tuesday.
   U.S. Customs Service agents turned up cocaine residue on a
dollar bill and traces of marijuana in a plastic bag, according to
the Coast Guard.
   Neither person aboard the Ms. Mindy _ ship's captain Lewis
Shaver and an unidentified first mate _ was charged with drug
possession.
   Also seized under the policy last week was a 68-foot shrimper.
   Officials have not decided whether to pursue civil forfeiture of
the boat or allow a fine to paid as in the case of the Ark Royal,
said Leon Guinn, assistant regional Customs supervisor.
   Rogerson, president of the Tomima Corp. and chairman of the
Rogerson Aircraft Corp., criticized the policy in a statement
Tuesday by his office in Irvine, Calif.
   ``This type of action presents an unreasonable danger to all
boat owners for the isolated actions of passengers and crew,'' he
said. ``The seizure of this vessel for the apparent individual
actions of a crewmember against the stated policy of the
corporation and the vessel for minute traces makes no sense.''
   Under the policy, which went into effect April 15, vessels with
drugs on board are seized by the Coast Guard and turned over to the
Customs Service _ no matter how petty the drug offense, how
valuable the boat, or if a shrimper's family depends on the living
he makes from the boat.
   Civil libertarians say the policy puts punishment before the
trial.
   ``What's wrong with it is the same thing that's wrong with
shooting someone or hanging someone, and then saying, `We're going
to give you a trial to see if you're guilty,''' said James Powell,
national legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Michael Sheehan, a spokesman for the Miami Customs office, said
it was obvious ``that the program is strict, stringent and tough.
   ``However, zero tolerance is also fair, reasonable and
judicious,'' Sheehan said. ``That has been pointed out by the
release of the Ark Royal.''
   Fewer than 10 percent of vessels seized by the government are
ever returned to owners. The Ark Royal was in that minority because
its owner moved swiftly and filed a convincing petition, Customs
officials said.
   The yacht's crew had undergone drug testing before being hired,
said Rogerson, who was not aboard the vessel when it was seized in
international waters. And the government was unable to charge any
of the six crew members with possession of the 10 marijuana seeds
or two stems discovered by the Coast Guard when it boarded the boat
Saturday.
   David Phelps and his two crewmen were arrested and charged with
misdemeanor possession of marijuana when Phelps' 68-foot shrimper
returned a week ago Tuesday from an eight-day trip.
   The Miss Lorraine carried 1,750 pounds of shrimp _ and a few
marijuana seeds the Coast Guard discovered during a routine safety
check, authorities said. Phelps and his two crewmen said the
marijuana was from a previous crew.
   ``What is a captain supposed to do? Frisk the crew and strip the
passengers?'' asked Capt. Thom Antoszewski, one of the bitter
fishermen who say their livelihoods and human rights are
jeopardized by the policy.
   Several Key West boat captains have drafted forms for their crew
to sign in which they swear they won't bring drugs aboard.

<HEAD>Feds: Laotian Officials Accused of Supervising Heroin Smuggling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men extradited from Hong Kong to face drug
smuggling charges here said Laotian officials supervise heroin
production there and take a cut of the proceeds, according to court
documents.
   The allegations, which name no specific officials but referred
to a ``big official'' who was in charge of the ``upcountry
province,'' were contained in affidavits requesting the extradition
of Cheng Ah-Kai, 60, of Hong Kong, and Wichai Chaiwisan, 55, of
Thailand.
   The defendants are charged with shipping 70 pounds of heroin to
an undercover agent in New York. They were arrested in Hong Kong in
March and waived extradition.
   They arrived here Tuesday night and were to be arraigned today.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said Tuesday the two claimed
they needed permission from the communist ruled Laotian government
to manufacture heroin and that officials received payments of
approximately $2,000 for every 700 grams of heroin produced.
   In a secretly recorded conversation with an informant, the two
said that Laotian officials also supervised the production to
ensure they were not cheated, according to the affidavits.
   ``This is the first prosecutable case in the United States which
actively discusses the possible involvement of Laotian government
officials'' in drug trade, said Robert Stutman, head of the Drug
Enforcement Administration's New York office.
   An official with the permanent United Nations Mission for the
Laos People's Democratic Republic disputed the allegations.
   ``The government does not encourage the Laos people to grow or
to produce or to trade in opium or heroin,'' said S. Sisouvong, a
third secretary at the Laos U.N. mission.
   He said the Southeast Asian government fully supported the
elimination of illicit drug trafficking and was trying to encourage
Laotians to grow crops like rice and vegetables.
   DEA intelligence sources have reported that the production of
opium, the base for heroin, had increased in Laos to more than 250
metric tons in 1987 from 50 metric tons in 1984, according to
Stutman.
   ``This type of growth can't go on without someone in the
government knowing about it and approving it,'' Maloney said.
   Stutman said U.S. officials would have problems pursuing the
matter because there was not much contact between the United States
and Laos.
   Cheng and Wichai were believed to have been involved in the
importation of heroin to the United States for more than 20 years,
according to Maloney. He said they received much of their supply in
Laos.
   The case began in January 1987 when the DEA learned that Cheng
was seeking a new route to smuggle heroin into the United States,
Maloney said.
   Through a confidential informant in Hong Kong, the DEA set up a
series of negotiations with an undercover agent who posed as an
organized crime figure with connections at Kennedy International
Airport here.
   These negotiations resulted in the shipment from Bangkok of 70
pounds of heroin, valued at $50 million, which arrived at Kennedy
on Jan. 16, concealed in a shipment of brass animal figures,
authorities said.
   Cheng and Wichai were charged in a three-count indictment,
handed up Feb. 9, alleging conspiracy to import heroin and
importation of heroin. They face up to life in prison if convicted.
   Stutman said the investigation abroad was continuing.

   Robert Redford opened an exhibition of his movies
by telling an audience that films are a powerful way to bridge
differences of opinion and that he supports glasnost in Soviet
cinema.
   Glasnost, the Russian word for openness, is a key term in
Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of reforms in certain areas.
   ``Obviously this is a very important time for our countries,''
Redford told the audience at Moscow's Oktyabr theater on Tuesday,
the exhibition's opening day. ``And I believe that film is a very
powerful tool to translate differences of opinion and points of
common interest.
   ``And for that reason, I support glasnost in both American film
and Soviet cinema.''
   President Reagan and Gorbachev are to meet May 29 in Moscow,
their second summit since last December, when the two signed a
treaty scrapping intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   Redford, 51, is most widely known among Soviets for his role in
``Three Days of the Condor,'' a 15-year-old spy movie that
continues to be shown in Soviet theaters.
   He came to Moscow after spending three days in Leningrad where
the eight-film exhibition opened.
   ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' which Redford directed but in
which he does not appear, and ``All the President's Men'' were the
opening-night films, shown at two different theaters in Moscow.
   Igor N. Lissakovsky, vice-president of the Association of
Filmmakers, said the general public was being admitted to the films
for 3 rubles a ticket (about $4.70), but that blocks of seats for
each showing had been reserved for members of the Filmmakers Union.
   Lissakovsky said the money from ticket sales, which usually goes
to the state, will be turned over to the Filmmakers Union for
projects encouraging young artists.
   He said he did not know how many seats were available to the
general public. Redford spokesman Gary Beer said the Soviets told
him the theater admitting the public will have three showings a
day, making available 6,000 seats daily, with 1,500 reserved for
Filmmaker Union members.
   The other theater is a private theater of the Filmmakers Union,
with admission by invitation only.
   Other films to be shown are ``The Candidate,'' ``The Sting,''
``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' ``The Electric Horseman,''
``Jeremiah Johnson,'' and ``The Natural.''
   Redford's stay in Moscow, which ends Friday, will include a
meeting on ecology, a cause the actor-director has supported for
years.
   He also plans to moderate a workshop on global warming caused by
the depletion of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. The
workshop is the effort of the Institute for Resource Management,
which Redford founded, and the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   Redford next travels to Tblisi, capital of the Soviet Republic
of Georgia, to open the film exhibition Friday.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady In Thin European Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar held steady in thin trading in
Europe this morning, with foreign exchange dealers saying they
expected it to remain in a narrow range throughout the session.
Gold prices rose.
   Traders said volume was modest ahead of the long weekend due to
start for many dealers in Europe on Thursday.
   One trader in Milan said dealers might try to test the dollar's
lower levels against the West German mark.
   ``I see the dollar a little lower. But traders will try and move
it down carefully,'' she said, citing fear of central bank
intervention as the reason for their caution.
   Another trader in Milan said attention had shifted to sterling,
following statements by Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson that he favors a closer link between sterling and the West
German mark.
   The Milan dealer said he expects the pound to edge up against
the mark.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.39 yen to a closing 124.24 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 124.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   --1.6765 West German marks, down from 1.6783
   --1.3925 Swiss francs, down from 1.3955
   --5.6915 French francs, up from 5.6905
   --1.8789 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8815
   --1,248.00 Italian lire, unchanged
   --1.2370 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2375
   The British pound rose to $1.8865 from $1.8825 on Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $450.40 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $446.50. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$449.35.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $449.20, up from $446.50 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.73 to close at a bid $451.68.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London today at a bid price of
$6.52 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's $6.45.

<HEAD>Local Law To Regulate Use In Suffolk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies with 20 or more computer
terminals would be required to provide employees with work breaks,
eye care, special lighting and detachable keyboards, under a bill
approved by the county Legislature.
   If Suffolk County Executive Patrick Halpin signs the bill, which
passed 13-2 Tuesday, it would be the first law in the country to
regulate the terminals in private businesses, workplace design
experts said.
   Business leaders have sharply criticized the measure, charging
it would be costly to implement and put placing them at a
competitive disadvantage in the marketplace. They contend the bill
will drive companies out of the county.
   Mitchell Pally, a spokesman for the Long Island Association, the
region's largest business organization, said the bill ``threatens
the continued economic vitality of the community.
   ``We're obviously very disappointed and will urge Mr. Halpin to
veto the bill,'' he said.
   The bill is intended to protect the health and safety of
employees who use video display terminals (VDTs), according to
legislator John Foley, sponsor of the bill.
   Foley, calling many offices ``high-tech sweatshops,'' said he
believed there was a need for regulation.
   Halpin, who must act on the bill within 60 days of its passage,
said he would hold a public hearing before deciding whether to sign
it.
   Lawmakers in the Long Island county approved a similar bill last
summer, but it was vetoed by the acting county executive at the
time, Michael A. Lo Grande.
   Labor unions, business leaders and workplace experts from around
the country said the Suffolk bill would serve as a model for other
municipalities or states.
   ``Whether this bill will result in legislation elsewhere is
unclear, but it'll rejuvenate a lot of campaigns for VDT standards
around the country,'' said Laura Stock, associate director of the
Labor Occupational Health Program, an advocacy group in Berkeley,
Calif.
   Legislator Joseph Rizzo, who abstained from voting, said, ``this
legislation is doing what a union should be doing.''
   Some companies hinted that they may consider areas outside of
Suffolk for future expansion.
   ``We view the law as a potential deterrent to doing business in
Suffolk,'' said Bruce Reisman, a spokesman for New York Telephone.
``Undoubtedly the law would have to be taken into consideration as
a factor in planning expansions.''
   New York Telephone has 1,500 employees in Suffolk _ operators
and office personnel who use VDTs routinely.
   Optometrist Joseph Hallick testified at the hearing that many of
his patients complain that they never needed glasses until they
started working at VDTs.
   Suffolk companies, however, argued that there is no evidence
that the prolonged use of a VDT is harmful to the employee.
   It mandates that companies pay 80 percent of the cost of annual
eye exams and eyewear required for an operator and provide
15-minute work breaks every three hours for employees who work at
the terminals.
   Businesses would be given six months from the bill's passage
date to comply. If the employer does not comply with the
regulations, the bill provides a basis for an employee to seek
damages in court.

   The airline pilots union disputes the National
Transportation Safety Board's finding that pilot error caused the
Northwest Airlines crash in Detroit that killed 156 people last
August.
   The NTSB in a report on the accident Tuesday faulted the captain
and co-pilot of Northwest Flight 255 for failing to follow the
proper checklist before takeoff and forgetting to extend the
plane's flaps and slats, devices that help provide lift.
   The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 crashed shortly after taking off
from the Detroit airport Aug. 16, 1987, killing 154 people on board
and two on the ground. The only survivor was a 4-year-old
passenger, Cecelia Cichan.
   The two pilots that were killed were members of the Air Line
Pilots Association, which represents 40,000 commercial pilots. The
union said it will continue its own investigation into the accident
and hinted it may petition the NTSB to reconsider the government
findings.
   ``The facts will eventually show that there's a gremlin running
around in the MD-80,'' said Steven Cramer, the ALPA representative
at Northwest.
   Cramer was alluding to the contention by the pilots union all
along that a mechanical failure could have prevented the flaps from
being set properly. Even if the pilots forgot to set the flaps a
warning device was the real culprit because it didn't warn the
pilots of their error as it was designed to, the union says.
   The NTSB said the ``overwhelming evidence'' was that the two
pilots, Capt. John R. Maus, 57, of Las Vegas, and co-pilot David J.
Dodds, 35, of Galena, Ill., forgot to set the flaps and slats
because they did not properly follow a checklist of pre-flight
duties while taxiing before takeoff.
   While acknowledging that the accident might have been averted if
a warning alert had sounded, the safety board said the failure of
the alarm because of an interruption in electrical power was only a
contributing factor to the accident.
   ``The reason for the absence of electrical power could not be
determined,'' the safety board said.
   McDonnell Douglas has denied any problems with the circuit
breaker and suggested the pilots may have pulled the breaker to
keep the alarm from sounding needlessly. The NTSB said it could
establish no evidence that the pilots interfered with the alarm
system, nor find evidence of a mechanical malfunction.
   Nevertheless, the safety board called on the Federal Aviation
Administration to begin an investigation to determine the
reliability of such breakers and determine if failures within the
system can cause such a power shortage.
   The thrust of the NSTB's findings, however, was aimed at the
performance of the two pilots.
   As the plane was taxiing, the captain failed to maintain
discipline in the cockpit and did not go through the pre-flight
checklists, a formal proceeding that requires the co-pilot to
verbally acknowledge that each task is performed, the board said.
There was no evidence on the cockpit voice recording that the flaps
had been set nor that several other pre-flight tasks had been
performed, the board said.
   It said that Dodd and Maus had last undergone formal training in
cockpit resource management in 1983 when they attended a 3{-hour
training session
   The safety board called on the FAA to speed up its development
of guidance to airlines on instituting better training techniques
on cockpit procedures and flight crew coordination. While some
airlines have such training programs, others do not, said NTSB
chairman Jim Burnett.
   Among those who sat quietly in the audience at the NTSB
proceeding was Allison Maus, the widow of the captain who died in
the crash. Mrs. Maus said she felt ``very badly'' about the NTSB
findings ``because my husband was a good pilot and he knew it.''
   ``I'm very proud of his ability and I feel that he's listening
and I have to defend him,'' she said.

<HEAD>Minister Says Japan's War With China Began By Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cabinet minister whose claim that Japan was not
the aggressor in World War II provoked strong protests from China
and other Asian nations told Parliament today the 1937-45
Sino-Japanese War began accidentally.
   The minister, Seisuke Okuno, told Japanese reporters on Tuesday
that he doesn't like to use the word ``invasion'' when discussing
the Sino-Japanese War because both countries lost millions of
people in the conflict.
   Japanese troops overran much of eastern China in the war.
   Opposition parties have demanded the dismissal of the Okuno,
director of the National Land Agency, and called on the
administration of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to take
responsibility for his remarks.
   Okuno has angered China and other Asian nations over the past
month by saying _ most recently on Monday _ that Japan had no
aggressive intent during World War II and had ``fought to protect
itself at a time when the white race had turned Asia into a
colony.''
   China's Foreign Ministry said Okuno's views had caused alarm
worldwide.
   ``The repeated occurrence of such expressions ... in Japan ...
shows there are indeed some people in Japan, even some people who
are cabinet ministers, who have no intention at all for
introspection of the past war of aggression,'' ministry spokesman
Li Zhaoxing said at a weekly briefing in Beijing. ``This cannot but
alarm all the peace-loving peoples and countries in the world.''
   Asked in Parliament today about Okuno's comments, Takeshita
said: ``Our country feels deep responsibility for the grave damage
Japan inflicted on the Chinese people during the past war. We
believe the government should fully recognize that our country's
actions during the war have been criticized severely as
aggression.'' But he stopped short of saying he agreed that Japan's
actions had been aggressive.
   During a Diet (parliament) session today, Okuno said he thought
the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge incident, generally believed to have
caused the Sino-Japanese War, had occurred by accident.
   In comments last month that he reiterated Monday, Okuno also
said Japan should not let the views of Asian neighbors stop Cabinet
members from visiting a controversial Shinto shrine that honors
Japan's war dead.
   Last month, China's Foreign Ministry called Okuno's statements
``astonishing and very regrettable.'' During a visit to China last
week, Japanese Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno reportedly sought to
smooth Chinese irritations over the remarks.
   Meanwhile, the Japan Socialist Party and Komeito (Clean
Government Party) began preparing a resolution calling for Okuno's
dismissal. Another opposition party, the Japan Communist Party,
decided on Tuesday it would demand Okuno's dismissal, news reports
said.
   In the 1937 incident at Marco Polo Bridge, 12 miles west of
Beijing, Japanese troops in the area under a 1901 protocol said
they heard shots while on routine maneuvers nearby.
   After reportedly finding one soldier missing in a roll call,
they began fighting Chinese troops who were guarding a nearby town.
Several days later, Japan poured more troops into China and
hostilities increased.
   In recent years, Asian countries have frequently criticized
Japanese views of its military past.
   In 1986, Education Minister Masayuki Fujio, a member of former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's Cabinet, was dismissed after
saying Korea was partly responsible for its annexation by Japan in
1910, and that Japan's actions against China in World War II were
justifiable.
   The remarks brought strong protests from other Asian nations.
   Japan's Asian neighbors also have complained about the
government's approval of a school history textbook in 1986 that
they said whitewashed Japan's role during the war, and its
censorship of other textbooks that portrayed Japan's military role
in a negative light.
   An official visit in 1985 by Nakasone to Yasukuni Shrine, where
Japan's war dead are enshrined, also drew sharp criticism from
countries such as China, which said it offended those who suffered
in the war.

<TEXT>
   Hail-spitting thunderstorms that pelted the Atlantic coast for
two days began blowing out to sea early today, while the National
Guard helped enforce a curfew on a Kentucky town ``buried'' by a
tornado blamed for one death.
   The storms, which shattered windows and downed power lines as
far south as the Gulf coast and as far north as Pennsylvania,
surprised motorists throughout the Deep South with icy roadways on
Tuesday.
   ``We've got wrecks everywhere,'' said Vicki Griffith, a police
dispatcher in Tallassee, about 20 miles northeast of Montgomery,
Ala. She said at least three people were injured in accidents
during the afternoon storm. The extent of the injuries was not
immediately known.
   School officials in Tallassee and nearby Wetumpka delayed the
dismissal of students Tuesday afternoon to allow the storm to
clear, said Robyn Hearn, a spokesman for the Alabama Emergency
Management Agency. No funnel clouds were sighted despite tornado
warnings.
   Thunderstorms also lashed Georgia and North Carolina, where
residents spotted several funnel clouds, and West Virginia before
beginning to move out to sea early this morning, the National
Weather Service reported.
   In Mississippi, winds overturned three mobile homes, caused
minor power outages and hurled a 50-foot communications tower 30
feet onto a nearby business. No injuries were reported.
   The storms produced golfball-sized hail near Saucier, Miss., and
in central Texas, where the wind gusted up to 76 mph. In
Winston-Salem, N.C., about 5,100 homes lost power due to the storm,
but it was restored by 9:15 p.m., Duke Power Co. said.
   Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson on Tuesday toured a 6-mile-long
path of destruction left the night before by a tornado that killed
a woman in a house trailer and injured at least 15 people in
Middlesboro, a town of 11,000 just north of the Tennessee border.
   ``It just kind of hopped along the valley,'' Wilkinson said.
``And it's very obvious where it touched down.''
   ``You just can't believe the kind of destruction we're talking
here,'' said Mayor Troy Welch. ``The city's just buried.''
   Joe Iovine, who watched bulldozers clearing debris Tuesday from
a furniture store owned by his family since 1910, said, ``It was
wiped out in 30 seconds. I get to talking about it and it chokes me
up. I've had it.''
   Wilkinson said a preliminary survey showed that 38 businesses
and 26 homes suffered major damage, but that damage was not severe
enough to warrant a federal disaster area designation.
   Welch, estimating damage in the millions, declared an emergency
shortly after midnight, and Wilkinson activated 30 National
Guardsmen to help clean up, keep the peace and enforce an 8 p.m.
curfew in the damaged business district.

   Thunderstorms moved out to sea today after lashing the East
Coast with hail and powerful winds that blew windows out of
buildings and downed trees and power lines.
   Thunderstorms Tuesday also dropped hail as big as golf balls
along the Gulf Coast and unleashed winds gusting to 76 mph in
central Texas. Strong winds damaged homes near Eola, Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued early today along the middle
Atlantic Coast and the Carolina coast. Cloudy skies prevailed from
northern Florida to New England and the lower Great Lakes region.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms extended from central Texas to
southeastern Colorado, and a few showers and thunderstorms dampened
North Dakota.
   Much of the southern Plains were under cloudy skies. Clouds
spread over the Pacific Northwest, but fair skies prevailed in the
rest of the West.
   In the upper Great Lakes, temperatures were in the upper 20s and
30s, prompting frost and freeze warnings for northern lower
Michigan.
   On Tuesday, strong winds blew out windows in Thomasville, Ga.,
and downed trees around Newton, Ga., and in the northern Florida
cities of Darlington and Bonifay. Trees and power lines were
knocked down in Greensboro, N.C.
   The thunderstorms also dropped dime-sized hail on Newton and the
Pennsylvania towns of Elizabethtown and Coatesville.
   Thunderstorms spawned golf ball-size hail near Saucier, Miss.,
and in Miles, Texas, and gusts to 76 mph in San Angelo, Texas.
   Today's forecast called for showers and a few thunderstorms
scattered across New England, most numerous over northern and
coastal sections; scattered showers and thunderstorms in the Texas
Panhandle, west central Texas and the Rio Grande Valley; clouds
prevailing in northeast Minnesota and the northern half of Florida
and sunny skies in the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 70s or 80s across
much of the nation; 60s from northern Minnesota to the lower Great
Lakes, eastern Ohio Valley and much of New England; 50s across the
northern Great Lakes and the upper Ohio Valley; and 90s in much of
central and Southern California to the Rio Grande Valley and south
central Texas and 100 to 105 degress across the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 28
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 81 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

   The champagne flowed as family and friends
celebrated the murder acquittals of reputed mob boss Nicodemo
``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and eight associates accused of killing a
gangster rival.
   ``It was a very, very brave jury,'' said Las Vegas lawyer Oscar
Goodman at the party in a posh center city hotel hours after
Tuesday's verdicts clearing Scarfo and his associates of killing
Salvatore Testa on Sept. 14, l984.
   Scarfo and his associates were also found innocent of conspiracy
and possession of an instrument of crime, charges brought against
them by two ex-mobsters turned informants who said they were part
of the murder plot.
   The revelers sipped $50-a-shot Louis XII cognac and downed
glasses of $100-a-bottle Taittinger champagne to celebrate the
stunning acquittal.
   The acquitted men, however, did not attend.
   They remained in jail without bail, under federal indictment
with nine other Scrafo associates on charges of operating a
criminal enterprise that includes murder, extortion, drug dealing,
loan sharking and gambling.
   ``No jury in the world is going to accept that kind of perjured
evidence without some kind of corroborating evidence, and in this
case there was none,'' Goodman said on the testimony of informants
Nicholas ``Nicky Crow'' Caramandi and Thomas ``Tommy Del''
DelGiorno.
   That trial is expected to be held later this year and First
Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Lee said the acquittals shouldn't
affect his case, which uses the same charges the federal government
has brought against organized crime families in Boston, New York
and Kansas City.
   Scarfo and other mob associates, including a few acquitted with
him this time, are charged in two other murder cases still ahead _
one in Philadelphia for the 1985 slaying of Frank ``Frankie
Flowers'' D`Alfonso, and the other the 1978 killing in New Jersey
of former Judge Edwin Helfant.
   Last December, Scarfo was found innocent of federal drug
racketeering charges, and the chief evidence against him and six
associates came from Caramandi and DelGiorno.
   Others acquitted with Scarfo included his nephew and alleged mob
underboss, Philip ``Crazy Phil'' Leonetti, Joseph Grande, Salvatore
Grande, Francis Iannarella, Salvatore Merlino, Joseph Pungitore,
Salvatore Scafidi, and Charles Iannece.
   Prosecutor Barbara Christie fled the City Hall courtroom
avoiding reporters, but the office of District Attorney Ronald
Castille in a brief statement said ``we are obviously
disappointed.''
   ``I love the American judicial system,'' said Scarfo's son,
Nicodemo, Jr., after the eight women and four men gave their
verdict in the eighth week of the trial.
   He had been in court every day, with other relatives, giving
visible support to his 59-year-old father, a cement contractor in
Atlanic City, N.J., whom federal and state organized crime
investigators claim heads the Philadelphia-Southern Jersey mob
decimated in the past decade by bloody internal warfare, arrests
and convictions.
   Scarfo has been in prison since his arrest in January 1987 for
conspiring to extort $1 million from a Philadelphia developer. He
is serving a 15-year sentence for that federal crime.

   A meeting between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
prominent editors has made clear that a major gathering of
Communist Party members next month is expected to fall solidly in
line behind his reform campaign.
   Gorbachev told the media and ideology leaders at a meeting at
the party Central Committee that old methods of choosing delegates
to party conferences would be scrapped for the meeting planned June
28, the first such gathering since 1941. The 5,000 people to take
part should be chosen solely on the basis of their support for the
reforms, Gorbachev said.
   ``There must be no more quotas, as were the case in the past,
specifying how many factory workers and farmers and how many women
are to be elected, among others,'' Gorbachev said. ``The principal
political directive is to elect active supporters of perestroika to
go to the conference.''
   Others who spoke at the meeting appeared to endorse that
approach and declared ``perestroika,'' Gorbachev's effort to
rebuild Soviet society, a path from which no one should stray.
   The 57-year-old party chief met with the media and ideology
leaders on Saturday, but full reports on the exchange were released
by the official Tass news agency only Tuesday night and early today.
   Gorbachev complained that conservatism continues to pose the
biggest threat to his reforms and that the doubters have raised
questions about whether the nation is turning away from socialism.
   ``Some people have indeed lost their bearings amid all these
processes under way,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``Some people have failed to keep their heads and panicked. And
the panic _and this is very serious _ has taken the form of asking:
`Isn't perestroika coming to mean the wrecking and rejection of the
values of socialism, isn't it giving rise to alien phenomena, isn't
it destabilizing society?'''
   Yet the 57-year-old leader said not everyone who fears his
reforms or has resisted them should be branded ``an opponent of
perestroika.''
   ``We found veritable confusion in the minds of many people _
workers, intellectuals and administrators alike,'' Gorbachev said.
``And let us be blunt, not only on the ground level, but also on
the top.''
   He did not make clear whether misunderstandings about his plans
to bring about a more democratic society and stronger economy
reached as high as the 13-man Politburo over which he presides.
   The Kremlin's No. 2 man, ideologist Yegor K. Ligachev, is
reputed to advocate a more conservative approach to resolving the
nation's problems than Gorbachev, although the extent of their
differences is known to few outside the ruling Politburo.
   The June 28 party conference is expected to change the face of
the party leadership and replace conservatives with more active
supporters of perestroika.
   ``It is necessary to rid socialism of everythintg
pseudosocialist, distorted and deformed in the period of the
personality cult,'' Gorbachev said, referring to the influences of
late dictator Josef V. Stalin, who ruled the country for 29 years
before his death in 1953.
   Gorbachev's call for electing reformists to the party conference
drew support from the editors and cultural leaders, according to
the Tass report.
   ``I would very much wish that the people who with their life and
deeds have proved their commitment to perestroika by all means
would get to the party conference and, on the contrary, that people
who oppose it, who hamper its progress would not be present at the
conference,'' said Kirill Lavrov, head of the Soviet Theatrical
Union.
   Prominent editors such as Sergei Zalygin of the journal Novy Mir
(New World) and Ivan Laptiev of the government newspaper Izvestia
said the reforms themselves have introduced new problems and a lot
of uncertainty.
   ``We should not think that those whom we describe as the mass of
the people _ the intellectuals, the working class and the peasantry
_ that all of them are delighted with perestroika,'' Zalygin said.
But he criticized the party and media for at times being poor
listeners and failing to heed public opinion.
   Laptiev also blamed the state-run press for some of the problems
encountered in the reform effort, and as an example pointed to the
media silence and distortion of events in Nagorno-Karabakh, a
region of Azerbaijan that ethnic Armenians want annexed to their
republic.

   Prime Minister Poul Schlueter
resigned today in a bid to form a new center-right coalition after
an inconclusive parliamentary election called over Denmark's
nuclear-arms policy and its allegiance to NATO.
   Danish radio said Schlueter submitted his resignation to Queen
Margrethe II at Amalienborg Palace and told her negotiations would
begin this afternoon.
   Tuesday's balloting ended in a stalemate in which neither major
bloc could form a majority government.
   Schlueter's outgoing minority, four-party coalition retained its
70 seats in the Folketing, the 179-member parliament. The socialist
opposition dropped two seats for a total of 79.
   The opposition Social Democrats, Denmark's largest party,
touched off the election by pushing through parliament a new
anti-nuclear resolution the government refused to implement because
of strong objections from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The resolution, designed to bolster Denmark's 1957 peacetime ban
on nuclear arms, calls for notifying visiting warships that such
weapons were not allowed in port. Unless the resolution is
overturned by the new parliament, the government will have to carry
it out, after the wording has been determined.
   Despite the vote, the government and the opposition both claimed
the outcome vindicated their position on the NATO issue.
   Schlueter, speaking during a televised post-election roundtable
discussion with other party leaders Tuesday, claimed that the four
coalition parties opposing the April 14 resolution came out best.
   ``The parties that voted for the Social Democratic resolution on
NATO policy were weakened,'' he said.
   Schlueter, who had called the election just eight months after
the last one, claimed the outcome would ease Denmark's crisis in
NATO. He had wanted voters to endorse the country's ``full
membership'' in the Western military alliance.
   But Social Democratic leader Svend Auken insisted ``there was
still a majority backing the resolution'' and said his party would
work for its implementation in the new parliament.
   In reply, Schlueter invited Auken to negotiate with government
parties ``a sensible solution'' to the issue.
   Until the opposition resolution was passed last month,
successive governments assumed that NATO allies abided by Denmark's
non-nuclear policy.
   The United States and Britain said the new measure, if
implemented, would jeopardize their plans to land troops in times
of crisis to reinforce Denmark, which controls the narrow access to
the Baltic Sea.
   They also said the measure threatened the solidarity of NATO and
was against their own policies, which forbid disclosure of which
ships carry nuclear arms.
   Final results showed 3,913,318 ballots cast for a turnout of
85.8 percent.
   Schlueter's Conservatives lost three seats, retaining 35.
   Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's Liberals, the senior
coalition partner, won 22 seats, three more than it had before.
   The coalition's nine-seat Center Democrats and four-seat
Christian People's Party were unchanged.
   Capturing seven additional seats to total 16, far-right Progress
Party was the biggest winner. Shunned by the mainstream parties for
its anti-immigration campaign, it is not expected to join a new
non-socialist coalition.
   The Social Democrats stopped their slide from the past two
elections by capturing 55 seats, a gain of one.
   The opposition Socialist People's Party dropped from 27 to 24
seats, while the far-left Common Course failed to poll the 2
percent necessary for representation.
   The swing party Social-Liberals held 10, a loss of one.
   Two semi-independent territories, the Faeroe Islands and
Greenland, each elect two representatives.
   A diplomat from a NATO country, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the nuclear issue ``couldn't come at a worse time.''
   The election came the day before U.S. Secretary of State George
P. Shultz was to meet Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
in Geneva to prepare for a Moscow summit in two weeks. A perception
that Denmark is wavering in its support of NATO could strenghthen
the Soviets' hand.

   Given the chance to be anything
they wanted for a day, many kids might choose to become president
of the United States, an astronaut or a performer.
   But not 4-year-old Jamie Dayhoff, who was recently given such an
opportunity by Dream Come True, an organization that gives
seriously and terminally ill children trips, gifts and celebrity
visits.
   Jamie, who has lymphatic cancer, always said he wanted to be a
soldier so when Army recruiters commissioned him a one-star general
Monday, he was ready.
   He stood tall as he was outfitted in a tailored battle dress
uniform, cap, general's star, a Combat Infantry Badge and dog tags.
   ``Doggie tags, woof, woof,'' Jamie said as the ID tags were
slipped over his head. ``Woo, they're cold.''
   He swore ``to support the Constitution ... against all enemies''
and saluted Lt. Col. Robert Thorlakson, commander of the Harrisburg
Battalion, U.S. Army Recruiting Command.
   ``I'm here to be a general, a GI Joe, a good guy,'' Jamie said
before asking Thorlakson's advice on what orders to give his
soldiers.
   ``Tell them to stand straight, march good, run fast and be good
boys,'' Thorlakson said.
   Despite being a rather young general, the Easton boy took to his
duties like an old pro.
   He fired two blank rounds from an M-16 rifle, carefully
retrieved the spent shells and stored them in his battle fatigues.
   ``I want to do it again,'' Jamie said after trying some
electronic rifle training. Each time Jamie pulled the trigger and
the electronic bullets hit their targets, he squealed in delight.
   ``He always enjoyed the GI Joe experience,'' said Charles
Dayhoff, Jamie's father. ``That was his dream, to eat with and take
a nap with soldiers, take a ride in a jeep and see how they train.''

<HEAD>Exiled Soviet Theater Director Returns As Guest Of Successor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Theater director Yuri Lyubimov has returned to the
Soviet Union after five years of exile that stemmed from his daring
presentations at the Taganka playhouse he founded.
   Alexander M. Yefimovich, deputy director of the theater,
confirmed that Lyubimov had returned to Moscow on Sunday as the
guest of Taganka director Nikolai Gubenko.
   Yefimovich said on Tuesday he had no information about
Lyubimov's plans. Gubenko and other theater officials did not
return repeated telephone calls.
   Lyubimov, 70, became an Israeli citizen this year. He lives in
Jerusalem with his wife, Katalin, and son, Peter, but spends much
of his time traveling.
   In July 1983 Lyubimov went to London to stage his avant-garde
version of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ``Crime and Punishment.''
   His family was given rare permission to accompany him and
cultural figures speculated that Lyubimov, who had spent much of
his career battling with Soviet censors, would not be allowed to
return.
   The director extended his stay in London, demanding assurances
that he would have artistic freedom if he returned to the Soviet
Union. In March 1984 he was dismissed from both the Taganka and the
Communist Party.
   When he left Moscow, Lyubimov's theater was working on a
production of ``Boris Godunov,'' about the troubled eight-year
reign of the czar who died in 1605.
   Yefimovich said early in April that Lyubimov intended to help
the Taganka company put the finishing touches on ``Boris Godunov''
and to take part in opening night in mid-May.
   On Tuesday, Yefimovich said the premiere now has been scheduled
for June and Lyubimov's visit is purely social.
   Soviet media hinted last month that Lyubimov wanted to visit his
homeland, but took no note of his arrival.
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, reported in March that
Lyubimov wished to return to the Soviet Union to work. It quoted
him as praising Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of
allowing freer artistic expression.
   In March 1987, Lyubimov and other exiled scientists and artists
wrote an open letter expressing doubts about Gorbachev's reform
program and calling the Soviet Union a ``gravely sick country.''
   It was printed by the weekly Moscow News and the writers were
criticized severely in other official media, which accused them of
wishing evil on their native land.

   Republican Gov. Arch Moore, seeking an
unprecedented fourth term, beat a strong primary challenge and will
face Democratic political novice Gaston Caperton in November.
   Moore edged Republican challenger John Raese, while Caperton
easily defeated former House of Delegates Speaker Clyde See in
Tuesday's primary election.
   In non-binding presidential preference races, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis defeated Jesse Jackson, while Vice President George
Bush won the GOP race.
   With 2,079 of 2,151 precincts reporting, or 97 percent, Dukakis
had 243,906 votes, or 79 percent, while Jackson had 43,771 votes,
or 14 percent. In the Republican presidential race, with 2,028
precincts, or 94 percent, reporting, Bush had 104,019 votes, or 90
percent.
   U.S. Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd will face Republican
state Sen. Jay Wolfe in the November general election.
   With 2,078 precincts, or 97 percent, reporting, Byrd, who is
seeking his sixth term, gained 237,037 votes, or 80 percent;
Huntington moving company owner Bob Myers had 57,330 votes, or 20
percent.
   With 2,028 precincts, or 94 percent, reporting, Wolfe won 75,736
votes, ort 70 percent; welfare recipient Bernie Lumbert had 32,491
votes, or 30 percent.
   Byrd promised that, if re-elected, he will step down as majority
leader to become Senate Appropriations Committee chairman so that
he can secure funds and advance programs important to the state.
   The veteran Moore, 65, overcame a late campaign furor over
reports he tried to buy his way onto a political slate for $12,000
in 1972 and held off Raese in the toughest primary he ever faced.
   With more than 2,051 precincts, or 95 percent, reporting early
today, Moore had 73,503 votes, or 53 percent, to Raese's 64,897, or
47 percent.
   Caperton, 48, was a political unknown as the primary season
began, but he poured more than $1.8 million into his successful
attempt to wrest the nomination from See, the Democrats' 1984
nominee.
   With 2,058 precincts, or 96 percent, reporting, Caperton had
122,276 votes, or 38 percent, to See's 87,753, or 27 percent.
Caperton's victory culminated the most expensive primary campaign
ever by a single West Virginia candidate; five other candidates
split the rest of the vote.
   No allegations of voter fraud were lodged in Mingo County, where
Tuesday saw where Tuesday's was the first election since a grand
jury indicted 16 Mingo County politicians on election law charges
as part of a state and federal investigation into political
corruption.

   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said today the Senate could ratify the
U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms agreement in time for the upcoming Moscow
summit if Secretary of State George Shultz works out disputes in
talks this week with the Soviets.
   ``I think there's still time to get the consent of the Senate to
ratification prior to the summit. But these matters have to be
dealt with,'' the Georgia Democrat said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America.''
   Senate leaders said this week consideration of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty would be delayed
indefinitely because of a dispute between the superpowers over
verification of settlement accords.
   The dispute has almost dashed hopes the INF treaty would be
ratified by the time President Reagan travels to Moscow for the May
29-June 2 summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Shultz was in Geneva today for a long-planned meeting with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that has taken on
greater importance because of the verification issue.
   Nunn said if the impasse is not resolved, the treaty could
languish in the Senate well after the summit.
   ``Even though I can't visualize these matters not being worked
out, it is possible,'' said Nunn. ``Unless they are worked out, I
think we'll have a long delay and no ratification of the treaty
anytime soon.''
   Nunn said that although the verification provisions under
dispute are technical issues, enough Democrats and Republicans in
the Senate are concerned to keep the treaty on hold.
   ``It is a serious problem because on-site verification goes to
the heart not just of this treaty, in terms of verifying, but also
future treaties,'' he said.
   ``Frankly, the military significance of this treaty is marginal
at best,'' Nunn said. ``But the symbolic and precedent kind of
example here is very important, so we've got to clear these matters
up.''
   Nunn also raised the possibility that the dispute over
provisions signed by negotiators in December could reflect
disagreements among Soviet officials.
   ``It may be that this is not the top leadership at all, but
rather people who lost their points in the negotiation and now are
trying to restore those points through obstruction in
implementation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Government Party Expels Durban Mayor For Opposing Segregated
Beaches</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The mayor of Durban said today
that the governing National Party suspended him because he opposes
whites-only beaches.
   Henry Klotz, who was elected mayor of South Africa's third
largest city last September, said he would rather be ousted from
the party than retract his support for integration of the entire
Durban beachfront.
   ``The policy of opening facilities must be pursued and I shall
support it absolutely,'' Klotz said in a statement. ``If this means
my explusion from the National Party, then so be it.''
   Durban, along with Cape Town, is one of South Africa's two
largest tourist destinations, and its Indian Ocean beachfront is
lined with resort hotels.
   Klotz received a letter from the Natal Province branch of the
party on Tuesday saying he was being suspended for disloyalty
because he refused to endorse President P.W. Botha's policy on
segregated beaches.
   Botha has supported the integration of some beaches but says
other beaches should remain exclusively for whites. Durban's
beaches reflect this policy _ most areas have been opened to all
races but one prime section called South Beach remains whites-only.
   Klotz said he formerly opposed integration of beaches but now
felt this step was essential ``if we are to succeed in becoming a
truly 21st century, cosmopolitan city.''
   ``All beaches are the property of all people of Durban in
partnership with visitors from South Africa and other countries,''
he said. ``I am duty-bound to act in the interests of all the
citizens of this fair city and I shall do so for as long as I am
able.''
   The far-right Conservative Party, the largest white opposition
party, won three parliamentary by-elections in March with a
campaign platform opposing integrated beaches. Klotz said he did
not believe the issue was a key factor in the by-elections, which
were held in districts far from the coast.
   Last week, a court in Port Elizabeth ruled that the city council
had acted without proper authority in 1966 when it proclaimed the
local beaches segregated. The government promptly appealed the
ruling and said the beaches would remain segregated until the
appeal process was completed.

<HEAD>Cheever's Widow Trying To Stop New Book</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The widow of Pulitzer Prize-winning author John
Cheever is suing a small Chicago publishing house to halt
publication of a new book of short stories due out in September,
her attorney said.
   ``The Uncollected Short Stories of John Cheever'' is set to be
published by Academy Chicago, which is primarily known for
importing British mystery novels.
   ``Mrs. Cheever objects to the very cavalier treatment she has
been given by this publishing company and the cavalier treatment to
Mr. Cheever's work,'' her attorney, Martin Garbus, said Tuesday.
   The suit will seek to have the contract with Academy declared
invalid because the publisher failed to consult Mrs. Cheever about
the book's content as promised, Garbus said. He said the suit would
likely be filed by week's end in either federal or state court in
Manhattan.
   Mrs. Cheever particularly objected to a forward by Scott
Donaldson, professor of literature at the College of William & Mary
and author of a Cheever biography to be published in June by Random
House.
   Mrs. Cheever said Donaldson was wrong to say that her husband's
early works were left out because he ``repudiated his
apprenticeship and formative years.''
   She said Cheever did not want them used in a 1978 collection and
would not want them used now because they were ``embarrassingly
immature.''
   Mrs. Cheever also objects to Donaldson's interpretation that
Cheever's works were a personal history.
   The 550-page Academy book collects 68 Cheever stories written
for magazines between 1931 and 1981.
   Academy has already brought the matter before the Circuit Court
of Cook County in Chicago to have the contract declared valid. The
company wants the court to enjoin Mrs. Cheever's from interfering
with publication.
   The author, who published his first short story when he was 17,
died in July 1982 at age 70. He won the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for
``The Stories of John Cheever,'' a collection of short fiction
works.
   Other Cheever works include ``The Wapshot Chronicle'' and
``Falconer.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Michel Rocard appointed a longtime aide as
his chief of staff today and consulted with senior Socialists on
choosing Cabinet ministers in his new government.
   President Francois Mitterrand, re-elected on Sunday, appointed
Rocard on Tuesday to succeed conservative Jacques Chirac.
   Rocard, long a rival to Mitterrand within the Socialist Party,
said he would not delay naming his Cabinet ministers, but it was
not clear how soon the appointments would come.
   The first move by the 57-year-old premier was to name Jean Paul
Huchon his chief of staff. Huchon was chief of staff to Rocard when
he was planning minister, then agriculture minister, in Socialist
governments from 1981-85.
   He is first deputy mayor of Conflans St. Honorine, the
working-class town in the Paris suburbs where Rocard has been mayor
since 1977.
   It is common in France for senior national officials to keep
their mayoral posts. Chirac, who was premier for two years, has
been mayor of Paris for more than a decade.
   Mitterrand, 71, was re-elected to a seven-year term in a
landslide victory over Chirac on Sunday. But the success of a new
government will depend largely on whether the Socialists gain the
confidence of a broad spectrum of voters _ and backing from
centrist politicans.
   Chirac's center-right coalition still controls the 577-seat
National Assembly, marking the first time in the 30 years of the
French Fifth Republic that a government must face a hostile
Parliament.
   Commentary on Rocard's appointment was largely favorable in
French newspapers, even those that traditionally support rightist
policies.
   The conservative daily Le Figaro noted that Rocard favored a
free-market economy and said he had ``shown his independent
spirit'' by bucking official Socialist positions in the past.
   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a prominent centrist
member of the assembly, said on Tuesday that he was ``waiting for a
gesture toward a united France'' in the composition of Rocard's
Cabinet.
   Rocard, 57, told reporters Tuesday that he would keep in mind
French people's concerns ``for their future, for their jobs, for
their education, for their security.''
   He must assemble a government which reflects the Socialists'
swing to the center and which can try to work with the conservative
parliamentary majority.
   Mitterrand says he will not automatically dissolve the assembly
to try to gain a leftist majority, choosing to try for success with
the present system. He also says the new government will include
non-Socialists.
   The new government is expected to profit from an increasingly
divided right wing, ranging from centrists to ultraright.
   Presenting himself as France's ``unifier,'' Mitterrand wooed
over some centrist politicians upset with Chirac's attempt to
accommodate the growing far-right movement.
   Rocard, a self-described ``free enterprise leftist,'' was
prepared to run for the presidency this year until Mitterrand
declared his candidacy.
   Polls usually rate him as one of France's most popular
politicans. A non-doctrinaire Socialist, he symbolizes the
president's effort for a policy of ``enlargement'' beyond the
Socialist ranks.
   The debonair, 5-foot-7 Rocard is known for his independent and
outspoken views. He resigned as agriculture minister in 1985
because he objected to a new system of proportional voting
instituted by the Socialists.
   The president bucked pressure in affirming that he will not
immediately dissolve the National Assembly, in which the Socialists
hold 211 seats.
   Mitterrand is being urged to take advantage of the victory
momentum and move quickly with changes.
   The president, stressing the new political configuration, has
made few concrete proposals for change.
   One of the few significant programs Mitterrand says he intends
to pursue is re-establishing the Socialist wealth tax abolished by
Chirac in 1986. He wants the proceeds to fund a minimum guaranteed
income.
   Mitterrand also says he will not continue the Chirac
government's privatization of state-owned companies.

<BYLINE>Heart Transplant Recipients Risk Mood Troubles, Family Distress,
Study Says

   A new study of heart transplant recipients has
found that half suffered mood disturbances after the operation and
many faced family problems related to the surgery and recovery.
   The results indicate psychiatrists must work to help recipients
get the most out of life after transplants, researchers said
Tuesday.
   Side effects of post-transplant medications cause some of the
psychological problems, said Peter Shapiro, assistant clinical
professor of psychiatry at the Columbia University College of
Physicians and Surgeons in New York.
   He and colleague Donald Kornfeld did the work, which Shapiro
presented Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric
Association.
   ``This is a very important paper. It's really pace-setting and
pace-making,'' said Norman B. Levy of the New York Medical College
at Valhalla, an authority on psychiatric aspects of transplants.
   The research was done with two groups of recipients. One group
of 30 was interviewed at up to a year after surgery, while another
43 were studied up to six years after the transplant.
   Overall, 37 of the 73 recipients had experienced some kind of
mood disturbances following the surgery. Problems ranged from
demoralization and difficulty adjusting to post-transplant life to
four cases of major depression.
   Fifteen of the 37 patients reported a period of mood swings,
irritability and argumentativeness, often with some mild mania.
Symptoms began in the first few weeks after transplantation and
gradually receded as dosages of drugs to prevent organ rejection
were tapered off.
   Twenty-two patients reported sexual problems as a side effect of
anti-rejection drugs.
   Twelve patients said they had experienced family or marital
troubles, such as children running away from home or picking fights
with their parents.
   The second problem was especially common with teenage sons who
resented the father's trying to re-assert a role of disciplinarian
now that the disabling heart condition was over, Shapiro said.
   Some problems result from the use of the anti-rejection drug
cyclosporine, which is inconvenient to administer and accompanied
by such side effects as headache, burning pains and interference
with sexual performance, researchers said in a written version of
the report.
   ``Impotence and fearful avoidance of sexual intercourse lead
many patients to feel guilt and disappointment, which is expressed
in fighting or creating psychological distance from the partner,''
they said.
   ``These problems tend to work out over the course of 12 to 18
months.''
   Sixteen patients also complained of decreased memory.

<TEXT>
   Burmese soldiers have killed, raped and
tortured members of ethnic minorities in the government's fight to
crush rebel movements, the human rights group Amnesty International
said today.
   The London-based organization said evidence shows ``a consistent
pattern of gross violations of human rights'' by the Burmese army.
In a 71-page report, it described the fates of nearly 200 alleged
victims.
   Among cases listed were those of an 11-year-old girl and her
mother raped by soldiers, a 22-year-old student who may have been
shot ``because he looked different'' and an illiterate rice farmer
whose flesh was peeled from the bone during interrogation.
   An appendix gave details of apparent ``extrajudicial
executions'' of 60 members of the Karen minority. Only one was said
to have been an active rebel.
   The Amnesty report said insurgents also have killed civilians,
but said the government was not justified in doing the same.
   Amnesty International investigates human rights violations
around the world. It said the information on Burma came from
civilians of the Karen, Mon and Kachin ethnic groups who fled the
country and were interviewed in Thailand last November.
   Its report noted that human rights investigators have not been
allowed into Burma, and that Burma sent a letter to the United
Nations in February denying similar allegations.
   Officials in Rangoon, the Burmese capital, said they had no
knowledge of the allegations. Burmese officials almost never make
statements to journalists on sensitive questions.
   Gen. Ne Win's military government has ruled the country for 26
years, espousing a mix of socialism and Buddhism.
   In the last several years, his army has expanded its campaign
against insurgents of the Karen, Mon, Kachin and other minorities
who control large areas along the frontiers, especially in the
north and west.
   Amnesty's report said insurgents had bombed schools, markets and
other civilian targets, but it gave no details. Rebel groups have
denied involvement in some of those attacks.
   ``Killings or other crimes by opposition groups can never be
used to justify unlawful killings or torture by members of the
security forces,'' Amnesty said. ``The security forces are
entrusted with protecting citizens and upholding and defending the
legal system.
   Torture described by those interviewed included burning with
cigars, slashing with knives, near-strangulation and ``shin
rolling'' _ rolling large bamboo poles over the shins until the
skin peels off and bones are exposed.
   Villagers forced to work as porters or guides for the army have
been beaten to death or forced to walk through minefields ahead of
soldiers, the report said.
   Burmese law provides normal channels for the arrest and
prosecution of those suspected of rebellion, as well as human
rights safeguards, ``yet virtually none of the refugees interviewed
knew of any instance in which this legislation had been invoked,''
it said.
   A 22-year-old victim's brother told Amnesty investigators:
``They could easily have taken him away for questioning, but
instead they simply killed him.
   ``My brother had been to school for eight years. He was tidy and
well-dressed. He had a fancy haircut. I think that maybe they shot
him because he looked different.''
   The U.S. State Department said in a recent report that ``the
serious human rights problems which persist in Burma are the result
of an authoritarian government and ruling party which do not
guarantee basic rights or the application of an impartial rule of
law.''

Testing</HEAD>

   Officials will seek an immediate review of drug
and alcohol testing practices on local railways following the
discovery that five employees involved in a fatal commuter train
crash last month had used drugs.
   The Federal Railroad Administration released test results
Tuesday showing that an engineer killed in the April 6 Metro-North
train crash had marijuana in his system, and that a dispatcher's
urine contained morphine and codeine.
   ``This insanity has got to stop,'' John Riley, head of the FRA,
said.
   Discovery of the drug traces also prompted Riley to reissue his
call for random testing of rail workers.
   In the last 16 months, Riley noted, there has been a rail
accident every 10 days somewhere in the nation in which at least
one employee tested positive for drugs. The dead or injured in
these accidents number 370, he said.
   Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman Robert R. Kiley
called for an immediate review of testing practices at Metro-North,
the Long Island Rail Road and the city's Transit Authority.
Metro-North serves Westchester County, north of the city, and
Fairfield County, Conn.
   In the Metro-North crash, morphine traces found in dispatcher
Thomas Furlong's urine were ``comparable to those which could be
expected following heroin use,'' said Lou Brott, an FRA spokesman.
   Engineer Raymond Hunter was killed when his empty train slammed
into the rear of another empty commuter train. He tested positive
for marijuana in his urine and his blood, the FRA said.
   Metro-North officials have blamed Hunter, 42, for failing to
activate an automatic safety system that could have prevented the
collision. They also said the train appeared to be traveling well
over the 15 mph speed limit.
   Three other railroad employees who controlled train movements
also had controlled substances in their systems, the FRA said.
   The three, who worked at a station near the crash site, have
been absolved of responsibility for the crash, according to Susan
Gilbert, a Metro-North spokeswoman. Along with Furlong, who worked
in Manhattan, they were suspended after the accident and now face
disciplinary hearings.
   Metro-North employees found to have used drugs on the job must
enter a substance abuse program or face dismissal. They also are
subject to spot drug testing while in the program.
   Riley declined to say whether the tests indicated drugs might
have affected the men's performances. A final report on the
accident, to be released in about two months, will determine what
role drug use played in the crash, he said.
   The tests, he said, did not indicate how recently the workers
might have used the drugs.

   A jury took only seven hours to weigh 500
pieces of evidence and testimony from 91 witnesses, then found a
man guilty of killing five hikers in a series of ``trailside
slayings'' that terrorized Northern California parks.
   The Superior Court jury that convicted David J. Carpenter on
Tuesday will return next week to begin for the penalty phase to
determine whether the he should be executed or spend the rest of
his life in prison.
   Carpenter, 58, of San Francisco, was convicted of first-degree
murder with special circumstances in the 1980 killings of five
hikers in two Marin County parks, part of a series of crimes dubbed
the ``trailside slayings'' eight years ago.
   After four months of hearing evidence, the jury returned the
verdict against Carpenter at the end of its second day of
deliberations. Attorneys on both sides were surprised by the quick
decision.
   ``It certainly seems to suggest they didn't buy anything the
defense presented,'' said Marin County Deputy District Attorney
John Posey, who portrayed Carpenter in closing arguments as a
cold-blooded killer whose ``ultimate goal'' was to commit murder
and rape and get away with it.
   ``We were much more hopeful than this,'' said defense attorney
Frank Cox. ``It came as a surprise to have an unfavorable verdict
as fast as this.''
   Defense attorneys argued Carpenter deserved acquittal because of
``serious doubts'' created by what they termed questionable police
procedures and inconsistencies in the testimony of witnesses.
   Carpenter, who already has been sentenced to the gas chamber for
two related killings in Santa Cruz parks, sat expressionless as
Judge Herbert B. Hoffman read the verdict.
   Carpenter spent eight days on the stand testifying in his own
defense, alleging he was miles away from the murder sites on the
days of the killings at Point Reyes National Seashore and Mount
Tamalpais State Park.
   He was convicted of murdering Richard Stowers, 19, of Petaluma;
Cynthia Moreland, 18, of Cotati; Anne Alderson, 26, of San Rafael;
Diane O'Connell, 22, of San Jose, and Shauna May, 23, of San
Francisco.
   Carpenter was also convicted of raping two of his Marin victims
and trying to rape a third.
   Defense attorneys said they would spend the rest of the week
developing a strategy for the penalty hearing scheduled to begin
Tuesday.
   Carpenter's automatic appeal in the Santa Cruz case is pending
before the state Supreme Court.

   Italy's highest court upheld the convictions and
prison sentences of seven Palestinians who conceived and carried
out the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship.
   After a three-hour hearing, the Court of Cassation on Tuesday
rejected appeals by defendants, including fugitive Palestinian
leader Mohammed Abbas. The court thus let stand the May 23, 1987,
convictions and sentences decided by an appeals court in Genoa, the
port city where the ill-fated Mediterranean cruise began.
   An elderly, wheelchair-bound New Yorker, Leon Klinghoffer, was
shot to death and his body was thrown into the sea during the
ordeal.
   Tuesday's ruling cleared the way for a separate civil action by
relatives of Klinghoffer to seek damages. Earlier rulings said the
two daughters of Klinghoffer were entitled to compensation.
   In addition to Abbas, head of the Palestine Liberation Front,
the Court of Cassation upheld life sentences for two other fugitive
group leaders: Ozzuddin Badrakkam, described as military chief; and
Ziad El Omar, another organization official. The 7-year term of
Abdulrahim Khaled, a colonel in the front, was also upheld.
   They were accused of helping to organize the hijacking.
   Three hijackers covered by the Cassation ruling are in Italian
custody. They include Magied Molqi, leader of the hijackers and
described as the man who shot Klinghoffer, sentenced to 30 years;
and two other hijackers, Ibrahim Fatayer Abdelatif and Ahmad
Marrouf Assadi, sentenced to nearly 25 years and nearly 16 years.
   Assadi had cooperated with investigators.
   A fourth hijacker, Bassam Asker, was convicted in separate
trials in juvenile court because he was a minor at the time of the
crime.
   The commandeered Achille Lauro eventually docked at an Egyptian
port, where passengers and hijackers got off after officials
negotiated with the pirates.
   Italian police took custody of the four hijackers after U.S.
warplanes intercepted the Egyptian plane that was taking them to
Tunisia and forced the aircraft to land in Sicily.
   Also aboard the plane were Abbas and Badrakkam, but Italian
officials later released them despite U.S. protests, saying there
was no evidence to hold them. Prosecutors later indicted them for
trial.

   A new study suggests that eating beef may not be
as bad for the heart as experts had once assumed because one of its
major forms of saturated fat lowers cholesterol.
   Despite their findings, however, the study's authors recommended
that people stick to widely accepted dietary guidelines and keep
their fat intake as low as possible.
   The study, conducted by Drs. Scott M. Grundy and Andrea
Bonanome, found that stearic acid, one of the main components of
saturated fat in the diet, appears to lower the body's cholesterol
levels.
   Until now, many experts assumed that all kinds of saturated fat,
including those containing stearic acid, were bad for the heart
because they promote clogging deposits of cholesterol.
   Grundy said that if people eat moderate portions of lean beef,
``it should not be feared as a cholesterol-raising food.''
   The research, conducted at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center at Dallas, was scheduled to be published in
Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Irwin H. Rosenberg and Ernst
J. Schaefer of the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at
Tufts University in Boston praised the work. They said it
``demonstrates convincingly'' that a diet high in stearic acid does
not raise blood cholesterol.
   But they were also cautious in interpreting the findings,
concluding, ``This study should not change our chief dietary
message to the American people.''
   Beef contains two major forms of saturated fat _ stearic acid
and palmitic acid. And while stearic acid lowers cholesterol,
palmitic acid raises it significantly.
   Stearic acid is found in varying amounts in many other foods,
too, including chicken and vegetables.
   Saturated fats are hard at room temperature, while
polyunsaturated and monosaturated fats, which come largely from
vegetables, are liquid.
   The researchers said the food industry may be able to use
stearic acid to make margarine that is more like butter, as well as
a cholesterol-lowering form of shortening for cooking.
   The study was based on 11 men who consumed three liquid diets
that were high in either stearic acid, palmitic acid or oleic acid,
a monosaturated fat that also lowers cholesterol.

<HEAD>Suspect in U.S. Mass Murder Case Wins Five-Month Extradition Delay
^EDS: Ng is cq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Ng, wanted in connection with
the slayings of 12 people in California, has won a five-month delay
in his Canadian extradition hearing.
   On Tuesday, a judge in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench
granted the delay until Oct. 17 at the request of defense lawyer
Donald MacLeod.
   Ng, a 27-year-old former U.S. marine, listened intently to three
hours of procedural arguments but displayed no emotion. Dressed in
blue jeans and a plaid shirt, he was shackled at the wrists and
ankles.
   A dozen police officers provided tight security, reporters and
spectators were checked with metal detectors and a police dog was
at the courtroom entrance.
   Ng faces 25 criminal charges in the United States, including 12
of capital murder. Eleven of the homicide charges involve 1985
sex-torture killings at a rural cabin in Calaveras County, east of
San Francisco. The other concerns the 1984 slaying of San Francisco
disc jockey Donald Guiletti.
   U.S. authorities applied for Ng's extradition in February 1987.
His lawyers have said they will fight his return to the United
States unless they are convinced he won't face the death penalty in
California if convicted.
   When the Canadian Parliament banned capital punishment in 1976,
the government signed an extradition treaty which allows it to
refuse to extradite fugitives who may face the death penalty in the
United States. However, the federal justice minister can waive that
right.
   Ng is serving a 4{-year sentence at the federal penitentiary in
Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, for armed robbery, aggravated assault
and unlawful use of a firearm. He was convicted in December 1985
after a shoplifting attempt at a Calgary department store during
which Ng shot a security guard in the hand.

<HEAD>Regan Says Bush Should Run on Reagan's Economic Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House chief of staff Donald T.
Regan today urged likely Republican nominee George Bush to use
President Reagan's economic record as his platform in the race for
the presidency.
   ``I certainly make the case for Reaganomics and the Reagan
record in my book,'' Regan said on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' show,
referring to his recently-released memoir, ``For the Record.''
``And if George Bush chooses to run on the Reagan record, I think
he'll be running on a very strong platform.''
   The vice president has a mathematical lock on the nomination and
is expected to pick up Reagan's endorsement later today.
   Regan, whose behind-the-scenes book has angered the Reagans for
its descriptions of a disengaged president influenced by a first
lady motivated by astrology, said he often failed to get Reagan to
focus on critical economic issues.
   As Treasury secretary, Regan said he was ``flying by the seat of
my pants.''
   ``The president never told me what he believed or what he wanted
to accomplish in the field of economics. I had to figure these
things out like any other American, by studying his speeches and
reading the newspapers,'' Regan writes.
   While crediting Reagan with creating ``an atmosphere of
confidence,'' that helped in the recovery from 1981-82 recession,
Regan said, ``the president himself had very little to do with the
invention and the implementation of the policies'' that came to be
called ``Reaganomics.''
   Nevertheless, Regan said today that Reaganomics deserves high
marks.
   ``I think Reaganomics has proven successful. We've had 5{ years
of expansion ... and the possibility of more months to come in
that,'' he said.
   ``We've had a change in morale in the American people over the
last few years. Remember that ... the malaise and all that sort of
thing, that's what Reagan inherited and yet as he leaves office we
feel a lot better about ourselves. Internationally, I think we're
better off too,'' he said.

   A judge, ignoring a plea for mercy
by the victim's widow, sentenced two members of the Billionaire
Boys Club to life in prison without parole for murdering one
defendant's father.
   Sentenced Tuesday were Arben Dosti and Reza Eslaminia, the
26-year-old son of Hedayat Eslaminia, who was kidnapped and
suffocated in a steamer trunk in July 1984.
   San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Robert D. Miller sentenced
Eslaminia and Dosti, 26, despite Eslaminia's mothers' plea for
leniency.
   ``I believe Reza is innocent,'' Mina Hakimi, widow of the
victim, told the judge in broken English. The elder Eslaminia had
at one time been an adviser to the Shah of Iran.
   ``Your crime involved a great deal of thought, planning and
execution,'' the judge said. ``For that reason, I'm sentencing you
to life without possibility of parole.''
   Eslaminia's attorney, Gary Merritt, said his client was not
present during the kidnapping or death of his father and was only
involved in conspiracy to kidnap.
   Assistant state Attorney General John Vance noted that the jury
had found Eslaminia guilty of murder after a trial of about 50 days.
   The two were convicted in January of murder, kidnapping for
extortion and conspiracy in the plot to kidnap the elder Eslaminia
for ransom, then kill him. The victim suffocated, apparently
accidentally, inside the steamer trunk hours after being kidnapped
from his condominium in July 1984.
   Authorities had originally suspected that the elder Eslaminia, a
former Iranian Parliament member and Cabinet member under the Shah,
had been killed by a hit squad sent by the Iranian revolutionary
government that deposed the Shah in 1979.
   Eslaminia was active in the movement against Iran's leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Dosti and Eslaminia were members of the BBC, which was founded
by Joe Hunt in 1983 as a business fraternity of bright young men
from some of Southern California's wealthiest families.
   Hunt, 27, was sentenced last July 6 to life in prison without
parole in the slaying of Ronald Levin, who vanished in the summer
of 1984 and whose body was never found.

   Share prices were sharply lower at midday today
with the market unnerved after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said a rise in interest rates of the major world economies
was possible.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 30.2
points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,762.4 by 12:15 p.m., its lowest level
so far in the session.
   Volume was a relatively strong 355.7 million shares compared
with 233.5 million shares at the same time on Tuesday.
   Lawson's comment, published in European editions of the Wall
Street Journal, that a worldwide rise in interest rates could be in
the cards sent share prices plunging, dealers said.
   Lawson said a coordinated effort by West Germany, Japan and
other leading nations to hike interest rates ``is certainly
possible'' following the Federal Reserve's increase in short-term
rates to curb U.S. inflation.
   The equity market was shaken by the idea that the leading
economic nations could join in a bid to choke off inflationary
pressures by pushing up the cost of borrowing.
   The Lawson comment was acting as ``a dark cloud over the entire
market,'' one equity salesman said.
   Some favorable earnings results by major U.K. companies were
ignored by the market, dealers said, as players chose to focus on
Lawson's remark.

   Ralph Nader discussed consumer fraud, Dear Abby
read strange letters, and sex therapist Ruth Westheimer _ well, you
know what she talked about _ at the American Association of Retired
Persons' biennial convention.
   An estimated 30,000 members of the AARP, an advocacy group for
Americans age 50 and older, descended on the Cobo Conference and
Exhibition Center Tuesday to sample a smorgasbord of expert advice
and senior-centered sales pitches.
   During the convention, delegates will also vote on a number of
resolutions that are not binding on the AARP's 3,600 local
chapters. The organization, which claims membership of 28 million,
will issue no political endorsements.
   But AARP planned a session today that could determine the thrust
of its formidable lobbying muscle in Washington on Social Security
and related issues.
   The program was to begin with videotaped statements from the
remaining presidential candidates. Afterward, U.S. Rep. Sander
Levin of Michigan was to explain the Democratic Party's plans, and
John Svahn, former commissioner of the Social Security
Administration, was to speak for the Republican Party.
   Also scheduled for today were speeches by outgoing AARP
president John Denning and his successor, Louise Crooks; television
journalist Ed Bradley; political humorist Art Buchwald and
economist Jane Bryant Quinn.
   Peace Corps Director Loret Ruppe delivered Tuesday's keynote
speech, detailing opportunities for senior citizens in the
volunteer organization.
   ``Age is respected in countries where we work,'' she said,
adding that senior citizens' biggest problems are health and
difficulty in learning a foreign language.
   The number of senior citizens in the Peace Corps has risen from
6 percent in 1961 to 12 percent now, said Ruppe.
   Nader told his audience how to watch out for fraud in prosthetic
devices, telephone solicitations, prepared food and
pharmaceuticals. Westheimer discussed sexuality among seniors, and
Abigail Van Buren read some letters she's received for her Dear
Abby advice column, including one from a woman who wanted a sewing
machine for her 45th anniversary but instead got a cemetery plot
from her husband.
   But the celebrity speakers had to compete for attention with
commercial exhibits ranging from motor homes and vacation spots to
exercise devices and foot medications.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said Sophie Grudzinski of Hobart, Ind. ``All
these freebies, we just can't pass it up. ... ``Dr. Ruth, that's
one thing we do not need,'' she said, without elaborating.

<HEAD>Federal Study: Fewer Defects In Condoms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer defective condoms are showing up
on the U.S. market, although more than 33 million condoms were
recalled or rejected in the last year, a federal study says.
   Only about four in every 1,000 domestic condoms were deemed
defective, an improvement from a 4.8 defective rate last year, said
Dr. Doyle C. Smith of the Food and Drug Administration, which
tested 115,000 condoms for such problems as pinholes and tears.
   Imported condoms proved more risky, with a defective rate of 6.5
per 1,000, which was still a drop from last year's rate of 7.3, he
said.
   The FDA testing that ended last month resulted in more than 30
million imported condoms being kept from distribution and 3 million
domestic condoms taken off the shelves in 19 recalls, according to
the study.
   ``Although the level of defects in condoms has dropped, there is
a need to continually improve the defective rate,'' Smith said,
adding that the FDA will continue to make random tests.
   The FDA issued its report Tuesday at the American Society for
Microbiology annual meeting, where hundreds from academia,
government and industry exchanged ideas on topics ranging from the
spread of disease to how microorganisms can help control acid rain.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and other health professionals
have said condoms and mutually faithful monogamous relationships
remain the best weapons to prevent the spread of AIDS and other
sexually transmitted diseases.

<HEAD>Nursing Home's English-Only Policy Upsets Hispanic Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanic workers at a nursing home have
been told they can no longer speak their native tongue on the job,
an order some of the workers have challenged as discriminatory.
   ``I continue to speak Spanish,'' said Doris Leal, a nurses' aide
at Nutmeg Pavilion Healthcare. ``Maybe I'm going to be fired, but
I'm going to fight for my rights.''
   ``I don't feel comfortable in my job anymore,'' said Maria
Rivera, another aide at Nutmeg. ``I don't feel free when I'm
working, so it's very difficult to do the job.''
   Officials outlined the policy to employees at a staff meeting
last week, according to staff members quoted in today's editions of
The Day newspaper of New London. The policy requires that employees
speak English in all areas except the coffee lounge during working
hours.
   James O'Kane, administrator of the facility, defended the policy
and said the workers have not filed any formal protest.
   ``On the floor we're to communicate with patients and other
staff to the utmost,'' O'Kane said. ``If I don't know what you're
talking about, it's difficult to be a team.''
   O'Kane said it makes English-speaking patients uncomfortable
when they cannot understand the health-care workers. ``Whether it's
Spanish or German or Greek or Gaelic is beside the point,'' O'Kane
said.
   Louis J. Halpryn, director of the Connecticut Nursing Home
Association, said he has not heard of any similar policies at other
nursing homes.
   Arvid J. Anderson, vice president of Lawrence and Memorial
Hospital in New London, said most of L&M's employees speak English
on the job, ``but we don't have any policy that says they have to.''
   Anderson said he values multilingual employees who can interpret
for non-English speaking patients, and he often hears employees
speaking in another language in the patient care areas, which he
has no objections to.
   Mrs. Leal said the policy affects seven nurses that she knows of.
   ``There is no law I know of in the United States that says you
can only speak English,'' she said. ``Maybe I'm wrong, but I think
it's discrimination.''
   The nurses said they have complained to the state Commission on
Human Rights and Opportunities, but have been told that panel
cannot help them.

<HEAD>More Older Minorities in High School, Census Bureau Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Census Bureau says that 11 percent of
black and Hispanic Americans aged 18 to 21 are still in high
school, double the rate for whites.
   The agency, in a report released Tuesday, also found that 25
percent of the young blacks and 22 percent of the Hispanics in that
age group were enrolled in college, compared with 39 percent of
their white peers.
   The proportion of young blacks dropping out of high school
plummeted from 27 percent in 1975 to 17 percent in 1985, while the
proportion who were graduated from high school rose from 61 percent
to 71 percent.
   But the proportion enrolled in college stayed the same _ 25
percent, said the Census Bureau report, ``School Enrollment: Social
and Economic Characteristics of Students.''
   Forty-seven percent of the blacks in the 18-21 age group were
high school graduates not enrolled in college, up from 36 percent
in 1975.
   Eleven percent of blacks were still in high school in 1985, down
from 12.5 percent in 1975.
   Among Hispanics, the proportion enrolled in college dropped over
the decade from 24 percent to 22 percent; the proportion of high
school graduates not enrolled in college rose from 33 percent to 38
percent; the proportion of dropouts fell from 31 to 29 percent; and
the proportion still in high school dipped from 12 percent to 11
percent.
   Among whites, the proportion enrolled in college grew from 35
percent to 39 percent; the proportion of high school graduates not
enrolled in college dropped from 46 percent to 42.5 percent; the
proportion of dropouts fell from 15 percent to 14 percent; and
those still in high school grew slightly, from 4.7 percent to 5.1
percent.
   Other Census Bureau reports have previously noted a sharp spurt
in black college enrollments before 1975, and a drop since then in
the proportion of black graduates advancing to college.

   The Coast Guard Academy's assistant
superintendent pleaded innocent to a charge of sixth-degree larceny
after an incident at a department store.
   Capt. W.S. Rich, who was suspended from his post pending the
outcome of the case, entered the plea Tuesday in New London
Superior Court and asked for a jury trial on the misdemeanor charge.
   Rich, 50, was arrested April 26 after a Bradlees security guard
accused him of removing a bag of merchandise from the department
store, Groton police said.
   Rich, who requested the suspension, has said the bag, which
contained several small items, was in a shopping cart between
double doors at the entrance and that it appeared to have been paid
for and abandoned.
   He said he had moved the cart, first inside, then outside the
store, when security guards asked him if he had paid for the bag,
which contained several small items.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa said today that an eight-day
sit-down strike at the Lenin shipyard showed Solidarity's strength
but that lack of widespread support hurt the strikers.
   ``We were paralyzed because there were so few of us,'' Walesa
told reporters at St. Brygida's Church near the shipyard in this
Baltic port, where the electrician led workers to form the Soviet
bloc's first independent union federation eight years ago.
   He said this month's action showed ``our strength as well as our
helplessness'' and that the workers would try again if necessary.
   Walesa and about 1,000 haggard strikers who had occupied the
plant and refused to work abandoned their strike Tuesday evening.
Strike leaders said they wanted to avoid a police raid, but
communist authorities said the action failed for lack of support.
   Still, the government said the two weeks of strikes that ended
Tuesday will compel it to speed up efforts to revive Poland's
crippled economy.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told The Associated Press by
telephone that the decision to end the strike was judicious and
``so eloquent that it requires no comment whatsoever.''
   The official PAP news agency reported some shipyard supervisors
were back at work today and normal work would resume Thursday.
Walesa said he got a phone call at home in the morning asking him
why he was not there.
   ``If there are people who think we lost, it is because we still
lack solidarity'' among workers nationwide, he said.
   But Walesa said that ``if necessary we will try again. Nothing
ended. Nothing is finished.'' He added that the 15-member strike
committee that engaged in five rounds of negotiations with
management will not be dissolved.
   There was no immediate word on whether the strikers would face
legal charges or disciplinary action. During negotiations, the
strikers had been offered amnesty but only if they left the
shipyard Sunday night.
   Heads held high, the shipyard workers filed out of the yard
without a settlement Tuesday but also without having backed down
from demands whose centerpiece was reinstatement of the yard's
Solidarity chapter.
   Through the intervention of the Catholic Church, workers and
management met five times from Saturday until Monday.
   Police had surrounded the shipyard since Thursday and the
strikers had rejected government offers of wage increases, so
quitting was the ``best solution possible,'' said strike committee
chairman Alojzy Szablewski.
   The strike evoked memories of 1980, when a younger, leaner
Walesa cosigned an accord at the same shipyard during a nationwide
wave of strikes over price increases that toppled a government. A
time of unmatched freedom followed.
   The rest of the country did not follow suit this time, leaving
the shipyard workers in the Baltic port city largely isolated.
   Urban said on Tuesday that ``the strikes and protests have not
won the support of the working class and society'' but had taught
the government important lessons.
   ``The May events will compel the government to more consistently
develop reform, which should be more strongly felt by society,'' he
said.
   The government planned today to introduce a bill that would
allow it to take over money-losing enterprises and fire managers
who resist economic change. Its reform program has increased prices
by 42 percent this year.
   And a PAP statement on Tuesday's meeting of the ruling Politburo
spoke of the ``indispensible'' need to quicken democratization _ a
process it has so far only vaguely described.
   Five major strikes since April 25 added up to Poland's worst
wave of labor unrest since the 1981 military crackdown on
Solidarity. The labor federation was banned in 1982.
   During negotiations, the mostly young strikers often appeared
more militant than their elders. On Monday, the young strikers
refused to accept a compromise largely agreed to by the strike
committee.
   Solidarity chaplain the Rev. Henryk Jankowski said the strike
committee had voted 13-2 to end the stoppage.
   ``I wanted to avoid the police taking them out,'' he said.
``There were many wonderful young men there, and I could not allow
them to be beaten.''
   Besides recognition of Solidarity, the strikers had demanded
monthly raises of at least $38 based on their current average of
about $105, reinstatement of fired Solidarity activists, freedom
for political prisoners and amnesty for strikers.
   Similar demands had been made by workers at the Lenin steelworks
in Nowa Huta in southern Poland, whose 10-day stoppage was crushed
Thursday by a violent, pre-dawn raid.
   The other strikes were settled peacefully: at a defense-related
heavy machinery plant in Stalowa Wola and among transit workers in
Bydgoszcz and Szczecin.

   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz today
reopened talks on a troubled arms control treaty and said he was
sure the Soviet Union wants to resolve differences that led the
Senate to shelve the pact indefinitely.
   Shultz, before meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, refused to blame the Soviets for differences over how
to monitor the destruction of U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range
nuclear missiles.
   ``I am not trying to characterize the disagreements,'' he told
reporters on his flight from Washington. ``Problems have arisen,
and since no one has ever done anything like this before, there are
problems. We approach this in a problem-solving way.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, in a
telephone interview today with the British Broadcasting Corp., said
``We think that we can iron out our differences.
   ``They are not very big,'' he said, ``so we still hope and we
think that the Senate is going to ratify the treaty before the
Moscow summit.'' The summit between Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is scheduled for May 29-June 2.
   Shevardnadze, arriving in Geneva on Tuesday, had said he was not
sure what the problems over the treaty were. He said the Soviets
had answered questions posed by the United States.
   ``Basically the verification problems regarding the INF
(Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) treaty have been resolved, I
think,'' he said.
   In Washington, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said today the Senate could ratify the
U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms agreement in time for the Moscow summit if
Shultz works out disputes in this week's talks.
   ``I think there's still time to get the consent of the Senate to
ratification prior to the summit. But these matters have to be
dealt with,'' he said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   The treaty, signed by Reagan and Gorbachev at the Washington
summit meeting in December, is the first to scrap an entire
category of nuclear arms. It also provides for unprecedented
on-site inspection of missile factories and bases to guard against
cheating.
   In the last few weeks, the Soviets had raised objections to
various procedures proposed by the U.S. side. These include the
scope of inspection within designated areas and use of cameras.
   Asked if he thought the Soviets were backsliding or causing
trouble, Shultz did not criticize Moscow. In fact, he said of
Shevardnadze, ``he wants to see the INF treaty completed and into
operation as much as I do. As problems arise, I am sure he will
want to look at them.''
   Shultz said he hoped the treaty will be ratified before Reagan
begins the summit with Gorbachev. But he said, ``I can't tell what
the Senate will do.''
   Shultz and Shevardnadze planned to meet twice today and twice
Thursday on the problems and on the wide range of summit topics,
including human rights.
   The differences over verification have prompted the Senate to
postpone indefinitely ratification of the treaty to scrap 683
Soviet missiles and 364 U.S. rockets.
   With the Moscow summit less than three weeks away, the trouble
over the treaty is a severe setback to the arms control process.
   Already, there is virtually no hope of completing a second
accord to sharply reduce long-range U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons
before the summit.
   The United States says the Soviets are trying to restrict the
access of U.S. monitors to Soviet missile plants and sites. This
would leave the United States unable to guarantee that the Soviets
are not cheating on the agreement, which bans medium and
shorter-range missiles.
   After Shultz winds up his talks with Shevardnadze on Thursday,
he flies to Brussels on Friday to brief NATO officials before going
home.

<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gunboat with 30 Fiji soldiers today headed
for an island where a self-styled king threatened to declare
independence from the South Pacific archipelago, the army said.
   It said a navy patrol boat was on its way to the Rotuma, 400
miles north of Suva, in case of trouble from the Malmahao clan,
whose leader intended to secede from Fiji.
   Reports from Rotuma said the island would hoist the British flag
and declare its secession on Friday, the 107th anniversary of
Rotuma's annexation by Britain. Fiji was a British colony until
1970, when it became an independent nation within the Commonwealth.
   Saturday marks the first anniversary of the military coup that
ousted the Indian-dominated government of Timoci Bavadra. Seven
months ago, coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka declared Fiji a republic.
   Rotuma's self-styled king is Sau Lagfatmaro, also known as Henry
Gibson, a martial arts expert with a home in Auckland, New Zealand.
He is partly of Rotuman descent.
   Lagfatmaro has claimed the title ``gagaj,'' meaning king, of one
of the seven clans forming the Rotuman community and has said that
on Friday his supporters will lower the Fiji flag.
   Rotuma since 1881 has been administered from Suva, first by the
British and since 1970 by Fiji.
   Unlike Fiji, where most of the 715,000 population is Melanesian,
Rotuma's 3,000 residents are mostly Polynesian.
   Lagfatmaro's whereabouts were not immediately known, but several
of his followers had been reported arrested and charged with
sedition.
   Britain's ambassador to Fiji, Roger Barltrop, was visiting
Rotuma at the invitation of the island council. Further details
were not available.
   Rabuka, meantime, was reported planning a parade on Saturday to
commemorate the South Pacific's first military takeover.
   Army sources said Rabuka, army commander as well as a member of
the semi-military government, had called all territorial soldiers
to barracks as a precaution against expected protests by coup
opponents.

   Maria DeSillers responded angrily to a
court-appointed official's report that she spent some $200,000
donated for her late son's liver transplants on herself, relatives
and friends.
   ``I am not a thief. I did not do anything wrong,'' Ms. DeSillers
said Tuesday after an unrelated hearing over a $1,000 state fine
levied against her in the wake of charges that she violated
Florida's charity laws.
   ``I resent the way I'm being treated, the way it's been
handled,'' she said.
   Ms. DeSillers' 7-year-old son Ronnie died at Children's Hospital
in Pittsburgh last year while awaiting a fourth liver transplant.
His plight resulted in a highly publicized fund-raising drive that
included a $1,000 donation from President Reagan.
   Karen Geivers, appointed at the request of the Dade state
attorney's office to review Ms. DeSillers' spending, on Monday
filed court documents listing questionable expenses paid from the
donations.
   Among the payments were $10,850 to a jewelry store, $23,700 to
Ms. DeSillers' ex-boyfriend, and $96,527 in cash withdrawals for
personal expenses.
   Ms. DeSillers has said the expenditures were reasonable and that
she needed the clothing and jewelry to look ``professional'' when
she tried to raise money for organ donor awareness after her son's
death. She is president of the Ronnie DeSillers National Foundation.
   Ms. Gievers in her report accused Ms. DeSillers of having
``ignored the laws ... when it suited her purposes to do so.''
   Ms. DeSillers denied the charges. ``I'm not saying I'm perfect.
But ... how could she say on there that I know the law and I
disregarded it. It's crazy.''
   Among the questionable expenditures found by Ms. Gievers were
$5,798 to the Cache clothing store, $3,163 for furniture, $6,134
for Ms. DeSillers' brother Osvaldo Marchante, $13,500 for a used
BMW, $23,700 to her attorneys and $44,359 to other sick children.
   Ms. DeSillers said the money to Dimas jewelry was to buy back
items she had pawned in early 1987 to pay her son's medical
expenses. The payments to her brother and to her boyfriend Jose
Castillo were for loans they had made to her, she said.
   Ms. DeSillers is appealing the charity law fine, and at the
Tuesday hearing Timothy Jansen of the Florida Secretary of State's
Office accused Ms. DeSillers of misleading the public.
   ``I don't think that the people who donated money intended that
the money for Ronnie should go for cars, the rent, jewelry and
certain other expenditures,'' Jansen said.
   Hearing examiner Donald Alexander will make a decision on the
fine within 30 days, said Harry Robbins, Ms. DeSillers' attorney.
   According to court documents, almost $300,000 of the $527,000
that remained in Ronnie's account when he died has been spent.
About $243,500 remains in the estate.

   Soldiers and police arrested at least six
Palestinian journalists today, and leaders of the Palestinian
uprising issued a new leaflet calling on Arabs to store enough food
for a month of civil disobedience.
   The army command today said it was pleased with the response of
Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip to a potentially explosive
campaign to issue new identity cards to the area's 400,000 adults.
   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel has
occupied since 1967, began demonstrating against the occupation
last Dec. 8. According to U.N. figures, 185 Palestinians have died
in the five months of violence. An Israeli soldier and a Jewish
teen-age settler also have been killed.
   ``The uprising has made the Palestinian problem a central issue
in the world,'' said the leaflet distributed in the occupied lands
and in Arab east Jerusalem, which was annexed by Israel. ``The
uprising is becoming a ghost which scares the enemy.''
   It urged ``a complete boycott of the Zionists'' and asks the
people to ``ready themselves for civil disobedience by storing food
in houses, enough for at least a month.''
   In Jerusalem and its suburbs, police and soldiers began rounding
up journalists and community leaders at about 1 a.m. (6 p.m. EDT
Tuesday), according to Arab reports.
   At least 11 people were seized, including two editors of the
pro-Palestine Liberation Organization newspaper Al Fajr, which has
become a voice of the uprising. Four other journalists were
arrested, along with a union leader, head of a youth council, and
several other Palestinians, the reports said.
   The army refused to comment on the reports.
   Israel radio reported that 47 people have been charged with
manslaughter in the death of man who allegedly collaborated with
Israeli authorities. The victim, Mohammed Id Sakanda, was lynched
by a mob in the village of Qabatiye in the West Bank in February.
   Today, soldiers with loudspeakers ordered West Bank merchants to
close their shops in the morning but said they could open any time
after noon.
   The move is part of a continued effort to force storekeepers to
operate at times dictated by the army, not by uprising leaders who
have ordered repeated general strikes.
   The new leaflet, the 16th issued by the United Leaders of the
Uprising, called for demonstrations on the Moslem holy day, Friday,
and a general strike and ``day of anger'' next Sunday.
   It also urged protests on Id el Fitr, the end of the Moslem
fasting month of Ramadan, which is expected to be Monday or Tuesday
when the new moon is sighted. It also urged a general strike on May
21.
   The leaflet called on Palestinians to keep refusing to pay taxes
to Israel and to refuse to obtain new government identity cards.
   The army began a campaign on Tuesday to force 400,000 residents
of the Gaza Strip to get new cards, a move that protest leaders say
is aimed at catching tax evaders and breaking the five-month
uprising.
   ``The first day of the program to issue new identification cards
passed very well,'' an army spokesman told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity. ``There were no incidents and 2,000 people
received new cards.''
   The army has outlined a month-long first phase encompassing
200,000 adults between the ages of 16 to 60 in Gaza City.
   The government also has been pushing to collect back taxes and
other lapsed fees.
   Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising issued leaflets
and had broadcast warnings from mosque loudspeakers urging
residents not to cooperate with the army. They charge the ID
program is a plot to break the Palestinian uprising, a main tactic
of which is nonpayment of taxes.
   The left-wing daily Al Hamishmar today issued a scathing
editorial of the army plan, saying the army might be trying to put
pressure on the families of young Palestinian protesters by denying
their parents the new card.
   It could create ``a layer of `cardless' residents who will be
illegal residents in an area where they live and even were born.''
   Jewish settlers, meanwhile, reacted angrily to charges by the
chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, that they were aggravating
tensions in the occupied territories.
   Shomron angered Jewish settlers on Tuesday when he told a
parliamentary committee the settlers were raising tensions in the
occupied lands.
   ``It's as if he would say the residents of Israel's northern
border were responsible for the Katyusha rockets fired at them
(from Lebanon),'' said Benny Katzover, a leader of Gush Emunim, a
religious settlement movement. ``The Arabs want to throw us out of
all of the Land of Israel.''

   A woman kidnapped a mail carrier at
gunpoint, took him to her home and searched his mailbag, then
released him, authorities said.
   Authorities said they had no explanation for the abduction of
Mason Thompson, 53, on Tuesday.
   Thompson said he was making his appointed rounds when a woman
drove alongside, produced a .22-caliber revolver and forced him to
get into her car, Inspector John Williams said.
   Williams said the woman drove Thompson to her residence and took
him inside, where she searched his mailbag but took nothing before
releasing him unharmed.
   About 30 minutes after the alleged abduction, Mae Lillian Smith,
26, was arrested, charged with kidnapping and jailed under $10,000
bond.
   ``If there was any reason for it,'' Williams said, ``she hasn't
told us.''

   Shiite Moslem militias with tanks,
howitzers, rockets and mortars fought each other today for control
of the slums of south Beirut. Police said 26 people were killed and
61 wounded.
   A cease-fire called by Syrian and Iranian mediators went into
effect eight hours after fighting began at 2:30 a.m., police said.
   Earlier today, Syria repeated a warning that it might use its
troops to halt the battle between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which had shattered an earlier 24-hour
truce.
   The battle occurred near where many of the 18 foreign hostages
in Lebanon are believed held. There was no word on the hostages.
Since fighting broke out Friday, 180 people have been killed and
433 wounded.
   ``We hold the (militia) leaders responsible for all the crimes
committed against humanity in south Beirut and urge them to order a
cease-fire before it is too late,'' acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss said in a statement broadcast by all radio stations before the
truce was announced.
   Beirut residents were shaken awake by the thuds of exploding
shells that echoed across the Lebanese capital as Amal, Arabic for
hope, mounted a five-pronged attack against Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
   A police spokesman said tank-led Amal forces, advancing behind a
fierce barrage of howitzer, rocket and mortar fire, dislodged
Hezbollah fundamentalists from several areas they had conquered in
the past five days on the western edge of south Beirut abutting the
airport highway.
   He said flight schedules were unaffected and that passengers
reached the airport through side streets.
   Hezbollah stormed Amal positions deep in south Beirut and
occupied the militia's main base in the district of Bourj
el-Barajneh, east of the airport highway, he said.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity according to
regulations, said Hezbollah occupied a police station in Bourj
el-Barajneh.
   The Sahel hospital, closest to the contested area, advised
rescuers through the Moslem-run Voice of Nation radio to take the
wounded to other hospitals because ``we can't cope with the flood
of casualties.''
   The police spokesman said Syrian officers and Iran's Deputy
Foreign Minister Hussein Sheikholeslam ordered the cease-fire, the
fourth since Friday, after contacting Amal and Hezbollah leaders.
``Fighting eased into sporadic exchanges of automatic fire,'' the
spokesman said.
   Before the cease-fire was announced, Syria's military
intelligence chief in Lebanon, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, repeated a
warning that his troops may intervene to stop the fighting.
   ``If the bloodletting continues, we will have no other option
but to respond to the pleas of the population and end their
ordeal,'' Kenaan said in a statement broadcast by all Beirut radio
stations.
   Syria sent 7,500 troops to west Beirut in February 1987 to curb
militia lawlessness in the Moslem sector of the Lebanese capital.
The slums, however, were outside the Syrian contingent's
jurisdiction.
   Thirty-six Syrian officers and six joint cease-fire committees
moved into the slums on Tuesday to enforce the truce. But Amal and
Hezbollah used the calm to fortify their positions for another
round of violence.
   Police said Amal brought about 2,500 fighters from its
strongholds in south Lebanon during the 24-hour lull to help its
4,000-strong force in south Beirut stage today's attack.
   Hezbollah had gained control of much of the slums before Friday.
Its fighting strength is estimated at 3,000.
   Syria is Iran's main Arab backer in its Persian Gulf war with
Iraq. But there have been growing signs of a strain in the alliance
amid pressures on Damascus from other Arab nations to distance
itself from Persian Iran.
   Syria, which considers Lebanon its exclusive sphere of
influence, also has been angry over Iran's drive, using Hezbollah
as its instrument, to dominate the 1.2 million Shiites in Lebanon,
the country's largest single sect.

   After saying Nancy Reagan had not talked with
her astrolger in a couple of months, White House officials were
caught off guard today when the stargazer said she had been in
touch with the first lady this week.
   ``I just don't know anything about it,'' said Elaine Crispen,
the press secretary to Mrs. Reagan. ``I wasn't aware they had
talked. I had no idea.''
   The astrolger, Joan Quigley of San Francisco, said she had
spoken with Mrs. Reagan this week but would not reveal her reaction
to the flap over the use of stargazing in planning the schedule of
President Reagan.
   Quigley's statement contradicted what White House officials were
saying.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater and Mrs. Crispen both
said on Tuesday that it had been ``a couple of months'' since Mrs.
Reagan had been in touch with the astrologer.
   In his new book, former White House chief of staff Donald T.
Regan says the first lady regularly consulted a San Francisco
astrologer about scheduling for the president, policy matters and
decisions.
   The White House has adopted a ``no-comment'' policy on specifics
in the book, trying to dampen the stargazing controversy.
   Fitzwater, at his regular news briefing, was asked whether Mrs.
Reagan had used a ``secure'' telephone line to speak with Quigley,
and if not, had there been a breach of security.
   ``I have no idea,'' Fitzwater replied.
   Asked to assess the role of astrology in preparation of the
president's schedule, Fitzwater said, ``We have not commented on
that in the past, and I would say only that the president's
scheduling is a process involving many people and many different
considerations and concerns.''
   Mrs. Crispen said Quigley had been to the White House only once,
at a state dinner. Other than that, the first lady had communicated
with her only by telephone, Mrs. Crispen said.
   She said she did not know how often they talked.

<HEAD>Police Seize Huge Arms Cache, Arrest Four Whites As Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four whites, including a woman
and two army deserters, were arrested and accused of amassing a
large arms cache to carry out attacks for the African National
Congress, police said today.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, in a statement, described
the four as ``a highly specialized terror unit.''
   The weaponry seized in connection with their arrests Sunday was
described as the largest arms cache ever uncovered by the police.
Vlok said it included a Soviet-made ground-to-air missile, limpet
mines, hand grenades, assault rifles, pistols, mchine guns, mortars
and explosives.
   Vlok alleged that the suspects had been trained in Moscow, Cuba
and Angola, and had radio transmitters which they used to
communicate with the headquarters of the African National Congress
guerrilla group in Lusaka, Zambia.
   The congress, outlawed in South Africa since 1960, began a
sabotage-and-bombing campaign the next year aimed at toppling
white-minority rule.
   Vlok said three of the suspects were South African citizens and
declined to give the nationality of the fourth. He said two had
deserted from the armed forces and one was a former South African
journalist. They all were in their 20s and 30s, he said.
   Vlok said police were still investigating how the weapons were
brought into South Africa, but he said the arms came overland
through Zambia and Botswana.
   By law and custom in South Africa, apartheid establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   It wasn't a White Christmas, but dozens of fans
who usually sing Christmas carols to composer Irving Berlin
serenaded him at his mansion today at the very start of his 100th
birthday.
   The reclusive composer, who hates to get up in the morning and
wrote a song to that effect, didn't put in an appearance.
   ``If he's 100, he's probably sleeping,'' said Roberta Kaufman,
who had been walking her dog and stopped to see what the crowd of
75 people was doing in front of the five-story brick mansion in
Beekman Place, an exclusive East Side enclave.
   John Wallowitch, who organized the midnight Tuesday serenade and
has organized the Christmas carol singing outside Berlin's door for
at least 20 years, was sure Berlin was awake.
   ``He's a night owl, I've seen him walking his dog at 3 a.m.,''
Wallowitch said.
   Berlin's secretary confirmed that.
   ``When they were there singing, of course he heard them. He was
very thrilled by that,'' Hilda Schneider said at mid-morning. She
added that the composer was spending the day ``quietly at home.
He's never made a big thing about his birthdays.''
   During a singing a somewhat intoxicated reveler yelled
``HAAApppy Birthday Irving'' at the drawn shades of 17 Beekman
Place. ``We love you. Where are youuuuu?''
   Many of those gathered seemed to be neighbors hoping to catch a
rare glimpse of Berlin. Just before the singing began, a shade went
up in the house and the crowd gasped.
   But it was a teen-age girl and a matron. Both waved and the
crowd waved back.
   ``Even if he didn't write a thing, to reach 100 is to be part of
American history,'' said 21-year-old John Wiessman, a junior at New
York University. ``But this guy wrote a lot. I love `God Bless
America.' Every American has got to love it.''
   The music and lyrics among the more than 1,500 songs Berlin
created for the stage, screen and popular music are inextricably
woven into the American culture.
   They include ``White Christmas,'' ``Easter Parade,''
``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``There's No Business Like Show
Business,'' ``Puttin' on the Ritz,'' ``Blue Skies,'' ``Cheek to
Cheek,'' and ``Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.''
   In London, the British Parliament honored the composer today
with a motion wishing him ``many more White Christmases and Easter
Parades.''
   Today's informal serenade will be followed tonight by a Carnegie
Hall tribute to the composer, with stars like Frank Sinatra, Isaac
Stern and Ray Charles scheduled to appear.
   Wallowitch got the crowd ready by reading through a song he
composed for the occasion.
   ``Just think, 100 years ago this little Russian lady was very
pregnant,'' he said, referring to Berlin's birth on May 11, 1888,
in Russia. Then he told the crowd to sing ``softly, with great
love.''
   The crowd sang ``Happy Birthday,'' Berlin's ``Always'' and
Wallowitch's ``The Songs of Irving Berlin,'' which included the
broad hint, ``Knock on my door and I'll welcome you in.''
   Nearly five years ago, Wallowitch was invited into the Berlin
home on Christmas Eve after a chorus of ``White Christmas.'' On an
impulse, he rang the doorbell. A maid answered and took him and his
fellow singers into the kitchen.
   There they were greeted by Berlin himself, in bathrobe and
slippers. The composer hugged the men, kissed the women and told
them, ``That's the nicest Christmas present I've ever had.''
   Still no Berlin, so the crowd ran through ``We'll be loving you,
always'' again. Another shade went up but again it was the teen-age
girl.
   ``Hey,'' the drunk said. ``We would love to see Irving. Please
bring him to the window.''
   The dispersing neighbors said they did not really expect to see
him. It's a neighborhood known for its recluses like Greta Garbo.
   Garbo didn't show either.

   Paula Van Ness, director of the Centers for
Disease Control's AIDS education campaign, has resigned just as the
agency is about to mail controversial AIDS brochures to 107 million
households across the nation, a spokeswoman said today.
   Ms. Van Ness, director of the CDC's National AIDS Information
and Education Program, said she will leave the agency June 3 to
become project director of a Ford Foundation plan to funnel funds
into community AIDS prevention and social service programs.
   Ms. Van Ness resigned a week ago Saturday, three days before the
government unveiled the brochure it plans to send to every American
household, according to today's editions of The Atlanta
Constitution. The brochures are scheduled to be mailed beginning
May 26.
   She told the newspaper she was working 90 hour weeks and was
leaving the AIDS information program ``partly to find some balance
in my life.''
   The agency made no public announcement of Ms. Van Ness'
departure, but CDC spokeswoman Gayle Lloyd said today there was no
attempt to keep it secret. The CDC does not routinely announce
staff resignations, she said.
   Ms. Van Ness was out of town and could not be reached today for
comment on the reason for her resignation.
   ``My understanding is she was made an offer too good to
refuse,'' Ms. Lloyd said. ``I don't know of any dissatisfaction she
had about the pamphlet.''
   An assistant, Laurie Sherman, also will leave the agency June
30, to return to California and work on various projects, said Ann
Sims, a CDC spokeswoman. Ms. Sims said she did not know why Ms.
Sherman was leaving the AIDS program, and Ms. Sherman could not be
reached for comment.
   Dr. Gary Noble, the CDC's deputy director for AIDS activities
and Ms. Van Ness' supervisor, was out of the country and could not
be reached for comment.
   Ms. Van Ness said the job change will provide relief from the
constant pressure, unending travel and ``90-hour weeks'' of the
AIDS education effort.
   ``For me it is partly an opportunity to find some balance in my
life, to work at a pace that will allow me to have more of a
personal life. No matter what some people say about government, we
work real long hours, really hard,'' she said.
   Ms. Van Ness joined the CDC on April 19, 1987, after serving as
executive director of AIDS Project Los Angeles, an AIDS service
agency. Before that she served on the project's board of directors
while working for a variety of family planning groups.
   At the CDC, Ms. Van Ness was put in charge of plans for the
first national direct mail campaign sponsored by the federal
government.
   The campaign got off to a rocky start. Secretary of Education
William Bennett and officials on the president's Domestic Policy
Council initially opposed spending the $20 million allocated by
Congress on brochures that would carry explicit information about
AIDS directly to American households.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 20th graf, `In the Democratic...' to CORRECT Byrd age to

   Republican primary voters gave West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore a
shot at a record fourth term and Nebraska Sen. David Karnes a
hard-fought victory in the first election of his brief political
career.
   But Karnes, who survived an aggressive challenge by Rep. Hal
Daub, may have a tougher time defeating the Democratic primary
winner, former Gov. Bob Kerrey.
   Other results from Tuesday's primaries in the two states showed
Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd easily winning West
Virginia's Democratic nomination for a sixth term. He will face
state Sen. Jay Wolfe, who won the Republican primary. In the
Democratic primary for governor, insurance executive Gaston
Caperton won a seven-way race for the chance to face Moore, who
edged millionaire businessman John Raese.
   Nebraska voters approved a measure raising salaries of lawmakers
in the nation's only one-chamber Legislature from $4,800 to
$12,000. It's their first raise in 20 years.
   And in Nebraska's 2nd District, where Daub gave up his seat,
Democrats denied a congressional nomination to Cece Zorinsky, widow
of U.S. Sen. Edward Zorinsky. Instead, former state Sen. Pete
Hoagland will be the Democratic nominee and will face Jerry
Schenken, winner of a four-way Republican race.
   ``We did it!'' an elated Karnes told supporters as he claimed
victory late Tuesday. ``And the thing that I am so proud about is
that we did it the old-fashioned way _ we earned every single
vote.''
   Nebraska's GOP Senate race had been rated a toss-up in
pre-election polls, but Karnes _ who was appointed 14 months ago
and is the nation's youngest senator at age 38 _ won by a wide
margin. With 99 percent of the vote counted, Karnes had 114,101
votes or 55 percent and Daub had 93,236 votes or 45 percent.
   Daub was quick to congratulate Karnes on ``his very sound and
impressive victory'' and promised to help him in November.
   Karnes was a supporter of Gov. Kay Orr's election and she
appointed him to fill Zorinsky's seat after he died in March 1987.
Daub, 47, was one of several GOP regulars who sought the job.
   For the Democrats, Kerrey had 152,363 votes or 91.6 percent and
Ken Michaelis, a disbarred lawyer, had 13,889 votes or 8.4 percent.
   ``I know the task over the next five months is going to be
difficult,'' Kerrey said, shrugging off polls that have showed him
the clear favorite.
   The 44-year-old Kerrey, who lost part of a leg in Vietnam and
won a Medal of Honor, has been a popular figure in Nebraska and
lent some glamour to the farm state when he dated movie star Debra
Winger.
   In West Virginia, with 95 percent of the vote in early today,
Moore led with 73,503 votes, or 53 percent, to Raese's 64,897, or
47 percent.
   Raese, who accused Moore of failing to deal with the state's
fiscal crisis, also lost his previous bid for office, a 1984 Senate
race against Democrat Jay Rockefeller.
   Moore, 65, won his first two terms as governor in 1968 and 1972,
but was barred by law from seeking a third straight term. After
Rockefeller served two terms, Moore was elected again in 1984.
   Caperton's victory in the Democratic primary followed a campaign
so bitter it threatened to leave his party divided.
   ``He bought this election fair and square,'' said Clyde See, the
former House of Delegates Speaker ho finished second and was
outspent $1.8 million to $500,000.
   ``This is a victory for change,'' said Caperton, a newcomer to
politics, ``a victory for those who believe we can create jobs and
prosperity in West Virginia, a victory for education.''
   With 96 percent of the vote in, Caperton had 122,276 votes or 38
percent, See had 87,753 votes or 27 percent; five others divided
the rest.
   In the Democratic Senate race, the 70-year-old Byrd had 237,037
votes, or 80 percent, while moving company owner Bob Myers had
57,330 votes, or 20 percent.
   ``I am delighted by the overwhelming vote of confidence that I
have received,'' said Byrd, who has pledged to step down as
majority leader to become Senate Appropriations Committee chairman
if re-elected in order to help steer tax dollars to West Virginia.
   In the GOP primary, with 97 percent of the vote counted, Wolfe
had 75,736, or 70 percent; welfare recipient Bernie Lumbert had
32,491, or 30 percent.

   The Justice Department will refer to the House
Ethics Committee the alleged failure of House Banking Committee
Chairman Fernand J. St Germain to report meals paid for by an
industry lobbyist, sources familiar with the probe said today.
   Concluding an investigation that was launched last summer, the
Justice Department is ``declining prosecution'' of the Rhode Island
Democrat, department spokesman John Russell said Tuesday. St
Germain issued a two-sentence statement saying he had been informed
by his attorney of the decision and that ``this means the case is
closed.''
   However, the department plans to refer the matter to the ethics
committee, which will decide whether it intends to review the case
for possible disciplinary action against St Germain. The committee
launches investigations under five different procedures, none of
which involves the Justice Department.
   The department investigated allegations that St Germain accepted
food, drink and entertainment from James O. Freeman, lobbyist for
the U.S. League of Savings Institutions and other financial
industry lobbyists.
   That is a possible violation of a federal anti-bribery statute
forbidding members of Congress from accepting anything of value in
exchange for an official act. The Justice Department probe also
focused on possible congressional reporting requirement violations
in connection with the alleged free meals and entertainment.
   St Germain's attorney, Raymond Banoun, has said he was confident
St Germain would not be charged with any wrongdoing because ``we've
shown to them that there's a degree of inaccuracy in the league
records.''
   Banoun said last year that one reimbursement submitted to the
league by its lobbyist shows that he was having dinner with St
Germain when St Germain was on television debating his opponent
live in Rhode Island.
   ``The fact of the matter is there are dozens upon dozens of
instances where he was out of town,'' Banoun said.
   League spokesman Mark Clark has said, however, that the league
keeps accurate expense records and has internal controls and audits.
   A Justice Department source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said one reason prosecution was declined was because Freeman's
record-keeping was inaccurate. House rules require reporting gifts
such as meals worth more than $250 in a single calendar year, but
don't count toward the limit meals worth less than $35.
   The Washington Post today quoted unidentified sources familiar
with the investigation as saying that it would be difficult to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each meal eaten by St Germain
totaled more than the $35 limit.
   The Justice Department investigation followed a 14-month probe
by the House ethics committee into allegations that St Germain used
his chairmanship for personal gain.
   The committee found that the 14-term congressman violated House
rules by underreporting his assets by more than $1 million and by
accepting a free plane ride from a Florida savings and loan
association. But no disciplinary action was recommended.

<HEAD>Senate Panel OKs Nurse's Statue at Viet Memorial</HEAD>

   A bill authorizing a statue of an Army nurse
at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was approved by the Senate Energy
and Commerce Committee today over objections that it might
encourage other groups to demand similar sculptures.
   The committee passed the measure, which has 63 sponsors, on a
voice vote and sent it to the Senate floor after the lone
dissenter, Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., protested what he called a
threat to the artistic integrity of the memorial.
   The bill, however, contained an amendment by Sen. Dale Bumpers,
D-Ark., that strengthens a declaration that Congress would not
allow any other statues to be placed at the memorial if the bronze
sculpture of an Army women's sculpture is approved.
   ``This will be the last one,'' said Sen. Bennett Johnston,
D-La., the committe chairman. ``But the last for how long?''
retorted Evans, who took pains to stress that his opposition had
nothing to do with his respect for American women.
   The proposal for a new statue honoring the 10,000 women who
served in the Vietnam conflict was introduced by Senate Majority
Whip Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn.
   At a committee hearing last February, the proposal was applauded
by veterans' groups but criticized by Robert W. Doubek, former
executive director of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, who said
the woman's statue would ``destroy the symbolism and aesthetics of
the memorial.''
   Doubek said the National Park Service already had received
demands for statues honoring others who had served in Vietnam,
including native Americans and even scout dogs.
   The memorial, situated on the Mall near the Lincoln Memorial,
features a long black granite slab bearing the names of 58,156
Vietnam War dead, including eight uniformed nurses.
   Two years after the memorial was dedicated in 1982, a
controversial statue of three battle-weary infantrymen and a
60-foot flagpole were erected on the 2.2-acre site.
   The proposed addition to the Vietnam memorial, the most popular
tourist attraction among national monuments in the capital, has
been endorsed by the Interior Department but rejected by the
Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning
Commission.
   The approval of all three agencies in required before any new
memorial is built on federal parkland in Washington.

<HEAD>Activist For Indian Rights Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John E. Hamilton, who called himself
the grand sachem of the Mohegan-Pequot Indian Nation and conducted
a marriage ceremony for newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, has
died. He was 90.
   Hamilton, known as ``Chief Rolling Cloud,'' died Tuesday at
Lawrence and Memorial Hospital. He broke his hip in a fall at his
home last month.
   Best known as an Indian leader involved in lawsuits seeking the
return of land to his southeastern Connecticut tribe, he was also a
cowboy who worked the Western range during the first quarter of
this century.
   In the 1930s, Hamilton founded the American Indian Defense
Association to protect Indian rights. He remained its head for
decades.
   In addition to speaking in behalf of Indian causes, he lectured,
wrote music and led an orchestra. He used the title ``grand
sachem,'' although the chairman of the Mohegan tribal council said
the last grand sachem died in 1769 and the title did not exist.
   Hamilton became a national figure in the early 1970s because of
his practice of ``adopting'' people into the Mohegan-Pequot Nation.
   Among those he adopted was Patricia Hearst, kidnapped in the
early 1970s by the radical Symbionese Liberation Army. At the time,
Hearst was being sought by the FBI for a bank robbery and firearms
violations.
   Hamilton, blaming the crimes on a spell cast by Hearst's
captors, named her ``Brave Heart.'' Later, he asked that she be
pardoned when she served a prison term.
   In 1979, Hearst and Bernard Shaw were married in San Francisco
in a blood rite conducted by Hamilton. He also attended an
Episcopal Church ceremony the following day.
   Survivors include four grandsons.

   Authorities launched a surprise
inspection at an unlicensed home for boys today, taking away one
youth and issuing citations to 19 men who locked arms to hinder
officials from entering.
   Authorities snapped a padlocked gate and broke through the human
chain shortly after 6 a.m. to begin inspecting birth certificates
of children at the facility run by the Rev. W.N. Otwell.
   The inspection involved the state attorney general's office, the
Department of Human Services, Department of Public Safety and the
Texas Rangers.
   Otwell and state Attorney General Jim Mattox have disagreed for
two years about whether the facility should be licensed by the
state, and Otwell at one time agreed to close the facility.
   The facility is a combination home for troubled boys, a
church-run school and preschool. It has about 25 boys and 10
toddlers and pre-schoolers, said church secretary Deborah Anderson.
   A state district judge ruled April 12 that state officials could
inspect the facility in the Community Baptist Church compound at
any time and remove children found there without a relative or
guardian.
   ``They played it low-key. They said they didn't want a
confrontation,'' said Rocky Otwell, the reverend's son, of today's
multi-agency inspection.
   Ron Dusek, a spokesman for the attorney general, said a
17-year-old youth lacking guardianship papers was removed from the
facility and taken to a Department of Human Services emergency
shelter, and that 19 men were cited for preventing execution of
civil process.
   In March 1986, a state district judge in Austin ordered Otwell
to close the home, but in November 1987 suspended $97,000 in fines
after the minister promised he would keep the home closed unless
the state passed a law exempting church homes from licensing. The
state has never done so.
   Otwell reopened the facility this spring in mobile homes, vowing
to renew his fight over licensing.
   ``If they come to shut us down, we'll just pick her up and sail
her on down the road,'' said Otwell, who has previously contended
that the requirement that he seek a state license violated the
constitutional separation of church and state.
   Parents of several of the 25 students attending the school have
been staying at the compound in past weeks anticipating an
inspection, said Ms. Anderson.
   Authorities herded everyone into the school auditorium, asked to
see children's birth certificates and released them when parents
showed documents, she said.
   Rocky Otwell, interviewed by telephone, said his father was too
busy to comment on the incident.
   ``He's upset, but there's not visibly any angry words
exchanged,'' said Ms. Anderson.

peasants, meeting in Paraguay canceled. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today promised tens
of thousands of jobless miners and dirt-poor peasants the church
would help them pursue a society of love, solidarity and justice.
   In a one-hour morning visit to the hard-hit mining city of
Oruro, the pontiff said he was aware of the crisis in Bolivia's tin
mining industry.
   In Asuncion, Paraguay, meanwhile, the government of President
Gen. Alfredo Stroessner canceled a scheduled meeting between John
Paul and a group of Paraguayans that included opposition leaders.
Authorities cited ``security reasons.''
   The pontiff arrived in Uruguay on Friday for a 13-day tour of
four South American nations. He is to leave Bolivia Saturday for
Peru and is scheduled to arrive in Paraguay on Monday.
   ``The deep mines that years ago were the great source of
national wealth ... are now only mute witnesses to the so many
lives consumed silently there,'' the pope told the miners.
   ``I come with a message of hope, which does not mean passivity
in the face of misery that each day becomes more evident, but
instead is an obligation to construct a new society founded in
love, solidarity and justice.''
   The pope spoke from a tall platform that gave him a clear view
of the entrance to Oruro's state-run San Jose mine, from which most
workers have been laid off in a government austerity program.
   An umbrella held by an aide sheltered the pontiff from the
intense sun of Bolivia's wind-swept altiplano, or high plain. Oruro
is 12,160 feet above sea level.
   Local mining union leader Victor Lopez told the pope: ``Today
you have not heard the call of our work sirens, because the mines
are empty, and in our mining camps you hear only the wail of
children, because they cannot lift bread to their mouths.''
   A rural farmer also spoke to John Paul: ``We peasants suffer a
lot. Treated very badly, we suffer for our produce. Prices are not
good. We are cheated.''
   Unemployment in Oruro, a city of 132,000, is running at easily
twice the national average of 22 percent. It is considered the
center of misery in Bolivia, itself South America's poorest country.
   The collapse of world tin prices prompted Bolivia's conservative
government to shut down 14 of 21 state-run mines, leaving 21,500 of
27,000 miners out of work.
   The pope was to return from Oruro to Cochabamba, where he spent
Tuesday night in a monastery. He had several events planned for
this afternoon in Cochabamba, including a mass and an encounter
with the country's youth.
   Cochabamba is the gateway to the country's principal
coca-growing region and a center for cocaine trafficking. It also
is plagued by a growing problem with local drug consumption,
especially among the young and poor.
   In La Paz, the pope reaffirmed the importance the Roman Catholic
Church places on traditional values and criticized a Bolivian
Indian custom of concubinage.
   The meeting in Asuncion was scheduled to bring together diverse
members of the Paraguayan civilian sector, including leaders of
opposition parties that are not recognized by the government.
   The government had criticized the invitation of opposition
politicians to the meeting.

   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts holds a
commanding lead over Jesse Jackson among likely Democratic voters
in California's June 7 presidential primary, a Gallup poll said
today.
   Dukakis was supported by 67 percent of the 487 Democrats
surveyed, to 26 percent for Jackson, with 7 percent undecided or
favoring someone else.
   Dukakis also led slightly in the state in a hypothetical general
election race against George Bush, with 46 percent of 1,205
registered voters backing Dukakis, 42 percent preferring Bush and
12 percent undecided or choosing another person.
   In a hypothetical Bush-Jackson race, Bush led with 58 percent to
31 percent for Jackson and 11 percent in the other or undecided
category.
   The poll also found Republican Sen. Pete Wilson with 51 percent
backing, to 30 percent for possible Democratic challenger Lt. Gov.
Leo McCarthy and 19 percent undecided or favoring someone else.
   The telephone survey was conducted May 5-7; it had a five-point
error margin for the results among Democrats, three points for the
questions asked of all voters.

   Security forces exchanged gunfire today
with Sikh extremists holed up inside the Golden Temple, and police
said witnesses had seen the bodies of five radicals inside the
complex.
   Electricity and water were cut off to the temple, Sikhism's
holiest shrine, on Tuesday after more than 800 pilgrims were
evacuated, according to security sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Heavy firing was reported early today between an estimated 100
extremists and about 2,500 police and paramilitary forces
surrounding the walled complex, which covers about five city blocks.
   A.A. Siddiqui, deputy inspector general of police, said at least
10 people have been killed and 10 injured since the violence began
Monday.
   He said there were reports that five bodies of Sikh radicals
were inside the temple but there was no way for police to verify
them.
   Police earlier reported that three bodies, believed to be Sikh
militants, were seen at daybreak on the ground outside the temple
complex.
   A. Hakeem, a paramilitary police commander, said it could not be
determined if the men had fallen from the temple rooftop or killed
while attempting to sneak in or out of the shrine.
   Siddiqui said his men had orders to fire on anyone moving inside
the shrine. He said that his troops could see entrances to food
stores and an ammunitions dump inside the shrine and were
preventing militants from getting to them.
   ``We will keep this up for a least a few more days,'' Siddiqui
said. ``Either the militants will be forced to surrender or will be
eliminated.''
   He added, ``We have no plans to enter the temple at this time.''
   The temple's head priest, Jasbir Singh Rode, was out of the
temple for a speaking engagement on Monday and has not been allowed
to return. He told reporters he asked authorities Tuesday for
permission to return but was denied.
   He was conferring with Indian officials today on ways to resolve
the confrontation, said Amritsar Police Supterindent Baldev Singh
said.
   Meanwhile, a curfew imposed three days ago remained in place in
most parts of Amritsar's old, walled sector.
   Elsewhere in Punjab state, two men were killed by Sikh gunmen
early today in the central Jalandhar district, the United News of
India reported. The latest slaying raised to more than 940 the
number of deaths blamed on the extremists this year.
   Since 1982, militant Sikhs have been waging a guerrilla war for
an independent homeland for their minority sect in the northern
state. Their attacks have increased in recent months, despite the
federal government's decision a year ago to take direct control of
security in the state.
   Although a majority in Punjab, Sikhs comprise just 2 percent of
India's 800 million people. The Sikhs claim they are discriminated
against by Hindus, who make up 82 percent of the nationwide
population.
   The temple siege began after at least five people were killed
and 10 hurt in a gunbattle Monday between Sikhs inside the complex
and security forces.
   The Golden Temple has become the main stronghold of Sikh
separatists, and an estimated 100 were believed holed up in and
around the shrine.
   The complex includes offices, living quarters, hostels for
pilgrims, dining halls and kitchens. The temple itself is
surrounded by a pool and reached by a single walkway.
   The security forces, beefed up after the initial outbreak of
fire, were given orders on Tuesday to shoot anyone attempting to
leave the shrine.
   Much of their gunfire on Tuesday afternoon was directed at a
watch tower overlooking the temple's main entrance.
   In June 1984, the Indian army carried out a raid to drive
militants from the Golden Temple and more than 1,200 people were
killed. Five months later, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was
assassinated by two Sikh bodguards in revenge.
   In New Delhi, P. Chidambaram, minister of state for home
affairs, told Parliament today that ``other forces'' were being
moved to Amritsar to deal with the situation, the United News of
India reported. He did not elaborate.

   The National Academy of Sciences has come down
on the side of those who advocate that NASA establish a robot
research and manufacturing facility in space to fill the time until
a space station is in orbit.
   ``We add our voice to the growing chorus of those urging NASA's
development of a mixed fleet of craft for access to space using
ELVs (expendable launch vehicles) for launching unmanned experiment
packages and the shuttle for those that require human presence,''
the academy said in a report Tuesday.
   It urged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to
develop methods for keeping the shuttle in orbit for longer periods
of time than has been the case and to develop ``free-flier''
platforms.
   The Reagan administration wants the space agency to encourage
private development of space by agreeing to lease 70 percent of a
robot factory, which would be put into orbit by the space shuttle.
Such a scheme would cost $140 million a year and require astronaut
visits every three months for servicing.
   Congressional committees have balked at the idea, viewing it as
a move to deprive the space station program of funds, thus killing
it.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 12,000 doctors have joined a pharmaceutical
company program that gives free heart medicine to needy patients
since the program was expanded five weeks ago, a company spokesman
said.
   Under the program, G.D. Searle & Co. issues certificates to
participating doctors, clinics and hospitals for heart medicine.
Patients obtain the certificate and prescription from their
doctors, then give them to pharmacists, who mail the certificate to
Searle for reimbursement.
   ``We are satisfied the program is a success,'' Searle spokesman
Bill Vaughn said by telephone Tuesday from Searle's corporate
headquarters in suburban Skokie.
   During a 14-month pilot program that ended in April, Searle
distributed two kinds of high-blood pressure medication to 20,000
patients. On April 6, the company announced it would expand the
giveaway to all seven of its heart medicines.
   Other drug companies have similar programs, but Searle's is more
extensive, said Judee Shuler, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association in Washington, D.C.
   The value of the pilot program was put at $9 million by Searle,
Vaughn said.
   Vaughn said the program is available to clinics nationwide and
that there is no time or money limit. ``These are life-time drugs.
You wouldn't want to put someone on a drug that he is going to need
all his life, then pull the plug on it later,'' he said.
   The drug giveaway is for people with no insurance or other
assistance, and annual incomes of $8,000 or less for a family of
one or two and $11,000 for larger families.

   The seventh and last victim of the Shell Oil

   The body identified Tuesday night was that of Bill Coles, 27, of
LaPlace, Shell Oil spokesman Bill Gibson said.
   Seven Shell workers were killed and 42 other people were injured
Thursday when the gasoline-refining unit exploded and caught fire
before dawn. At least 250 homes in Norco were heavily damaged and
windows were broken up to 20 miles away in New Orleans.
   Two men remained hospitalized: Richard Hodges, 34, of Norco in
critical condition at West Jefferson Hospital and John Violette,
43, of LaPlace in stable condition at River Parishes Hospital.
   The cause of the blast has not been determined, Gibson said.
   ``The main thing going on is the investigation of the cause,''
he said. A team of Shell specialists and federal Occupational
Safety and Hazard Administration investigators are examining the
site today, he said.

   Democrats rallied on Capitol Hill today and
vowed to fight President Reagan from now until November if he makes
good on his threat to veto the 1,000-page trade bill.
   ``If you decide to pull out that pen, Mr. President, we will
have to override that veto and we have the votes to do it,'' Rep.
Tony Coelho, D-Calif., told listeners gathered at the steps of the
Democratic National Committee.
   It remained unclear, however, where supporters of the measure
would find enough support in the Senate to override a presidential
veto. The bill fell three votes short of what would be needed.
``We'll consult the stars,'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said,
drawing a laugh from the crowd.
   Several hundred supporters including congressmen, their aides
and labor officials spilled into the street as party leaders urged
Reagan to relent and sign the measure. It was the final show of
political muscle before sending the measure to Reagan's desk.
   Absent from the ceremony, however, was Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., the chairman of the House-Senate conference committee that
fashioned the legislation. In reply to a question, Rep. Beryl
Anthony, D-Ark., said Rostenkowski may have had a scheduling
conflict.
   There have been recurrent reports, however, of friction between
Rostenkowski and House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, over provisions
of the measure. At the rally, Wright introduced Majority Leader
Thomas Foley, D-Wash., as ``the architect'' of the bill.
   The ornate Statuary Hall next to the House chamber was chosen as
the site for ceremonies in which Wright was signing the bill and
sending it on to Reagan. Officials of labor unions and religious
groups are among the invitees.
   Republicans are expected to be mainly absent from the
festivities, aimed at pressuring Reagan to drop his veto threat and
sign the bill after all.
   Reagan has been critical of the bill's curbs on Alaska oil
exports and its provision requiring companies with 100 employees or
more to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale
layoffs.
   Meanwhile, Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin told a manufacturers'
association the Reagan administration recognized the popularity of
the plant notification provision.
   ``We've gotten together _ you and us and everyone whose been
trying to `fight' the notification (provision) _ a real political
problem,'' she told the National Association of Manufacturers.
   ``The polls have indicated that, from the people I've talked to,
62 percent of the people think that plant notification is the right
way to go. Another 13 percent think it should be much more
stringent,'' she said.
   The major provisions of the bill have hardly figured in the
debate in recent weeks. They would streamline the system under
which the United States imposes import restrictions and takes other
steps to aid endangered U.S. industries and retaliate against
international trade violations.
   But there are numerous other provisions ranging from
agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil
companies.
   Reagan has been saying the Alaska provisions violate the
Constitution by discriminating against that state's ports while the
plant-closings feature would dull rather than sharpen the nation's
edge in global markets.
   Supporters of the plant-closings provision call it a humane and
decent way to treat employees and their families. But there are
only a handful of supporters for the Alaska provisions, which
Democratic leaders have been trying in vain to erase from the
legislation.
   ``I had hoped that if these offending provisions had been
eliminated the president would have had one less reason for vetoing
this bill,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said
Tuesday.
   The remark appeared to mark the end of efforts to erase the
provisions.
   The bill won final passage on April 27 but has been becalmed on
Capitol Hill while leaders sought to do some after-the-fact custom
tailoring.
   The House last week approved a resolution that would have
instructed a congressional employee to call the enrolling clerk to
smooth out any minor wrinkles in the bill _ and erase the Alaska
provisions while he was at it.
   To bring up the resolution in the Senate, however, Byrd needed
unanimous consent and was unable to obtain it Tuesday when he
sought to do so.

after being brought there by ambulance, according to a hospital
statement. Her illness had not been diagnosed.
   Ms. Brown, whose streee Boggs, was the central
figure in a fight between civil liberties advocates and Mayor
Edward I. Koch over the constitutionality of a program to remove
mentally ill homeless people from the streets.
   St name was Billihe was ordered released after she objected to being
treated
against her will last October.
   ``Joyce Brown is resting comfortably at St. Clare's Hospital,
where she was admitted yesterday for observation,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Virginia Stuart. ``She is undergoing medical
evaluation, and her condition remains stable.''
   Koch said Tuesday, ``Obviously everyone will be very saddened by
any medical problem she has. I hope that she's getting good medical
care and I wish her the best.''
   New York Civil Liberties Union lawyer Rob Levy said Ms. Brown
``basically wasn't feeling good'' and was taken to the hospital
from her room at the Traveler's Hotel.
   Ms. Brown had been living on a sidewalk grate in Manhatuding congressmen,
their aides
and labor officials spilled into the street as party leaders urged
Reagan to relent and sign the measure. It was the final show of
political muscle before sending the measure to Reagan's desk.
   Absent from the ceremony, however, was Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., the chairman of the House-Senate conference committee that
fashioned the legislation. In reply to a question, Rep. Beryl
Anthony, D-Ark., said Rostenkowski may have had a scheduling
conflict.
   There have been recurrent reports, however, of friction between
Rostenkowski and House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, over provisions
of the measure. At the rally, Wright introduced Majority Leader
Thomas Foley, D-Wash., as ``the architect'' of the bill.
   The ornate Statuary Hall next to the House chamber was chosen as
the site for ceremonies in which Wright was signing the bill and
sending it on to Reagan. Officials of labor unions and religious
groups are among the invitees.
   Republicans are expected to be mainly absent from the
festivities, aimed at pressuring Reagan to drop his veto threat and
sign the bill after all.
   Reagan has been critical of the bill's curbs on Alaska oil
exports and its provision requiring companies with 100 employees or
more to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale
layoffs.
   Meanwhile, Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin told a manufacturers'
association the Reagan administration recognized the popularity of
the plant notification provision.
   ``We've gotten together _ you and us and everyone whose been
trying to `fight' the notification (provision) _ a real political
problem,'' she told the National Association of Manufacturers.
   ``The polls have indicated that, from the people I've talked to,
62 percent of the people think that plant notification is the right
way to go. Another 13 percent think it should be much more
stringent,'' she said.
   The major provisions of the bill have hardly figured in the
debate in recent weeks. They would streamline the system under
which the United States imposes import restrictions and takes other
steps to aid endangered U.S. industries and retaliate against
international trade violations.
   But there are numerous other provisions ranging from
agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil
companies.
   Reagan has been saying the Alaska provisions violate the
Constitution by discriminating against that state's ports while the
plant-closings feature would dull rather than sharpen the nation's
edge in global markets.
   Supporters of the plant-closings provision call it a humane and
decent way to treat employees and their families. But there are
only a handful of supporters for the Alaska provisions, which
Democratic leaders have been trying in vain to erase from the
legislation.
   ``I had hoped that if these offending provisions had been
eliminated the president would have had one less reason for vetoing
this bill,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said
Tuesday.
   The remark appeared to mark the end of efforts to erase the
provisions.
   The bill won final passage on April 27 but has been becalmed on
Capitol Hill while leaders sought to do some after-the-fact custom
tailoring.
   The House last week approved a resolution that would have
instructed a congressional employee to call the enrolling clerk to
smooth out any minor wrinkles in the bill _ and erase the Alaska
provisions while he was at it.
   To bring up the resolution in the Senate, however, Byrd needed
unanimous consent and was unable to obtain it Tuesday when he
sought to do so.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   May 9
   The Baltimore Sun on defense spending:
   Presidential candidates talk little about it, but the military
budget working its way through Congress is a clear signal of
painful decisions awaiting the next administration.
   President Reagan came to office trumpeting a ``defense buildup''
that in seven years raised military spending $2 trillion.
   His successor will have to trim the current Pentagon five-year
plan by at least $300 billion and perhaps more than $500 billion
(half a trillion).
   Quite obviously, a ``defense builddown'' on this scale will
require drastic cuts in manpower, in new weapons procurement, in
the number of bases scattered around congressional districts and in
overseas bases and commitments.
   But George Bush and Michael Dukakis have hardly addressed this
monumental prospect.
   Defense should be a major issue for the candidates because the
intellectuals who advise them are already engaged in debate on the
nation's future world role.
   Clearly, this is a period of marking time as the Reagan era
limps to a close. Soon enough, a new president will have to take
hold of a defense budget that will determine the country's
military-diplomatic posture until the end of the century.

   The Times Record, Brunswick, Maine, on the Reagans' interest in
astrology:
   The White House admitted ... that President and Nancy Reagan are
deeply interested in astrology.
   In a new book, former White House chief of staff Donald Regan
claims Mrs. Reagan turned to astrologers to help determine the
president's schedule.
   A day later, Reagan said in a speech that he wonders what would
happen if Earth were invaded by ``a power from outer space.''
   He said he imagines that an invasion from another planet would
unite all nations in a common defense.
   All of a sudden the president's enthusiasm for the Strategic
Defense Initiative _ Star Wars _ begins to make sense.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on Israel's offensive in
Lebanon:
   Israel undertook its first major offensive into Lebanon since
1985 (last) week. Working with its ally, the Lebanense Christian
militia, the Israeli army thrust into southern Lebanon, killed
upward of 40 alleged Palestinian terrorists, captured 20 more,
destroyed several guerrilla bases, and withdrew to Israel within 48
hours. ...
   As military actions go, this one was quick and efficient. It
appears to have accomplished its purpose _ to protect Israel's
northern border.
   That Israel found it necessary to re-enter Lebanon, foraying out
of the security zone it has imposed on that unhappy country, is
without doubt regrettable.
   The action will not make Secretary of State George Shultz's
peace initiative any easier. ...
   But let's not focus on Israel as to blame. It belongs, if
anywhere, with the Palestinian radicals (backed by Syria, Iran and
the Kremlin) who refuse to negotiate with Israel, and who use the
Palestinian refugees as pawns in the bloody, cynical game of
Mideast power politics.

   Carlsbad (N.M.) Current-Argus on alcohol:
   Anyone watching TV is likely to get the impression that you can
guzzle down alcohol like soda pop and still shoot straight, beat up
the bad guys, and rescue the heroine from a fate worse than death.
   Over the years, this constant portrayal of continuous drinking
as part of the American lifestyle has made it part of the lifestyle.
   In the process, alcoholism has become the biggest drug-related
killer of Americans during the past two generations.
   Perhaps it is time to address the problem of alcohol the same
way the U.S. surgeon general handled tobacco addiction. He did not
treat cigarette smoking as a moral problem but as a menace to the
health and welfare of the whole people.
   A similar campaign to educate and depopularize the use of
alcohol might be equally effective.

   Los Angeles Times on the treatment given undocumented aliens:
   The importance of a federal court ruling last month on refugees
from El Salvador is all the more important and appropriate in the
light of the confusion surrounding the closing of applications for
amnesty under the new immigration law.
   U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon has made permanent an
injunction requiring the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
inform Salvadorans of their rights when they come into custody. ...
   There has been, Kenyon said, a ``pattern and practice of
pressuring Salvadorans to accept voluntary departure'' from the
United States. ...
   Kenyon ordered the INS once again to inform the Salvadorans of
their right to apply for political asylum, their right to counsel
and their right to access to a public telephone. ...
   The providing of information concerning these basic rights
should be standard operating procedure for processing all
undocumented aliens.

   Sioux Falls (S.D.) Argus Leader on the Reagans' interest in
astrology:
   President Reagan is as resilient a politician as there is.
   But with only about eight months left in his second four-year
term as president, there may not be enough time for him to live
down his latest embarrassment.
   There has been some straight-faced disappointment expressed. But
many of Reagan's critics have been chuckling since last week's
disclosure that Nancy Reagan reportedly used astrology to determine
the timing of the president's speeches and travel. ...
   We find it odd that Reagan, a supporter of creationism and
prayer in public schools, is linked with a practice denounced by
some religious denominations.

   Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram on Attorney General Edwin Meese:
   One of the saddest commentaries on the state of affairs in the
last year of the Reagan administration is that FBI Director William
Sessions would be asked, and would respond at length, about the
ethical conduct of public officials.
   While Sessions' remarks were labeled as ``pure speculation'' as
they specifically concerned the many investigations into Attorney
General Edwin Meese's private and public conduct, what the FBI
chief said was worth noting.
   Sessions clearly grasps the imperative of public officials,
particularly ``those related to the enforcement of the law, to be
generally perceived by the American public as being people who
abide by the law.''
   Call it sleaze, call it greed, call it situation ethics, some
behavior simply cannot be tolerated in public officials. ...
   The perception of sleaze erodes the respect that is fundamental
in a system of laws. Choosing which laws we will obey, Sessions
said, ``is contrary to the fabric of American society generally. We
are a country of law.''
   That is something every citizen must remember, from the
stockbroker or laborer who snorts cocaine to an Ollie North who
employs drug traffickers or an Edwin Meese who peddles influence.

   The Oshkosh (Wis.) Northwestern on the message of prison
sentences:
   If sentences have messages, it is hard to tell what the message
is when a man gets a six-year sentence on first degree sexual
assault under circumstances that can only be described as extreme.
   The man was accused _ and pleaded no contest to _ the first
degree charge in March and was sentenced last week. ...
   The victim was a 6-year-old girl. She was tied up at the time of
the rape, and was totally at the disposal of the criminal. There is
even some evidence that it was not a one-time crime.
   This was an extreme case. Yet the sentence handed down is less
than one third of the maximum sentence. True, the maximum is
perhaps to be reserved for such crimes done under threat of a
weapon.
   But to a 6-year-old there's little difference whether there was
a weapon present or not.
   Knowing the man may be out in four years does not tell society
that first degree rape is being treated with the full vigor of the
law.

   The Daily News Journal, Murfreesboro, Tenn., on ``atomic
veterans'':
   President Reagan's advisers are asking him to veto a bill which
would grant some new benefits to the nation's ``atomic veterans,''
those exposed to radiation in the 1945 occupation of Japan or
during postwar testing of atomic weapons.
   We urge Reagan to ignore this advice and give America's veterans
the care to which they are entitled.
   The measure would cover some 250,000 U.S. military personnel.
Many of those were at Hiroshima or Nagasaki in the weeks
immediately following the atomic bombing of those Japanese cities
in August 1945.
   Every military man puts his life on the line for his country,
but those who entered the two bombed cities exposed themselves
unknowingly to radiation which can cause sickness and death years
afterward.
   Others affected by the bill Reagan wants to veto were in the
armed forces after the war's end, when above-ground atomic blasts
were done to test nuclear weapons. ...
   America's veterans of all ages deserve the best the country can
provide for them, and that is especially true for those who were
exposed to deadly radiation in the performance of their duties.
   We urge President Reagan to put these veterans ahead of the
government's worries about legal liabilities.

   The News Tribune, Woodbridge, N.J., on amnesty for illegal
aliens:
   Were we dreaming? Did the wealthiest nation on the planet just
open its doors to about 2 million people who have lived illegally
within its borders for the past six years?
   And is it prepared to say all is forgiven and soon you can
achieve full citizenship? ...
   We had every right to gather up illegals and give them the boot
_ a remedy that may well have been preferred by those Americans
prejudiced against the immigrants, many of whom are dark skinned.
...
   We are a nation of immigrants. With the sad exception of slaves,
our kin arrived here seeking what the best nation in the world had
to offer.
   We have not slammed the door. This unprecedented amnesty program
gives us additional reason to be proud.

   The Worthington (Minn.) Daily Globe on Vice President George
Bush:
   Vice President George Bush was telling reporters (last)
Wednesday he sometimes doesn't speak up at presidential Cabinet
meetings because he fears one day he may be mentioned in a ``kiss
and tell'' book.
   Other times, Bush said, he doesn't speak up ``because I don't
want the president to have to be choosing between his vice
president and the other members of the Cabinet.''
   Bush offered several reasons for not having expressed opinions
through the past eight years.
   But what kind of president would George Bush make if he is loath
to speak up even as vice president because someone, someday might
quote something he said?
   Anyone who aspires to the White House must be willing to speak
out and to express himself, must be willing even to risk
embarrassment.
   We must wonder what kind of president George Bush would be when
he is afraid, even now, to state his views at Cabinet meetings
because his words might sometime be included in someone's book.

   The Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle, Augusta Herald on Pete Rose's
suspension:
   A powerful message was sent to professional baseball managers
and players in the 30-day suspension of Cincinnatti Reds' Manager
Pete Rose for shoving umpire Dave Pallone in a game with the New
York Mets.
   Although Pallone showed poor judgment in delaying his call some
four seconds, thus infuriating Rose, National League President Bart
Giamatti is warning the league that pushing an umpire will not be
tolerated for any reason. ...
   But the chief reason Rose was rapped so harshly ... is because
Reds fans became unruly, throwing objects at Met players and
Pallone. ...
   Holding Rose, or any other manager, responsbile for the actions
of those in attendance doesn't make sense. ...
   The most feasible solution would be to make a team forfeit a
game if crowd control becomes a problem. And forfeit another if the
crowd still won't calm down.
   Two or three forfeits in a row should bring the rowdies to their
senses.

   A car packed with explosives blew up
today on a bridge minutes after police had chased it away from the
Israeli Embassy, authorities said. Three people were killed and 15
wounded.
   The semi-official Cyprus News Agency said an Arab man who owned
the car was arrested while trying to run away from the scene.
   A caller claiming to represent terrorist Abu Nidal's group told
NBC News this morning at a bureau in the Middle East that Abu
Nidal's organization was responsible for the bombing. Bill
McAndrew, NBC's manager of news information, quoted the caller as
saying it was the first of future attacks against Israeli targets.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-Banna, has been accused
by Israeli, Arab and Western intelligence agencies of directing
scores of terrorist attacks. They include simultaneous assaults at
Rome and Vienna airports Dec. 27, 1985, that killed 20 people.
   His group, Fatah-Revolutionary Council, broke in 1976 with
Fatah, the mainstream guerrilla faction led by Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat.
   Israeli Ambassador Aharon Lopez said the Israeli Embassy was a
possible target of today's bombing. Authorities said windows were
shattered in the building but no one there was injured.
   The Mitsubishi Pajero exploded and disintegrated in the middle
of the bridge on a main highway, less than 200 yards from the
embassy. The explosion set four other vehicles on the bridge ablaze.
   A police statement said a briefcase containing a remote-control
detonating device was found about 200 yards from the site of the
blast. No further details were available.
   A police statement said the car's driver and a Greek Cypriot
woman who was in a car immediately behind were killed. Another
Greek Cypriot, Andreas Frangos, a retired diplomat, was in another
nearby car and died of his wounds in a hospital a few hours later.
   Fifteen other people were taken to Nicosia General Hospital with
various wounds, hospital officials said.
   The news agency said the arrested Arab, whom it did not name,
had arrived on the island on March 21.
   Later today, scores of policemen converged on a Nicosia
apartment building where the man lived and searched it.
   Police said the car with the bomb had a foreign visitor's
temporary Cyprus registration plates and twice tried to park
outside the four-story embassy in a narrow side street.
   Cypriot police guards told the driver parking was forbidden and
the car sped off toward the Grivas Avenue bridge. The explosion
came a minute later, the statement said.
   ``There must have been a lot of explosives packed in that car,''
Nicosia Police Chief Andreas Trifyllis told newsmen at the scene.
   Lopez told Israel army radio: ``We do not know yet who is
responsible. But it is certainly possible that the embassy was the
terrorists' target and that the car (bomb) exploded prematurely for
some reason.''
   Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, the Foreign Ministry condemned the
attempted bomb attack.
   ``The explosion, in the wake of which innocent Cypriots were
hurt, was another attempt to exploit the soil of Cyprus for
terrorist attacks against Israel,'' the ministry said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin called it another ``terror
attempt against Israel, Israelis, Israeli representation outside
the region. Terror has become part of our life.''
   However, Rabin said he would not describe the attack as an
escalation in the war between Arab guerrillas and Israel.
   On Monday, police arrested a Lebanese at Larnaca airport who was
carrying a silencer-equipped pistol and two full ammunition
magazines hidden in a radio-casette player.
   The arrested man, Hassan Moussa, 22, had just arrived on a
Middle East Airlines flight from Beirut and the pistol was
discovered during an X-ray check.
   Moussa was ordered in custody for eight days by a Larnaca court
on Tuesday, pending the completion of police investigations.
   Police prosecutor Andreas Charalambous told the court Moussa
admitted he had arrived in Cyprus ``to commit a crime,'' but did
not give more details.
   The bridge on Grivas Avenue is crossed by the main road from the
capital of this Mediterranean island to western and northwestern
Cyprus.
   In October 1984, a car bomb explosion damaged the multi-story
building housing the Israeli Embassy, which was then in a different
part of town. No one was injured.
   Responsibility for that attack was claimed by the mainstream
Fatah faction of the PLO.
   The PLO has accused Israel of killing Khalil Wazir, a top PLO
leader, in Tunis last month as well as killing three PLO officials
in a Cyprus car bombing last February.

<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson says his decision to leave the
ministry to run for president was right but he may return soon to
his ailing Christian Broadcasting Network, according to a newspaper
report today.
   Robertson left CBN and resigned his ordination as a Southern
Baptist minister in September 1987 to campaign full time for the
1988 Republican presidential nomination.
   At the White House today, Robertson endorsed Vice President
George Bush and told reporters that he will officially withdraw
from the race on Monday.
   Asked if he would run again in 1992 if Bush loses this fall,
Robertson replied, ``It's conceivable. It's not a certainty.''
   In his interview with The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star,
Robertson said of the television network he formerly led, ``I can't
abandon CBN. It's too important to me. I've got to do everything I
can to make sure that it's healthy.''
   Robertson told the newspaper he likely would return to CBN as
chief executive officer, the title his eldest son, Timothy, now
holds. The senior Robertson also said he would appear on the air,
probably as a news commentator.
   Asked when he might return, Robertson said, ``Very shortly. It's
not too long.''
   Robertson has lost badly to Bush and former candidate Bob Dole
in GOP contests nationwide. Meanwhile, CBN has lost viewers and
donors, laying off hundreds of workers.
   ``I assumed that I had built a very competent staff and that
they would be able to run CBN in my absence,'' Robertson told the
newspaper. ``I did not realize that my personal presence on `The
700 Club' was as important as it is to the audience.
   ``I was able to do news analysis and at the same talk about
spiritual things, and we've had a hard time getting a replacement
for that, so the audience has dropped dramatically in the last
year. That has, of course, impacted contributions.''
   Robertson said his return to the airwaves would not necessarily
spell a return to ``The 700 Club,'' CBN's flagship show and
mainstay of the past two decades.
   ``It may be time to look for other vehicles to talk to the
American public and the world public,'' Robertson said. ```The 700
Club' has been around since 1967 and that's 21 years. That's a long
time for any television program.''

   The world's longest survivor of a five-organ
transplant was deteriorating today as her organs failed due to
serious infection, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Tabatha Foster, 3{, of Madisonville, Ky., was in very critical
condition late this morning at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh,
said the spokeswoman, Sue Cardillo.
   ``It's very bad,'' Ms. Cardillo said. ``She's beginning to show
signs of multiple organ failure, and her heart ... is being
supported by medication.''
   Tabatha's condition fell Monday from serious to critical after
surgeons changed drainage tubes inserted last month to relieve a
buildup of bile in her transplanted liver, Ms. Cardillo said.
   Tabatha was connected to a breathing machine and was unconscious
and under sedation, Ms. Cardillo said.
   The medication that subdues the body's tendency to reject
transplanted organs left Tabatha susceptible to infection, Ms.
Cardillo said. Doctors did not know what caused Tabatha's
infection, which has entered her bloodstream, to flare.
   Tabatha received a new liver, small intestines, pancreas and
parts of a stomach and colon during experimental surgery that ended
Nov. 1.
   Similar procedures had been performed only twice before in the
world. Both patients died.

   President Reagan hinted anew today at the
worst kept secret of the Republican primary season: his support of
George Bush's presidential campaign.
   In a sort of political tease for the formal endorsement Reagan
will make tonight at a Republican Party dinner here, the president,
accompanied by Bush, walked into the Cabinet Room to waiting GOP
congressional leaders.
   As they emerged, the lawmakers applauded.
   ``I just have very brief announcement to make and that is that
I'll have something to say about the campaign tonight,'' Reagan
said.
   The president then walked over to the table, sat down next to
vanquished Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole, and grinned
widely as reporters tried to question him, saying at one point he
had other business that needed more immediate attention.
   Bush smiled, walked to the other side of the table, and took his
seat across from Reagan.
   A short time later, Pat Robertson told reporters at the White
House he gave Bush his endorsement in a private meeting and said he
would withdraw from the GOP race on Monday.
   ``I will be making that official on Monday ... because the race
is pretty much over,'' said Robertson, who has won only 46
delegates in the Republican primary and caucus competition.
   ``I didn't ask anything for myself'' in the meeting with Bush,
he said. ``I spoke about education and the need to bring the 1984
platform into line with the realities of 1988,'' he said.
   As Robertson was speaking to reporters just outside the White
House, Bush appeared with several aides on the second floor balcony
of the vice president's office in the Old Executive Office
Building, across the street, and waved.
   Robertson said he told Bush he would work to get his supporters
to back the vice president. He said that Bush made no assurances
about specific issues.
   ``We definitely had a meeting of the minds on the platform,''
Robertson said. ``My feelings and his feelings were totally in
harmony, that the 1984 document of the Republican Party platform is
something we can all unify behind.''
   Reagan's blessing later in the day will be anti-climatic, since
it comes two weeks after the Pennsylvania primary in which Bush won
sufficient Republican convention delegates to lock up the party
nomination.
   The president chose a Cabinet Room meeting with GOP
congressional leaders to say he would complete the public
endorsement of Bush tonight at a Republican Party dinner here.
   The timing of Reagan's endorsement had been the subject of
high-level jockeying between Bush campaign and White House
officials in recent days, although there never was any serious
question that Reagan supported Bush.
   Two weeks ago, when Reagan was asked on the day after the
Pennsylvania primnary whether he was endorsing Bush, the president
replied that he thought the time had come for that, but that he
wasn't quite ready to do it. ``Let us see,'' he told reporters.
   Reagan had steadfastly maintained from the outset of the
Republican competition, early last year, that he would remain
neutral until a nominee emerged.
   The president had said that as titular leader of his party, it
would be inappropriate to do otherwise.

   About 60 monkeys attacked joggers
and visitors at the Penang Botanical Gardens after a youth stoned a
baby monkey to death, the New Straits Times reported Wednesday.
   ``Several of us saw a large group of monkeys coming towards
us,'' one jogger was quoted as saying. ``Initially, we thought they
were just coming for food and tried to chase them away. We had to
run away when they started charging at us.''
   The animals went after people wearing yellow clothes because the
youth who stoned the young monkey and taunted others on Tuesday
wore a yellow shirt, the daily said. It said no one was reported
injured.
   There are about 350 monkeys at the gardens in Penang, about 180
miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur.

   President Saddam Hussein has fired 22
senior health officials for mismanagement and negligence, the
government daily Al-Jumhuriya reported Wednesday.
   The newspaper said a parliamentary committee has recommended to
Hussein that Health Minister Sadiq Alwash be ``punished'' after
being found ``unfit'' for his job.
   It said the committee had inspected hospital and other health
facilities in many cities over the past two months and found they
were in ``very bad condition'' because of the negligence of their
directors, Al-Jumhuriya reported.
   The newspaper said the fired officials included senior health
executives and hospital directors, but it did not give any details
on the problems that led to the firings.
   The committee was set up in February and authorized to
investigate state-run institutions.

   A debate on AIDS at a World Health Organization
conference took an unexpected turn Wednesday when a delegate of
Uganda proposed an international week of sexual abstinence to
increase public awareness of the disease.
   Dr. I. S. Okware, saying he was speaking on a ``light note,''
said that barring an accord on proclaiming such a week, the agency
might consider introducing it ``on a voluntary basis.'' Other
delegates reacted with laughter.
   According to the latest WHO statistics, Uganda had a total of
2,369 cases of AIDS registered by last October. It was the highest
number of all African nations and the third-highest rate worldwide,
after the United States and France.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a deadly
disease caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   A federal jury today convicted two admitted
revolutionaries of armed robbery, racketeering and murder in a
series of crimes that included two 1981 armored truck robberies
that left two guards and two police officers dead.
   The jury found Mutulu Shakur and Marilyn Jean Buck each guilty
on all eight counts. Both defendants face maximum sentences of life
in prison for the convictions of murder while committing robbery.
   The charges against Shakur, 37, and Ms. Buck, 40, included a
string of robberies and attempted armored truck robberies in New
York and Connecticut.
   Among the robberies was the $1.6 million holdup of a Brink's
truck in Rockland County, north of the city. A guard and two Nyack
police officers were killed in the bloody aftermath of the Oct. 20,
1981 robbery.
   The pair also were convicted of a June 1981 armored truck
robbery in the Bronx in which a Brink's guard was killed.
   One of Shakur's defense attorneys, Jesse Berman, said the
verdict would be appealed. Both Shakur and Ms. Buck remain jailed,
and U.S. District Judge Charles Haight did not set a sentencing
date.
   The bank robbery and racketeering convictions carry maximum
20-year sentences.
   The jury also found, by way of the racketeering conviction, that
Shakur and Ms. Buck played key roles in the 1979 prison escape of
black radical Joanne Chesimard.
   Chesimard, a Black Liberation Army leader serving a life
sentence for the murder of a New Jersey state trooper, escaped from
state prison at Clinton, N.J., and is believed to be living in Cuba.
   The defense had said that Shakur, who is black, and Ms. Buck,
who is white, are revolutionaries who were put on trial because of
their political beliefs.
   Both Shakur and Ms. Buck were fugitives during an earlier trial
of several defendants in the Brink's case.
   Shakur, who has said he considers himself a ``prisoner of war,''
was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List until he was captured in Los
Angeles last year.
   Ms. Buck, a fugitive since 1977 when she escaped from a West
Virginia prison, was captured in 1985 with a loaded revolver. She
was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison on a weapons
charge.
   The jury reached its verdict on the seventh day of
deliberations. The trial began with opening arguments Nov. 30, 1987.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Sculpture of Woman at Vietnam Memorial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation authorizing a bronze statue of a
female Army nurse at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was approved by
a Senate committee Wednesday over a dissenter's protest that the
memorial might become a sculpture garden for special interest
groups.
   Before the bill was passed by the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee by voice vote and sent to the Senate floor, it
was amended to stress that Congress would not approve any further
additions to the memorial once a woman's statue is built.
   But Sen. Daniel J. Evans, R-Wash., was not satisfied. He noted
that a statue of three Vietnam infantrymen and a 60-foot flagpole
already have been erected on the 2.2-acre memorial site near the
Lincoln Memorial, and he predicted there would be further demands
to recognize others who served in Vietnam.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., the committee chairman, said the
bill specifies that ``this will be the last.''
   ``But the last for how long?'' Evans retorted.
   Evans, alone among 17 committee members in opposing the bill,
said that ``adding bits and pieces to this stark and dramatic
memorial'' would destroy its artistic integrity. He made clear that
his dissenting vote had nothing to do with his respect for American
women.
   The politically popular measure, introduced by Sens. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., and David Durenberger, R-Minn., with 63
sponsors, has been endorsed by the Interior Department.
   But it is opposed by the Commission of Fine Arts and the
National Capital Planning Commission, whose approval also is
required before any new monuments can be built on federal parkland
in the capital.
   At a committee hearing last February, the bill was applauded by
veterans' organizations but criticized by Maya Lin, the architect
who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
   ``I cannot see where it will all end,'' she said. ``What is to
stop someone from trying to add a female statue to the Iwo Jima
Memorial?''
   She and J. Carter Brown, chairman of the fine arts commission,
said it might be more appropriate to build a separate monument to
all American women who have served in the armed forces since World
War II. Congress authorized such a monument in 1986.
   Robert W. Doubek, former executive director of the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial Fund, warned that to add a woman's statue would
``open a Pandora's box of competing and proliferating statuary to
the ephemeral goal of literally depicting every possible
subcategory'' that served in Vietnam.
   Doubek said the National Park Service already had received
requests for statues honoring native Americans and scout dogs at
the Vietnam memorial.
   The memorial's black granite slab bears the names of more than
58,000 Vietnam War dead, including eight uniformed nurses.
   Built with $11 million in private funds, the memorial has become
the most popular tourist attraction of any national monument in
Washington. The memorial, which was dedicated in 1982, has
attracted an estimated 20 million visitors.

   Students from a California junior high got a
lesson from the school of hard knocks when the agency that arranged
their East Coast tour ran out of money midway through the trip,
leaving them without cash for food, lodging or airplane tickets
home.
   The 185 youth from Emerald Junior High School in El Cajon were
able to continue their planned itinerary today, heading for
Philadelphia in buses, only after their school board agreed to pick
up costs for the trip and American Airlines donated plane tickets
home.
   The youths' 38 teachers and parent chaperones pooled their cash
Tuesday to stay the night at a lower-cost Washington hotel after
the travel agency that arranged the pre-paid tour ``just ran out of
money,'' said principal Marge Dean, trying to oversee the situation
from California.
   ``I don't know what the travel agency did with the money but
it's gone,'' she said today.
   She said the school board voted Tuesday night to pick up
remaining costs for the trip, estimated at $47,000, and would ``ask
the parents to have some kind of fundraising activity ... they'll
probably have to have car washes'' to help defray the costs.
   ``The kids have been wonderful, a little bit teary-eyed and
concerned, but now that they know that they can continue the trip,
they're wonderful,'' she said.
   Ms. Dean said no one at East@West Travel and Tours of San Diego
had been available to comment since the agency announced Tuesday
the trip was being cancelled due to a lack of money. Telephones at
the agency went unanswered early today.
   Tour director Steve Ewalt, an employee of the travel agency who
said he was sticking with the students even though he wasn't
getting paid, said he'd directed hundreds of tours for the company
but ``this time we could sense that it was a little different.''
   ``We just found that the money was drying up,'' he said. ``When
it stops right in the middle, there's really nothing we can do
about it.''
   He said he didn't know what had happened back at the travel
agency, but that continuing the tour for the students was the top
priority for now.
   ``The kids I don't think have experienced any of the real
heartache that some of us have,'' he said.
   Ewalt said the students boarded buses for Philadelphia early
today and would spend the end of the week in New York before
heading home on Saturday.
   ``I'm just making calls letting everyone know we're still
coming,'' Ewalt said this morning prior to leaving Washington.
   The students began their East Coast tour Friday in Williamsburg,
Va., then toured Thomas Jefferson's home, Monticello, and arrived
in Washington over the weekend.

   When 3-day-old Brandie Nicole Kristoff
grows up, she'll have a fantastic story to tell about the day she
was born.
   No doubt she'll tell how dad was arrested, handcuffed and taken
to the police station for driving recklessly when he drove her
mother to the hospital.
   ``It's not funny to him at this point,'' Richard Kristoff's
wife, Jennifer, said Tuesday from Memorial Hospital of Carbondale.
``He'll look back at it and laugh _ maybe later.''
   At 5:45 a.m. Monday, Mrs. Kristoff started having labor
contractions.
   Mrs. Kristoff, 24, thought they had plenty of time for the
25-mile trip to the hospital. But, she said, every time she had a
contraction, she yelled a little louder _ and her husband drove a
little faster.
   ``Sure, I was driving faster than normal. But what else could I
do?'' Kristoff, 26, said Monday.
   When the labor pains became more frequent, Kristoff said his
wife ``was screaming and, at one point, grabbing my hair as I was
driving. I was afraid she was going to have the baby right there,''
he said.
   Police Chief Ed Hogan said Wednesday the couple was about a
half-mile from the hospital when police noticed their car.
Kristoff, they said, was driving about 50 mph, or 25 miles over the
speed limit.
   Kristoff cut off another driver while making a turn and nearly
plowed into the back of a truck, police said.
   Shortly after the couple arrived at the hospital, Officer Gerald
Edwards asked Kristoff for his license. After admitting that he
speeded, police said, Kristoff told Edwards to take his license as
bond and let him go inside.
   Kristoff acknowledged he then ``got smart'' with the officer. He
said he started to walk away but didn't get far. Edwards grabbed
him, handcuffed him and took him to the station.
   Shortly before 7 a.m. _ a little more than an hour after he and
his wife started their trip _ Kristoff was released; a police
officer drove him back to the hospital. Kristoff ran into the
delivery room just as 5-pound, 4-ounce Brandie Nicole was born.
   Edwards said ``his intentions from the very first were to write
a warning,'' said Sgt. John Knapp. ``But the guy talked himself
into a ticket, calling him all sorts of vile names.''
   Knapp said police decided a written warning was sufficient.
   After seeing his healthy daughter, Kristoff said, his anger
subsided.
   ``At least, after all of this,'' Kristoff said, ``Brandie will
have a funny story to tell about being born.''

   An attacker jumped from a jeep
today and shot to death a military judge who handles cases related
to this nation's civil war.
   The jeep pulled up outside Judge Alberto Serrano's home, where
the gunman approached his car and fired four shots, witnesses said.
The attacker then rushed back to the jeep, whose driver was
waiting, and escaped.
   Serrano, 45, died at the scene.
   Most of the witnesses were neighbors, and they spoke on
condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.
   Past killings have been blamed on leftist guerrilla groups
fighting for power since 1979 and on rightist death squads. But
police said they had no idea who the attacker was.
   Serrano was one of three military judges in charge of national
security cases linked to the civil war, including people suspected
of cooperating with the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Report Urges More European Responsibility in NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and its NATO allies
should revise their joint defense compact to shift more of the
financial and military burden onto the Europeans, a new study has
concluded.
   The report by a panel of legislators and defense experts from
the United States, Canada and eight European NATO member countries
is a summary of conclusions from a yearlong study on the future of
the Western alliance.
   The report, titled ``NATO in the 1990s,'' is to be presented
publicly in Washington on May 18. Details were disclosed this week
by sources associated with the study.
   The report says a new political mandate for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization is needed to reflect a fundamental change in
the relationship between Western Europe and America.
   The European members must take on more responsibilities in line
with the region's increased economic strength and greater political
cohesion, the report said.
   The United States, it said, is undergoing a major re-examination
of its global role in light of massive budget and trade deficits
that jeopardize not only its own economy but also the world
economic system.
   As a result of growing European and diminishing American clout,
leaders from both sides of the Atlantic should strike a new defense
bargain, the report said.
   ``It's time for a better equilibrium'' within the 39-year-old
alliance, said Peter Corterier, secretary-general of the North
Atlantic Assembly, a NATO advisory group of parliamentarians that
sponsored the study.
   ``We feel it cannot be denied that the relative weight of the
United States and Western Europe has changed,'' Corterier said in
an interview Tuesday.
   Pressure in the U.S. Congress has been mounting in recent years
for the Europeans to bear a bigger share of the cost of defending
NATO territory. A Congressional Budget Office study published
Tuesday said the United States spends 6.7 percent of its annual
economic output on defense, compared with 3.3 percent for non-U.S.
NATO members.
   The United States has been predominant in NATO since it was
formed in 1949. This is because of America's role as the nuclear
guarantor of Western Europe's security, as well as its traditional
economic power.
   The report's conclusions do not call into question NATO's
official doctrine of relying on a mixture of conventional and
nuclear arms to deter attack.
   It says a substantial U.S. troop presence in Europe, as well as
a U.S. nuclear guarantee for the alliance, remains vital to Western
security.
   Nonetheless, a new mandate for the alliance should be drawn up
soon, preferably within a year after President Reagan leaves office
next January, it said.
   The mandate should reaffirm the standard NATO aims of pursuing
arms control agreements with the Soviet bloc while maintaining a
strong defense. But it should include the following additional
elements:
   _The European members should promise to intensify cooperation
among themselves as a way of economizing in an era in which
government defense spending is expected to be severely constrained.
   _The United States should welcome a move toward greater European
cooperation on defense matters.
   _All the allies must agree that future NATO policy matters
reflect a progressively larger European influence.
   The report also recommended:
   _Creating, separately from NATO, a consultative body to
coordinate policies on security matters outside the NATO treaty
area. Membership would be open to Japan and other non-NATO
democratic nations.
   _Lessening NATO's reliance on short-range nuclear weapons and,
by the 1990s, further reducing the number of nuclear arms in
Europe. The report rejected the Soviet aim of scrapping all nuclear
weapons.
   _Establishing a NATO-Warsaw Pact crisis avoidance center, which
would bring together military experts and diplomats from both blocs
to exchange information on military activities and seek to resolve
low-level incidents involving NATO and Warsaw Pact military
personnel.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today ruled that the
U.S. Department of Agriculture did nothing wrong when it lifted a
ban on shipments of Florida citrus to other citrus-producing areas.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela's ruling was in response to a
suit filed by the state of Texas in an effort to keep Florida fruit
out of the state.
   The USDA on Feb. 11 lifted a 3{-year ban on shipments of fresh
Florida citrus into Texas and other citrus-producing areas. The
Florida fruit was quarantined after an outbreak of citrus canker in
parts of Florida in the fall of 1984.
   Officials of the Texas attorney general's office and state
agriculture department filed suit on March 9, contending that the
USDA violated its own rules in lifting the ban.
   ``With all the information put before me, I am satisfied'' that
the USDA followed the law in promulgating the rule, Vela said today.
   Texas officials sought to have the quarantine reinstated and
claimed the USDA did not allow adequate time for comment when it
lifted the ban.
   But Vela said the new protocol is so similar to one the USDA
proposed last fall that there had been plenty of time for comment.

   At least 8,000 people marched today
to demand that President Corazon Aquino allow her ousted
predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos, to return from exile to bury his
mother.
   The march began after a military court sentenced the leader of a
January 1987 coup attempt to 12 years hard labor.
   Late Tuesday, the court convicted a total of 106 officers and
enlisted men of various charges in connection with the coup
attempt, which the government said was aimed at restoring Marcos to
power.
   Marcos supporters marched at midday to the Mendiola Bridge, 300
yards from the presidential compound, where 200 riot police stood
guard. The bridge was blocked by barbed wire and two water-cannon
trucks.
   Protesters set off firecrackers and carried banners reading
``Cory regime - heartless'' and urging President Reagan to allow
Marcos to leave his Hawaiian exile and return for the funeral of
his mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos.
   Marchers chanted ``Bring Back Marcos'' and ``Cory government
resign.'' Col. Emiliano Templo, deputy capital region commander,
estimated the crowd at between 8,000 and 10,000.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos, 95, died May 4. Here body has been lying in
state at a suburban church, and no date has been set for the
funeral. Relatives hope Mrs. Aquino will change her mind and allow
Marcos to attend.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return for the
funeral, saying he threatens national security. Marcos supporters
have been linked to several coup attempts against the Aquino
government.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii after a civilian-military uprising toppled
his 20-year administration and propelled Mrs. Aquino to power in
February 1986.
   The Reagan administration barred Marcos from leaving Hawaii
without permission after the Aquino government claimed he had
chartered a plane in January 1987 to return home if a coup attempt
succeeded.
   During the Jan. 27, 1987 attempt, hundreds of dissident soldiers
stormed media and military facilities in the Manila area, taking
control of a few media facilities but surrendering about 60 hours
later. One mutineer was killed.
   Late Tuesday, a military court sentenced the leader, Lt. Col.
Oscar Canlas, and 10 others to 12 years imprisonment at hard labor.
They were convicted of mutiny, illegal possession of weapons, being
absent without leave and conduct unbecoming an officer.
   Twenty-nine other soldiers were sentenced to six years in prison
and 66 received six-month sentences for being absent without leave.
   The trial lasted nearly a year.

   A woman who was wounded during a Christmas
rampage by a gunman who killed 16 people testified today that she
crawled along the floor and hid behind a counter after being shot
in the mouth.
   ``I thought to myself, there is nowhere else to go, so I stayed
quiet,'' Roberta Woolery, a market cashier, testified during the
trial of R. Gene Simmons, 47.
   Mrs. Woolery said identified Simmons as the gunman and said she
and Simmons had been co-workers at the market for 3{ years.
   Simmons, a retired Air Force master sergeant, is on trial in the
Dec. 28 deaths of former co-worker Kathy C. Kendrick, 24, and James
D. Chaffin, 33, in Russellville. Four people were wounded during
the shootings.
   Simmons is to be tried July 18 in the deaths of 14 relatives,
including his wife, children and grandchildren. The bodies were
found at his home near Dover after the shootings in Russellville.
Police said the 14 were killed during the Christmas holidays.
   Mrs. Woolery testified that she did not know how many shots were
fired because the incident happened so quickly and she could not
distinguish gunshots from the noise made by bottles and cans that a
customer threw at the assailant.
   On Tuesday, a witness testified that the gunman wore a ``horrid
grin'' as he aimed his revolver at office workers during the
rampage.
   The gunman stepped over the body of one of his victims, ``took a
stance and pointed the gun at me,'' said Juli Money, extending her
arms with hands clasped to show how the man held the gun.
   ``I screamed, `No!' and dived behind some boxes,'' she said.
``He was grinning. He had a horrid grin that looked like false
teeth and his eyes were wide open.''
   According to police, Simmons used two .22-caliber revolvers to
kill Miss Kendrick, who friends say rejected Simmons' amorous
attention, and Chaffin, who apparently was a chance victim. Police
said Simmons had a grudge against most of the people he is accused
of shooting.
   Chaffin was shot in the right eye at point-blank range as he
opened a door at Taylor Oil Co. after he and Ms. Money heard two
shots fired in the office area, Ms. Money said. The gunman had
already wounded the company president, Rusty Taylor.
   It was Chaffin's body, Ms. Money testified, that Simmons stepped
over before aiming at her.
   David Salyer, who was shot in the forehead, also said Simmons
fired with a grin on his face.
   Simmons, who had worked for Taylor and Salyer, then went to a
nearby law office where Miss Kendrick worked and stood in front of
her desk, according to another witness, Brenda Jones. Miss Kendrick
returned to her desk a short time later and said, ``Can I help
you?''
   Simmons had his hands in his pockets but jerked his right arm up
and started firing a pistol, Miss Jones said. ``He missed her at
first,'' she said. ``She just stood there. He kept shooting.
Finally, he hit her.''
   Prosecutor John Bynum said in his opening statement Tuesday that
Miss Kendrick, a legal secretary, was shot at least four times in
the head as she sat at her desk.
   About 60 spectators were present in Franklin County Circuit
Court, including relatives of some of Simmons' family members.
   Pat McNulty, 36, of Bryant, whose brother was among the dead
family members, said, ``We've got our grief to deal with and Gene
Simmons has got God to deal with.''
   Judge John Patterson replaced one juror with an alternate during
a closed hearing. The judge said someone reported that the replaced
juror said something derogatory about Simmons.
   The trial was moved here because of extensive pretrial publicity.

   Twenty-seven U.S. and Soviet scientists
studying the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the Earth inaugurated
a year-long electronic seminar using personal computer terminals
Wednesday.
   Researchers will use their terminals to send messages at any
hour to electronic ``mailboxes.'' The messages can be retrieved at
any time by other members of the seminar sponsored by the Institute
of Space Sciences in Moscow, part of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research
in Boulder, Colo.
   The opening ceremonial exchange between Washington and Moscow
was timed to coincide with a two-day, face-to-face conference on
global warming in Moscow sponsored by the institute, the
corporation, the U.S. Natural Resources Defense Council and the
Institute for Resource Management, an environmental research
organization headed by actor Robert Redford.
   The computer exchanges will be ``a lot more collegial than your
typical international conference,'' permitting the informal sharing
of tentative ideas, trying out of approaches and asking ``what
if?'' questions, said Irving Mintzner of the World Resources
Institute, one of the researchers taking part.
   The World Resources Institute was host to the Washington
ceremonies.
   The electronic set-up is ``a workshop, I like to say,''
commented Elena Loshchenkova, senior staff scientist of the Moscow
institute.
   One of the organizers of the electronic seminar, former
astronaut Russell Schweickart, said a real conference would take
weeks to organize and would cost at least 10 times more ``for the
same productivity.''
   Last year, Schweickart, Walter Orr Roberts, retired president of
the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, and Roald Z.
Sagdeev, director of the institute in Moscow, were blocked from
using Apple Corp.'s Macintosh computers in the Soviet Union because
the Pentagon considered that machine's graphics programs too
sensitive to provide to a potential adversary.
   Climate scientists are big users of computer graphics because
their results frequently take the form of global maps.
   The organizers decided to go ahead using machines compatible
with IBM Corp. personal computers, which have less advanced
graphics capability than the Apple machines.
   But recently the export ban on Macintosh was lifted, and ``four
or five'' have been taken to the Soviet Union for use in the
program, Schweickart said.
   The electronic seminar is being supported by a grant from the
Rockefeller Brothers Fund. The seminar also has free use of
1,050-word per minute satellite and land circuits of the European
Space Agency linking the United States, Europe and the Soviet Union.
   Asked if the exchanges would be monitored by the two
governments, Schweickart said, ``Who knows and, in part, who
cares?''
   The ``greenhouse effect'' refers to the buildup of gases in the
atmosphere that trap heat normally radiated out to space. The most
important of these gases is carbon dioxide resulting from the
burning of fossil fuels.
   U.S. scientists generally agree that sometime in the next
century the average temperature of the earth will be three to eight
degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it is now.

   The jailed wife of convicted spy Jonathan J.
Pollard has been moved to the Mayo Clinic for tests to determine
whether her health is deteriorating, officials and family friends
said today.
   Anne Henderson-Pollard, who was sentenced in April 1987 to five
years imprisonment as an accessory in her husband's spying for
Israel, was flown May 9 from Lexington, Kentucky, to a Rochester,
Minnesota, medical prison facility, said Kathy Morse, spokeswoman
for the Bureau of Prisons.
   Mrs. Pollard, who suffers from a degenerative stomach disease,
will undergo tests at the nearby Mayo Clinic by her former surgeon,
Bernard Goldberg, said David Turner, who heads a group called
Justice for the Pollard.
   The group is seeking improved prison conditions for the Pollards
and a presidential pardon. Jonathan Pollard, a former Navy
intelligence analyst, is serving a life sentence.
   Turner said he believes a recent letter campaign by Israeli
parliament members and public figures to U.S. congressmen and
administration officials was having an effect. He said that for the
first time since the Pollards' imprisonment, a friend from Israel
was allowed to visit the couple at their prisons last month.
   The friend, Amnon Dror, wrote a letter to the White House saying
he was shocked by Anne Henderson-Pollard's condition. He said she
was so thin her bones showed through her skin, her skin color was
yellowish and she clutched her stomach in pain throughout the
11-hour visit.

   An Azerbaijan metalworker went on trial for murder
Wednesday in connection with ethnic riots that killed at least 32
people in February, Pravda reported. He was the first of more than
80 people charged to stand trial.
   The Communist Party newspaper said the defendant, identified as
T. Ismailov, was accused of participating in the riots in the
Azerbaijan city of Sumgait and intentionally killing someone for
``hooligan motives.'' Ismailov is an employee of a pipe and tube
plant.
   Ethnic violence broke out Feb. 28 in Sumgait during a
territorial dispute between Azerbaijan and the neighboring republic
of Armenia. Armenians had demanded that Nagorno-Karabakh, an
Armenian-dominated region of Azerbaijan, be annexed to Armenia.
   Armenian activists said Armenians living in Sumgait, an
industrial city on the Caspian Sea about 20 miles of Baku, were
hunted down by bands of Azerbaijanis.
   Soviet media have said 26 ethnic Armenians and 6 Azeris were
killed. Officials said 200 people were injured.
   All those charged will be tried in Sumgait by a tribunal led by
Albert K. Klokov, a member of the Azerbaijan Supreme Court, Pravda
said. If convicted of murder, Ismailov could be sentenced to death
and shot by a firing squad.
   Pravda quoted Zulfi S. Gadzhiev, head of the Sumgait Communist
Party, as saying even petty crime has declined since the riots, but
effects of the violence remain.
   ``Many families that left the city during those bitter February
days have still not returned home,'' he said. ``We will be exact:
more than 1,200 jobs at factories and institutions are still
empty.''
   Gadzhiev said the jobs were being kept open because officials
expect the people who held them to return.
   The unrest caused a ``bleeding wound'' that made a rift between
Armenians and Azeris, Pravda said.
   It also declared that the trials will show ``who needed to sow
hostility between the two peoples,'' a possible reference to
official allegations of foreign involvement in the riots.
   Soviet media customarily accuse such Western media as the Voice
of America and Radio Liberty of trying to foment trouble among the
many Soviet ethnic groups.

<HEAD>Conservationists Ask Americans To Stop Buying Ivory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservationists picked the National Zoo to
launch a campaign Wednesday to discourage Americans from buying
carved ivory, in an attempt to save the lives of African elephants.
   ``Most people don't realize that ivory comes from elephants,''
said Diana E. McMeekin, vice president of the African Wildlife
Foundation. ``They think it's like jade.''
   Ivory is so precious that the foundation suspects that traders
somewhere are hoarding it in the hope of a new price rise. Cynthia
Moss, author of the recent book, ``Elephant Memories,'' told
reporters that today's price for raw ivory is $68 a pound, up from
$2.40 in the 1960s.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says U.S. imports of carved
ivory are worth $20 million to $30 million a year. The foundation
estimates that 95 percent of it comes from Hong Kong, usually
smuggled from Africa through the Middle East. Japan is an even
bigger customer.
   The foundation estimates that the 800 tons of ivory sold in the
world every year costs the lives of 80,000 elephants. Americans
could save about 27,000 of those elephants by refusing to buy ivory
rings and other trinkets, it says.
   The foundation calculates that the elephant population in
Africa, which may once have been as high as 3 million, was down to
1.3 million in 1979 and about 750,000 today. Though it does not see
a threat to the survival of elephants, it predicts that the entire
environment of Africa will change because of the reduction in
elephant numbers.
   Mrs. McMeekin acknowledged that African governments, of which
about 30 have elephants on their territory, oppose the campaign.
   ``I had a four-hour fight with the Zimbabweans the other day,''
she said. ``They don't approve at all.''
   She said African governments work hard to protect wildlife and
understand that they lose money from tourists as it disappears, but
they resent action from other countries.
   Paul T. Schindler, president of the foundation, said that is why
the foundation opposes a bill now before Congress to ban imports of
ivory. It also disapproves another, which Mrs. McMeekin said is
being drafted, that would put a tax on imports of ivory with the
proceeds to be used to promote conservation.
   Schindler said that could mislead purchasers into thinking they
were helping protect elephants instead of promoting their
destruction.
   Mrs. McMeekin said she avoids using words such as ``boycott.''
But she urged Amnericans: ``Don't buy ivory.''
   She estimated that about 80 percent of the ivory in this country
is imported legally, though sometimes with the help of forged
documents, but was originally taken in violation of the law in an
African country.

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government introduced legislation
in Parliament on Wednesday to make Islam the state religion of
Bangladesh. The move sparked street protests and was denounced by
opposition parties and women's groups.
   ``Like the water lily is the state flower, Islam shall be the
state religion,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman told
reporters before Prime Minister Maudud Ahmed introduced the bill in
the house.
   The bill was expected to pass easily because the ruling Jatiya
Party of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad holds 251 of the 300
seats.
   ``The government is trying to divide the nation in the name of
Islam,'' opposition member Shahjehan Siraj said. ``Government seems
to have some bad motives behind it.''
   Witnesses and opposition leaders said at least 50 people were
injured when more than 1,000 opposition supporters stoned six
government-owned buses in downtown Dhaka.
   Bangladesh's 105 million people are 85 percent Moslem, with
Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities. The country has had a
secular constitution since it won independence from Pakistan in
1971.
   Ershad told a religious gathering in March that ``the day-to-day
life of the nation must be guided by the tenets of Islam and the
ideals of Prophet Mohammed.''
   ``This law will curtail the activities of the fundamentalists,
who are gaining ground because of Islamic slogans,'' said a senior
leader in Ershad's Jatiya Party, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The constitutional amendment is the first major bill to come
before the Parliament, which was elected last March 3. Most
opposition parties boycotted that election, and only about half of
the nation's 48 million eligible voters cast ballots.
   Twenty-one opposition groups, which have been agitating since
last November for the ouster of Ershad, pledged to oppose any
attempts by the Parliament to change the constitution. These
parties, which have no seats in the house, contend Parliament does
not represent the people.
   But Ahmed promised that the bill would not be rushed to passage.
``There shall be enough time for the opposition to speak on it,''
he said.
   ``The government will seek public opinion on the legislation,''
he added.
   Several women's rights groups have already held demonstrations
against the idea of making Islam the state religion.

   Pat Robertson, acknowledging the obvious, endorsed George Bush
today and said he would drop his own candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination on Monday. President Reagan prepared to
make his own formal endorsement of Bush as Democratic front-runner
Michael Dukakis celebrated two more big primary victories over
Jesse Jackson.
   Robertson, the former television evangelist, conceded weeks ago
that he had no chance to catch Bush. He said today, after meeting
with Bush at the White House, that he wanted to give his supporters
a chance to win national convention seats during GOP caucuses this
weekend in Arizona and Virginia, then would pull out.
   Asked if he would run again in 1992 if Bush loses this fall,
Robertson replied, ``It's conceivable. It's not a certainty.''
   Reagan, in a teasing mood, told reporters today at the White
House _ with Bush nearby _ ``I just have a very brief announcement
to make, and that is that I'll have something to say about the
campaign tonight.'' Grinning, he declined to answer questions on
the subject.
   The president is to announce what everyone already knows at a
Republican dinner tonight.
   Vice President Bush cruised to barely contested wins in
Tuesday's contests in Nebraska and West Virginia. He already has a
mathematical lock on the Republican nomination.
   But Bush's showing in Nebraska pointed to possible weakness in
the fight to come this fall. Sen. Bob Dole of neighboring Kansas,
who dropped out of the Republican race almost two months ago, still
siphoned off nearly a fourth of the vote.
   Even though he has mowed down all his rivals, Bush has made weak
showings in some farm states.
   With two more wins in his column, Dukakis moved within striking
distance of the 2,081 delegates needed to nail the Democratic
nomination. According to the latest AP delegate count, Dukakis had
1,581 to Jackson's 942.
   In West Virginia, Dukakis captured 254,206 votes, or 79 percent,
to Jackson's 45,111 or 14 percent, with 99 percent of the precincts
reporting. In Nebraska, Dukakis received 105,542 votes, or 63
percent to Jackson's 43,134 or 26 percent, with 100 percent of the
precincts in.
   Dukakis won all 37 of the delegates in West Virginia and 18 of
the 25 in Nebraska.
   Exit polls suggested Dukakis was beginning to make some inroads
into Jackson's black support, which has been all but monolithic in
contests to date. Only about 4 percent of West Virginia's voters
are black, but about a third of them voted for the Massachusetts
governor, ABC voter polls on Tuesday indicated.
   But Jackson won 24 percent of the white vote in Nebraska, one of
his best showings of the primary season among white voters,
according to ABC. Dukakis, for his part, did well among Democrats
in both states who voted for Reagan in 1984, which would bode well
for him in a fall confrontation with Bush. And he was winning
support across the ideological spectrum.
   ``Voters of different ideologies look at Dukakis and are seeing
what they want to see,'' said ABC News poll analyst Doug Muzzio.
``In a sense he's all ideologies to all voters.''
   Bush won 108,421 votes or 89 percent in West Virginia, with 99
percent of the precincts reporting. In Nebraska, he had 137,229 or
71 percent to Dole's 45,376 or 24 percent; Robertson had 10,273, or
5 percent, with 100 percent of the precincts in.
   Bush, who is spending most of this week in the capital, was
heading off Thursday on a campaign swing to New Mexico, California,
Oregon and Washington state.
   As the votes were counted in West Virginia and Nebraska, Jackson
had already moved on to Oregon, which holds its primary on Tuesday
with 45 Democratic delegates at stake. Dukakis was heading to the
state on Thursday, after a series of meetings with congressional
leaders in Washington.
   But both Dukakis and Jackson were turning their attention toward
California, whose huge primary with its 314-delegate prize is less
than a month away.
   California's June 7 contest _ the same day as primaries in New
Jersey, Montana and New Mexico _ finishes off the Democratic
primary season, and provides Jackson with his last real chance to
show some strength before the Democratic National Convention,
beginning July 18.
   ``I hope by the 8th of June we are at or closing in on the
nomination,'' Dukakis told reporters in New York City, where he was
attended a fundraiser Tuesday night. ``I'm working hard, vigorously
and I hope successfully, to see if we can wrap it up.''
   Even so, he was not discounting Jackson's strength as a rival.
   ``We're taking none of these primaries for granted,'' Dukakis
said. ``They're all very, very important.''
   Jackson's aides have indicated he will invest as much money and
time in California as he can.
   ``The race is on and the race is live,'' Jackson said at a news
conference in Portland, even as he congratulated Dukakis on two
more wins. ``We will take it all the way to the end ...I want the
nomination.''

<HEAD>Groups Laud Bill Provide Quality Schooling for All 4-Year-Olds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent business group and the nation's
two major teachers unions on Wednesday endorsed a Senate bill aimed
at making high-quality nursery schooling available to all
4-year-olds.
   The so-called Smart Start program, proposed by Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., would provide money to supplement and strengthen
existing early childhood education programs run by schools,
community groups and others. States and communities would share the
cost.
   The bill reserves at least half the spaces in the program for
poor children. Better-off families would be charged on a sliding
scale. The Kennedy bill authorizes $500 million for the program in
its first year, $750 million in the second year and $1 billion in
its third year.
   ``We believe the time for this legislation has arrived,'' Albert
Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in
testimony to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee chaired
by Kennedy.
   Both Shanker and Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National
Education Association, said preschool programs receiving money
under the bill should not emulate kindergarten or grade school but
should help young children develop and learn as individuals.
   They also said the federal government should set high training
standards for preschool teachers in federally supported programs.
   Owen Butler, vice chairman of the Committee for Economic
Development, said the group of 250 academic and corporate trustees
views the Kennedy bill ``with considerable enthusiasm.''
   Butler, retired chairman of Proctor & Gamble Co., recommended
merging Smart Start with the existing $1 billion Head Start program
at the Department of Health and Human Services. ``It makes little
sense to have two programs,'' he said.
   Butler also said he was concerned about the federal government's
reliability in paying for the preschool programs. Under the bill,
states would have to put up 30 percent the first year; 40 percent
the second; and 50 percent thereafter.
   Butler said states should have to pay 50 percent right from the
start. ``History has shown that where the federal government takes
on too big a role and the federal funding is later reduced, many
programs die,'' he said in his testimony.
   The Committee for Economic Development was formed to study ways
to address pressing economic and social problems. Last fall the
group released a study saying the nation should concentrate on
helping poor children in their earliest months and years of life,
including prenatal care and enriched preschool education.

   Joyce Brown, the homeless woman whose refusal to
voluntarily leave the street ignited a battle with the city over
the rights of the homeless, remained hospitalized Wednesday with an
unknown ailment.
   ``Joyce Brown is resting comfortably at St. Clare's Hospital,
where she was admitted yesterday for observation,'' hospital
spokeswoman Virginia Stuart said in a statement. ``She is
undergoing medical evaluation, and her condition remains stable.''
   Brown, who used the name Billie Boggs while living on the
street, possibly suffered seizures, authorities said. But Stuart
said her illness had not been diagnosed.
   Brown was the central figure in a fight between the civil
liberties groups and Mayor Edward I. Koch over the
constitutionality of a city program to remove mentally ill homeless
people from the streets during cold weather.
   Brown had been living on a sidewalk grate when she was picked up
last October and hospitalized for psychiatric treatment against her
will. She eventually won her release.

   Police have arrested a former
congressional candidate on charges that he tried to hire a hit man
to kill Mayor Henry Cisneros for $5,000, officials said today.
   Officials arrested Parker E. Abell on Tuesday and charged him
with solicitation of capital murder, said District Attorney Fred
Rodriguez.
   ``He was doing it to make a statement. He wanted to get
publicity,'' Rodriguez said.
   Rodriguez said Abell had mentioned other possible targets,
including State Comptroller Bob Bullock, but decided on Cisneros.
   ``Bullock's name was mentioned, ... but for whatever reasons,
whether it was that (Bullock) was out of town or not a big enough
name, he settled on Mayor Henry Cisneros. He wanted someone at the
local level, but with a national reputation,'' Rodriguez said.
   Rodriguez said he informed the mayor's office of the alleged
plot, but did not recommend more protection for the mayor.
   Abell sought the 23rd Congressional District seat in 1982 as a
Liberterian and told detectives he was now leader of a political
extremists' group, the American Patriots.
   Gary Johnson, Texas secretary of Libertarian Party, said today
that Abell is no longer a dues-paying member and is not on the
party mailing list.
   Rodriguez said the state's investigation began about a month ago
after Internal Revenue Service officials contacted his office
because an IRS undercover agent had talked to a man who wanted to
assassinate a public official.
   The IRS agent gave the man the name of an undercover officer who
worked for prosecutors. The two talked on the telephone, then in
person for the first time on Tuesday, Rodriguez said.
   ``He wanted a patriot to carry out the execution,'' Rodriguez
said. ``He was firm in his convictions and he wanted a hitman with
the same resolve and same philosophy.''
   All conversations with Abell were taped, Rodriguez said. He was
arrested at a supermarket pay phone Tuesday afternoon.
   Rodriguez said that in Abell's car officers found a .22-caliber
rifle with 12 live rounds and ``execution warrants'' with blanks to
fill in names of public officials.
   ``The above-named traitor or traitors are to be executed on
sight,'' read the warrants. ``Each accused has given public proof
of guilt beyond reasonable doubt that he or she is a traitor to the
people of the United States and the United States Constitution.''
   Abell allegedly solicited ``this (undercover) officer as a
shooter for himself and unknown associates,'' wrote John Veltkamp,
the undercover investigator for the Bexar County District
Attorney's office who posed as the hit man.
   The mayor said Tuesday that he never met Abell and does not
recall receiving threatening letters from him.
   ``We get threats on a regular basis _ not always with a price.
That's what makes this a little more serious,'' said Cisneros.
   Rodriguez said the investigation is continuing and that he would
oppose the suspect's being relased from jail.
   ``We got a dangerous man here. If he seeks out two hitmen he is
determining his resolve to do something,'' Rodriguez said.
   Natalia, Abell's home, is 18 miles southwest of San Antonio.

   A defense attorney in the cocaine
smuggling trial of reputed Colombian drug kingpin Carlos Lehder
Rivas told jurors in closing arguments today that Lehder's chief
prosecutor must have attended a different trial.
   ``He was in a trial in which all the witnesses told the truth,''
Edward R. Shohat said of U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who wrapped
up the government's final arguments minutes earlier. ``He was in a
trial in which there was no cross-examination of the witneses. ...
That wasn't the trial that occurred in this courtroom.''
   Lehder, 38, whom prosecutors said was a key member of Colombia's
Medellin cartel, is charged with bringing 3.3 tons of cocaine into
the United States from 1978 to 1980, paying bribes and making
threats to use Norman's Cay in the Bahamas as a private relay
station.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is
charged with smuggling conspiracy.
   Shohat said a big inconsistency in the government's case was
that the indictment claimed that all the cocaine was delivered to
Colombians in southern Florida, but the government's key witness,
an American, testified that some of the cocaine was delivered to
him.
   In his closing arguments, Merkle referred to trial testimony
that Lehder used bribes, charm and threats to run a smuggling
empire, and that for once Lehder was without such advantages.
   ``He cannot buy his way out of a just verdict. He cannot charm
his way out of a just verdict. And he cannot force his way out of a
just verdict,'' Merkle said.
   A day earlier Merkle said Lehder was waging a violent war
against the United States and viewed cocaine as a weapon.
   ``He's still at war,'' Merkle told the jury that has heard 22
weeks of testimony.
   Merkle said Tuesday that Lehder viewed cocaine as a weapon
against the United States. The prosecutor also said the Colombian
was responsible for smuggling 19 tons into the United States and
had earned $20 million.
   ``That is an example of Mr. Lehder's `children' you saw in this
courtroom,'' said Merkle. Several witnesses have testified that
Lehder referred to cocaine loads as children.
   Merkle blasted defense arguments that Lehder had been used by
convicted smuggler and key prosecution witness Ed Ward as well as
contentions that Lehder was a legitimate businessman who wanted to
develop Norman's Cay as a resort.
   ``There is simply no way the defense is plausible, credible or
believable,'' the prosecutor said. ``A legitimate businessman
doesn't attract tourists with machine guns.''
   The prosecutor said that to equate Lehder's drug organization to
Ward's group of American smugglers was like ``comparing the Boston
Red Sox to the Little League.''
   ``The evidence in this case shows a trail of bribery,
corruption, violence and personal debasement that has been created
and fostered by Mr. Lehder,'' he said.
   The jury likely will get the case Friday and begin deliberations
on the 11-count indictment charging Lehder with conspiracy,
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of
cocaine and racketeering.
   A separate Miami indictment accuses Lehder of being one of the
leaders of the Medellin cartel, believed to be responsible for 80
percent of the cocaine smuggled into United States.

<HEAD>Security Guard Writes Play About Farmer's Suicide</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lenard is cq.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After reading about the suicide of a financially
strapped farmer, a security guard began spending his evenings at
home writing a play to dramatize the plight of farm families.
   Bradford Riley's ``Foreclosure'' opens next week for a limited
run at an off-off Broadway theater in New York. Riley said he hopes
the drama will be presented across the country.
   ``No one is a spokesman for the farmer, because farmers don't
speak much,'' Riley said Tuesday in a telephone interview. ``Maybe
the play could do that. It's suited to play in a field, in
gymnasiums.''
   Riley's play is based on the experiences of the Hill family of
Waynesboro in east Georgia. Lenard Hill, whose farm had been in his
family for five generations, killed himself 20 minutes before the
land was to be auctioned in February 1986 to pay a $300,000 debt.
   Hill reportedly hoped proceeds from his life insurance policy
and a private land sale would settle the debt, but it was not
enough. When the plight of his widow, Annabell Hill, was
publicized, Atlanta businessman Frank Argenbright Jr. led a
fund-raising drive to help the family.
   That drew the attention of, among others, New York developer
Donald Trump, who contributed $39,000. Two days before Christmas
1986, the mortgage on the 705-acre farm was retired.
   ``I kept getting news clippings and cutting them out of the
paper about farmers committing suicide,'' said Riley, 38.
   But it was Mrs. Hill's story that inspired him to write.
   ``I tried to show what it's like, what makes a farmer commit
suicide,'' he said.
   ``Foreclosure'' doesn't follow the Hill story exactly. In the
play, for example, both husband and wife commit suicide, Riley
said. Mrs. Hill now lives in Augusta; her son runs the farm.
   Riley, who has dabbled in theater before but never tried a major
production, said he worked on the play for 1{ years. It will debut
May 19 at the LaMama Theater, and run for three weeks.
   Riley, who farms part-time in Blairsville in north Georgia, said
he planned to present Mrs. Hill with a signed copy of his play.
   ``Mrs. Hill's story personifies for me the American farmers'
condition,'' Riley said. ``My hopes are that `Foreclosure' will
bring the urgency of the farmers' situation to the American
conscience.''

   A developer was convicted today of taking
more than $115,000 intended for the reconstruction of 61 houses
that burned in a 1985 police confrontation with the radical group
MOVE.
   Ernest Edwards, charged with stealing money from various
accounts intended for the rebuilding project, was convicted of
stealing mobilization money, bond money, transportation expenses
and unlawfully using workers paid by the city to work on a union
hall.
   He was also convicted in a kickback scheme involving a drainage
project at the neighborhood destroyed in the May 13, 1985 fire that
killed six MOVE members and five children. The fire began when a
police helicopter bombed members of the group who had barricaded a
house to resist eviction.
   Edwards was acquitted on charges he stole $85,000 for his own
salary and for workers on the project.
   His former business partner, W. Oscar Harris, was found guilty
of failure to make required disposition of about $90,000 and
acquitted of theft by deception and criminal conspiracy charged
related to the same amount.
   Neither Edwards nor Harris showed any emotion as the 31-count
verdict was read to Common Pleas Judge Angelo A. Guarino.
   The jury deliberated about 6 hours before returning the verdict.
   ``I'm not going to try to say what won the case. I'm just very
pleased,'' said Assistant District Attorney Janet P. Houser.
   ``He's not taking it very well. ... We thought it was a
compromise verdict and a verdict that really didn't indicate that
the evidence as we presented it was properly understood,'' said
Edwards' attorney, Hugh C. Clark.
   The two men are free on bail until Friday, when a new bond must
be posted on their convictions. Bail was set at $25,000 for Edwards
and $2,500 for Harris. Sentencing is scheduled for June 15.

   Authorities on Wednesday arrested a former official
who had worked in the prime minister's office and charged him with
bribery.
   Tokyo prosecutors said Tetsuaki Hashimoto, 58, who was in charge
of the annual budget for government publicity since 1979, allegedly
received a total of $800,000 in cash from various advertising
firms, including $18,400 in bribes from July 1984 to last October.
   They said the latter sum was paid in six installments by
executives of two Tokyo advertising firms handling government
publicity.
   Arrested for allegedly bribing Hashimoto were Mokikichi
Fukuzawa, 60, president of the Sanko advertising agency, and
Tatsunori Kawamoto, 59, president of the Nihon Video Network
advertising firm.
   It was the first bribery case involving an official working for
the prime minister since World War II, news reports said.
   Hashimoto, who resigned March 1, reportedly handled the
government's publicity budget under four prime ministers, including
the current one, Noboru Takeshita.
   The government spent an annual $92 million through March 31 on
electronic media, newspaper and other forms of advertising,
according to government statistics.

   A bank teller who was seen walking
arm-in-arm with a person who fit the description of the man who
robbed her has been arrested on conspiracy charges.
   A robber escaped March 9 with nearly $3,000 from a branch of
Burritt InterFinancial BankCorp. after handing teller Cynthia
Langham a note and threatening her with a gun, police said.
   ``There was a long delay between the time she supposedly took a
note from him and announced that she'd been robbed. She waited on
two customers in the meantime,'' Detective William M. Kilduff said.
   The next day, some police officers at a conference saw the
teller walking with a man who resembled the suspect. After
notifying the FBI, police arrested Thomas M. Jenkins of East
Hartford in his room at the hotel where the conference was being
held.
   Langham, 23, was arrested Monday. Kilduff said police only
recently obtained enough information for a warrant for her arrest
on charges of third-degree larceny and third-degree conspiracy to
commit larceny.
   Jenkins has been held since his arrest. Langham was released
Monday on a written promise to appear in court later this month.

<TEXT>
   An appeals court has ruled that the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration does not have the authority to
temporarily outlaw ``designer drugs'' as they hit the market.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday threw out the
convictions of three men found guilty of distributing and
conspiring to distribute MDMA, or methylenedioxymethamphetamine in
1985 and 1986. The drug's street name was ``ecstasy.''
   The court said the U.S. Attorney General had not delegated his
authority to the administrator of the DEA to designate the drug as
a controlled substance.
   The opinion issued by Judge Robert Boochever said that federal
law governing permanent scheduling of controlled substances was
altered in 1984 with an amendment that fundamentally changed the
process for temporary scheduling.
   Judge Charles B. Wiggins dissented, saying, ``I believe the
majority demands too much of the government's crime-fighting
efforts in the face of an unambiguous delegation of responsibility
by Congress.''
   ``I believe the plain intent of Congress was to establish an
expedited system of review in order to criminalize the possession,
manufacturing and distribution of newly-developed `designer' drugs
before they become public health hazards,'' he wrote.
   In July, 1985, the DEA administrator added MDMA to a federal
list of temporarily controlled substances.
   Temporary scheduling, designed to take effect within 30 days of
announcement to avoid lengthy public comment that could jeopardize
public safety, expires after a year. It can be extended six months
if the Attorney General has begun efforts to make it permanently
illegal.
   The court did not make a finding that the Attorney General
couldn't delegate authority to place ``ecstasy'' on the emergency
list.

   Students from a California junior high school
got to continue their weeklong tour of the East Coast on Wednesday
after school officials and an airline came to the rescue when their
prepaid tour went bust.
   The 185 youngsters from Emerald Junior High School in El Cajon
had been midway through their trip Tuesday when the travel agency
that arranged the tour left them without cash for food, lodging or
airfare home.
   ``I don't know what the travel agency did with the money but
it's gone,'' said school principal Marge Dean, who was in
California helping arrange a long-distance bailout.
   The youths' 38 teacher and parent chaperones pooled their cash
Tuesday to finance one night at a lower-cost Washington hotel after
East@West Travel and Tours of San Diego said the trip was being
canceled due to a lack of money, Ms. Dean said. Telephones at the
agency went unanswered Wednesday morning.
   The youngsters continued their planned itinerary, heading for
Philadelphia in buses Wednesday, after their school board agreed to
pick up remaining costs for the trip and American Airlines donated
plane tickets home.
   ``The kids have been wonderful, a little bit teary-eyed and
concerned, but now that they know that they can continue the trip,
they're wonderful,'' Ms. Dean said.
   ``There was a little bit of time when they were worried,'' said
tour director Steve Ewalt, an employee of the travel agency who
added that he would see the youth through even though he wasn't
getting paid. ``The kids I don't think have experienced any of the
real heartache that some of us have.''
   Ewalt said he'd directed hundreds of tours for the company but
``this time we could sense that it was a little different.''
   ``We just found that the money was drying up,'' he said. ``When
it stops right in the middle, there's really nothing we can do
about it.''
   Ms. Dean said the Cajon Valley School Board voted Tuesday night
to pick up remaining costs for the trip, estimated at $47,000, and
would ``ask the parents to have some kind of fund-raising activity.
... They'll probably have to have car washes'' to help defray the
costs.
   Ewalt said the students would wind up the week in New York
before heading home on Saturday. The students began their East
Coast tour last Friday, visiting Williamsburg, Va., and touring
Thomas Jefferson's home, Monticello, before sightseeing in
Washington.

   A private organization that promotes
international exchanges said Wednesday it will sponsor a weeklong
conference in December for 300 young leaders from the Soviet Union
and the United States.
   The conference, sponsored by the American Center for
International Leadership, will be held Dec. 1-7 in an unspecified
city in the United States. A similiar event will take place in the
Soviet Union the following year.
   The participants _ 150 from each country _ primarily will be
betweeen the ages of 30 and 40. They will be drawn from various
fields where they have excelled.
   Discussions will focus on long-term cooperation in a range of
issues, from the environment to military affairs.
   Cultural and educational contacts between the two countries have
expanded greatly since 1985 when President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed a three-year agreement to broaden ties.
   Discussions are under way to continue the cultural arrangement.
U.S. officials have raised the possibility that an extension might
be signed at the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Moscow this month.

<HEAD>Bush's Foreign Policy Resume May Be More Hindrance Than Help</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush has a foreign policy resume that
stretches from Central America to the Great Wall of China, but as
he moves toward a fall presidential showdown his experience is
proving more of a political handicap than Michael Dukakis'
inexperience.
   The Republican vice president relishes describing the Democratic
governor of Massachusestts as one who ``doesn't know much about
foreign affairs.'' Bush clearly expects to overwhelm Dukakis
whenever foreign policy is an issue in the fall campaign.
   Granted that Dukakis has seemed ill at ease on foreign policy
questions including the continued validity of the Monroe Doctrine
against foreign intervention in the Western Hemisphere, U.S.
retaliation against Iran in the Persian Gulf and the use of nuclear
weapons in Europe.
   But those seemed brief, mostly forgotten incidents compared to
the incessant questioning Bush receives about his role in the
Iran-Contra affair and his knowledge of Panamanian strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega's involvement in drug trafficking.
   And, it is Bush who will be haunted throughout the campaign by
the words of his rivals for the GOP presidential nomination,
particularly former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. who
once questioned whether in administration councils the vice
president had been ``in the cockpit or ... on an economy ride in
the back of the plane.''
   Bush may yet prove correct as he anticipates that Dukakis' lack
of foreign policy experience will lead him into a damaging gaffe
when they debate in the fall.
   ``I can't wait for the debates,'' said the vice president.
   ``I can't wait for Mr. Dukakis to discuss the Noriega matter,''
he replied a week later when an Ohio high school student asked if
it was true, as Dukakis was charging, that the Panamanian general
had been on the U.S. payroll.
   Bush said he would ask Dukakis, ``What would you do about it?
... You can make a lot of unfounded criticism, but what's his
suggestion? What's he going to do and do it in a way that handles
the delicate Central American relationships that we're building.''
   Maybe, as Bush said, he can't wait to confront Dukakis on
questions like Noriega and Iran-Contra.
   But it is equally clear that Dukakis is just as eager to raise
those issues.
   What better way to defend his lack of foreign policy experience
than by going on the offense against the Bush resume.
   Hardly a day goes by that the Massachusetts governor doesn't
raise the Noriega matter. ``Who was dealing with him and why?''
Dukakis said Monday. ``Were we paying him and if so why? I can tell
you one thing: If I'm the president we won't be doing business with
drug-running Panamanian dictators.''
   Dealing with dictators is a fact of life in international
relations, one accepted by most voters.
   But the involvement in drug-trafficking makes the Noriega matter
a far more serious political issue.
   A pledge to wage a war on drugs was a theme common to the
rhetoric of all presidential candidates, Republican and Democratic.
That alone was recognition of the fact that voters were demanding
to know what the politicians intend to do about a serious national
problem.
   In 1984, Republicans were able to play back Sen. John Glenn's
jibes at Walter F. Mondale when they were battling for the
Democratic presidential nomination. It will be the Democrats' turn
this time.
   They are sure to recall Haig's comment on the Bush-Noriega
matter, the day the former Reagan Cabinet official ended his race
for the GOP presidential nomination.
   ``I do think there's been less than forthright discussion of
this issue by the vice president,'' said Haig. He refused to
elaborate, but the fact that he was secretary of state during the
first two years of the Reagan presidency made his comment
particularly tantalizing.
   Equally useful to the Democrats would be the collected jibes of
Bob Dole, the acerbic senator from Kansas who thrashed Bush in the
Iowa Republican presidential caucuses and then saw his hopes of
being the nominee buried on Super Tuesday.
   It was Dole who predicted Iran-Contra would be an issue for the
Democrats in the fall campaign. And in case the opposition needed
some help trying to describe the scandal, Dole referred to White
House advisers ``peddling arms to the ayatollah while others hear
no evil, see no evil.'' Dole left it clear that one of the
``others'' was Bush.

   A fuel leak was found in the engine of a Horizon
Air comuter aircraft that caught fire and crash-landed April 15 at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, injuring 19 people,
investigators said.
   The leak occurred because an ``O'' ring was out of place in a
fuel filter assembly, and the filter wasn't seated properly, Ted
Lopatkiewicz of the National Transportation Safety Board said
Tuesday. The findings confirmed passenger reports of ``liquid
streaming out of the engine,'' he said.
   ``An X-ray revealed that the `O' ring was damaged and out of
place,'' and a manual test also confirmed the leak, Lopatkiewicz
said.
   John Kelly, president of Horizon Air, said investigators ``found
exactly what we said the cause was'' and that it was ``not
something Horizon had fixed, touched or been involved in.''
   After landing, the twin-engine de Havilland Dash 8, with 40
people aboard, careened out of control and crashed into three
passenger loading ramps. It came to rest against a terminal
concourse.
   The crew and airport firefighters were praised for coolness
under pressure and quick action in dousing the blaze.
   The turboprop engine, a 2,000-horsepower PW-120 manufactured at
the Pratt & Whitney of Canada Ltd. plant near Montreal, was
dismantled by investigators last week, he said.
   Pratt & Whitney of Canada has asked airlines in Europe and North
America that fly the Dash 8 to check the fuel filter assembly.
   ``They have checked and everything is in order,'' company
spokesman Pierre Henry said Tuesday. He said it was possible the
filter assembly on the Horizon plane might have been damaged during
maintenance.
   ``Every time you remove a filter and put a new one in, ... if
the cover is not on properly, a leak can develop because of the
pressure,'' Henry said.
   The filter assembly had been in service six or seven days on the
Horizon Air plane and was part of ``the fuel pump that had been
taken straight from the factory and put on this engine,'' Kelly
said. ``How it got in that shape, I don't know.''
   A check of other filter assemblies Horizon had in storage
revealed a similar seating problem in one other unit, which was
turned over to investigators, he added.
   Still unknown, Lopatkiewicz said, was how the fire ignited and
why the plane went out of control when it made an emergency landing
shortly after takeoff for Spokane.

<HEAD>Republicans Pledge Unity in Nebraska; Democrats Divided in WVa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Nebraska Republicans said Wednesday their bruising primary had
given Sen. David Karnes ``the strength to win'' against Democrat
Bob Kerrey, but West Virginia Democrats remained divided by their
fight to choose an opponent for GOP Gov. Arch Moore.
   Karnes, who was running in his first election after being
appointed 14 months ago, defeated Rep. Hal Daub by a
bigger-than-expected margin Tuesday for the right to face Kerrey,
the ex-governor who swamped one Democratic rival.
   Moore edged millionaire industrialist John Raese to grab the GOP
nomination for an unprecedented fourth term, and will face another
millionaire, insurance executive Gaston Caperton, who had never
before run for office.
   Also in West Virginia, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd
easily won the Democratic nomination to a sixth term and will be
heavily favored over his Republican opponent, state Sen. Jay Wolfe.
   Daub appeared with Karnes at a unity gathering in Omaha on
Wednesday, drawing cheers from party leaders as he placed a
``Karnes for Senate'' sticker on his lapel.
   ``I learned a great deal from him,'' said Karnes, who at 39 is
the nation's youngest senator. ``Maybe he taught me too well.''
   The four-term congressman, who had attacked Karnes aggressively
during the campaign, praised his rival and said that without the
hard-fought primary ``neither one of us would likely have had the
strength to win'' in November.
   That sentiment was echoed by Tom Mason, director of
communications and research for the Republican Senatorial Committee
in Washington.
   ``Everybody would rather avoid a primary, but he got his
political act together,'' Mason said of Karnes. ``... Had Hal Daub
won, a lot of Karnes people would have sat it out.''
   But Anita Dunn, communications director for the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, noted that Kerrey has been running
ahead in polls pitting him against either Republican in a state
where 51 percent of registered voters prefer the GOP.
   ``The race will tighten up,'' she said, ``but Bob Kerrey remains
a popular figure, and against that you have an appointed senator
who just came through one of the most bitter primaries that anyone
is going to see.''
   In West Virginia, Caperton said Wednesday his top priority was
to ``bring our party together because we share the common goals of
better jobs, improved schools and a balanced budget for our state.''
   But talk of party unity held little appeal for Clyde See, who
finished second in a seven-man field.
   ``He bought this election fair and square,'' was the assessment
from See, the former House of Delegates Speaker who was outspent by
Caperton $1.8 million to $500,000. See had been the Democratic
nominee in 1984.
   Here are the returns from the major races, with 100 percent of
the vote counted in Nebraska and 99 percent in West Virginia:
   _ Nebraska GOP Senate: Karnes had 114,783 votes or 55 percent;
Daub had 93,932 votes or 45 percent.
   _ Nebraska Democratic Senate: Kerrey had 153,611 votes or 92
percent; Ken Michaelis, a disbarred lawyer, had 13,996 votes or 8
percent.
   _ West Virginia GOP Governor: Moore had 77,626 votes or 53
percent; Raese had 67,986 votes or 47 percent.
   _ West Virginia Democratic Governor: Caperton had 128,593 votes
or 37 percent; See had 93,435 votes or 27 percent; state Sen. Mario
Palumbo had 50,955 votes or 15 percent; Agriculture Commissioner
Gus Douglass had 48,376 votes or 14 percent; the rest were divided
among three other candidates.

<HEAD>Study Says Beef Fat Not As Bad As Experts Once Believed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major form of saturated fat in beef appears to
lower cholesterol rather than raise it, so meat may not be as bad
for the heart as many experts had believed, new research concludes.
   Dr. Scott M. Grundy said his work suggests that people should be
able to eat moderate amounts of lean beef without worry, although
he believes they should stick with widely endorsed guidelines for
cutting fat consumption.
   ``Beef is OK for most people in moderate amounts,'' he said in
an interview.
   Other experts cautioned that his study, based on liquid diets
given to 11 men, is too small and preliminary to be the basis for
saying how people should eat. All 11 were healthy volunteers, aged
late 50s to early 70s. The researchers cautioned that only men were
enrolled in the study and that the findings might not apply to
women.
   Grundy found that, contrary to widely held beliefs, not all
saturated fat raises the body's supply of cholesterol. Instead, one
type found in beef and many other foods seems to lower it, just as
monosaturated and polyunsaturated fat does, while another kind
found in beef raises it.
   If confirmed by other research, the finding means that food
makers may be able to use the cholesterol-lowering saturated fat to
create margarine that's more like real butter as well as healthy
shortening for cooking.
   Grundy said his work doesn't imply that people can gorge on
prime ribs or other fatty beef with abandon. But he says it appears
that three-ounce portions of select-grade beef are reasonable, and
people need not give up beef entirely to protect their hearts.
   The research was conducted by Grundy and Dr. Andrea Bonanome at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. It
was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Cholesterol clogs the arteries and leads to heart attacks and
strokes.
   In an interview, Grundy noted that Americans are already eating
leaner beef than in the recent past.
   ``By removing the fat from beef, we can still maintain its
quality and yet have very little fat,'' he said. ``Furthermore, the
fat that remains, if we eat lean beef, does not raise cholesterol
as much as we thought. So I think we can say that if beef is
obtained in the proper way, it really should not be feared as a
cholesterol-raising food.''
   Grundy is a past chairman of the American Heart Association's
Nutrition Committee and contributed to the association's dietary
guidelines suggesting that people limit their total fat intake to
30 percent of total calories. Saturated fat should be less than 10
percent of the day's calories.
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Drs. Irwin H.
Rosenberg and Ernst J. Schaefer of the USDA Human Nutrition
Research Center on Aging at Tufts University said the latest
research ``demonstrates convincingly'' that one form of saturated
fat lowers cholesterol.
   However, they said people should still hold down fat consumption.
   ``This study should not change our chief dietary message to the
American public,'' they wrote.
   Dr. John C. LaRosa of George Washington University, chairman of
the heart association's Nutrition Committee, agreed. ``It's a nice
little piece of work,'' he said, ``but it's not the basis for
dietary recommendations.''
   Fats from plants and animals differ in their proportions of
various fatty acids. Safflower oil, for instance, is high in oleic
acid, which lowers the body's cholesterol levels, while palm oil
contains high levels of palmitic acid, which raises cholesterol.
   Beef fat is high in both palmitic acid and stearic acid; both
are saturated fatty acids. Unlike polyunsaturates such as corn oil,
saturated fats are solid when cool.
   In the study, men drank three liquid formula diets for three
weeks each. They were high in palmitic acid, stearic acid or oleic
acid.
   The researchers found that compared with using the high-palmitic
acid diet, the men's blood cholesterol levels dropped 14 percent
while they consumed stearic acid and 10 percent while on oleic acid.
   Grundy said that 3 percent to 4 percent of the calories in the
typical American diet are from stearic acid.

   Her son, Ronald Whitaker, was hurt Sunday when he grabbed

   ``The car was coming as he was running out in the street,''
Ronald said. ``I had to push him out of the way.''
   Ronald was hit in the leg by the car. He was treated at a

   ``I was standing on the corner and I saw Ron hesitate and I knew
what he was trying to do,'' Mrs. Bloomfield said.
   Police said the driver hit her car's brakes and turned to try to
avoid the boys.

   A gangster was sentenced today to a
maximum term of 27 years-to-life in prison for killing a
Chinese-American journalist in 1984, an act he testified was
ordered by the Taiwanese government.
   Tung Kuei-sen, a member of the International United Bamboo Gang,
was ordered to serve the prison sentence for the murder of Henry
Liu after he completes a 20-year sentence for heroin smuggling.
   San Mateo County Superior Judge Margaret J. Kemp rejected
defense arguments for concurrent sentencing that a prosecutor said
could have set Tung free in six years. Liu's widow also had asked
the court for mercy, saying she was touched by Tung's public
repentance.
   Kemp called the slaying ``an act of political terrorism.''
   Tung, 36, received 25 years to life for murder and two years for
use of a firearm. Prosecutor Bob Bishop said Tung will not be
eligible for parole for 17 years and eight months.
   Tung was convicted by a jury in March after admitting he gunned
down Liu in the garage of the dissident writer's home in Daly City
on Oct. 15, 1984. He claimed he carried out the act for patriotic
reasons, believing he was killing a traitor on order from Taiwan's
government.
   Wearing a red prison jumpsuit and manacles on his wrists and
ankles, the short, stocky member of the infamous Taiwan gang smiled
wryly as the sentence was explained to him by an interpreter in the
packed courtroom.
   The 52-year-old Liu was a columnist for Chinese-language
newspapers in San Francisco and was killed just after publishing an
unflattering biography of Taiwan President Chiang Chung-kuo, who
died four months ago.
   Helen Liu had testified at Tung's trial that before her
husband's slaying, the Taiwan government had started sending over
former friends of her husband's to try to convince him to quit
criticizing the government.
   Tung, who is serving his heroin smuggling sentence at Lewisburg
Federal Penitentiary in Pennsylvania, is one of two suspected
gunmen to be brought to trial in the United States.
   He pleaded innocent last June despite having admitted to the
slaying at his 1986 federal drug trial, saying he was unable to get
a plea bargain and wanted to tell his story for the record.
   Tung testified that Liu was killed on orders from his gang boss
and members of the Taiwanese government. He said he believed he was
duped by his government into killing a man who was not a traitor
and also sent a written apology to Mrs. Liu.
   In a letter to the court, Mrs. Liu said she hoped others
involved in her husband's ``bloody murder'' would be prosecuted.
   Bishop, an assistant district attorney, said during the trial
that Taiwanese Admiral Wang Hsi-ling hired Tung to assassinate Liu.
   The prosecution said Wu Tun, 35, was the second gunman and is
serving a life term for the killing in a Taiwanese prison. Chen
Chi-li, 43, the reputed head of United Bamboo, is also serving a
life term in a Taiwanese prison for Liu's killing.

   A federal magistrate today recommended that
Rainbow Family members be prevented from meeting this weekend in
advance of a July gathering by thousands of family members.
   In a hearing Tuesday before Magistrate J. Michael Bradford,
health and U.S. Forest Service officials said the Rainbow Family's
planned July 4 meeting in an East Texas forest could strain
resources.
   Bradford recommended to U.S. District Judge William Wayne
Justice in Tyler that the group be restrained from advertising and
organizing for the ``tribal council'' this weekend. Tyler will
consider the recommendation Thursday.
   Attorneys for the group and the government may file arguments on
Bradford's recommendation. He will hold another hearing Friday, a
law clerk said.
   Family members will fight the recommendation and still plan to
meet, spokesman Stephen Principle said.
   ``I don't know who can stop this,'' he said of both gatherings.
``All our literature every year has said, `Ignore any rumors of
cancellations, regardless of source.'''
   Principle said no state has ever stopped the annual July
gathering.
   At the Tuesday hearing, the forest service said the loosely knit
group had not applied for special-use permits.
   Dr. Marietta Crowder of the Tyler Health Department testified
that a Rainbow Family convention the size of one in North Carolina
last year that drew 17,000 people would strain drinking-water
supplies and garbage collection abilities.
   Members of the self-proclaimed peace and environmentalist group
gathered before the hearing on the federal courthouse steps to
protest the possible prevention of their gathering.
   The group, which held its first gathering in 1972, has no
headquarters and no membership list, said spokesman Garrick Beck in
New York.
   Officials predicted about 500 people would show for this
weekend's council meeting and up to 20,000 for the July 4 weekend
event, called the Rainbow Gathering of the Tribes.
   A Rainbow Family spokesman who identified himself only as
Alabama said today that the group had scouted four possible sites
for the gatherings _ Angelina, Davey Crockett, Sam Houston and
Sabine National Forests _ but had not chosen one.

<HEAD>Wage, Price Freeze Extended After Government Fails to Get Credit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IVAN STEFANOVIC</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A wage and price freeze that was
scheduled to be lifted May 15 has been extended because the
government failed to secure enough international financial support,
a senior official said Wednesday.
   Vice Premier Milos Milosavljevic told the Communist Party's
Central Committee that international support was crucial to ending
the wage and price freeze imposed in November in an attempt to curb
170 percent inflation.
   The Basel Bank for International Settlements has approved only
half of an expected $500 million loan for debt-ridden Yugoslavia,
Milosavljevic said.
   The money is intended as an interim loan to tide Yugoslavia over
while it works out repayment schedules on other debts.
   He said the Basel Bank's action ``makes it impossible'' to
implement what the government bills as a new package of
market-oriented economic reforms, beginning with the lifting of the
freeze May 15.
   The deputy premier said he expected the rest of the loan to be
raised in about 10 days during negotiations with some unidentified
European governments and with the United States, an indication the
freeze could be lifted then.
   Yugoslavia was hoping for fresh loans of about $1.4 billion and
a rescheduling of $2 billion that matured for repayment this year
on its $20 billion foreign debt.
   It hopes to sign an agreement this month with the International
Monetary Fund on new credits and debt rescheduling. The IMF worked
with the Yugoslav government on its undisclosed new package of
economic measures, which are aimed at tighter wage control.
   Milanko Renovica, a member of the Communist Party's ruling
Presidium, said the government wage and price freezes have yielded
only partial results.
   Renovica, a former Communist Party chief, noted that exports had
increased, creating a surplus trade balance, but ``inflation has
not been curbed, wages continue to decline along with the standard
of living,'' he said.
   Living standards have fallen by one-third since 1980, while
unemployment has risen to about 16 percent, or more than 1 million
people. Last year, Yugoslavia was hit by move than 1,500 strikes.
   About 4,000 construction workers were on strike Wednesday in
southern Yugoslavia demanding higher and more regular wages, the
Tanjug news agency reported.
   ``The conclusion is that the crisis continues and deepens,''
Renovica said.
   Renovica stopped short of demanding that Communist Premier
Branko Mikulic step down.
   On Tuesday, the parliament of the Yugoslav republic of Croatia
joined the parliament of Slovenia in calling for a vote of
no-confidence in the Mikulic government because of its failure to
deal with the economic crisis.
   The attempt to unseat the government in Belgrade will be made
during a May 14-15 debate in the federal parliament on its first
two years in office.
   The Croatian move opened up a chance that the government could
become the first in postwar Yugoslavia and the first in Communist
Eastern Europe to be forced to resign.
   According to parliamentary procedure, a simple majority of votes
in both chambers is required to force resignation.

   Joe Pepitone, the former New York Yankee
slugger, has lost a bid to reduce his sentence on misdemeanor drug
charges and will begin serving the six-month jail term Monday, his
attorney says.
   A four-judge panel of the state Appellate Division in Brooklyn
upheld the sentence Tuesday.
   Pepitone's attorney, John Kelly, had challenged the sentence as
excessive for a first offense misdemeanor conviction. ``If he had
been a nobody on the street, he wouldn't have received a jail
sentence,'' Kelly said.
   The 46-year-old Pepitone, who played for the Yankees from
1962-69, has been free on $15,000 bail pending his appeal since his
sentencing Oct. 22, 1986.
   A jury found Pepitone guilty of possessing 300 pills and
glassine envelopes used to package narcotics.

   The latest edition of Donald Trump's
best-selling biography, ``Trump: The Art of the Deal,'' is two
sentences shorter after developer Samuel J. LeFrak complained a
reference to him was inaccurate.
   The mention comes during a reported conversation between Trump
and the late Roy Cohn, during which Trump tells the lawyer the
government had filed civil rights suits against his company and
many others, saying they discriminated against blacks in some
housing developments.
   Trump said he had been advised to settle, but goes on to write:
``The idea of settling drove me crazy. What we didn't do was rent
to welfare cases, white or black. I'd watched what happened when
the government came after Samuel LeFrak, another builder, and he
caved in and started taking welfare cases. They virtually ruined
his buildings.''
   The new printing of the book written by Trump and Tony Schwartz
eliminates the last two sentences of that paragraph.
   ``Sam called me and very politely said he was distressed, and
his lawyers wrote a letter to Random House,'' his publisher, Trump
told The New York Times Tuesday. ``There's nothing legally wrong
with what I wrote, but I happen to like Sam and ... didn't want him
to be distressed.''
   Gerald Hollingsworth, general counsel to Random House, said
``they were deleted out of deference to Mr. LeFrak's feelings and
out of a belief that they were not important to the book in any
case.''

   HESPERIA, Calif. (AP) _ During his 30-year career as a
professional wrestler, stuntman and animal handler, ``The Great
John L'' has tackled bears, eaten fire and broken bricks with his
bare hands.
   But The Great John L may have met his match in a neighbor who
does not see his three pet mountain lions as mere pussycats.
   John L, known offstage as Bill Clark, says he asked neighbors if
they objected to the mountain lions before he moved last month to
this desert neighborhood, 65 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   Now, he says he cannot afford to move right away.
   Phyllis Brooks of the San Bernardino County Department of Health
Services said Wednesday that John L has until May 20 to do
something with his ``cats,'' who have appeared in television
commercials. In the meantime, Ms. Brooks said, John L has moved the
cats to his brother's house in a more remote area nearby.
   ``These are professional cats,'' John L said earlier this week.
``Not run-of-the-mill ordinary cats.''
   ``The cats are like my kids _ it's like asking me to shoot
them,'' he said.

   Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Iron Maiden
and Kiss are giving some telephone users heavy-metal headaches in
this Portland suburb.
   About 200 phones are picking up the music of those rock groups
and other bands from radio station KZRC, which has its studio
nearby.
   A phone customer, Brad Moffenbier, described the music as
``noise of the worst kind.''
   Bob Simms, an installation supervisor for the GTE Northwest
telephone company, said the phenomenon was not uncommon. He
attributed it to broadcasting quirks, improperly grounded phone
lines and use of phones that are not equipped to screen out radio
waves.
   One of the station's owners, John Grant of Lake Oswego, said
KZRC, which broadcasts from sunrise to sunset, was cooperating with
the phone company in an effort to eliminate the problem.

   Singer Pat Boone says he still considers
Tennessee home, even though he has lived in Beverly Hills for 28
years.
   ``My heart yearns to be back here in Middle Tennessee,'' Boone
said Monday. ``When people ask me where home is, I still tell them
Nashville.''
   Boone was here working on The Nashville Network's program,
``Wish You Were Here,'' a recreational vehicle travelogue series.
   Boone, who turns 54 on June 1, is finishing up work on a new
album. The singer burst onto the pop charts in the mid-1950s with
songs such as ``Ain't That A Shame'' and ``I'll Be Home.''
   Boone performs about 100 concerts a year, and says he would like
to be host of a Saturday night television show to follow ``Hee
Haw.''

<BYLINE>Longstanding Aggressiveness, Impulsiveness Seen in Suicidal Teens
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study of suicidal teens clashes with the
popular notion that teens often brood for weeks and give indirect
clues before killing themselves, a psychiatrist reported Wednesday.
   ``That was very, very rare'' in the teen-agers studied, said
David Shaffer, a teen suicide expert at the New York State
Psychiatric Institute, which is affiliated with Columbia University.
   Instead, the teen-agers most commonly had a long history of
aggressive and impulsive behavior, oversensitivity and suspicion,
he said.
   ``They were aggressive to others for years, and finally they
were aggressive to themselves,'' Shaffer said.
   Their most common trigger for suicide was getting in trouble at
school, or with the police or the family, but not knowing what the
consequences would be, Shaffer said.
   He spoke at a session of the American Psychiatric Association's
annual meeting. Results of the research are still being analyzed,
he said.
   The study focused on suicides of people age 11 to 19 in the New
York metropolitan area over two years. Of the 181 suicides, 142 or
78 percent were committed by males, Shaffer said.
   Whites accounted for 71 percent of the suicides, though they
make up only 62 percent of the area's population, Shaffer said.
Blacks were underrepresented with 12 percent of suicides and 20
percent of population, Shaffer said.
   Sixty-two percent of the suicidal young people were ages 15 to
18, with 14 percent ages 11 to 14, and the rest age 19.
   To perform ``psychological autopsies,'' researchers interviewed
142 families of suicidal teens.
   Shaffer said half the male cases had shown anti-social or
aggressive behavior, while only about 14 percent could have been
diagnosed with major depression.
   About half the female cases showed depression alone or with
anti-social behavior, he said.
   Less common than the teens who showed the long history of
aggressiveness and impulsivity were perfectionists, who worked hard
at school and showed rigid personalities, Shaffer said.
   Next came girls with untreated depression, and finally a small
group of psychotic teens who had been treated, he said.
   The triggering factor of waiting for the consequences of getting
into trouble suggests such teens were probably highly anxious,
bordering on terror, when they killed themselves, he said.
   He told of one teen who had broken into a neighbor's home and
been discovered by the neighbor. The homeowner threatened to tell
the boy's father that night. The youth went home and shot himself.
   Another teen-ager, a perfectionist who worried about entering a
new school as his family planned a move to Hawaii, killed himself
the night before they were to leave, Shaffer said.
   The study also found that about half the teens who killed
themselves had a close relative or grandparent who had attempted or
succeeded at suicide. That was much higher than the rate for a
comparable group of youths who had not killed themselves, Shaffer
said.
   That hints at a possible genetic influence on suicides, he said,
but it might simply be that the young people were imitating their
suicidal relatives. Other studies have shown that people who killed
themselves show biochemical abnormalities.
   The longstanding characteristics of impulsivity and
aggressiveness in suicidal teens mean those are signals to get a
teen into treatment, said Richard Jed Wyatt of the National
Institute of Mental Health.

<HEAD>Army Says Two Soldiers Arrested in ``Military Indiscipline''</HEAD>

   Officers and soldiers at two provincial
army bases defied military discipline today, and two officers were
arrested, the defense minister said.
   Gen. Hector Alejandro Gramajo Morales told a news conferece
``there were some signs of indiscipline'' at the two army bases,
``but they were immediately neutralized and the officers involved
immediately changed their attitude.''
   Earlier, a statement from the defense ministry said a coup
attempt had taken place. Throughout the country, the media
interpreted the events as an attempted coup against President
Vinicio Cerezo's civilian government.
   But in reading from a prepared statement at the news conference,
Gramajo Morales refused to admit that a coup attempt or a mutiny
was involved. He also tried to minimize the incidents that occurred
at dawn today, saying they were short lived and the rest of the
army's 74 bases and installations were not involved.
   The general claimed the officers involved in the ``acts of
indiscipline'' were fooled and disoriented by ``speculation and
disinformation'' propagated by unnamed civilians.
   Gramajo Morales said two officers at the bases involved _
Jutiapa, 74 miles west of the capital, and Retalhuleu, 115 miles
southeast of the capital _ have been arrested and are being
investigated by military authorites.
   He did not identify them by name or rank.
   Cerezo, a lawyer and leader of the Christian Democratic Party,
was inaugurated in January 1986, replacing a military government
that had taken power three years earlier in a palace coup.
   The government and military had been in agreement on one of the
major issues in Guatemala, whether to resume peace talks with
leftist guerrillas.
   Gramajo said in an interview with The Associated Press this year
that the rebels first must abandon their weapons and said ``the
army is very close to achieving a total victory.''
   Leftist guerrillas have been fighting the civilian government
and a succession of military or military-dominated governments for
27 years. The first round of peace talks ever held in the
insurgency took place last October in Madrid, Spain.
   The government had been resisting rebel calls for another round.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
preliminary reports indicated that some military units were
involved in a coup attempt but she had no details.
   She reaffirmed U.S. support for civilian democracy in Guatemala.
   Cerezo succeeded Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, who took
control in August 1983 from another military ruler, Gen. Efrain
Rios Montt. Rios Montt came to power after young army officers
staged a coup in March 1982 that overthrew the rightist government
of Gen. Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia.
   The elections in November 1985 were the first in 16 years in
which the military did not field a candidate.
   On Monday, the national police said gunmen fired at the house of
Mario Sandoval Alarcon, leader of the rightist National Liberation
Movement, over the weekend.
   The previous week, hand grenades were tossed at the homes of two
men who served in the governments of Rios Montt and Mejia Victores.
There were no claims of responsibility.

   With post-election maneuvering under way
Wednesday in Denmark, the Reagan administration declined to
speculate publicly about how the balloting will affect continued
Danish participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``The results are somewhat inconclusive,'' State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said. ``The United States and Denmark
have a long and close friendship and the United States government
will continue to work closely with the government that is formed
after the Danes have evaluated their election.''
   The Reagan administration had been hoping Danish voters would
elect parliamentarians opposed to a recently passed resolution that
would make it impossible for U.S. ships carrying nuclear weapons to
visit Denmark. The resolution has raised questions about Denmark's
continued membership in NATO because nuclear deterrence is one of
the bedrocks of alliance doctrine.
   Tuesday's vote for 179 Parliament seats resulted in a modest
shift to the right and strengthened the parties that give
unqualified support to NATO, analysts there said.
   The future of the Danish nuclear resolution depends on whether
Prime Minister Poul Schlueter _ who doesn't want to implement the
policy _ is able to form another minority government.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said ``we have an interest
in the substance of the (nuclear) ship issue and expect to discuss
it with the new government once it is formed.''
   As the delicate coalition-bargaining unfolds in Denmark, the
United States is remaining noncommital about the situation, the
U.S. officials said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz made clear, however, during
a trip to Europe late last month that he is disturbed by the
possibility that Denmark might institute a ban on nuclear-armed
ships.
   A similar ban enacted by New Zealand led to the demise of a
three-decade alliance in the South Pacific and Shultz asserted that
Danish action to limit nuclear missions would hurt NATO as well.
   Shultz, who has said his hand in dealing with the Soviets is
strengthened by NATO solidarity, said ``if you like the benefits,
if you like peace, if you like the fact that progress is being made
in negotiations, then you ought to like the responsibilities that
go with making that possible.''

<HEAD>Democratic Group Proposes Voluntary National Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A moderate Democratic group proposed on
Wednesday a voluntary program that would link federal education,
housing and job training aid to participation in civilian or
military service to the nation.
   ``We believe that there is something relating to civic
obligation that still should be a part of our national life,'' said
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Democratic Leadership
Council. ``We seem to have lost that sense of involvement for
something more than the individual in recent years.''
   As outlined in the 66-page proposal, the ``Citizens Corps,''
would consist of young volunteers working one or two years at
subsistence wages in civilian or military service to earn vouchers
that could be used for college, vocational or job training expenses
or to make a down payment on a home.
   Nunn said the vouchers would amount to $10,000 for each year of
service and eventually would replace existing federal grant and
loan programs as the primary source of federal aid to students.
   ``This would be a shift to saying that if you're going to get
assistance from society for your education, then you're going to
serve society,'' he told reporters.
   The proposal also calls for the enlistment of volunteers over
age 65, who would be paid a modest hourly wage instead of vouchers.
They would be used primarily to fill administrative and supervisory
tasks within the corps.
   Under the plan, the corps would be administered by a small
federal agency that would set broad policy and make matching grants
to states and local governments and non-profit agencies, which
would handle day-to-day operations. Federal grants would cover 75
percent of the costs.
   The total annual cost of the program, based on the enlistment of
800,000 volunteers, would about $15 billion. Of the total, $5
billion would come from new federal expenditures, $2 billion from
local and state governments and non-profit agencies and $7 billion
to $8 billion from existing federal grant and loan programs for
education.
   Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, past chairman of the
leadership council, said the national service proposal is an
attempt to ``move away from the politics of pure entitlement to
some sort of system that involves mutual civic obligation.''
   ``There are too many people focusing on purely tangible rewards
and immediate rewards rather than a long-term sense of
citizenship,'' he said.
   Nunn said the program would focus the energies and enthusiasm of
young people on the nation's social needs, such as fighting
illiteracy, improving health care and drug and alcohol abuse
treatment, and providing child care for working parents.
   At the same time, he said, it would strengthen military
recruitment by providing a new manpower pool that would also be
less expensive than the current all-volunteer force.
   Nunn said the DLC, composed of elected Democrats at the
national, state and local level, is planning a series of forums
around the country this year to discuss the national service idea
and obtain reaction from young people. Legislation would be offered
next year.
   Nunn said he has no plans to push for a national service plank
in this year's Democratic presidential platform. But he said aides
to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the front-runner for the
White House nomination, have discussed the proposal with council
staff members.

   The West German doctor who performed the first
known successful use of one liver split in two and transplanted
into two patients said Wednesday that the procedure still is a
method of last resort.
   ``I guess the risk for both recipients will be a little bit
higher. So I think it's a step forward, but it's only a step
forward if one cannot manage the donor problem,'' Rudolph Pichlmayr
of the University of Hannover's Medical School said by telephone
from West Germany.
   Exasperated by the shortage of donor organs, European surgeons
have begun dividing livers and grafting the parts into different
patients, a development hailed by other transplant surgeons when it
was reported at a conference here Tuesday.
   ``It could double the donors,'' said the University of
Pittsburgh's Thomas E. Starzl, who performed the world's first
successful liver transplant in 1967. ``If you have patients who are
terribly ill and in equal need, it's one way out.''
   ``It's an important step forward,'' agreed Christoph E.
Broelsch, professor of surgery at the University of Chicago.
   Henri Bismuth of Paul Brousse Hospital in Paris reported at the
conference here on liver disease that he had no choice May 1 but to
divide the liver of a 40-year-old man for two women, both near
death.
   Both parts of the organ have since functioned well, although one
woman is critically ill from kidney and lung complications she
suffered before surgery, according to Bismuth.
   The liver is the only human organ that can regenerate itself. In
splitting a liver, surgeons divide it by its two main groups of
blood vessels, but a common artery and bile duct must be carefully
divided, and one half can be weaker than the other, Pichlmayr
explained.
   Pichlmayr performed such an operation Feb. 2, believed to be the
first successful attempt at split-liver transplantation in the
world.
   In the United States, about 450 people are awaiting liver
transplants, according to Arthur Harrell of the American Council on
Transplantation. About half of them are children.
   Pichlmayr said he, like Bismuth, was desperate to save two
patients' lives but had just one liver. As a result, he
transplanted the halves of a 23-year-old man's liver into a
2-year-old boy and a 63-year-old woman.
   Both recipients are home and doing well, said Pichlmayr.
   ``I can see this happening at our institution anytime soon if we
have the appropriate setting,'' Broelsch said.
   ``We have to take all the maneuvers to get more livers,
particularly of course for the smaller children,'' Pichlmayr said.
``I have many patients waiting and many children waiting and too
few donor organs.''
   Doctors have been trimming livers for several years to make them
fit properly, particularly for children.
   ``It's of course a pity to throw away the other half of the
liver,'' Pichlmayr said.
   Broelsch said the one-year success rate is about 50 percent to
60 percent for children who receive reduced-size livers, compared
to 80 percent to 90 percent for those who receive an entire organ.

   A rocket-propelled grenade was fired
at the U.S. embassy in the capital today, but security sources said
it caused no casualties.
   In Washington, the State Department confirmed the attack in
San'a in this republic on the southern Arabian peninsula. It said
the third floor facade was struck and some windows broken.
   Yemeni security sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the blast only scratched the embassy's fence.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Yemeni
authorities responded quickly to a U.S. request for assistance.
   The authorities have promised to investigate and advise the
embassy of findings, the Yemeni sources said.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the attack. The sources
said there had been no threat.
   They said many residents have possessed rocket-propelled
grenades and other light arms since a civil war in the 1960s.

<HEAD>Mixed Reception Seen for Next Wave of 20,000 Cubans a Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thirty-six bleary-eyed Cubans arrived before dawn
Wednesday to tears and hugs from relatives, but they and 20,000
other Cubans coming to Miami this year face a more uncertain
reception from the rest of the city.
   For some residents, concerns stem from memories of escalated
street crime after the 1980 Mariel boatlift; others, particularly
American blacks who feel their economic and political opportunities
will shrink with the rising Cuban population, also are concerned.
And government officials fret about the financial costs of the new
immigrants.
   ``It's a shame people tend to remember only the bad parts of
Cuban immigration, but the truth is that most Cubans have gone on
to be some of our most thriving citizens,'' said City Manager Cesar
Odio, a Cuban-American.
   Officials are quick to note that the new, carefully screened
Cuban immigrants, who began arriving by the hundreds this month,
have little in common with the 125,000 who came ashore when Cuban
President Fidel Castro opened the port of Mariel _ and his prisons
_ for six months and ignored Carter administration pleas for
controlled immigration.
   ``Not only have they been through a rigorous procedure by
federal immigration officials to ensure their financial stability,
but most will initially be living with relatives here _ that's a
support system the bulk of the Mariels never had,'' said Bobby
Bernal, refugee affairs coordinator for Dade County.
   Unlike most other immigrant groups, Cubans have chosen one city
as their own. More than 80 percent of the Cubans coming here since
Castro's 1959 revolution stayed in South Florida. They have
overtaken non-Latin whites, called ``Anglos,'' and make up 42
percent of Dade County's 1.86 million people as the largest group.
   Cubans dominate Miami politics, economy and society and
transformed a tourism-based southern city into a modern,
Latin-oriented financial center.
   Still, simmering resentment flared in the years immediately
following Castro's uncontrolled ``Freedom Flotilla.''
   A minority of hard-core criminals helped push Miami atop violent
crime statistics and that lawless image was spread with a Hollywood
remake of ``Scarface,'' starring Al Pacino as a Mariel cocaine
kingpin.
   Thousands were placed on the public dole, and state and local
governments still are seeking federal reimbursement for $150
million in services spent on the refugees.
   In 1980, Dade County residents expressed a backlash by passing
an anti-bilingualism ordinance, and continued resentment by the
remaining non-Latins often surfaces on radio talk shows and other
forums.
   ``Cubans already here would like to allow any Cuban to come over
here and live in liberty _ but you have to draw the line
somewhere,'' said WNWS radio talk show host Al Rantel, who roused
attention with his proposed referendum to put a cap on public
spending for refugees.
   Black leaders have protested every new influx, fearing Cubans
will further dilute black political and economic power.
   ``From day one they're competing for the same jobs as blacks,''
said Garth Reeves Jr., publisher of the black-oriented newspaper
The Miami Times. ``We need more Cubans like we need the plague.''
   The basis for the new immigration is an agreement signed by the
United States and Cuba in late 1984, only to be suspended by Castro
five months later after the start of U.S. Radio Marti broadcasts
into Cuba.
   That pact was revived seven months ago when Cuba agreed to take
back about 2,500 Mariel Cubans _ a move that sparked riots and
hostage sieges at federal detention centers in Oakdale, La., and
Atlanta.
   The United States then opened its doors to 3,000 political
prisoners and the annual flow of 20,000 immediate relatives of U.S.
citizens. The 36 former political prisoners and their families, who
arrived in a regular chartered flight at Miami International
Airport from Havana Wednesday, were part of another group of some
400 political prisoners and relatives whose release was secured
from the Cuban government by the U.S. Catholic Conference.
   Cubans are being issued 40 to 45 visas a day and the immigrants
are allowed to travel by any means they desire anytime within four
months of the visa, said Donna Sherman, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington.
   At that rate, about 250 arrivals per week are expected this
month and as many as 350 a week are expected by summer's end, she
said.

<HEAD>Trip to Comedy Club May Result in New Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense attorney found nothing funny about a
group of sequestered jurors taking in a show at a comedy club the
night before they convicted his client of murder.
   The night out, in apparent violation of the judge's order, could
lead to a new trial _ the third _ for Tommy Wayne Dunn, who was
convicted of paying a man $800 to kill his father in 1981.
   Attorney Mike DeGeurin appealed the case to the 1st Court of
Appeals.
   After a hearing Tuesday on the appeal, State District Judge
Jimmy James said he will urge the appellate court to deny a new
trial.
   Bailiff Don R. McCray said he ``basically didn't realize I was
doing anything wrong'' when he took eight jurors to the Laff Stop
nightclub last Aug. 19.
   DeGeurin noted a transcript that quotes James saying: ``Mr.
Bailiff, don't let the jury separate other than for purposes of
going to the hotel and (their rooms). They are not to separate at
any other time.''
   Five jurors testified that McCray told them they could stay at
the hotel with another bailiff or go to the club.
   The eight who went with McCray watched two comedians and a
hypnotist and ran up a $39.15 bar tab.
   While the hearing mostly concerned the violation of James' order
and whether the night at the club may have affected deliberations,
McCray said the liquor bill launched the fuss.
   ``This has escalated and been blown all out of proportion,'' he
said. ``It's always been my understanding that on a sequestered
deal, jurors can have drinks or wine with their meal.''
   ``This is highly unique, but nothing happened that affected the
defendant getting a fair trial,'' said Prosecutor Carol Davies.
   She and DeGeurin said they know of no other sequestered jury
being taken to a club for drinks.
   ``It's not a laughing matter,'' DeGeurin said Wednesday. ``Can
you imagine the defendant sitting in his cell with his head hanging
wondering what the jurors will decide on this case and on the other
side the jurors are out boozing it up at a club being hypnotized
and laughing it up?''
   Dunn's father, Alfred, 53, was shot twice in the back Oct. 12,
1981, as he walked across a parking lot with Robin Buchanan
Summers. She testified last year she had affairs with both the
father and son.
   The man believed to have fired the shots committed suicide in
jail while awaiting trial. Dunn, 40, is serving a life sentence on
his second conviction of murder.
   His first conviction was reversed because his lawyer, Stan
Schneider, was excluded from being present while detectives were
taking Dunn's confession.

<HEAD>Actress Madlyn Rhue to Appear in Ad Campaign for Multiple
Sclerosis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Madlyn Rhue at first rejected a
request from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society to appear in
an ad for them because she didn't want to be portrayed as a
helpless victim.
   The actress, who is one of 250,000 Americans who suffer from the
disease that attacks the body's muscular system, thought they would
be ``poor-me'' ads.
   ``I didn't want to do any of that look-how-I've-been victimized
jazz,'' she said recently.
   After all, the disease hasn't stopped Miss Rhue from acting.
Although she tried to hide the disease at first, she now speaks out
about it. Her most visible role is the wheelchair-bound ballistics
expert on the CBS-TV show ``Houston Knights.''
   But when the society showed her a proposed ad campaign by the
New York firm Wells, Rich, Green that showed people with multiple
sclerosis doing such activities as scuba diving and sky diving, she
changed her mind.
   Miss Rhue will appear in an ad sitting in a wheelchair. The
headline says ``Even With MS, Madlyn Rhue Is On a Roll.'' The print
ad campaign premieres this month.
   ``It says to the world, OK, I'm in a wheelchair,'' Miss Rhue
said, ``but look at what I can do.''

<HEAD>Big Banks Boost Prime Lending Rate, First Time Since Black Monday</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to UPDATE with 7 banks raising prime; Wall
Street reax. Pickup 3rd graf, `Many economists...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least seven of the nation's biggest banks
boosted their prime lending rate a half percentage point to 9
percent Wednesday, the first increase since just before the stock
market crash in October.
   Chase Manhattan Bank was the first to announce the increase and
was quickly followed by Citibank, Chemical Bank, Manufacturers
Hanover, Continental Illinois Bank, Mellon Bank and Marine Midland
Bank.
   Other big banks also were expected to increase the key rate,
which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base rate on
loans to many businesses and for consumer loans, including
home-equity loans.
   The impact was felt on Wall Street, where the the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks was down about 44 points to the
1,959 level by midafternoon.
   Many economists had predicted an increase in the prime rate,
which often lags behind rising interest rates elsewhere, because
the cost of borrowing for banks themselves has been rising in
recent weeks.
   The higher borrowing costs reflect a fear of higher inflation,
which has been fed by evidence that the economy is growing faster _
especially figures reported by the government last week that showed
unemployment had hit a 14-year low.
   These inflation worries have led the Federal Reserve Board, the
nation's central bank, to nudge short-term interest rates higher.
For example the federal funds rate, the overnight interest on loans
among banks, has risen above 7 percent, compared with around 6.6
percent less than two months ago.
   The last time banks raised the prime rate was in September, when
it went from 8.75 percent to 9.25 percent. The rate dropped back to
9 percent on Oct. 22, two days after the Black Monday stock
collapse. It fell to 8.75 percent Nov. 5 and fell to 8.5 percent
Feb. 2.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis rode
high-speed trains being tested for use between Boston and New York
on Wednesday, and accused the Reagan administration of failing to
promote such service and ``spending the last eight years without a
national transportation policy.''
   Dukakis, one day after widening his delegate lead with primary
victories in Nebraska and West Virginia, was flying to New Jersey
for a fund-raiser Wednesday night.
   He was to meet with congressional leaders and attend a luncheon
with Latin American ambassadors Thursday in Washington and also
scheduled a meeting with Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu of South
Africa before heading west to campaign in California and Oregon.
   The Massachusetts governor rode to Providence, R.I., aboard a
Canadian train and back to Boston on a Spanish-made train.
   Dukakis, during the 32-minute ride from downtown Boston 50 miles
south to downtown Providence, said a lack of White House support
for Amtrak and high-speed service had caused the nation's skies to
become dangerously overcrowded.
   He said air shuttle traffic between Boston and New York could be
reduced by using high-speed trains that could travel between the
cities in about three hours.
   Dukakis, who has pushed for the service as a member of the
Coalition of Northeast Governors, which arranged the test runs,
said the equipment needed for hourly service between New York and
Boston would cost about $200 million and could be financed through
a 10-year lease-purchase plan.
   ``That is a very, very modest investment for what could be and
should be a profitable service,'' Dukakis said. ``One of the
reasons our airports are so overburdened is that we have been
spending the last eight years without a national transportation
policy.''
   Accompanying Dukakis on the trip were dozens of reporters from
national and international news organizations covering his
presidential campaign. He was to pick up Secret Service protection
for the first time Wednesday but agents were not with him during
the train rides.
   The reporters also took a brief subway ride with the governor
from Park Street station, a downtown Boston subway hub, to South
Station, a subway stop that also houses the city's Amtrak depot and
served as the departure point for the high-speed test.
   Dukakis said there had been a 20 percent increase in ridership
since 1982 on the state's major public transit system. He
occasionally uses the system to travel to the Statehouse from his
home in suburban Brookline.
   The high-speed trains tested Wednesday use tilt-car technology,
allowing them to take curves at speeds up to 25 purcent faster than
conventional trains. A three-hour trip time to New York would be 90
minutes faster than current Amtrak service. The trip to Providence
was 14 minutes faster than Amtrak.

<HEAD>Summer Forecast Is for Record Vacation Travel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A travel group predicted Wednesday that
Americans will set new records in travel this summer, with the
majority taking a car, truck or camper to a vacation spot less than
250 miles from home.
   The U.S. Travel Data Center, in its annual projection of summer
vacations, said the Southeast will remain the most popular
destination, while the Midwest and Great Lakes regions, which are
in the midst of an economic recovery, will generate the biggest
increase in vacation travelers.
   Cities, the data center said, will edge out oceans and beaches
this year as the preferred destination.
   ``The economy this spring is much better than we expected after
the stock market crash,'' said Suzanne Cook, director of the data
center, ``and we're finding that summer vacation intentions are
stronger than last spring.''
   Cook said the traditional summer vacation _ ``where the parents
take the kids on a three-week summer vacation'' _ is no longer the
model for many American households, where more women work and have
less time to take long trips.
   ``We're finding that people are taking more shorter trips
throughout the year and not just one long summer vacation,'' Cook
said.
   It estimated that Americans will take 136 million vacation trips
during June, July and August, up 3 percent from the 132 million
trips last summer. Cook said the 1987 travel rate was a record.
   The average trip will last six nights, and an estimated 83
percent of travelers will use a car, truck or camper to get to
their destination, the center said. Another 13 percent will go by
plane, while the rest will take a bus or train or hadn't decided
how they will travel.
   The travel center projects that 51 percent of the summer
vacation trips will total 500 miles or less round-trip, 23 percent
500 to 1,000 miles and 26 percent more than 1,000 miles. The
average round-trip distance, the center said, is expected to be 870
miles. Cook said the figures do not take into account international
travel.
   The travel data center, a private, non-profit group that
promotes travel, developed its forecast from the results of monthly
telephone interviews of 1,500 adults. Cook said the margin of error
in the survey is plus or minus 2 percentage points. The center,
which is affiliated with the Travel Industry Association of
America, has been conducting summer vacation surveys for seven
years.
   The survey showed about 40 percent of the summer travelers will
stay with friends and relatives and another 40 percent in hotels or
motels. The rest will stay in a camper or vacation homes.
   The center found that nearly a third of those responding to its
survey _ 31 percent _ said they planned to visit a city, while 26
percent said they would go to an ocean or beach. That is exactly
the opposite of the results for the 1987 survey.
   Cook said one explanation for the popularity of cities this year
is that people from the Midwest tended to favor cities over beaches
as vacation spots, and that region is projected to take nearly 9
percent more vacation trips this year than last.
   The center expects residents of the Great Lake region _
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin _ to show an even
bigger increase in vacation trips this year: 13 percent. It
attributed the expected rise to ``economic improvement and pent-up
demand for travel'' in the region.
   As for other regions, the center projects a 3.8 percent decrease
in vacation trips by Northeast residents, a 3 percent decline by
Southeast residents and a 3.7 percent increase in trips by
residents of Western states. The expected declines in vacation
trips by Northeast and Southeast residents this year follows a big
increase last year, the center said.
   Richard Hebert of the American Automobile Association said the
most popular cities to visit in the United States are Washington,
New York City, San Francisco and New Orleans. The single most
popular destination is the state of Florida, he said.

<HEAD>GAO Faults Quality Assurance Efforts by Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government efforts to make sure Medicare
patients receive good health care are hampered by poor
coordination, questionable information and a lack of treatment
standards, a congressional investigative agency said Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office said it ``found reasons for
concern about current systems for monitoring'' the quality of care
given the Medicare program's 31 million enrollees. The government
spent $70 billion on such care last year.
   In a report, the GAO said review methods of ``uncertain
validity'' are being used and problems identified by one set of
reviewers are not coordinated for action by others.
   Further, it said, ``the accuracy of key information (generated
by reviews) is questionable'' and the federal Health Care Financing
Administration, or HCFA, does not have an adequate long-term
strategy to improve its overall Medicare monitoring system.
   Any future strategy should include setting minimum standards of
clinical practice and testing incentives to get doctors to follow
them, the GAO said.
   It recommended that the House Ways and Means health
subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., consider
proposals to assign quality-assurance responsibilities to a new or
existing federal entity.
   Stark, who requested and released the report, said he would use
it ``to look at whether we need to develop legislation to make sure
we get good quality care for the nation's retirees.''
   ``Right now we don't know if we're getting quality in the
medical care Medicare is paying for,'' Stark said in a statement.
``The GAO report makes clear that HCFA doesn't have a strategy for
finding out how to know quality care when we see it, or if we did,
to make sure Medicare is receiving it.''
   The Department of Health and Human Services, of which HCFA is a
part, was quoted in the report as agreeing with all or most of the
GAO's recommendations.
   The report said the agency opposes creation of a new federal
entity to develop quality assurance methods but would consider
improvements in internal coordination.

<HEAD>Tass: Founders of Rival Political Party Hamper Kremlin Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Tass news agency on Wednesday called
the founders of a new Soviet political party liars and
scandalmongers whose actions hamper Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reform drive.
   It the first attack by the state-run media on the new Democratic
Union, Tass accused members of ``slanderous, anti-social
activity.'' The toughly worded dispatch indicated that officials
would not tolerate any challenge the new party might mount to the
ruling Communists.
   Past attempts to challenge the Communist Party have been crushed.
   About 70 people met Monday outside Moscow to create the new
party, which seeks multi-party elections, independent trade unions,
a new constitution and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern
Europe and areas seized by the Soviet Union in World War II.
   Members of the Democratic Union expressed the hope that if
Gorbachev is serious in his campaign for a more open society, he
will allow the party to seek supporters and take part in elections,
which are tightly controlled by the Communist Party.
   Tass said the Democratic Union's platform was a ``provocation
with a political flavor'' that was so anti-constitutional it
touched off arguments among group members and exposed its authors
to criticism from the group itself.
   ``The group is nothing more than a bunch of scandalmongers
deliberately smearing honest people and hampering perestroika and
efforts to foster good relations between people,'' the Soviet news
agency said.
   ``Perestroika,'' which means ``reconstruction'' in Russian, is
the name given to Gorbachev's ambitious reform program for economic
and social restructuring.
   Tass did not say why the Democratic Union's ``Declaration of
Principles'' was unconstitutional, but the 1977 Soviet Constitution
enshrines the Communist Party's monopoly on power, calling it the
``leading and guiding force'' of the country.
   Tass also defended the jailing of Sergei Grigoryants, the
founder of the independent human rights journal ``Glasnost,'' who
was arrested Monday.
   Grigoryants, a former political prisoner, had offered to let the
Democratic Union group use a country cottage outside Moscow that he
rents for their Monday meeting.
   But police surrounded the building, arrested Grigoryants in the
yard, and broke down the cottage's doors to arrest others,
associates of Grigoryants told a Moscow news conference Tuesday.
   The Tass account of Grigoryants' arrest said: ``On May 9 ... he
kicked up a violent row on a trip outside Moscow and has been
sentenced to seven days in jail by the People's Court of Ramenskoye
in the Moscow region.''
   Grigoryants, a former political prisoner, was convicted on a
charge of resisting authorities. Andrei Babitsky, a fellow editor
of ``Glasnost'' who was also detained at the cottage but later
released, said Grigoryants had been falsely accused.
   Lawyer Valentin Yelisyenko, who also spoke at the dissidents'
Tuesday news conference, said police had no arrest warrant for
Grigoryants or any of the others arrested and had search warrant to
enter the cottage.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush Turn Campaigns Westward; Reagan Poised to Endorse
Veep</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis turned their
campaigns west on Wednesday toward final primaries in Oregon and
California, both firmly in command and focusing on the fall.
President Reagan, in a move that surprised no one, was bestowing
his official blessing on Bush.
   The lone remaining Republican opponent, television evangelist
Pat Robertson, bowed to the obvious at last and offered Bush his
endorsement.
   Robertson said he would drop his own candidacy for the
Republican presidential nomination on Monday, weeks after he had
ceased active campaigning against the vice president.
   Reagan, whose support of Bush was never in doubt, planned the
formal endorsement of his vice president at a Republican Party
fund-raising dinner in Washington.
   He delivered a political tease of sorts when he and Bush walked
into the Cabinet Room to meet with GOP congressional leaders.
   ``I just have a very brief announcement to make,'' Reagan said,
``and that is that I'll have something to say about the campaign
tonight.''
   With two fresh primary wins in his column, Dukakis took a
high-speed train ride and denounced the Reagan administration for
not supporting rail service.
   ``One of the reasons our airports are so overburdened is that we
have been spending the last eight years without a national
transportation policy,'' Dukakis said.
   Bush, with a mathematical lock on the GOP convention, and
Dukakis, with a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead for the
Democratic nomination, were both flying to the West Coast on
Thursday to begin campaign swings.
   Both planned visits to Oregon, ahead of Tuesday's primary there,
and California, which ends the primary season June 7 along with New
Jersey, New Mexico and Montana.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson campaigned in Portland, Ore., and shook
off resounding primary losses to Dukakis in West Virginia and
Nebraska.
   Robertson appeared before reporters at the White House and said
he had given Bush his endorsement in a private meeting and would
get out of the race.
   ``I will be making that official on Monday ... because the race
is pretty much over,'' said Robertson, who won only 46 delegates in
a campaign that spent more than $20 million.
   He said ``I didn't ask anything for myself,'' and promised to
work to have his supporters back Bush.
   Asked if he would run again in 1992 if Bush loses this fall,
Robertson said: ``It's conceivable. It's not a certainty.''
   Robertson said he soon may return to the Christian Broadcasting
Network that he founded and which he left last fall to run for the
presidency. He said contributions and viewers have dropped
dramatically in the last year.
   ``I assumed that I had built a very competent staff and that
they would be able to run CBN in my absence,'' Robertson said in an
interview with the Norfolk, Va., Virginian-Pilot and Ledger-Star.
``I did not realize that my personal presence on `The 700 Club' was
as important as it is to the audience.''
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, rode two high-speed trains
being tested for use between Boston and New York and denounced the
Reagan administration for what he said was no national
transportation policy and a failure to support Amtrak.
   He rode the trains from Boston to Providence, R.I., and back, a
50-mile one-way trip that the train covered in 32 minutes. He said
equipment needed for hourly service between New York and Boston
would cost about $200 million.
   ``This is a very, very modest investment for what could be and
should be a profitable service,'' Dukakis said.
   Jackson spoke to about 1,800 students at the predominantly black
Jefferson High School in Portland. He exhorted them to reject drugs
and violence, and afterward led a 15-block anti-drug march from the
school through one of the city's most crime-ridden areas.
   ``You get those guns out of your pockets and the drugs out of
your life, and you can make a difference,'' he said.
   Jackson insisted he was in the race until the end, despite two
more landslide wins by Dukakis Tuesday night including a delegate
shutout of Jackson in West Virginia.
   Dukakis has moved within striking distance of the 2,081
delegates needed to nail down the Democratic nomination. According
to the latest Associated Press delegate count, Dukakis had 1,589 to
Jackson's 944.

   A man who pursued his estranged wife
for two years, then shot her 13 times and stuffed her body in an
oven, was sentenced Wednesday to 28{ years to life in prison.
   A jury found Michael Linton, 32, of Yonkers guilty in February
of the murder in February 1987 of Yvonne Renee Linton in her
Yonkers apartment. He was also convicted of attempted assault on a
friend of Mrs. Linton who was in the apartment moments before the
killing.
   Linton entered his wife's apartment from the fire escape and
attacked her and the friend as she spoke to her mother on the phone.
   She shouted, ``Michael, you're a murderer!'' her mother said.
   Their three children were asleep when he came in and did not see
him.
   State Supreme Court Justice Nicholas Colabella imposed a 25-year
to life term for murder and a 3{- to seven-year term for the
attempted assault conviction _ both the maximum _ and ordered that
they be served consecutively.
   Linton says he is innocent and will appeal.
   The murder occurred one day before Linton was due in court to
answer a charge that he had violated a judge's order of protection
barring him from contacting his wife, who was divorcing him.
   According to prosecutor Jeanine Ferris Pirro, Linton pursued his
wife for two years from North Carolina to Yonkers, repeatedly
threatening her.
   The couple's 11-year-old son, Michael Jr., testified that his
father had repeatedly said he would ``hunt down'' his wife and kill
her for leaving him.

   He came under suspicion in 1951 after two other British spies,
Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, defected to the Soviet Union.

   About 4,000 construction workers
demanding higher wages were on strike Wednesday in southern
Yugoslavia, the Tanjug news agency reported.
   The strikes began Tuesday when 1,000 workers stopped work in
Pristina, capital of the southern region of Kosovo. The workers
were demanding pay raises of 100 percent. Most make about $50 a
month.
   Izet Sheku, trade union president in Pristina, informed the
strikers about an economic recovery program of their construction
company. Tanjug said most workers greeted the news with applause,
but a few taunted Sheku that ``you promised us a lot before but
nothing was realized.''
   The workers protested excessive bureaucracy and organization in
the company without any decision taken on whether to continue the
strike, Tanjug said. The agency said the number of workers on
strike in and around Pristina, capital of Yugoslavia's poorest
region, rose to 4,000 Wednesday.
   About 2,000 textile workers of a textile plant in Djakovica,
another Kosovo town, went on strike a week ago demanding higher
pays before they were accomodated.
   In 1987, according to official estimates, there were more than
1,570 strikes in Yugoslavia involving some 365,000 workers.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Denies Texas Ban On Florida Citrus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Wednesday blocked
Texas officials' attempt to keep fresh Florida citrus out of the
Lone Star State.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela ruled that the U.S. Department
of Agriculture followed the law in February when it lifted a
3{-year ban on shipments of fresh Florida citrus to other
citrus-producing areas.
   Texas officials had sought to have the quarantine reinstated;
they claimed the USDA did not allow adequate time for comment when
it lifted the ban. Vela's ruling was in response to a suit filed by
the state of Texas in an effort to stop shipments of the Florida
fruit into the state.
   ``With all the information put before me, I am satisfied that
the USDA followed the law in promulgating the rule,'' Vela said
Wednesday.
   The USDA on Feb. 11 lifted the ban on shipments of fresh Florida
citrus into Texas and other citrus-producing areas. The Florida
fruit was quarantined after an outbreak of citrus canker there in
August 1984.
   Canker can damage the plants and cause lesions on the fruit or
make it drop prematurely.
   After the USDA lifted the ban, Texas issued a 30-day emergency
quarantine.
   Then on March 9, officials of the Texas attorney general's
office and state agriculture department sued, contending the USDA
violated its own rules in lifting the ban without allowing a period
for comment.
   Texas citrus producers contend that an outbreak of canker would
devastate the state's $65 million citrus industry; Florida
officials have maintained that the canker is under control and the
threat to Texas is minimal.

   In Nicosia, Cyprus, a car loaded with dynamite blew up near the
Israeli Embassy. The explosion killed the car's driver and two
Cypriots. Police said 15 people were injured in the blast about 200
yards from the embassy.
   Police said the driver of the car tried to park outside the
embassy building twice but was told by police he had to move. When
asked for his identification, the driver took off at high speed,
rammed another car at an intersection and the dynamite exploded.
   The car's owner, a Lebanese arrested near the scene, was in the
vehicle but ran away just before the explosion.
   An anonymous caller told NBC News the Abu Nidal Palestinian

   Police said 26 people were killed and 61 wounded, bringing total

   The battle raged for eight hours, and sporadic fire continued
after a cease-fire called by Syrian and Iranian mediators. The

refuse to obtain new government identity cards.
   The Israeli army began a campaign Tuesday to force 400,000
residents of the Gaza Strip to get new ID cards, a move that
Palestinians say aims to catch tax evaders and break the uprising.
   In Jerusalem and its suburbs, police and soldiers arrested

<HEAD>China Suspends Fireworks Exports After U.S. Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 26 million defective or mislabeled
fireworks have been seized in a federal crackdown that reportedly
has led China to suspend export production of firecrackers.
   More than 100,000 cartons of Chinese fireworks awaiting shipment
were recalled and production of fireworks intended for export to
the United States was halted in April, until quality control can be
improved, sources familiar with the Chinese fireworks industry said
Wednesday.
   The sources spoke on condition they not be identified.
   Zheng Wanchen of the Chinese Embassy in Washington said he had
no information on the report. Wilson W. Mao, head of the importing
company Hop Kee Pyrotechnics Ltd. in Monterey Park, Calif., was out
of town and not available for comment, his office said.
   But officials of the Consumer Product Safety Commission
comfirmed that more than $2 million worth of imported fireworks has
been seized in recent weeks in a joint operation with the U.S.
Customs Service.
   That operation concentrated on imported products arriving at
customs offices in San Francisco, Cleveland, Chicago, Philadelphia,
Baltimore and Charleston, S.C.. the safety commission reported.
   Mislabeling and overloaded fireworks were the most common
problems cited by the agency, which seized more than 15 million
``Thunder Bomb'' firecrackers containing between 72 milligrams and
84 milligrams of powder. Federal law limits firecrackers to 50
milligrams.
   The crackdown doesn't mean there will be no Fourth of July
fireworks, agency officials added. In San Francisco, for example,
some two-thirds of the imported products passed inspection and were
allowed into the country.
   The effort does represent a shift in emphasis from inspecting
retail dealers to trying to stop problems before they are widely
distribued, according to Safety Commission Chairman Terrence M.
Scanlon.
   ``We have taken enforcement of U.S. government safety standards
from the roadside to the dockside in an effort to be more
effective,'' Scanlon said Tuesday in a statement in Cleveland where
he announced ``Midwest Thunder,'' the joint Customs-CPSC operation
in that area.
   The effort combining the work of the two federal agencies will
give taxpayers ``more bang'' for the dollar, said John Mackey, an
aide to Scanlon.
   Officials predicted the effort would lead to the availability
this year of safer firecrackers.
   In 1987 more than 9,000 Americans were injured by fireworks
seriously enough to require hospital treatment, the safty agency
said.
   Seized fireworks can be returned to commerce and sold if the
problem is repaired, such as improving the labeling and warnings,
according to officials. Products that cannot be fixed are
destroyed, they said.

   A man arrested for allegedly running a
multimillion-dollar cocaine operation adopted the lifestyle of a
cocaine kingpin played by Al Pacino in the movie ``Scarface,''
authorities said.
   Thomas Mickens, 24, was taken into custody Tuesday at his
$760,000 house on Long Island by police and FBI agents, Police
Commissioner Benjamin Ward said.
   A silver Rolls-Royce worth $121,000 was parked in the garage at
the Dix Hills house, Ward said. Mickens bought as many as 19 luxury
cars with drug profits, police said.
   Mickens apparently also used neighborhood businesses he owned to
launder money from his cocaine operations in the city and in
Atlantic City, N.J., authorities said.
   Mickens used the name Tony Montana, Pacino's character in the
1983 movie, authorities said.
   ``His favorite movie was `Scarface,''' said Capt. Charles Mattes
of the Queens narcotics squad. ``He tried to model his existence
after that character.''
   Mickens allegedly employed nearly 100 street-level dealers and
pushers in a 2-year-old heroin and cocaine network based in the
borough of Queens but also flourished in Harlem and in Atlantic
City, according to a criminal complaint obtained by U.S. Attorney
Andrew J. Maloney.
   Two locations in Queens and homes in Miami and Atlantic City
were searched. Authorities also seized a bar, a grocery store and a
sporting goods store, all named ``Tony Montana'' and owned by
Mickens.
   Only a small amount of drugs was found during Tuesday's arrests,
Mattes said. Authorities, he added, were mostly looking for records
and documents that would describe Mickens' organization and perhaps
lead to more arrests.
   ``We believe taking this organization down dismantles a major
flow of narcotics into this area,'' Ward said. Mattes described
Mickens' operation as a ``multimillion-dollar organization'' but he
refused to say exactly how much money it made.
   Mickens was not linked to the drug-related violence that led to
the death of police Officer Edward Byrne, who was gunned down Feb.
26 while protecting the home of a witness, Ward said.
   Mickens faces federal charges of conspiracy and possession and
distribution of narcotics. He is being held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center, pending a bail hearing Thursday, said Charles
Rose, an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District.
   Six other men, believed to be lieutenants in Mickens'
organization, were also picked up Tuesday. All were charged with
conspiracy and possession and distribution of narcotics.

   A former hostage said Wednesday that he and two
other Frenchmen were freed by captors in Lebanon because the public
pressured France to negotiate with Iran, and he urged Americans and
Britons to do the same.
   ``I don't understand the Americans and the British,'' said
journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann.
   ``I have the impression that they have abandoned their hostages.
But these men are suffering, and what is to be done has to be done
very quickly. It is urgent,'' he said.
   Outgoing Premier Jacques Chirac thanked Iran for its help in
freeing the French hostages. He said the Islamic Republic had
intervened to get them out of Lebanon and announced that diplomatic
relations between France and Iran, broken last July, may be
reestablished.
   Nine Americans and three Britons are among the 18 foreigners
still held captive by pro-Iranian Shiite extremists in Lebanon. The
U.S. and British governments have said they will not negotiate with
terrorists.
   Kauffmann spoke to 250 reporters, a former American hostage and
relatives of hostages at a packed news conference in a Left Bank
theater.
   ``There was a consensus among the French that they wanted to
free their hostages, and they supported what their government did
to get us out,'' he said.
   Kauffmann, 44, and diplomats Marcel Carton, 64, and Marcel
Fontaine, 45, were freed May 4 in Beirut. They had been held by the
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group Islamic Jihad for three years.
   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua oversaw negotiations that led
to their release. A fourth French hostage, Michel Seurat, died in
captivity.
   Kauffmann said he believed all nine of the American hostages and
the three British hostages were still alive.
   He was flanked by his wife, Joelle, and the head of the
committee of journalists who pressured the government for his
release. Kauffmann writes for the weekly news magazine L'Evenement
du Jeudi.
   Kauffman refused to discuss the status of the foreign hostages.
He said that doing so could put them in danger or cause them to
lose the small privileges that make life bearable: the few books
and cigarettes they are sometimes allowed.
   Former American hostage David Jacobsen sat in the front row
beside Jill Morrell, fiance of British television journalist John
McCarthy, 31, kidnapped April 17, 1986.
   Peggy Say, sister of American journalist Terry Anderson, the
longest-held hostage, spoke to Kauffmann and the other two French
hostages. Fontaine shared a cell with Anderson for several months.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was seized in west Beirut March 16, 1985.
   ``I have never tried to tell my government exactly what to do,''
said Mrs. Say. ``But I think that after more than three years, they
could, perhaps, take some pointers from the French and follow the
leads and initiatives the French government has provided.''
   Mrs. Say met earlier in the day with Pasqua.
   During the two years that Pasqua and the government of Chirac
were in office, 10 French hostages were freed in Lebanon. No French
hostages are believed to remain in the hands of the kidnappers.
   Asked what the American government was doing to secure her
brother's release, Mrs. Say replied, ``I'm not exactly sure,
because they don't share that with me.''
   ``All they tell me is that there continues to be quiet
diplomacy, although I'm not sure what that means. After all this
time, I have to wonder if quiet diplomay is a code word for no
diplomacy.''
   She said that after her meetings with the three former French
hostages she was reassured about her brother's physical condition.
``Terry's Marine Corps training is standing him in good stead. He
is surviving.''
   But, she said, it was also clear that he was angry.
   ``He feels betrayed by his own government and by the people he
was in Lebanon to serve. I'm sure that when he gets out _ and I
believe he will _ it will take a long time from him to recover from
this.''
   Before the news conference, Joelle Kauffmann said her husband
would be checking back into Val-de-Grace military hospital to
recover from exhaustion. The three hostages spent 48 hours in the
hospital for physical examinations after they arrived in France
last Thursday.
   Kauffmann said fellow hostage Michel Seurat became ill in
September 1985 with what Kauffmann believes was cancer. On Dec. 28,
Seurat said goodbye to Kauffmann and was taken to another, cell
where he died.

   Harold ``Kim'' Philby, longtime Soviet spy and
central figure in espionage scandals that rocked Britain 30 years
ago, died in Moscow, the domestic Press Association news agency
reported Wednesday night.
   The report quoted diplomatic sources in London.
   Philby, 76, a member of a prominent British family, was a spy
for 30 years while he worked for the British secret service. He was
known as the ``Third Man'' who tipped off fellow spies Donald
MacLean and Guy Burgess that they were under investigation by
British authorities in the late 1950s.
   Both fled to the Soviet Union in 1951, and Philby followed them
to Moscow in 1963.
   At one point Philby was reported to be an adviser to Soviet
intelligence agencies in Moscow.
   The MacLean-Burgess-Philby spy scandals virtually wrecked the
exchange of intelligence information between London and Washington.
   At one point, Philby was so highly valued in the British secret
service that he was being groomed to be its chief.
   In April, Philby granted his first interview to a Western
journalist, telling the Sunday Times that British intelligence let
him defect rather than face an embarrassing public trial.
   He said he found peace and a happy fourth marriage, to a Russian
woman, and felt at home in the Soviet Union.
   Philby had been under suspicion for 12 years and his unmasking
was a nightmare for British intelligence. It began when McLean and
Burgess defected to the Soviet Union and reverberated into the
1980s with the disclosure that Antony Blunt, another upper-class
Englishman, had been revealed as a traitor and went unpunished.
   When Philby defected, Blunt was given immunity from prosecution
in exchange for information. He later became art adviser to Queen
Elizabeth II.
   Blunt died in 1983. Burgess and MacLean died in Moscow.
   Philby espoused Soviet communism as a Cambridge University
student in the 1930s and penetrated the highest levels of British
intelligence in the Kremlin's service.
   Because of his high contacts in Washington, Philby was able to
betray the whole Western Alliance. He sent many Western agents to
their deaths and was even able to head off the defection of a
Soviet diplomat who threatened to xpose him.
   Philby was decorated for his services by the Soviet KGB
intelligence service and published his memoirs, titled ``My Secret
War.''
   Asked by his interviewer, ``Would you do it all again?'' Philby
replied: ``Absolutely.''

   Democrat Jesse Jackson led a march through
a crime-ridden area of Portland Wednesday and urged students to
keep away from drugs on the second day of a campaign swing through
Oregon.
   Jackson, hoping for a strong showing in the state's May 17
primary to boost his struggling presidential bid, was also
campaigning in Redmond and Salem, one day after losing two more
primaries _ in Nebraska and West Virginia _ to Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   He began the day with an anti-drug rally in which he told high
school students to turn their lives around.
   ``You get those guns out of your pockets and the drugs out of
your life and you can make a difference,'' he told about 1,300
students at predominantly black Jefferson High School.
   ``Dope pushers are killers of the dream,'' he said. ``They're
terrorists.''
   Jackson was greeted with thunderous applause on his arrival in
the school's gymnasium and received several standing ovations from
the students.
   As he often does in such appearances, Jackson invited all
students who had ever taken illegal drugs to gather next to the
stage. At first only a few did, but within minutes about 100
students were standing in front of Jackson.
   ``If you must cry, it's all right,'' he told one of the
students. ``Just go on and change your ways.''
   After the rally, he led a 13-block anti-drug march from the
school through one of Portland's highest crime areas.
   Jackson and community leaders led a procession of about 2,000
people, and hundreds more lined the streets chanting, ``Win, Jesse,
Win,'' and ``Keep Hope Alive.''

   Thousands of people who worked at the
fire-ravaged First Interstate Bank tower have moved to temporary
quarters in a generally trouble-free transition. Some of the new
space even was provided by competing financial institutions.
   ``Our fiercest competitors have been very nice in this crisis,''
said Bob Campbell, a spokesman for First Interstate.
   The three-hour, 43-minute blaze a week ago gutted 4{ floors in
the 62-story tower, the tallest building in California, and caused
one death and 40 injuries. An 12th-floor electrical problem was the
suspected cause.
   It will take six to 10 weeks to reopen floors of the vacated 1
million square-foot building that were damaged by smoke and water,
officials said.
   Mal Lumby, a spokesman for First Interstate, said there are no
firm estimates yet on how long it will take to repair the burned
floors.
   ``It could be as long as a year. It's all speculation at this
point. The analysis of the metal (structural beams) has not yet
been done,'' Lumby said.
   Most of First Interstate's 2,000 bank and holding company
employees have been working in their new locations since Friday.
   About 900 report daily to the bank's emergency operations center
several blocks from the burned building. The center, described by
Campbell as ``the operations hub of the bank'' is where employees
handle check clearings, statements and securities operations.
   ``Customer service didn't miss a beat,'' said another bank
spokesman, John Popovich.
   Several hundred other people moved to vacant space in nearby
buildings; about 800 are on call at home enjoying a paid vacation.
   ``No one is being laid off,'' Campbell said, adding that First
Interstate hoped to have space next week for all employees.
   Bank of America and Security Pacific National Bank helped out
the competition in the emergency.
   Bank of America provided sub-leased office space at downtown for
three of the 10 banks operating out of the First Interstate tower.
   Corporate officers of First Interstate and their clerical staffs
moved into a 23,700 square-foot area of the 10th floor of the Bank
of America headquarters, said Bank of America spokesman Tom Chapman.
   Hanil Bank of Korea moved its employes into 4,800 square feet of
space, he said, and Commerzbank of Germany workers moved into a
3,800-square-foot area on the 47th floor of the Bank of America
headquarters.
   Popovich credited the bank's emergency plan and satellite
headquarters, a $1.5 million contingency facility, for keeping the
bank in operation.
   ``Of course, we expected an earthquake, but it was nice to have
it (the plan) handy,'' he said.
   First Interstate owns the bank tower in partnership with
Equitable Life Assurance Society. Equitable's real estate
subsidiary, Equitable Real Estate in New York, manages the building.
   There also were 30 other tenants, mostly legal firms employing
about 1,400 people, with operations in the now-closed tower. Many
attorneys have taken refuge in nearby legal offices.
   ``There has been great community generosity here and reaching
out,'' Equitable's Jonathan Miller said Wednesday from New York.
   Suitcase- and box-toting employees, accompanied by security
officers, have been making a daily pilgrimage to the fire-scarred
tower to pick up crucial files, computer disks and other items such
as telephone lists.

   Aging American, British and French comrades
who harbor the often agonizing memories of one of World War II's
most heroic missions gathered Wednesday for probably their last
full reunion, 44 years after they were parachuted behind enemy
lines.
   ``It took some of them this long to find each other, and they
won't let go,'' said Daphne Friele, who was an 18-year-old
secretary in the British intelligence office that trained 279
Americans, Britons and Frenchmen for a mission code-named
``Jedburgh.''
   Records of the operation remained top secret until 1985,
although many of those taking part have told their dramatic stories
of sabotaging German forces and supporting the European resistance.
The specially trained soldiers were dropped in teams of three with
a radio _ scattered across France, Belgium and The Netherlands _ in
advance of the June 6, 1944 Normandy landings.
   Their code name, Mrs. Friele said, comes from the name of a
Scottish town where the term ``Jedburgh justice'' was the rule for
dealing with sheep rustlers: ``hang them first and question them
afterwards.''
   This week, 51 American, 26 French and 18 British survivors of
the Jedburgh unit will meet with President Reagan, receive honors
at the French and British embassies and visit the CIA headquarters
where one of their members, William E. Colby, was director in the
mid-1970s.
   The final group of French veterans arrived Wednesday to shouts
of greetings from their fellow British and American soldiers at
Dulles International Airport.
   French Gen. Roland de Mecquenem of St. Julien Le Concelles said
his memories of the resistance are ``neither sad nor gay. We
experienced the happiness of fulfilling a duty.''
   Mrs. Friele _ she later married an American ``Jed'' who died in
the Korean War and, after the Jeds first reunion in France four
years ago, married another one _ said she has been able to track
down all but two of the original American soldiers in the
operation. For them she has only names and scant detail: Arthur
Gruen and Ian Forbes.
   ``I was 18 and very impressionable, so these people have always
been my heroes, and they always will be,'' said Mrs. Friele, 62,
who has lived in the United States since the war. Her second
husband, Berent E. Friele Jr., 65, of Redding, Conn., like many of
the American Jeds, was also sent into China to aid resistance
against the Japanese.
   Mrs. Friele said life after the war has been difficult for some
of the men because of the intensity of their experiences dodging
enemy forces.
   She said the reunion in France and one in 1985 of American Jeds
have given the men a chance to share experiences, often unpleasant,
that they had rarely talked about. Many had not seen each other
since they were trained in England, she said.
   ``Things that angered them just spilled out,'' she said.
   ``Some couldn't readjust. They became alcoholics and went
through terrible experiences,'' she said.
   But she said many have done very well in the military and
elsewhere. In addition to Colby, former Jeds include retired Army
Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, who has organized a controversial
worldwide effort to support resistance groups against communism,
and internationally known yachtsman Hod Fuller, a retired Marine
general.
   The late columnist Stewart Alsop was a Jed.
   Paul Cyr, 66, of Centreville, Va., said he only found out after
the war that the headquarters of British Special Operations thought
some of their messages were coming from the German Gestapo and so
did not respond to requests for assistance, including arms drops.
   Cyr, who was sent behind enemy lines twice in Europe and later
in China, said his biggest problem was communications.
   ``It could take all day to get the radio into the sidepockets of
a bike and get out into the countryside to send a simple message,''
he said. In France, he said, the mostly French-speaking Americans
operated in villages and towns with Germans all around them.
   The Jeds tell the story of one American who didn't speak French
and injured his back during the jump. He had to spend time in a
German hospital, speaking very little, before a mission was flown
in to rescue him.
   Cyr said he has some horrible memories, including holing up on a
farm with 300 resistance fighters and ending up with only 15
survivors after Germans were led to the scene by a Frenchman.
   Retired Col. Frank Mills of Fairfax, Va., who worked with the
Allied forces in Europe and with the Americans who went to China
but was not a Jed himself, is writing a book about the missions.
   Since the documents were declassified, Mills has spent three
years going through hundreds of boxes stored in the National
Archives.
   He said that despite the obvious danger of the missions, only a
handful of the Jeds were killed.
   ``They were guerrillas. They had to design operations that would
keep them alive,'' he said.

   The government of Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner canceled a meeting between Pope John Paul II and
civilian leaders, including opposition politicians, but a church
group pledged Wednesday to try to hold the meeting anyway.
   The Permanent Episcopal Council said it would search for another
site if the government prevented use of a sports stadium operated
by the Education and Culture Ministry.
   John Paul is scheduled to arrive Monday in Paraguay on the last
stop of his four-nation pilgrimage to South America. The meeting
with about 350 civilian leaders was scheduled Tuesday, May 19.
   The session in Paraguay had been billed as a ``meeting of the
pope with the constructors of society.'' It was intended to bring
the pontiff into contact with a broad mix of civilians, including
peasants, lawyers, religious leader and members of opposition
parties not recognized by the government.
   The invitation of opposition leaders prompted government
criticism. An editorial Sunday in Patria, the daily newspaper of
President Stroessner's ruling Colorado Party, described the meeting
as a ``corrupt assembly.''
   Patria reported Tuesday that government officials, citing
``security reasons,'' notified the pope's local envoy on Monday
that the meeting had been canceled.
   Tensions between the church and government have escalated in the
last year. The church hierarchy has increasingly criticized
Stroessner, in absolute power since 1954, and other government
leaders. It has accused them of repeated civil rights violations.

   The director of the Centers for Disease Control's
AIDS education campaign has resigned, just as the CDC prepares to
mail AIDS brochures to every U.S. household, a spokeswoman said
Wednesday.
   Paula Van Ness, director of the CDC's National AIDS Information
and Education Program, said she will leave the agency June 3 to
become project director of a Ford Foundation plan to funnel funds
into community AIDS prevention and social service programs.
   ``My understanding is she was made an offer too good to
refuse,'' said CDC spokeswoman Gayle Lloyd. ``I don't know of any
dissatisfaction she had about the pamphlet.''
   Ms. Van Ness resigned April 30, three days before the government
unveiled the brochure it plans to send to 107 million households.
The brochures are to be mailed beginning May 26.
   There was no announcement of the resignation, but Ms. Lloyd said
there was no attempt to keep it secret. She said the CDC does not
routinely announce staff resignations.
   No replacement for Ms. Van Ness has been named, Ms. Lloyd said.
   Ms. Van Ness was out of town and could not be reached Wednesday
for comment. She told The Atlanta Constitution she was leaving the
AIDS information program ``to find some balance in my life,''
citing the large amount of travel and ``90-hour weeks.''
   Ms. Van Ness joined the CDC in April 1987 after serving as
executive director of AIDS Project Los Angeles, an AIDS service
agency.
   The CDC's direct mail campaign got off to a rocky start.
Secretary of Education William Bennett and officials on the
president's Domestic Policy Council initially opposed spending the
$20 million allocated by Congress on brochures that would carry
explicit information about AIDS directly to households.

   Scientists who experimented with
an ancient corpse nicknamed Lady X have developed a new type of
museum case to protect from decay such priceless relics as mummies
and the Dead Sea Scrolls.
   The technique involves construction of hermetically sealed
display cases filled with inert nitrogen gas.
   A small-scale prototype of the case, which contains temperature
and humidity sensors, a leak detector and almost no oxygen, was
unveiled Tuesday during a seminar attended by 100 scientists,
museum officials and Egyptian dignitaries.
   Lady X, a 3,000-year-old mummy, rested nearby in a less
sophisticated case. Scientists at the Getty Conservation Institute
used cotton swabs to collect bacteria and fungi from her surface
for use in tests that led to development of the new case.
   ``In the past, very little research has been done on the
conservation of organic materials,'' said Luis Monreal, director of
the institute.
   Included among organic materials, he said, are mummies,
parchment manuscripts, textiles and embroideries, artworks on paper
and relics made of leather, bone or wood.
   The institute, part of the J. Paul Getty Trust, plans to build a
full-size display case and test Lady X in it for one to three
months, said research director Frank Preusser.
   The mummy, a brown-skinned, 4-foot-10 woman believed to have
been a commoner, was shipped here from Cairo last September.
Discovered near Luxor in the 1960s, she was the first mummy sent
out of Egypt since the remains of Pharaoh Ramses II were taken to
Paris in 1976 for radiation treatment to halt fungal decay.
   Once research is completed, Egypt will build cases so mummies of
27 pharaohs and queens discovered in 1881 can be placed on display
for the first time, perhaps by May 1989, said Zahi Hawass, director
general of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   Plans to display 15 of those mummies last October were canceled
to await results of the California research, he added.
   He said Egypt's government has extended its original six-month
contract with the institute for another six months to allow
completion of research on Lady X, who was nicknamed by an Egyptian
official.
   ``I'm afraid this mummy will stay here and ask for an American
green card,'' Hawass joked, referring to a temporary work permit.
   Monreal said the new case was designed to be built relatively
inexpensively so any country can use it to preserve organic
materials.
   He said the institute offered its findings to the Israel Museum
in Jerusalem if the museum wants to build cases to preserve the
Dead Sea Scrolls. The leather and papyrus manuscripts were
discovered in the 1940s and 1950s and contain all the books of the
Old Testament except Esther.
   Lady X probably was about 40 years old when she did. She lived
sometime during Egypt's New Kingdom period, from 1500 B.C. to 1050
B.C. Egypt has thousands of such mummies. Most were commoners.
   The mummies were perfectly preserved for millenia in tombs. But
after excavation, they became threatened by pollution, bacteria,
fungi and changes in temperature, humidity and light.
   Getty scientists didn't take tissue samples from Lady X.
Instead, the microbes they collected were grown on strips of
parchment placed in glass vials.
   Growth of the microbes was tested under varying conditions of
light, temperature, humidity and oxygen levels, said researcher
Nieves Valentin.

   Lim Hong Juat and Saw Bee Hong
were married, but both have been dead for many years.
   It all began a few weeks ago, when 78-year-old Foo Ah Heoh,
Lim's mother, was tormented by a recurring dream of her son, who
died 16 years ago at the age of 25.
   In the dream, Lim urged his mother to marry him to a certain
Miss Saw.
   Foo learned that there was a Saw Bee Hong who once lived nearby.
   She went to see Saw's family, who told her that Saw had died in
an accident 15 years ago, when she was 12. But the family said it
had no objections to the marriage.
   On Tuesday, a Chinese temple priest joined in marriage
3-foot-tall paper effigies of the couple.
   Eighty friends and relatives attended the ceremony in the city
of Penang, about 180 miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur, the National
News Agency Bernama reported Wednesday.
   At the wedding, which cost $1,600, the dead newlyweds were
showered with gifts, including a house, a car, a video-cassette
recorder and bedroom furniture _ all made of paper.

   Eight soldiers who trained Jamaican
troops after the 1983 Grenada invasion have been indicted by a
federal grand jury for allegedly submitting thousands of dollars in
false travel vouchers to the Army.
   The Special Forces soldiers from Fort Bragg, who were
temporarily housed in the Americana Hotel in Ochos Rios, Jamaica,
allegedly conspired to receive two sets of receipts. One showed the
amount actually paid for their rooms, $27.50; the second showed
that the hotel received $55.
   The indictment, handed down Tuesday, said that just before or
immediately after returning to Fort Bragg in May 1984, the eight
destroyed the receipts that reflected what was actually paid.
   They then filled out false travel vouchers that showed they paid
the greater amount and were reimbursed, according to the indictment.
   Each of the eight was indicted on a single count of conspiring
to defraud the United States, along with a second count of
submitting a false claim for reimbursement of lodging expenses.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Raleigh said the
conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison,
a fine of up to $250,000, or both.
   The false claim charge carries a maximum of five years in prison
and a fine of up to twice what was taken, or $250,000, or both, the
spokesman said.
   The indictment alleged that the eight were assigned in December
1983 to Jamaica to provide trained personnel to serve as security
forces for the government of Grenada following the invasion of that
country two months before. The eight returned to Fort Bragg in May
1984.

<TEXT>
   The head of an archives on Robert F.
Kennedy's assassination says key material supporting a conspiracy
theory appears to be missing from recently opened Los Angeles
Police Department files.
   Professor Philip H. Melanson said Wednesday that discrepancies
existed between earlier accounts of how much testimony was taped
and the amount of audiotape made available for public perusal last
month.
   ``Our survey of the files has discovered a major gap in the case
record,'' Melanson said. ``There is a large shortfall of tape
recordings of interviews, (and) ... the best circumstantial
evidence indicates that more data did exist but disappeared.''
   Melanson said the records contain no taped interviews of 51 key
witnesses, including 29 whose testimony would have been expected to
shed light on whether Kennedy had been a victim of a conspiracy.
   ``The fact that they do have to do with conspiracy is disturbing
because it means that the original investigation was either quite
incompetent ... or ... if it wasn't incompetence and it was some
kind of purging of a record, it's the most disturbing of all,'' he
said.
   In Los Angeles, the chief police spokesman, Commander William
Booth, said the department would ``not deal with what somebody else
calls a discrepancy.''
   ``Everything that we had in file with regards to that case had
been turned over to the (state) archives,'' he said. ``In terms of
individuals coming up with their own theories ... and being
critical as to whether they find what they're looking for or not
... the records have to speak for themselves.''
   Robert Houghton, who as chief of detectives headed the police
investigation into the June 5, 1968, assassination, rejected
suggestions of a cover-up and characterized conspiracy theories as
``ridiculous.''
   ``I don't know anything about destroying any tapes at all,''
Houghton said from his home in North Ridge, Calif. ``Certain things
I understand have been blocked out, but that was to protect a lot
of people who were interviewed. I don't know what was taken out, if
anything.''
   The Robert F. Kennedy Assassination Archives are part of
Southeastern Massachusetts University library's private collection.
Melanson started the archives in 1984, when the college in
Dartmouth accepted material gathered by the Robert F. Kennedy Truth
Committee, a group believing more than one person was involved in
the shooting.
   Los Angeles police concluded in 1969 that Sirhan Sirhan alone
was responsible for the assassination.
   Conspiracy theorists suggested that a second gunman fired at
Kennedy from behind, while Sirhan stood in front of him.
   Melanson, who teaches political science, said that of the 3,470
interviews Los Angeles police conducted in investigating the
killing, only 301 interviews were available on tape in the recently
released record.
   Melanson said he was told in 1985 by Theodore Taylor, co-author
with Houghton of a 1970 book on the investigation called ``Special
Unit Senator,'' that ``every single interview was taped,'' and
Taylor later said he had access to 3,000 hours of audio tape in
police department files.
   After tabulating the approximate length of witness tapes listed
in police records ``a generous estimate is that about 400 hours of
audio tapes were disclosed,'' by the department, said Melanson.
   Nobody answered the telephone Wednesday at Taylor's home in
Laguna Beach. In New York, Random House, which published ``Special
Unit Senator,'' said it had no telephone listing for Taylor.
   Melanson, an acknowledged expert on the shooting and its
aftermath, said he arrived at his conclusions by cross-checking
lists of witnesses with records of taped testimony on file with the
California state archives, keeper of the 50,000-page police dossier
on the shooting.
   Several people at or near the Ambassador Hotel at the time
Kennedy was shot claimed to remember a young woman in a polka-dot
dress with Sirhan, leading to the ``polka-dot'' conspiracy theory.
   Those questioned for whom no tape exists include ``12 persons
with information relating directly to whether Sirhan was
accompanied by a female accomplice the night of the shooting, the
so-called `polka-dot dress girl,''' said Melanson.
   Among those who told police about the polka-dot dress girl was
Sandra Serrano-Sewell. She recanted her statement about seeing the
girl two weeks after the slaying, but said in April that police
badgered her into retracting her statement.
   The Los Angeles Police Department has repeatedly been accused of
bungling the investigations by conspiracy theorists.

   U.S. and Laotian soldiers digging on
their hands and knees scoured a remote hillside Wednesday where a
U.S. warplane crashed 22 years ago, but officials said they failed
to find the remains of two missing American fliers.
   The soldiers searched the bamboo- and brush-covered hillside in
Savannakhet province where the OV-1A Mohawk reconnaissance aircraft
was shot down on March 15, 1966.
   The U.S. government is trying to resolve the fates of 555
Americans listed as missing in action in the Indochina war.
   ``There was an exhaustive search of the crash area from May 2 to
11 ... (but) no remains of the two crewmen aboard the aircraft ...
were found,'' said Ross Petzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok.
   ``There was some danger posed by unexploded ordnance left over
from the Indochina war period,'' Petzing said. ``Three cluster
bombs and several live shells were exploded at the excavation site
by U.S. Air Force emergency ordnance disposal experts.''
   Maj. Tim Pfister, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command, said
the team returned to Bangkok with some pieces of wreckage from the
Mohawk and a very small amount of personal effects.
   He said the soldiers toiled in dusty conditions and temperatures
of more than 100 degrees, using simple tools to shovel out clumps
of earth and fine metal screens to sift for remains. The 14
Americans stayed in tents at the crash site, about 95 miles east of
Savannakhet city in southern Laos.
   Pfister said the Mohawk had taken off from the U.S. air base at
Phu Bai in central Vietnam on a mission involving interdiction of
the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which communist North Vietnam used to
infiltrate men and supplies into U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
   He said another aircraft on that mission reported that one
crewman parachuted out and landed near the area where the Mohawk
crashed.
   Petzing said that as an expression of America's concern with
Laos' own humanitarian problems, the U.S. team donated six months
of medicine and equipment worth about $13,000 dollars to the Sepone
district hospital for use by inhabitants of the crash area.
   It was the third such joint excavation in communist-ruled Laos.
   The remains of 11 missing Americans were found in the first
joint excavation in 1985, and eight others were found in the second
dig in 1986. Laos had promised a third dig in 1986, but a long
period of inactivity followed until Washington agreed last August
to consider Vientiane's calls for humanitarian aid.
   In February, the Laotians handed over two boxes of remains they
said were found in their recent excavations.
   U.S. officials said they received exceptional cooperation from
the Laotians.
   The American team was from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution
Center and the Army Central Identification Laboratory. The two
Honolulu-based agencies are entrusted with resolving the fates of a
total of more than 2,400 MIAs in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The
war ended in 1975 with communist victories in all three countries.

<TEXT>
   More than 11,000 people cheered first lady
Nancy Reagan as she took the stage at the fourth annual national
``Just Say No'' Walk Against Drugs Rally on Wednesday.
   Initially flanked by two school children, drug-sniffing police
dogs, Snoopy, Yogi Bear and Ronald McDonald, Mrs. Reagan told the
children how proud she was of them.
   ``Saying no to drugs is the biggest decision your can make in
your lives right now,'' she said during the ceremony on the Mall
near the Washington Monument. ``You've made a commitment against
drugs; that is an adult decision and you deserve the adult respect.
   ``And I want you to know that you have my fullest respect, not
to mention affection,'' she said.
   As the honorary chairman of the Just Say No Foundation, Mrs.
Reagan told the crowd of a campaign to get more young people to
pledge to fight drugs when the new school year starts this fall.
   ``I hope you will join in this drive to renew the pledge against
drugs and to get new people to just say no,'' she said.
   Mrs. Reagan's remarks were the highlight of the program hosted
by Tempestt Bledsoe of NBC-TV's ``The Cosby Show'' and Sonny
Melendrez of The Disney Channel's ``You and Me Kid.''
   Among the featured performers was LaToya Jackson, the
international spokeswoman for the ``Just Say No'' movement and
board member of the foundation.
   Ms. Jackson, the sister of superstar Michael Jackson, sang her
``Just Say No'' song while on stage with members of the Halau Hula
Olana's champion hula ensemble from Oahu, Hawaii.
   Most of the children in the program and in the audience were
members of the 15,000 Just Say No Clubs active in schools and young
people's organizations across the nation.
   The clubs are an outgrowth of a commitment Mrs. Reagan made to a
group of school children in Oakland, Calif., in 1984. Since 1986,
the second week of May has been observed as ``Just Say No'' Week,
including local and national walks and rallies on the same day.

<HEAD>Cranston Wants Housing Bill To Be Part of Fall Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation calling for a new national housing
policy should be ready this summer in time to be a major focus of
the presidential and congressional campaigns, Sen. Alan Cranston
said Wednesday.
   The California Democrat, who is chairman of the Senate housing
subcommittee, said he wants all of the presidential and
congressional candidates to make a commitment to the housing
program he has been working on with some of the nation's leading
housing experts for the past 10 months.
   ``We want to have an impact during the campaign so that housing
is discussed not just in general terms with all candidates claiming
to be `friends of housing,''' Cranston said in remarks to a meeting
of the California Association of Realtors.
   He said commitments are necessary ``so they will be more likely
to adopt the policy framework that supporters of housing have
developed.''
   Meanwhile, representatives of the poor urged the House housing
subcommittee to approve legislation to provide for the construction
of 5 million new public housing units and to modernize 1 million
public housing units over a 10-year period.
   Rick Tingling-Clemmons, representing the National Tenants
Organization, urged Congress to appropriate emergency money ``to
begin the immediate restoration, renovation and repair of all
existing public housing units.''
   He said the tenants' organization also wants Congress to pass
the so-called Jesse Gray Housing Act, named for the 1969 founder of
the tenants organization, to provide for additional public housing.
   Cranston, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, said he hopes to
have the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees housing
legislation, approve his legislation by Aug. 15 when Congress
recesses for the summer.
   ``We will move it as far as possible through Congress this
year,'' he told the realtors, ``but I suspect we will have to wait
for a new administration to enact it.''
   He said major pieces of the bill should be ready to be announced
in June and should be introduced in the Senate and House in July.
   ``We should set clear, realistic goals that can be accomplished,
say, by the year 2000,'' Cranston said. ``Even if the initial steps
must be smaller than many would like, we can show that they are the
right steps and that they are part of a sustainable strategy.''

<HEAD>Archbishop Urges Harsher Economic Pressure Against South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only new and harsher economic pressure on
South Africa will prompt the regime to end its policy of official
racism, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu told members of Congress
Wednesday in appealing for new sanctions against his country.
   In meetings and appearances throughout the day, Tutu repeated
his message that the longstanding U.S. policy of diplomatic
pressure has failed. He urged lawmakers to support a new bill that
would sever virtually all economic ties between the two countries.
   ``It is critically urgent that you make a moral decision,'' Tutu
told a Capitol Hill audience that included about a dozen House
members. ``Are you on the side of injustice or justice? The side of
oppression or freedom? Of inhumanity or humanity?''
   A bill that would require U.S. companies to shed their
investments in South Africa within a year and ban trade in
everything but strategic minerals and agricultural products is
pending in the House, and a similar bill was to be introduced in
the Senate Thursday by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and others.
   While supporters are optimistic about House passage, the bill's
fate is unclear in the Senate, in part because moderate Republicans
who were key to the passage of limited sanctions in 1986 are
reluctant to go along with harsher measures.
   As Tutu sought support for the legislation, a congressional
study was issued showing that South Africa's exports to 24
countries which report trading data to the International Monetary
Fund decreased by 7 percent and imports plummeted by 31 percent
from 1982 through the first half of 1987. The declines came while
overall trade was rising substantially.
   The interim report by the General Accounting Office did not say
how much of the decline was due to the limited sanctions imposed by
Congress in 1986 over President Reagan's veto. Those sanctions
banned imports of agricultural products, coal, iron, steel and
textiles, and exports of oil, arms, nuclear materials and
computers, as well as new U.S. loans.
   The report also noted that U.S. direct investment in South
Africa declined by about 10 percent since 1982.
   About 80 percent of South Africa's trade remains with six major
industrial nations: the United States, Great Britain, West Germany,
France, Italy and Japan. The United States and Great Britain
recently have decreased their share of trade, while Japan has
increased its share, the GAO found.
   Tutu said the South African government remains intransigent,
exercising what amounts to terrorism over its black majority
despite the earlier sanctions by the United States. And he
suggested that world attention to the problem has waned.
   ``I want to know what the South African government still has to
do so the world would be filled with so much revulsion and outrage
that it would move heaven and earth to rid the world of the scourge
of apartheid,'' the Anglican archbishop said, comparing the
government to that of Nazi Germany.
   ``It sometimes takes our breath away, the things that the South
African government has been able to get away with,'' he said.
   Tutu contended that ``anything that has happened in South Africa
has happened because of pressure.''
   He specifically cited the continued detention by the government
of children as young as 7 and 8 years old, with some held more than
a year and kept without contact from the outside.
   ``What must our people still suffer so that the world,
recognizing their anguish, would then say we can't allow this to
continue?'' Tutu asked.
   Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., who supported the limited
sanctions in 1986, said he was concerned that unilateral action by
the United States might have little impact without parallel moves
by other major South African trading partners like West Germany and
Japan.
   ``It would be far more effective if we had a global approach,''
Tutu acknowledged. ``But who is likely to persuade them? No country
is in a better position that the United States. ... The moral stand
you take sends out ripples.''
   In a speech at the National Press Club, Tutu faulted the current
leaders of the United States, Great Britain, West Germany and Japan
for ignoring the problem. ``They have decided that South African
blacks are expendable ... profits matter more,'' he charged.

   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., who underwent a
double lung transplant last weekend, was removed from a respirator
Wednesday and ``is making steady progress,'' officials said.
   ``There are no signs of rejection as yet,'' said Barbara Austin,
a spokeswoman at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.
``His lungs are oxygenating well and there is a good possibility he
may be removed from the intensive care unit on Thursday.''
   The rare operation was performed Friday night, and Spence
continues to take drugs to ward off rejection of the new organs,
which came from an 18-year-old motorcycle accident victim from
Texas, hospital officials said.
   A lung specialist determined Spence suffered from a severe form
of non-hereditary emphysema, Austin said.
   ``The congressman is in good spirits _ very upbeat,'' she said.
``He was asking for hot soup early Wednesday.''

<HEAD>Defense Begins Closing Arguments In Cocaine-Smuggling Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense attorney for Carlos Lehder
Rivas charged Wednesday that prosecutors used ``bought witnesses''
who were promised reduced sentences or other favors for testifying
against the reputed Colombian drug lord.
   In closing arguments at Lehder's cocaine-smuggling trial,
defense attorney Edward R. Shohat said the chief prosecution
witness got ``the break of a lifetime'' for his testimony against
Lehder.
   By agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, convicted smuggler Ed
Ward was able to reduce a possible 215-year sentence and $5.9
million fine to less than six years in prison, Shohat said.
   ``Boy, did he put it over on the government,'' said the defense
attorney.
   He charged that Ward lied to the grand jury that indicted Lehder
in 1981 and that he again committed perjury in Lehder's trial. Many
other prosecution witnesses also received deals from prosecutors in
exchange for testimony, he said.
   Lehder, 38, and co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are on trial
in federal court on charges they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons
of cocaine into the United States from Colombia via Lehder's
private Bahamian island, Norman's Cay, from 1978 to 1980.
   A separate Miami indictment accuses Lehder of being one of the
leaders of the so-called Medellin cartel, a violent smuggling ring
believed to be responsible a large share of the cocaine entering
the United States.
   Lehder was captured in February 1987 at a mansion near the town
of Medellin after a shootout between Colombian army troops and his
bodyguards. He was immediately whisked onto a U.S. Air Force plane
bound for the United States.
   The prosecution called 115 witnesses in the trial, which began
with jury selection last October. Last week, defense attorneys
surprised the courtroom by announcing that they would be calling no
witnesses.
   Closing arguments were expected to continue through Thursday and
the jury may get the case Friday.
   Winding up his prosecution arguments Wednesday, U.S. Attorney
Robert Merkle referred to testimony that Lehder used bribes, charm
and threats to run a smuggling empire. For once, Merkle said,
Lehder couldn't use such tools.
   ``He cannot buy his way out of a just verdict. He cannot charm
his way out of a just verdict. And he cannot force his way out of a
just verdict,'' Merkle said.
   A day earlier, Merkle told the jury that Lehder was waging a
violent war against the United States and viewed cocaine as a
weapon. ``He's still at war,'' Merkle said.
   In his defense arguments, Shohat told the jury that the judge
would instruct them that they should consider the testimony of
convicted felons with special care.
   ``Boy, do we have convicted felons here!'' he said.
   He argued that many of the government witnesses were given
immunity from prosecution, hoping for reduced sentences or some
type of deal in return for their testimony.
   ``The government brought in 29 bought witnesses,'' he said.
``They paid an incredible price to get Mr. Lehder's conviction.''
   He also argued that much of the testimony did not concern the
charges contained in the indictment.
   ``The issue is not whether Mr. Lehder was good or bad,'' Shohat
said. ``The issue in this case is the 11 counts in the indictment.''
   As an example, Shohat cited the days of testimony concerning
possible payoffs to officials in the Bahamas, including allegations
that Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling had taken bribes. Pindling
has called the allegations ``a fantasy.''
   ``Lynden Pindling is not on trial here in this case. Carlos
Lehder is on trial,'' Shohat said. The payment of bribes to
Bahamian officials, he said, ``is not an issue in this case.''
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Co-defendant Reed, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged with
smuggling conspiracy.

   Pat Robertson announced Wednesday that he
would withdraw from the Republican presidential race next week and
said in a newspaper interview that he will likely return to his
financially ailing Christian Broadcasting Network.
   Barbara Gattullo, a spokeswoman for Americans for Robertson,
said the decision to return to CBN is ``not set in stone, but the
important thing is whether or not he returns to CBN, he will
continue to be involved in politics.''
   She said Robertson would file papers shortly with the Federal
Election Commission for a new political action committee _
Americans for the Republic.
   Robertson himself, speaking to reporters outside the White
House, endorsed Vice President George Bush, who already had the GOP
nomination well in hand.
   The former television evangelist said he would formally withdraw
from the race Monday.
   Meanwhile, in an interview published in The Virginian-Pilot &
The Ledger-Star of Norfolk, Robertson said he likely would return
to the Christian Broadcasting Network, which he founded nearly 30
years ago, as chief executive officer, a job his son now holds.
   ``I don't have a comment to make,'' said CBN spokesman Benton
Miller. ``None of the staff or I ... have been provided any
informati   Robertson, who has spent over $22 million on his campaign,
has
but 46 delegates to the national convention, while Bush has more
than 1,300. Robertson finished third to Bush and Sen. Bob Dole in
most of the early primaries.
   Ms. Gattullo said the new political action committee will raise
money and train conservative Christians who want to become involved
in the political process. The staff of Americans for Robertson
would switch to the new PAC, keeping the same offices in Virginia,
she said.
   The new PAC has a purpose similar in some ways to Robertson's
now-defunct Freedom Council, which had tax-exempt status before it
folded in 1986 after Americans for Robertson was incorporated.
Critics challenged the council as being merely a front for
Robertson's then-undeclared campaign, and it is being investigated
along with CBN and Americans for Robertson by the Internal Revenue
Service.
   Unlike the council, Americans for the Republic will actively
support candidates, Ms. Gattullo said.

   President Reagan conferred with experts on the
Soviet Union on Wednesday, and one of them said the flap about the
use of astrology at the White House will not overshadow the
superpower summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Over lunch in the Roosevelt Room, Reagan spent an hour talking
with eight scholars who specialize in various aspects of Soviet
life. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was the first
in a series of two or three such meetings.
   Talking with reporters later in the White House driveway, Adam
Ulam, a Harvard University historian and political scientist, said
Reagan ``mostly listened'' to the group.
   Ulam was asked how the Soviets would react to the disclosure
that Nancy Reagan had consulted an astrologer in planning the
president's schedule and activities.
   ``I don't think they pay any attention to it,'' he replied.
``Why should they? I think that they deal with facts. They don't
deal with ... gossip which doesn't really concern (them).
   ``I mean they're really dealing with the United States on the
basis of factual things and they discount much of rhetoric and much
of the gossip which goes on as everyday staple of our own political
commentary,'' Ulam said.
   Reagan will meet with Gorbachev in Moscow May 29 through June 2.
It will be their fourth summit.

   Vincent van Gogh's portrait of his innkeeper's
teen-age daughter, who wrote a vivid account of the artist's death
decades after his suicide, was set to be auctioned Wednesday and
was expected to bring more than $15 million.
   ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux,'' one of van Gogh's last
paintings, is included in a slate of impressionist and modern
paintings scheduled for sale at Christie's auction house.
   The picture of the 13-year-old girl was made a month before van
Gogh committed suicide in July 1890 in the village of Auvers
outside Paris. In an essay written when she in her 70s, Adeline
Ravoux Carrie described the artist's final hours as he lay in his
room at her father's inn, dying of a gunshot wound.
   Interest in the painting is keen, experts say, in part because
it serves as a link to the artist's last days. Christie's, the
auction house where the sale will take place, estimates the work
may fetch more than $15 million.
   The portrait last changed hands in 1980 when an anonymous buyer
purchased it at a Sotheby's auction for $1.98 million.
   Over the past 14 months, three of paintings by van Gogh _ who
sold almost nothing during his lifetime _ have fetched previously
unheard-of multimillion-dollar prices that shocked the art world.
   In March 1987, van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9 million
at Christie's in London to a Japanese insurance company. Three
months later, ``The Trinquetaille Bridge'' went for $20.2 million,
also at Christie's in London. It was bought by an unidentified
collector in Switzerland.
   Then, in November, history was made when van Gogh's ``Irises,''
a composition of purple flowers and green leaves set off by a
single white iris, sold at Sotheby's in New York for $53.9 million
to an anonymous buyer, the highest price paid at auction for a
painting.
   In the painting auctioned Wednesday, Adeline, dressed in blue,
sits in profile on a chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue
ribbon, her gaze is serene, her posture correct and her hands are
folded demurely in front of her. ``He observed her very deeply, and
when he came to paint her, he painted both the grace and stiff
awkwardness of an adolescent girl,'' said Michael Findlay, senior
vice president of Christie's and an expert on impressionist and
modern painting.
   But Mrs. Carrie, who died in 1965 at the age of 88, said in a
1956 essay that she didn't immediately appreciate the painting.
   ``I admit that I was only moderately satisfied with my portrait;
it was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true
to life,'' Mrs. Carrie wrote.
   However, she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying,
``Monsieur Vincent divined not the young girl I was, but the woman
I was to become.''
   Mrs. Carrie described van Gogh, who lived at her father's inn
during the last 2{ months of his life, as a disciplined artist and
``a soft and calm'' man who enjoyed playing with her baby sister.
   She described how a doctor and police were summoned after he
returned to the inn after shooting himself, and how his brother,
Theo, who was the artist's chief backer, came running from the
train station, his face ``distorted by grief.''
   Among the other artworks set to be auctioned Wednesday night are
works by Pierre Auguste Renoir, Mary Cassatt, Henri de
Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.

<HEAD>Kerr-McGee Resumes Production of Oxidizer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kerr-McGee Corp. has resumed production
of a rocket fuel oxidizer, drawing the ire of jittery officials
still recovering from last week's blast at a similar plant two
miles away.
   Officials in this city of 55,000 vowed Wednesday to take legal
action to close the plant until the cause of last week's explosion
is determined.
   With the shutdown of the plant where the explosion occurred, the
Kerr-McGee plant is the only one in the nation producing ammonium
perchlorate, a component in the solid rocket fuel used in space
shuttle and military rockets.
   ``We feel absolutely satisfied that it's safe,'' Kerr-McGee
spokesman Paul Reed said in Oklahoma City.
   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' said Henderson City Manager Gary
Bloomquist. ``I'm totally amazed that they did it.''
   Kerr-McGee ceased production of the rocket fuel component last
Wednesday following the series of explosions at the Pacific
Engineering & Production Co. plant. The explosions killed two
people, injured 326 and caused an estimated $73 million in damage.
   Reed said the production resumed at 4 p.m. Tuesday. He announced
it Wednesday from the company's corporate headquarters in Oklahoma
City.
   Bloomquist said plant officials notified Henderson Mayor Lorna
Kesterson of the resumption after the night shift had reported for
work at the sprawling industrial complex blocks from the downtown.
   Last week's blast at the Pacific Engineering plant, two miles
out into the desert, damaged homes and businesses throughout the
Henderson and Las Vegas area.
   Bloomquist said Kerr-McGee officials last week promised not to
reopen until the cause of the explosions was known.
   Bloomquist said he had been instructed by city council members
to take legal action to halt the Kerr-McGee operations until the
accident's cause is known.
   The city manager said he thought the city could close the plant,
and he wanted to do so.
   ``I'm very sensitive to the loss of jobs and the loss of
industry,'' Bloomquist said. ``But I'm more sensitive right now to
the fact that there's a lot of very nervous people living in this
city.
   ``I don't think it's unreasonable for Kerr-McGee to keep the
commitment it made to the people,'' Bloomquist said.
   Military officials have expressed concern about the loss of the
Pacific plant and its impact on the national defense.
   Kerr-McGee spokeswoman Annita Bridges said the company would be
operating three shifts, as it was doing prior to last week's
accident.
   ``If there is a need to increase capacity, we will do what we
can to meet that need,'' Ms. Bridges said. ``We've looked since the
accident as to what kinds of increases we might be able to make.''

<TEXT>
   Poland's worst labor unrest in nearly
seven years reminded authorities that plans to reform the economy
and political system are racing against a deadline of mounting
public impatience.
   But the opposition learned that the public is not ready for a
repeat of the nationwide strikes of 1980 that led to the birth of
Solidarity.
   The walkouts that began April 25 among bus and tram drivers in
the western Polish city of Bydgoszcz led to the sit-in strike by
hundreds of Gdansk shipyard workers that ended Tuesday night in the
Baltic port city.
   The workers' demands for higher pay and union freedoms echoed
August 1980, when Poland was electrified by a sudden national labor
revolt and the Eastern bloc's first independent trade union
federation, Solidarity.
   The organization, formally banned after the imposition of
martial law in 1981, claimed 10 million members _ nearly one out of
three Poles _ and was far larger than the ruling Polish United
Workers (Communist) Party.
   The younger Poles who are most ready to storm the barricades did
not experience the disappointment and trauma of martial law in the
same way as their elders.
   When the Gdansk shipyard strike committee _ led behind the
scenes by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa _ agreed to discuss a
compromise in which the strikers would give up a demand for the
immediate recognition of Solidarity, it was the younger generation
that balked.
   ``History does not like to repeat itself. And this was exactly
what the aging veterans of Solidarity could not understand,'' said
a commentary Wednesday by the state-run news agency PAP.
   Although there were frequent expressions of concern and sympathy
for the recent protests, the vast majority of society hung back
from any overt moves to help the strikers.
   ``(The Poles) saw in 1981 that (pursuing strikes) was a
cul-de-sac, given the geopolitical situation in this part of the
world,'' said a Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said the strikes in 1980-81 led to Soviet-supported
repression by the Polish government and further economic hardships
for common Poles.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the recent unrest was
instructive for the authorities and would cause them to redouble
efforts to reform the economic and political systems.
   Indeed, one day after the last strike, the Polish parliament
unanimously passed a program to speed up its plans to make the
economy more efficient by giving it special powers to fire managers
or take over enterprises that resist economic changes.
   But the diplomat said the authorities have already lost ``the
hearts and minds'' of the new generation.
   ``Solidarity has not necessarily captured them either,'' he
added.
   He said there was ``impressive but not overwhelming support from
the rest of society,'' but that Solidarity calls for sympathy
action ``were not taken up with alacrity.''
   Official comments were quick to label the strikers' decision to
leave the shipyard even without a settlement the end of Solidarity.
   ``The myth of Solidarity's might has fallen,'' the PAP
commentary said. It ``turned out to be a small group which could
not find support in big enterprises, including those in Gdansk, and
even in the Gdansk shipyard.''
   But another Western diplomat said he thought it was too early to
write Solidarity's obituary.
   He said the group will continue to exist ``because it continues
to be a necessary focus for a whole band of postulates and opinions
that exist among the Polish people.''
   For Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, it was more a matter of
timing. Despite official propaganda that portrayed him as the
manipulator of events, he said repeatedly that the strike at the
Lenin shipyard this time caught him by surprise and came ``too
early'' to attract enough support to be effective.
   Public dissatisfaction is building, he said, and if authorities
do not pursue reform more effectively _ including dialogue with
Solidarity and other independent groups _ the final result will be
``bloody revolution.''

<HEAD>Officer, Five Instructors Charged in Recruit's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The officer in charge of the Navy rescue
swimmer school and five instructors face military charges in a
recruit's death at Pensacola Naval Air Station, the Navy said.
   Lee William Mirecki, 19, died March 2 shortly after he was
pulled from a pool at Naval Aviation Schools Command.
   Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, the school's top officer, was charged
with dereliction of duty, Rear Adm. David R. Morris, chief of Naval
Air Training in Corpus Christi, Texas, said in a statement Tuesday.
   Petty Officers Richard E. Blevins, David J. Smith, Michael W.
Combe, Frankie E. Deaton and John W. Zelenock were charged with
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery.
   Mirecki died after swimming exercises in the rescue school
program that trains Navy air crew personnel for search and rescue
missions.
   Initially, the Navy said Mirecki died of natural causes. But
Mirecki's classmates contacted news media and his family to say he
was treated unusually harshly the day he died.
   Mirecki's sister, Lyn Johansen, said recruits told her Mirecki
was having trouble performing a difficult exercise known as
``sharks and daisies,'' in which instructors jump on top of
students in the water to test their rescue abilities.
   ``The others were told to get out, line up by the pool with
their backs to the water, sing the National Anthem and do exercises
while they dealt with Lee individually,'' she said.
   The recruits said Mirecki called for help, got out of the pool
once, asked instructors to allow him to drop the class but was
pulled back into the pool.
   ``After their exercises, they turned around to see Lee's limp,
blue body being pulled from the water,'' Mrs. Johansen said she was
told.
   Rescue workers began cardiopulmonary resuscitation, she said.
   Morris will appoint an investigating officer to determine
whether the evidence warrants referring the charges to a
court-martial or dropping them.
   If convicted, Torchia faces a maximum penalty of punitive
dismissal from the Navy and three months' confinement; the
instructors face a maximum penalty of dismissal and three years'
confinement.

<HEAD>Gallup Poll Finds Dukakis Well Ahead for June 7 California Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts holds a
commanding lead over Jesse Jackson among likely Democratic voters
in California's June 7 presidential primary, a Gallup Poll said
Wednesday.
   Dukakis was supported by 67 percent of the 487 Democrats
surveyed, to 26 percent for Jackson, with 7 percent undecided or
favoring someone else.
   The Massachusetts governor also led slightly in the state in a
hypothetical general election race against the likely Republican
nominee, Vice President George Bush, with 46 percent of the 1,205
registered voters backing Dukakis, 42 percent favoring Bush and 12
percent undecided or choosing another.
   In a hypothetical Bush-Jackson race, Bush led with 58 percent to
31 percent for Jackson and 11 percent in the other or undecided
category.
   The telephone survey, conducted May 5-7, had a five-point margin
of error for the results among Democrats and plus or minus three
points for the questions asked of all voters.

   The state chairman of Jesse Jackson's
presidential campaign says he plans to run for a seat on the
Democratic National Committee to test the party's sensitivity to
Jackson supporters.
   State Sen. Eugene Walker said Tuesday he will contest the
re-election of Herb Mabry, state president of the AFL-CIO, who has
been a committee member from Georgia for 25 years.
   The state Democratic committee will vote Saturday in Savannah to
fill four DNC seats, including Mabry's, for four-year terms.
   ``We've developed a constituency that's very large and loyal to
the Democratic Party,'' Walker said. ``That constituency has earned
a voice on the DNC.''
   Mabry, an automatic unpledged ``super delegate'' to the
Democratic National Convention, said he had thought Jackson's
campaign would challenge someone else.
   ``Why pick me?'' Mabry asked.

   The man in charge of raising New Orleans' $6
million share of the Republican National Convention costs said
Wednesday the job is too much for one person.
   Officials said $3 million must be raised in 90 days.
   ``This morning I certainly feel like the job is too big for any
one man,'' oilman Patrick Taylor told reporters. ``I have been sort
of perversely flattered in that everybody, when it was turned over
to me, they just all sort of walked away and forgot it. It's been
sort of lonely.''
   Taylor sounded the alarm Tuesday for the first time when he told
city officials the money was not coming in as planned. Until then,
those associated with the fund-raising effort had appeared
confident the money would be available in time to pay bills.
   About $1 million has been raised for the national convention
Aug. 15-18 in the Louisiana Superdome. An additional $3 million
must be raised in 90 days, officials said.

<HEAD>Study: Poor, Minorities Disenfranchised By Voting Barriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Discriminatory voter registration procedures
are disenfranchising the poor, minority and disabled citizens
throughout the country, directors of a private study said Wednesday.
   Among the practices are arbitrary registration hours,
inconvenient registration locations, ``mysterious purging of voters
without notice, denial of registration before an election,'' said a
statement from Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who is the author of
legislation to correct such practices.
   The Citizens Commission on Civil Rights in hearings in New York,
Atlanta and Phoenix in 1984 and 1985 ``documented numerous examples
of discrimintory practices,'' the group said.
   The commission also reviewed the registration systems in each
state and the historical voting and registration practices. The
report said in most states, local officials have ``wide
discretion'' in setting times, places and conditions for people to
register to vote.
   ``This discretion is often is exercised in ways which establish
barriers to registration and voting,'' said the report.
   The restrictive practices ``have a disproportionately adverse
effect on low-income, minority and disabled citizens,'' the report
said. It cited the following examples:
   _ Limited registration sites affect poor people who don't own
cars.
   _ Limited hours for registration affect working people who can't
get away from their jobs.
   _ Many registration sites are inaccessible to the disabled.
   _ Failure to provide bilingual assistance affects low-income
citizens and non-English speaking minorities.
   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 has eliminated the most blatant
discrimination practices, but ``remnants of the old systems of
disenfranchisement persist,'' the report said.
   Among the specific problems are refusal by local officials to
designate sites in black commuinities for mobile registration
units; requirement of excessive identification from black
applicants; ``undue scrutiny'' of Hispanics and Asian-Americans to
determine their citizenship; sites ``that require extraordinarily
long trips'' and dual registration requirements for tribal and
state elections for Native Americans.
   The commission recommended legislation to permit registration by
mail, election-day registration, and a congressional investigation
into denial of the right to vote for homeless people.
   Cranston's bill, pending in Senate committee, and a companion
House bill by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., generally parallels those
recommendations.
   The commission is sending a copy of its report to Congress, the
White House and the presidential candidates, seeking support for
its proposals.

<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO on Wednesday said a new $13
million broadcast advertising campaign was designed to show that
unions, like their workers, are interested in fairness, justice and
life outside the job.
   The ads, which all end with a chorus singing ``America works
best when we say union yes,'' have begun appearing on the
television networks and in 13 local markets. The 30-second spots
are expected to reach more than nine out of 10 of all American
homes at least four times.
   Radio spots will be aired as well, including one that urges
listeners to ask Congress to override President Reagan's expected
veto of the trade legislation. Unions have been pushing a provision
of the bill requiring mandatory notice of plant closings for large
companies.
   At a closed-circuit TV news conference to the 13 cities where
the TV ads will be shown, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said
``the labor movement has a long, well-documented record of fighting
for the rights and the standard of living of working Americans. But
in spite of that, there are still many Americans who have serious
misconceptions about what unions do and about whether or not they
are necessary in today's work place.''
   ``The goal of `Union Yes,''' he said, ``is to talk directly with
American workers about the value of unions in the work place today.
One of the best ways to do that now is through television.''
   Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America,
told reporters in Washington that the ads ``fill a need to let the
population at large know what the trade union movement stands for.''
   He said many Americans have ``a stereotype of unions and union
members. They see a heavyset fellow smoking a cigar and wearing a
$500 suit.''
   One commercial focuses on women, with a woman saying unions have
ensured fairness in promotions. Another, obviously pregnant, woman
says that because of unions she will be able to take time off to
have her baby and come back to a job.
   The first phase of the ad campaign runs through mid-June. The
second phase picks up on Labor Day in September. The campaign,
which is paid for with union dues, is expected to last two years.
   The ads will star actors Jack Lemmon, Tyne Daly and Howard
Hesseman.
   Local TV ads will run during May and June in New York, Los
Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston, Detroit,
Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Washington, Atlanta, Nashville, Tenn., and
Orlando, Fla.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist officials under pressure to
resolve the country's rising economic and political turmoil said
Wednesday that a party conference will grapple next week with
changes in national leadership.
   Premier Karoly Grosz has said the meeting could lead to
departure of party leader Janos Kadar.
   Critics of the 75-year-old leader, who has headed the party
since 1956 when the Kremlin put down an anti-Soviet revolt, blame
him for Hungary's economic problems and for resisting reform.
   A communique published Wednesday in the state-run media after a
one-day meeting of the Communist Party's Central Committee said it
is ``necessary to renew the party's leading bodies.'' It proposed
that a conference next week elect a new Committee. Its more than
100 members make key policy decisions for the party.
   Wednesday's statement said the Central Committee on Tuesday
approved a draft policy document for debate at the conference.
   The original document was written by Kadar, but the communique
did not make clear whether changes had been made to incorporate
complaints from critics inside and outside the party that it did
not go far enough with reform.
   In the version published last month, the Communist Party
accepted blame for the country's economic woes and offered some
political reforms, such as multicandidate elections and limited
terms in party office.
   But critics said it stopped far short of allowing genuine
political pluralism, an issue hotly debated among the nation's
880,000 Communists and in the state-run media for the past year.
   Austerity measures imposed to curb a gross foreign debt of $17
billion have resulted in inflation of more than 15 percent this
year and prompted widespread grumbling from citizens and the
official trade unions about the government program.
   The communique on Wednesday said leaders at Tuesday's meeting
also debated personnel changes and formed a special committee to
deal with such matters at the three-day conference opening May 20.
But it did not reveal who made the report on personnel matters or
say who will be on the committee.
   Western diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they expected some changes in membership of the Central Committee
at next week's conference. They described Tuesday's decisions as a
modest step forward in dealing with the mounting political and
economic crisis.
   Communist party leaders, including Kadar and Grosz, have said in
recent months they would like the party to retreat from day-to-day
adminstrative duties and concentrate on ideological and political
leadership of the country.
   Grosz has also declared readiness for dialogue with any
Hungarian who is not opposed to socialism and Budapest's alliance
with the Soviet Union.
   Grosz, a leading contender to succeed Kadar as party chief, has
said the political future of the party leader may be up for debate
at next week's conference.
   ``In the event that some 1,000 delegates attending the
conference decide that personnel changes are necessary, and if
these changes include the person of Janos Kadar, he will accept the
decision,'' Grosz told reporters while in Britain last week.
   Kadar has said he would step down if asked, but he has shown
little sign of wanting to do so.
   Hungarians will watch closely to see whether outspoken reformers
move up or down in party rankings when the conference ends with
another Central Committee meeting May 22.

<HEAD>Labor Department To Monitor Pressures On Pension Fund Managers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department launched an effort
Wednesday to ensure that pension fund managers who control a
growing percentage of the nation's corporate stock are free from
improper pressures in takeover battles.
   Over the next several months, department investigators will be
monitoring how selected investment managers vote on takeover
defenses and other issues that affect the value of stock, according
to David M. Walker, assistant secretary of labor.
   The department's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration
issued guidelines in February saying pension fund investment
managers should keep the interests of the members of the fund in
mind when voting proxies for shares in their care. The enforcement
project is intended to see if the guidelines are being followed.
   ``We're not trying to come out pro-corporate management or pro
any other party. The important thing is that pension funds not be
viewed as tools or pawns of corporate management or any other
party,'' Walker said.
   There has been growing concern in recent years that investment
managers have been subject to pressure from parties trying to block
takeovers, such as corporate managers or union leaders, who have
the ability to add to or take away from a fund manager's business.
   ``We want to make sure there's not undue influence, improper
influence, that would adversely affect the economic interests of
the plan,'' Walker said.
   If the enforcement project turns up violations, investment
managers could be subject to civil enforcement proceedings, Walker
said, adding, ``If the plan suffers an economic loss ... then there
is personal liability.''
   Walker said he did not know how much abuse exists. However, a
survey released in September by the Employee Benefit Research
Institute, a Washington-based, non-partisan research organization,
showed that 65 percent of pension fund investment managers reported
being pressured at least once in voting on corporate takeovers.
   ``The stakes are high in this area for a lot of parties. There's
a great potential for abuse and we hear a lot of assertions. ...
We're trying to do a little bit of preventive medicine ... before
abuse becomes widespread,'' Walker said.
   The question of improper influence over fund managers has become
more important as more companies call on shareholders to adopt
poison pills and other measures designed to thwart corporate
raiders.
   Pension funds controlled 24 percent of the nation's stock last
year, up from 19 percent in 1980 and 10 percent in 1970. But, the
percentages are significantly higher for stocks traded on the New
York Stock Exchange, Walker said, and pension funds own 60 percent
of some companies, he said.
   The department estimates by the year 2000, pension funds are
likely to control half the stock in all U.S. companies.

   The nine astronauts who worked in
Skylab, the only manned American space station, gathered Wednesday
to celebrate its launch nearly 15 years ago and to urge a greater
commitment to space exploration.
   ``Space is our frontier, and beginning its exploration may be
our generation's greatest contribution to human history,'' said
Alan Bean, commander of the second of three Skylab crews.
   Gerald Carr, who headed the third mission, agreed, saying future
space probes ``should avoid the 10- to 12-day mindset and plan for
the long haul.''
   Bean, Carr and their seven colleagues joined dozens of engineers
and other members of the Skylab team in observing the historic
events following Skylab's launch aboard a Saturn V rocket on May
14, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   The three Skylab missions, from May 1973 to February 1974,
resulted in significant information about bio-medicine, solar
physics, astrophysics, engineering and technology, materials
processing and other topics.
   But the Skylab team first had to overcome problems that
threatened to jeopardize the mission before the astronauts stepped
aboard.
   Ground crews noticed shortly after the launch that a meteorite
and heat shield had ripped off and struck solar panels that were
left improperly deployed.
   But ground crews managed to alter the lab's orbit and develop a
shield that the first crew members, Joseph P. Kerwin, Charles
``Pete'' Conrad Jr. and Paul Weitz, carried into space with them 11
days after the initial launch.
   The crew made a daring space walk to adjust the panels when they
arrived and salvaged the mission.
   Other Skylab crew members were Owen K. Garriott and Jack Lousma,
who flew on the second mission, and Edward Gibson and William R.
Pogue, on the third.
   Tuesday's conference, sponsored by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and the University of Alabama at Huntsville as
well as local space and aeronautics groups, was held at the Wernher
von Braun Civic Center, named in honor of the former German rocket
scientist who helped develop the American space program after World
War II.
   The Skylab astronauts showed no reluctance to join a similar
mission again.
   ``Eight of us got together after dinner Tuesday night and
someone asked if we would volunteer to go to Mars,'' said Kerwin,
scientist pilot on the mission. ``Eight hands shot up as rapidly as
possible.''
   ``We would do it in a minute,'' said Carr, commander of the last
mission.
   Kerwin said the nation's space program reached its peak in 1967,
when it received 7 percent of the federal budget. He said it had
been shrinking since then, now getting a fraction of 1 percent of
the budget.
   ``I hope that's not permanent,'' he said.
   One thing that Skylab showed, Carr said, is that people can hold
up in space longer than was thought.
   The first crew stayed aboard 28 days, the second 59 days, and
the third 84 days.
   Carr, now an aerospace consultant in Huntsville, Ark., said
today's generation of space scientists should avoid ``reinventing
the wheel. They would be remiss if they don't take the lessons that
have already been learned and re-apply them and build on that
data.''

   Myrtle Beach may have been rated the
East Coast's tackiest tourist spot, but the owner of a miniature
golf course sporting pink flamingo and gorilla statues says such
attractions represent good, clean fun.
   The book, ``The Worst of Everything,'' also rates Los Angeles
the tackiest vacation spot in the West and gives Panama City, Fla.,
that distinction for the Gulf Coast.
   Al Tirrell, owner of Jungle Golf, called the tacky label ``the
most outrageous lies I've ever heard.''
   ``It's a family beach. We're newer, we're cleaner, Tirrell said.
   Vacationer Charlie Jolley, of Mars Hill, N.C., was sympathetic.
``I'd much rather see the plain beach, but you don't come here
expecting it all to be coconut palms,'' Jolley said Tuesday.
   The book's author, Don Lessem, asked authorities in dozens of
fields for their opinions on the worst.

   An elementary school principal paid off
an unusual bet with pupils by donning a tuxedo and bow-tie and
eating a lunch of pizza and cola atop the school's sun-drenched
roof.
   Below, on the school grounds of Lutherville-Timonium Elementary
School, 500 pupils shouted triumphantly, ``Eat, eat, eat.''
   The scene Tuesday was an odd victory celebration for the
students, who were challenged at the beginning of the school year
by principal Fred Brown to read 1 million pages by the end of the
school year.
   The prospect of seeing him eat lunch on the roof of the school
was the reward.
   ``We're not sure whether it (Brown's offer) was a flip remark,''
said librarian Doris Glotzbach. ``But we picked up on it and
wouldn't let it go.''
   There were doubts about whether the students could get through
enough books to reach the goal, but the chance of putting Brown on
the roof apparently proved incentive enough.
   ``It did the job as far as motivating students to read,'' said
fifth-grade teacher Dennis Kimmel. ``They were carrying around
books with them all the time.''

<HEAD>Two Baby Rattles, One Puzzle Game Recalled Over Choking Hazard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission
announced Wednesday the recall of two brands of baby rattles and a
puzzle game because they present a choking hazard to infants.
   The commission said Li Peng Enterprises Inc. of Los Angeles
withdrew its Rainbow Bell rattle, and Toys-R-Us of Rochelle Park,
N.J., withdrew its Crib Pals Shake and Twist Baby Rattle and its
Colorforms Story Book Puzzle.
   The Rainbow rattles, item CT-8013, are plastic with a handle
made of what appears to be beads at one end and four bell-shaped
noise makers in a circle at the other end.
   The commission said it did not know of any injuries caused by
the rattles, but said they posed a choking hazard because the
handle is small enough to enter a child's mouth and can reach the
back of the throat.
   About 86,400 were sold between June 1987 and August 1987 for
$2.85.
   The Crib Pals Shake and Twist Baby Rattles, No. 098132, are 5{
inches by 1} inches and have a ball containing liquid and six
colored pellets. The commission said the rattle can break during
use and the pieces present a potential choking hazard, although no
injuries or deaths have been reported. Approximately 24,000 were
sold from March 1986 to December 1987 through Toys-R-Us stores for
$1.48.
   The Colorforms No. 150 Story Book Puzzles have five wooden
pieces and come in two models, the Pinky Brite Bear and the Rosy
Brite Bear. Some pieces are small enough to present a choking
hazard, the commission said, although no injuries had been reported.
   About 12,000 puzzles were sold from September 1986 to December
1987 through Toys-R-Us for $5.97.

<HEAD>Pentagon Will Increase Payments For Work In Progress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon said Wednesday it would increase
government payments to defense contractors for work in progress to
help ease the burden of lining up financing to perform weapons work.
   The increase in the so-called progress payment percentage will
apply to Defense Department contracts awarded on or after Oct. 1,
the start of fiscal 1989, the Pentagon said in a prepared statement.
   The progress payment rate for large contractors will be
increased from 75 percent to 80 percent a month, while the rate for
small business concerns will be hiked from 80 percent to 85
percent, the Defense Department added.
   The increase is the first since 1981 and follows two reductions
in progress payment rates _ in 1985 and again in 1986.
   The move will cost the U.S. Treasury an estimated $500 million
in fiscal 1989, but is justified because the current 75 percent
rate is imposing ``an excessive financing burden on the defense
industry,'' wrote Robert B. Costello, the undersecretary of defense
for acquisition, who approved the change.
   Under longstanding practice, defense contractors are allowed to
submit monthly bills for contract work in progress instead of
waiting until all work is completed. That system of progress
payments was developed as weapon systems grew larger and more
complex, in many cases requiring years of work and straining the
ability even of the biggest company to borrow enough money to keep
assembly lines moving.
   The Defense Department has never paid progress fees at the full
contract rate, however. Currently, for large firms, it pays out a
maximum 75 percent of the monthly bill. The remaining 25 percent is
withheld pending deliveries, completion of contract work or final
audits.
   The progress payment rate for large contractors has ranged as
high as 90 percent in the early 1980's, when inflation was soaring
in double digits, but held steady at 80 percent from 1968 to 1981.
   The last change in the rate _ dropping it from 80 percent to 75
percent _ occurred in 1986 at Congress' direction in order to trim
government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget
law.
   Unless Congress intervenes with new legislation, however, the
Pentagon is no longer bound to keep the 75 percent rate.
   According to the Defense Department, ``The 25 percent financing
share now required of the defense industry is higher than
historical levels and is not compatible with current interest rates
and economic conditions.''

<HEAD>Jackson Campaign Challenges Delegate Split in Kansas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT TRUELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of Jesse Jackson say the
Democratic presidential candidate was shortchanged in delegates he
received at Kansas district conventions.
   Jackson backers filed a formal challenge to the delegate
selection process last week, as state party officials prepared for
a state Democratic committee meeting on Saturday to choose the last
of Kansas' delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July
in Atlanta.
   Supporters say Jackson should have been allocated 12 national
delegates instead of the seven he received, based on the results of
county caucuses March 19.
   They also say Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis should have 10
delegates instead of 12, and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. should have two
instead of five. The number of uncommitted delegates would remain
at two under the challenge.
   A total of 26 national delegates was selected April 22 at
congressional district conventions.
   Jackson supporters also complain that the way delegates are
chosen in Kansas is confusing and unduly complicated.
   ``It's an unfair process,'' said Charles Meek, state coordinator
for the Jackson campaign. ``When you say `caucus' to the average
person, they say, `What do you mean?' All we're asking for is what
is fair.''
   ``We're still formulating an answer to the challenge,'' said Joe
Scranton, executive director of the Kansas Democratic Party. ``We
don't know what that answer will be yet.''
   The state party has until May 24 to rule on the Jackson
challenge.
   Delegates are selected to the national convention based on a
process that started with 117 local caucuses, which chose the
people who vote at the district conventions.
   The district conventions then selected 26 national delegates
from the five congressional districts. The third and final step is
the selection of 13 delegates at the state committee meeting. Those
delegates will be chosen based on the results of the district
conventions, with seven going to Dukakis and three each to Jackson
and Gore.
   Bill Beachy, former state party executive director who is acting
as a consultant to the Jackson campaign in the challenge, said the
26 national delegates selected at the district conventions should
accurately reflect the results of the local caucuses under a party
rule.
   That rule was not followed, he said.
   Candidates must receive at least 15 percent of the caucus votes
before they can receive any delegates, according to the rules.
Beachy says people were allowed to re-group at the district
conventions and previously uncommitted delegates threw in with
either Dukakis or Gore.
   Although Gore did not break the 15 percent threshold in the
local caucuses in three congressional districts, he received one
delegate from each of those districts after picking up uncommitted
delegates at the district conventions.
   ``They shouldn't be allowed to re-group after the caucuses,''
Beachy said. ``The caucuses set what the (delegate) allocations
should be.''
   Scranton acknowledged there is a difference of opinion in
interpretation of party rules.
   He also joined Jackson supporters in their complaints about the
complicated process.
   ``Anyone who has tried to administer this, from the county
selection on up to the national selection, is painfully aware of
how complicated it is,'' Scranton said.

<TEXT>
   Eight soldiers who trained Jamaican
troops after the 1983 Grenada invasion have been indicted by a
federal grand jury for allegedly submitting thousands of dollars in
false travel vouchers to the Army.
   The Special Forces soldiers from Fort Bragg, who were
temporarily housed in the Americana Hotel in Ochos Rios, Jamaica,
allegedly conspired to receive two sets of receipts. One showed the
amount actually paid for their rooms, $27.50; the second showed
that the hotel received $55.
   The indictment, handed down Tuesday, said that just before or
immediately after returning to Fort Bragg in May 1984, the eight
destroyed the receipts that reflected what was actually paid.
   They then filled out false travel vouchers that showed they paid
the greater amount and were reimbursed, according to the indictment.
   Each of the eight was indicted on a single count of conspiring
to defraud the United States, along with a second count of
submitting a false claim for reimbursement of lodging expenses.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Raleigh said the
conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison,
a fine of up to $250,000, or both.
   The false claim charge carries a maximum of five years in prison
and a fine of up to twice what was taken, or $250,000, or both, the
spokesman said.
   The indictment did not indicate the total amount of the false
vouchers, and the Army would not comment Wednesday.
   The indictment alleged that the eight were assigned in December
1983 to Jamaica to provide trained personnel to serve as security
forces for the government of Grenada following the invasion of that
country two months before. The eight returned to Fort Bragg in May
1984.

   Former President Nixon has notified Republican
Party officials that he does not want to be invited to address the

Wednesday.
   In a letter to Republican Party chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf

London Sunday Times he would be avoiding any political activity
this year.
   Nixon also notified Fred Malek, Vice President George Bush's
choice for convention manager. Malek worked in the Nixon White
House.
   The party source, who insisted on anonymity, said there was
sentiment among party officials to invite Nixon to address the New
Orleans convention.
   But Nixon, who was driven from office by the Watergate scandal,
was aware that his appearance would be controversial, said the
source. The former president has not appeared at a Republican
National Convention since he left office.
   Bush already has locked up the GOP presidential nomination.

   A prosecutor who police said was naked
from the waist down when they pulled her car over after a
high-speed chase was cleared of trying to outrun the officers.
   Former Assistant State Attorney Jan Bamping, 32, who resigned
her post after publicity about the incident, was cleared Tuesday of
fleeing to elude an officer, the only criminal charge against her.
She pleaded guilty to two non-criminal traffic charges and was
fined $400.
   ``I have paid for this more than I ever should have, I think,''
she said after Tuesday's hearing.
   On March 20, Bradenton Beach police said they spotted Ms.
Bamping _ accompanied by prosecutor Jerry Blevins, who also later
resigned _ pass improperly, and tried to pull her over.
   The officers claimed she fled at up to 90 mph, then turned
belligerent when police caught up with her and asked her why she
was semi-nude.
   They accused her of threatening them by using the name of
Manatee County Judge Walter Talley and showing her state attorney
badge.
   Ms. Bamping denied Tuesday that she was partly naked. She said
she was wearing a knee-length shirt at the time.
   ``I was not partially clothed. I was not fleeing. I was polite.
I never used Judge Talley's name. I did not threaten them,'' she
said.
   She was cleared of the misdemeanor flight charge in part because
the officers never mentioned a high-speed chase in taped radio
conversations and did not request assistance, as is usual in such
cases.
   Her former boss, State Attorney Frank Schaub, refused to discuss
the case in detail, but said Tuesday ``I cannot reappoint her.''
   Ms. Bamping said she plans to stay in Florida.

   The Federal Election Commission on Wednesday
certified another $1.7 million in federal matching funds to
presidential candidates.
   That brings to $54.5 million the total that has been passed out
so far to 15 candidates, most of whom are now out of the race.
   After a candidate drops out, the individual may still receive
matching funds to cover debts and winding down costs.
   To be eligible for matching funds a candiate must raise $100,000
privately in sums of $250 or less across 20 states. The Federal
Treasury thereafter matches each contribution of $250 or less.
   The amounts approved Wednesday followed by the total the

<HEAD>Hodel Attacks `Pure Racism' in Bill on Indian Adoption and Custody
Laws</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel on
Wednesday attacked a bill to amend Indian adoption and child
custody laws, saying it contains provisions that smack of ``pure
racism.''
   Hodel wrote Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the
Select Committee on Indian Affairs, that he was ``extremely
alarmed'' about some portions of the bill.
   Assistant Interior Secretary Ross Swimmer, a former principal
chief of the Cherokee Nation who is in charge of Indian affairs,
asked the committee to hold up action on the bill until the
department could propose a substitute.
   Hodel said one provision of the bill gives parents no right to
object to a tribe's attempt to transfer custody or adoption cases
from state to tribal court unless the objection is ``consistent
with the best interests of the child as an Indian.''
   ``The provision ignores all other aspects of the child's status
as a human being. That, in my view, is pure racism,'' Hodel said.
   Current law permits tribes to claim jurisdiction in adoption and
custody cases only for children of enrolled members, but the bill
would extend that jurisdiction to children whose ``parents and
other ancestors of the child may have had no connection with the
tribe, perhaps for years or even generations,'' Hodel said.
   In his testimony at a hearing of the committee, Swimmer said,
``We do not believe that Indian parents and their children should
have to return to the reservation of their tribe, which is often in
another state, for a court proceeding concerning the child.''
   ``We strongly oppose the expansion of the definition of Indian
child and recommend that the definition should not only contain a
membership requirement but also that the domicile of the
birthparent or parents is in Indian country,'' Swimmer said.
   If the family does not live in Indian country _ on a reservation
_ then state courts should have jurisdiction, following certain
guidelines of federal law for placement of children in foster homes
and adoptions ``unless the best interest of the child requires a
different placement,'' Swimmer said.

   American and Soviet negotiators reached tentative
agreement Wednesday night on a handful of sticking points on
preventing cheating on a missile-ban treaty, a senior U.S. official
said.
   The issues are technical, but U.S. Senate leaders have vowed not
to take up the treaty until they are settled.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to
predict Senate passage of the nuclear missile treaty as a result of
the progress in talks supervised by Secretary of State George P.
Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   But, he said, ``it is still our expectation we're going to get
this resolved'' before President Reagan's visit to Moscow May 29
for a fourth summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The issues, involving verification of the agreement to scrap all
U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range missiles, were taken up by two
teams of negotiators headed by American Maynard Glitman and Col.
Gen. Nikolai Chervov, the senior arms control specialist on the
Soviet general staff.
   Four or five issues were tentatively resolved, including two big
hurdles, the U.S. official said. One deals with U.S. demands to
inspect Soviet missile containers big enough to hold only a stage
of a rocket. The other involves how much access U.S. inspectors
will have to Soviet missile plants and bases.
   Nine verification problems surfaced in recent weeks. In
addition, the Soviets demanded the right to inspect West German
Pershing 1-A missiles stored in the United States.
   In another sign of progress, the two sides agreed to exchange
notes on futuristic weapons. The aim is to persuade Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and
other critics that the ban would apply to intermediate-range
weapons that have not been developed yet.
   Shultz said earlier Wednesday he could not guarantee Senate
approval of the treaty before the Moscow summit.
   ``I can't tell you what the Senate is going to do,'' Shultz told
reporters before his first meeting at the U.S. mission with
Shevardnadze. ``That's for the Senate to decide. But I think it
would be a good thing to have ratification before the summit
meeting.''
   On Monday, the Senate indefinitely postponed debate on the
treaty. Democratic and Republican leaders said the Soviet response
to U.S. complaints about restrictions on monitoring were inadequate.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader,
said: ``We don't want to give the Soviets loopholes to cheat.''
   State Department officials were less critical but also urged the
Soviets to modify restraints they intended to impose on American
monitors at missile plants.
   Shultz suggested that Shevardnadze was as interested as he was
in seeing the treaty ratified.
   ``I am not going to try to characterize the disagreements,'' the
secretary said.
   ``Since nobody has ever done anything like this before, it's not
surprising there are problems. Obviously we think we're on the
right track. However, we approach this in a problem-solving
spirit.''
   Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.: ``We think
that we can iron out our differences. They are not very big ... so
we still hope and we think that the Senate is going to ratify the
treaty before the Moscow summit.''
   The pact on intermediate-range missiles, which Reagan and
Gorbachev signed last December, is unprecedented in its provisions
for on-site inspection to guard against infractions.
   It also is the first U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate an
entire category of nuclear weapons.
   Under its provisions, the Soviets would destroy 683 missiles and
the Americans 364 _ all their rockets with ranges of 315 to 3,125
miles.
   Shultz had two sessions with Shevardnadze on Wednesday and two
more scheduled for Thursday. The secretary of state will go to
Belgium Friday to brief the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
then fly home to report to Reagan and the Senate.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze were also dealing with summit
preparations and other issues such as human rights and the presence
of Cuban troops in Marxist-ruled Angola.

   A second luxury yacht seized for carrying tiny
amounts of drugs remained in U.S. Customs custody Wednesday, as the
crackdown under the new ``zero tolerance'' policy continued.
   And a jetliner owned by Colombia's Avianca Airlines was seized
Wednesday following the investigation that began when cocaine was
found aboard it.
   The seizures come a day after the $2.5 million Ark Royal was
allowed to sail away following payment of a fine.
   The $600,000 Ms. Mindy, a boat used to entertain customers of
North Miami's Cigarette Racing Team, was boarded Monday as it
returned from the Bahamas and docked in Port Salerno.
   A search by Customs agents turned up cocaine residue on a dollar
bill and traces of marijuana in a plastic bag.
   ``It's simply being detained and checked right now for
narcotics, and a determination will be made later'' whether to
confiscate the ship, Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan said
Wednesday.
   Neither the ship's captain, Lewis Shaver, nor his unidentified
first mate, who were the only people aboard the boat registered out
of Orange Beach, Ala., were charged with drug possession.
   Sheehan said the plane's seizure also was ``consistent with zero
tolerance.''
   The new, tough policy allows the confiscation of a boat, plane
or other conveyance if it carries any amount of drugs, no matter
how small.
   The plane's seizure was based on a 35.8-pound cocaine shipment
found March 27, Sheehan said, adding that the delay was to allow
for a full investigation.
   Avianca has a right to appeal the process by petitioning the
government for release of the plane, Sheehan said.
   Since October 1986 Customs has made 10 seizures aboard Avianca
planes, many of them in flower shipments, for a total of 1,000
pounds of cocaine.
   The Ark Royal, seized under the get-tough rule, was held for
three days after the Coast Guard found some marijuana seeds and
stems in a trash can and a drawer Saturday.
   But the 133-foot vessel, complete with hot tubs and a grand
piano, was released Tuesday afternoon when Michael Rogerson,
president of the California-based company that owns the boat, paid
a $1,600 fine.
   Fewer than 10 percent of vessels seized by the government are
ever returned to owners. The Ark Royal was in that minority because
its owner moved swiftly and filed a convincing petition, Customs
officials said.

   The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday
required banks, savings institutions and credit unions to meet
strict deadlines for making available funds deposited by check.
   The new rules, effective Sept. 1, require financial institutions
to give customers access to deposited funds within one, three or
seven days, depending on the type of check deposited.
   Banks have opposed the rules fearing they won't have enough time
to make sure deposited checks will not bounce and are not forged.
Consumer advocates, however, say some banks make customers wait
longer than necessary before they get access to their money.
   According to staff members, the Fed was flooded by more than
1,000 formally submitted comments after it proposed the rules in
December.
   The board voted 4-2 to approve the new regulation. One
dissenter, Martha Seger, argued that it burdens small institutions
with paperwork and leaves banks vulnerable to fraud. Board member
H. Robert Heller also voted against the rules.
   Board member Wayne Angell, who voted to approve the regulation,
said legislation enacted by Congress in August left the Federal
Reserve with little choice but to adopt it. Angell was joined by
Chairman Alan Greenspan, Edward W. Kelley Jr., and Manuel H.
Johnson.
   Funds from cashier's checks, certified checks and government
checks must be made available for withdrawal by 9 a.m. on the next
business day.
   Financial institutions will have three days to make funds
available from local checks written on an institution in the same
metropolitan area.
   Funds from checks written on out-of-town banks can be held up
for as long as seven days.
   By 1990, the hold periods will shrink to two days for local
checks and five days for out-of-town checks.
   Checks deposited through automatic teller machines after 2 p.m.
will not be considered received until the next day.
   The Federal Reserve is also requiring banks to disclose their
availability policies at teller windows and to provide a reminder
on preprinted deposit slips to custmers using automatic tellers.

<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan's stargazer hopes to keep her
White House consulting link until the Reagans return to California,
but says she's troubled by being in the spotlight and by the
``kooks'' in her business.
   Joan Quigley, so discreet about her work that one of her
high-society acquaintances said she ``didn't know anything about
this astrology bit,'' contends her role has been greatly
exaggerated.
   ``Mrs. Reagan is a very able woman and is very nice to deal
with,'' Quigley said. ``She uses astrology constructively.''
   But after the Reagans leave the White House next January,
``there's no way'' she'd sign up a subsequent president as a
client, Quigley said in an interview.
   ``After the end of this year, I will never do anything connected
with any U.S. president or his wife or anybody again,'' she said
Tuesday. Quigley has been besieged by reporters and photographers
since Sunday's disclosure of her high-level consultations.
   The socialite and heiress, author of three books on astrology,
was a regular guest on Merv Griffin's television talk show from
1973 to 1985, making astrological predictions. She met Mrs. Reagan
through Griffin, a longtime friend of the Reagans who shares a July
6 birthday with the first lady.
   But despite her television appearances, Quigley has largely
evaded public scrutiny.
   ``She is one of the few I've met astrologically who doesn't seek
or want publicity,'' said Robert Cooper, executive secretary of the
Tempe, Ariz.-based American Federation of Astrologers. He calls her
``well-versed in classical astrology.''
   Quigley, a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Vassar College, said she
developed her interest in astrology from her mother and her disdain
for sensationalism from her father, the late John B. Quigley, a
prominent San Francisco Republican and hotelier. His view of it as
a bizarre profession caused her to keep her work secret early in
her career.
   The publicity of the past few days, she said, ``is very
embarrassing to me.''
   ``I've been put in a terrible situation because I'm an ethical
person and I don't talk about my clients. But I had to come forward
to show that I am a serious person with a scientific approach to
astrology.''
   She declines to discuss her handful of clients but is quick to
criticize pop astrologers and syndicated horoscope writers she
regards as the ``kooks'' and charlatans of her profession.
   ``How can it be possible that the same thing is happening to
one-twelfth of the world's population on a given day? They give
astrology a superstitious name,'' Quigley said.
   Quigley said she offered her services to the Reagans in the 1980
campaign, then signed on as a consultant for an undisclosed fee in
1981, after Reagan was shot and Mrs. Reagan's concerns about his
scheduling were heightened.
   Quigley said she has spoken with Mrs. Reagan this week but would
not reveal her reaction to the flap. A spokeswoman for the first
lady has said she will continue to use astrological portents in
shaping the president's schedule.
   Reagan, according to the astrologer, has a ``fabulous'' chart.
``He's an Aquarian, and all our greatest presidents except for
Washington have been Aquarians: Lincoln, FDR and Reagan,'' she said.

<HEAD>China Has Ended Pork Rationing, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has ended pork rationing, according to
Chinese officials, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   ``A Chinese agriculture official privately stated that pork
rationing in Beijing had stopped being enforced,'' the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service said in a report. ``Other officials
said that pork rationing had ended throughout the country, though
no official announcement has confirmed this.''
   China began rationing pork in most major cities last fall in
response to shortages. Pork traditionally supplies about 80 percent
of the total animal protein in the Chinese diet.
   ``The pork shortages that led to the rationing did not, however,
affect China's ability to supply hogs to its limited export markets
(primarily Hong Kong),'' the report said. ``In fact, the country
has had a surplus of hogs for export to Hong Kong, but increases in
hog trade between the two countries have been limited by a Chinese
export quota.''
   The report said an end to rationing ``shows that Chinese
agricultural officials believe the tight pork supply situation is
now being resolved'' as producers respond to lower feed prices,
higher pork prices and government incentives to promote larger
production.
   ``It also is an indication that many urban consumers are willing
to pay more for the higher-quality, free market pork instead of
enduring the cheaper, fattier meat that has been sold at lower
prices in state markets,'' the report said.

   Underground leaders in the occupied lands urged
Palestinians on Wednesday to ``burn the earth with fire and anger''
in continued rebellion.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the uprising has the same
goals as Palestinian ``terror organizations,'' and declared that
``terror must be met by force.''
   Doctors at Ramallah Hospital in the West Bank said a 19-year-old
Arab died of gunshot wounds suffered in a clash with Israeli
soldiers last month in a village near Bethlehem.
   An army spokesman said reports of the death were being
investigated. It would bring to at least 186 the number of
Palestinians killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip since Palestinian riots began Dec. 8.
   Instructions for more Arab strikes, boycotts and other
resistance appeared in a new underground leaflet. It was
distributed as soldiers rounded up at least 11 journalists and
other community leaders in overnight raids.
   ``Let's burn the earth with fire and anger under the feet of the
occupation,'' the leaflet said. ``Painful blows should be inflicted
against the occupation soldiers and policemen and the
collaborators.''
   The bulletin was the 16th from the United Leadership of the
Uprising in five months of rebellion among the 1.5 million
Palestinians in the occupied territories, which Israel captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   It said the leadership ``calls for a complete boycott of the
Zionists and asks the people to ready themselves for civil
disobedience by storing food in houses, enough for at least a
month.''
   Police spokesman Alex Lapidoth in Jerusalem said more than 2,000
extra officers were ordered deployed in the Holy City from Thursday
through early next week.
   He said they were needed to handle anticipated Arab protests
this weekend at the end of the Moslem feast of Ramadan and on
Sunday, Jerusalem Day, when Israelis celebrate the 21st anniversary
of city's reunification.
   The leaflet ordered demonstrations on Friday the Moslem sabbath,
a ``day of anger'' and general strike Sunday and a march by
teachers to protest the closing of Palestinian schools.
   Rabin told a meeting of B'nai B'rith leaders from around the
world the uprising has ``the same political goals ... that the
Palestinian terror organizations try to achieve by terror and
atrocities.''
   ``Terror must be met by force,'' he said. ``Any giving in to
violence will invite more violence, terror and the increasing
danger of war.''
   He defended the use of force to put down the revolt, saying
soldiers and police acted within the limits of Israeli law.
   ``I know that you have seen television day and night, all the
stories of confrontation between civilians and the military,'' he
said. ``I will not deny it. This is what we have to do.''
   In the West Bank village of Qabatiyeh, 47 Palestinians were
charged with manslaughter in the lynching death of an Arab man
accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities, Israel radio
reported.
   Mohammed Id Sakanda was dragged from his home and hanged from an
electricity pole in February.
   Israeli soldiers closed the main vegetable market in Hebron and
used loudspeakers to order merchants there and in other towns to
keep their shops closed in the morning, when leaders of the
uprising have told them to open.
   A struggle between the army and Palestinian leadership over when
stores will close and open has continued for months.

   The Marine Air Contingency Battalion, dispatched from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., ``will conduct jungle patrolling, small arms

<TEXT>
   A former Libertarian congressional
candidate was accused of trying to hire a ``patriotic'' assassin to
kill Mayor Henry Cisneros ``to make a statement,'' authorities said
Wednesday.
   Parker E. Abell, 74, a tax protester who claims to be head of a
political extremist group called the American Patriots, was held
without bail in the Bexar County Jail on charges of solicitation of
capital murder.
   Abell, who was under surveillance for about a month, was
arrested Tuesday after agreeing to pay an undercover officer $5,000
to kill Cisneros, District Attorney Fred Rodriguez said.
   ``He was doing it to make a statement. He wanted to get
publicity,'' Rodriguez said. ``It wasn't a spur-of-the-moment
thing. It was thought out. He is firm in his convictions and
somehow or another he wanted a hitman with the same resolve, the
same philsophy.
   ``He just didn't want anybody. He wanted a patriot to carry out
the execution,'' said Rodriguez, who met with the mayor Wednesday
to discuss the threat.
   Cisneros, 40, a four-term mayor and former president of the
National League of Cities, said he was not getting additional
protection and joked that he was insulted he was worth only $5,000.
   ``I'm going about the business of San Antonio and this is not
going to dissuade me,'' Cisneros said.
   Abell, a resident of Natalia, 18 miles east of San Antonio,
mentioned other possible targets, including State Comptroller Bob
Bullock, before deciding on Cisneros, the prosecutor said.
   ``Bullock's name was mentioned ... but for whatever reason,
Bullock being out of town, not enough name ID, he settled on Henry
Cisneros,'' Rodriguez said.
   Officers arrested Abell at a supermarket pay phone. In his car
were a .22-caliber rifle and ``execution warrants'' issued by the
``Sovereign Court of the People,'' police said.
   The warrants contained blanks for names of public officials to
be assassinated.
   ``The above-named traitor or traitors are to be executed on
sight,'' read the warrants. ``Each accused has given public proof
of guilt beyond reasonable doubt that he or she is a traitor to the
people of the United States and the United States Constitution.''
   Rodriguez said the investigation began about a month ago after
Internal Revenue Service officials contacted his office, saying an
IRS undercover agent had talked to Abell, who wanted to assassinate
a public official.
   An undercover officer later talked to Abell on the telephone
several times and in person for the first time Tuesday, Rodriguez
said.
   Abell was a Libertarian candidate for the 23rd Congressional
District seat in 1982. More recently, he and several members of his
group picketed the courthouse to protest the grand jury system,
officials said.
   ``He said his group was small to avoid dissension among the
troops,'' said Assistant District Attorney Skip Atwell, head of the
special crimes unit.
   Gary Johnson, secretary of the Libertarian Party of Texas, said
Abell's affiliation with the party ended in 1985.
   ``Our philosophy is to live and let live and, politically, we
would like to see as little government as possible,'' Johnson said,
``but we don't want to do this through violent means.''

   Thunderstorms dumped rain in Texas and pelted Florida, Maryland
and Pennsylvania with hail Wednesday, while rain dampened much of
New York and New England.
   Sunny skies prevailed from the south Atlantic and Gulf Coast
states across the Ohio, Mississippi and Tennessee valleys to
portions of the northern and central Plains. Skies were also sunny
from the Rockies to the West Coast.
   Up to 2 inches of rain fell in parts of southwest Texas, causing
some local flooding. A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect for
a large part of southern Texas.
   The storms produced hail between Waldo and Green Cove Springs in
northern Florida and pea- to marble-size hail in central Maryland
and eastern Pennsylvania.
   Rain was widespread from eastern New York to most of New
England. The only section of New England to escape rain was
northern Maine.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.38 inches at San Angelo, Texas; 0.49 inch at Midland,
Texas; 0.47 inch at Bridgheport, Conn., and 0.46 inch at Hartford,
Conn.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 43 degrees at Grand
Marais, Minn., to 104 at Thermal, Calif. The nation's morning low
was 16 at Gunnison, Colo.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern and eastern Texas to southern Mississippi; scattered
showers over the Great Lakes, northern New York and northern
Vermont; rain over parts of Washington and Oregon, and sunshine
over most of the remainder of the nation.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the 70s and 80s across
most of the nation, with readings in the 60s in New England and New
York, in the 50s and 60s from Michigan to eastern Minnesota, and in
the 90s to near 105 in the desert Southwest.

<TEXT>
   Sportscaster Howard Cosell drank ``before,
during and after telecasts'' and once threw up on Don Meredith's
cowboy boots during ``Monday Night Football,'' a former ABC Sports
executive says in a forthcoming book.
   In ``Up Close & Personal: The Inside Story of Network Television
Sports,'' Jim Spence also calls Cosell ``one of the unhappiest
human beings on this planet.''
   Spence, who worked at ABC for 26 years, was senior vice
president of ABC Sports from 1978 until he left the network in
1986. He is now president of a sports production and marketing
company.
   His book, co-written with Dave Diles, will be in bookstores next
month.
   Spence describes Cosell as an insecure, overbearing man who
became impossible to work with late in his career.
   ``He had made millions of dollars, traveled the world, been
applauded and honored time and time again. Yet, today, I think he
is one of the unhappiest human beings on this planet,'' he wrote.
   Cosell, 70, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A woman
answering the phone at his home said he was visiting his wife at a
New York hospital, where she is recovering from surgery.
   According to Spence, Cosell's drinking sometimes became a
``major problem.''
   During a ``Monday Night Football'' telecast from Philadelphia in
1970, he said, Cosell ``got so drunk he couldn't pronounce the name
of the city he was in without slurring.''
   Cosell left the booth after throwing up on Meredith, one of his
broadcasting partners. At the request of ABC Sports chief Roone
Arledge, Spence said, an ABC spokesman told reporters that Cosell
became ill after one drink because of a reaction to flu medication
he was taking.
   Spence said Cosell ``again got out of control'' during ABC's
telecast of the 1984 American League playoffs when he kept kept
interrupting colleague Al Michaels.
   Spence said he got a call the next day from Michael's agent, who
said ``Al had told him that Cosell was drinking heavily and was
impossibly argumentative, and that Al could no longer tolerate it.''
   Cosell's relationship with Michaels and other ABC sportscasters
reached a low point after he criticized them in his 1985 book, ``I
Never Played the Game.''
   ``We were all sick and tired of his bad-mouthing of everybody
and everything,'' Spence wrote.
   Cosell left the network in 1985. In January, he started a
nationally-syndicated TV show that recently went off the air.

<HEAD>OSHA Imposes $3.1 Million Fine Against IBP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration imposed a $3.1 million fine Wednesday against IBP
Inc. for requiring employees at its Dakota City, Neb., meatpacking
plant to do such repetitive work that their health was endangered.
   The fine is the second largest OSHA has ever imposed against an
individual company. The only bigger fine _ $4.2 million _ was
levied against Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, in November 1987,
said OSHA spokesman Terry Mikelson.
   Mikelson said inspectors and a specially hired expert in
ergonomics found a ``significant occurrence'' of repetitive motion
injuries among workers at the plant. The agency maintains that IBP
could have taken numerous steps to reduce the risk of such
injuries, but did not.
   OSHA Deputy Assistant Secretary Frank White said the injuries
are ``a major health hazard in one of the most dangerous
occupations in the country, and we want the meatpacking industry,
in general, and IBP, in particular, to eliminate the problem.''
   ``IBP has known about the high toll that these disorders have
had on its work force but has chosen not to deal with it,'' White
said.
   IBP, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Co., has 15 working
days to contest the fine. The company already is contesting a $2.6
million fine levied by OSHA last July for safety and record
violations at the Dakota City plant.
   In a statement issued late Wednesday, IBP officials said the
citation ``represents a misguided attempt by OSHA to force the
meatpacking industry to blindly accept untested theories about the
prevention of repetitive motion disorders.''
   ``OSHA's goal is to intimidate companies by threatening enormous
penalties unless they accept Alice in Wonderland theories,'' the
statement said.
   The company said that it has urged OSHA to develop a special
program for the meatpacking industry, but OSHA has not done that.
   Al Zack, a spokesman for United Food and Commercial Workers
Union, said he was pleased with OSHA's action and its
recommendations for changes in working conditions at the plant.
   ``There are very simple ways of preventing injuries,'' Zack
said, ``and it's better to prevent the injuries than fining the
employer afterward. It would be far preferable if IBP would stop
denying there is a problem and start working on solutions.''
   Mikelson of OSHA said the history of the latest fine dates back
to November 1987, when safety inspectors from the agency ``noticed
a pattern of repetitive motion injuries,'' a sometimes crippling
injury caused by repeated hand, wrist and arm motion.
   As a result of that finding, Mikelson said, OSHA expanded its
inspection to health-related issues and hired an expert in
ergonomics, David Cochran, of the University of Nebraska at
Lincoln, to do more extensive studies.
   What the studies found, Mikelson said, was that 620 workers at
45 work stations at the Dakota City plant were ``at grave risk'' of
developing repetitive motion illnesses. Of those, 377 workers
actually had developed the illness, Mikelson said. Some of those
required surgery to correct, some are on restricted work schedules
and some are on permanent disability leaves, he said.
   The affected employees work on the production lines, doing such
work as cutting, trimming, hide removal and lifting meat with
hooks, Mikelson said.
   OSHA maintains that IBP should have done such things as changing
the design of knives, educating workers about the need to change
positions periodically and slowing its production line.
   ``Much of this particular situation is connected with a speedup
of the production line,'' Mikelson said.
   The $3.1 million fine represents a $5,000 penalty for each of
the 620 workers. Mikelson estimated that a total of 3,000 people
work at the Dakota City plant, one of 15 IBP plants.
   OSHA began investigating IBP in the winter of 1986 after
receiving a worker complaint about conditions at the Dakota City
plant. A preliminary investigation showed that IBP's records showed
an unusually low occurrence of worker injuries and illnesses,
Mikelson said.
   OSHA then launched a more extensive investigation, which
resulted in the $2.6 million fine for under-reporting injuries and
illnesses at the plant.
   At the time when OSHA was beginning its first investigation, IBP
and workers at the plant were engaged in a bitter lockout that
turned into a strike. The seven-month strike by the United Food and
Commercial Workers Union ended last July.

   Pat Robertson announced Wednesday that he
would halt his Republican presidential race next week, and said in
a newspaper inerview that he will likely return to his financially
ailing Christian Broadcasting Network.
   Barbara Gattullo, a spokeswoman for Americans for Robertson,
said the decision to return to CBN is ``not set in stone, but the
important thing is whether or not he returns to CBN, he will
continue to be involved in politics.''
   She said Robertson would file papers shortly with the Federal
Election Commission for a new political action committee _
Americans for the Republic.
   Robertson himself, speaking to reporters outside the White
House, endorsed Vice President George Bush, who already had the GOP
nomination well in hand.
   The former television evangelist said he would formally withdraw
from the race Monday.
   ``I will be making that official on Monday, as a candidate,
because the race now is over and the people that I wanted to bring
through the process are pretty much home now in relation to their
races,'' he responded when asked if he were withdrawing.
   But an aide, Richard Pinsky, later described Robertson's planned
move as a suspension, rather than a withdrawal.
   Asked whether he would be releasing his delegates, Robertson
responded: ``Well, of course, I will be releasing them.''
   ``Many of them were not really bound to me because in the
caucuses, it has to do with their own preferences. However, the
procedures go on the first ballot, we want to make sure that
there's a unanimous vote for George Bush,'' Robertson told
reporters.
   Pinsky later said Robertson would release the delegates, but not
immediately.
   Meanwhile, in an interview published in The Virginian-Pilot &
The Ledger-Star of Norfolk, Robertson said he likely would return
to the Christian Broadcasting Network, which he founded nearly 30
years ago, as chief executive officer, a job his son now holds.
   ``I don't have a comment to make,'' said CBN spokesman Benton
Miller. ``None of the staff or I ... have been provided any
information by him at this point concerning what his future plans
are.''
   Since 1967 Robertson had co-anchored the ``700 Club'' program
that is the heart of the network in terms of viewership and fund
raising. He left the program in 1986 to organize his presidential
campaign, and in September 1987 resigned both as the network's
chief executive officer and as a pastor in the Southern Baptist
church to run for office.
   The network quickly reported a big drop in revenue and began
laying off personnel. At the time, spokesmen refused to blame
Robertson's political ambitions for the shortfall.
   In March, CBN announced it faced a deficit of $500,000 for the
month, and sent out pleas for more donations.
   ``I did not realize that my personal presence on the `700 Club'
was as important as it is to the audience,'' Robertson told the
newspaper.
   His return was seen as both a political and economic necessity
by several experts.
   ``He needs to shore up his base,'' said one, Larry Sabato, a
University of Virginia political scientist and longtime Robertson
watcher. ``This campaign in the later stages has been injurious to
that base. Such severe setbacks as he has suffered have shaken even
his staunchest supporters.''
   Robertson, who has spent over $22 million on his campaign, has
but 46 delegates to the national convention, while Bush has more
than 1,300. Robertson finished third to Bush and Sen. Bob Dole in
most of the early primaries.
   Ms. Gattullo said the new political action committee will raise
money and train conservative Christians who want to become involved
in the political process. The staff of Americans for Robertson
would switch to the new PAC, keeping the same offices in Virginia,
she said.
   The new PAC has a purpose similar in some ways to Robertson's
now-defunct Freedom Council, which had tax-exempt status before it
folded in 1986 after Americans for Robertson was incorporated.
Critics challenged the council as being merely a front for
Robertson's then-undeclared campaign, and it is being investigated
along with CBN and Americans for Robertson by the Internal Revenue
Service.
   Unlike the council, Americans for the Republic will actively
support candidates, Ms. Gattullo said.

<HEAD>Aloha Pilots Describe In-Flight Ordeal With Gaping Hole in
Fuselage</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New throughout to UPDATE with FAA tape recording</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The pilots of Aloha Flight 243 knew they had
problems as they tried to land their plane with a large section of
its cabin wall and ceiling torn away, but for a time they thought
their predicament was even worse, it was revealed Wednesday.
   According to a tape of radio communications from the crippled
Boeing 737, the pilots were certain as they approached the airport
on the island of Maui that the nose landing gear had failed to
deploy.
   This would have made landing the severely damaged aircraft
especially dangerous, according to aviation experts.
   ``Be advised we have no nose gear. We are landing without a nose
gear,'' co-pilot Madeline ``Mimi'' Tompkins told the Maui airport
tower in a strained but controlled voice as Capt. Robert
Schornstheimer struggled to keep the aircraft aloft.
   ``We'll need all the (emergency) equipment you got,'' she
continued, although giving little hint as to how serious Flight
243's predicament really was last April 28 in the skies above
Hawaii.
   Only seconds before the plane landed on the runway did the
controller tell the pilots the landing gear actually was deployed.
They possibly had been misled by a false instrument reading.
   The tape was played Wednesday by the Federal Aviation
Administration, the same day that Schornstheimer and Tompkins were
honored by the Air Line Pilots Association for their heroics. They
met with Vice President George Bush on Tuesday.
   Schornstheimer told the pilots group that training and teamwork
allowed him and Ms. Tompkins ``to stay calm and fly the airplane''
as they rapidly descended from 24,000 feet to a safe landing with a
20-foot section of the cabin exposed to the sky, one engine out and
another engine damaged by flying debris.
   A flight attendant was swept to her death during the flight.
   The two pilots were presented the Superior Airmanship Award from
the 40,000-member pilots union for landing the plane safely without
any additional casualties.
   The FAA tape provided little hint of the drama that was
unfolding aboard the aircraft. The plane was just approaching the
south coast of Maui when the first word of trouble aboard the plane
reached the control tower.
   ``Maui tower, Aloah 243. We're inbound for a landing,'' Ms.
Tompkins advised matter of factly.
   After providing the plane's position, she added, ``We are
unpressurized, declaring an emergency.''
   The tower directed another plane away from the runway and
advised that Flight 243 had a clear, straight approach and
emergency vehicles would be waiting.
   While Schornstheimer flew the plane, Ms. Tompkins handled the
radio. While they must have been aware of the huge missing section
of the cabin wall and ceiling, they never suggested the extent of
the plane's damage to the control tower during the 10 minute and 18
second descent and landing.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar suggested that the controller had no
need to know the information and the crew probably was busy
otherwise.
   Ms. Tompkins at one point advised there were injuries on board.
How many?
   ``We have no idea. We cannot communicate with our flight
attendants,'' she replied, the strain in her voice now showing.
   Muffled noise could be heard in the background as the wind
whipped through the cockpit _ its door torn off by the rapid
depressurization. The pilots later explained they had to resort to
hand signals to communicate.
   As Schornstheimer struggled to keep the plane flying on a direct
path to the Maui airport, Ms. Tompkins advised that the cockpit
instruments indicated the nose landing gear had not deployed.
   Two minutes later there came good news.
   ``Just for your information, the gear appears down. The gear
appears down,'' the tower informed Flight 243 seconds before it
landed.
   ``Aloha 243, just shut it down where you are. Everything's fine.
... The fire trucks are on the way,'' the controller then said.
   During the ALPA ceremony, Schornstheimer said, ``What seemed
like a short time to Mimi and I because of our busy cockpit duties
must have seemed like an eternity to our passengers and flight
attendants.''
   Ms. Tompkins praised the captain, an 11-year veteran of Aloha.
   ``Bob analyzed the situation confronting us and he reacted,''
she said. ``All of his decisions were the right ones.''
   Despite the experience, she said she was eager to return to the
cockpit: ``I`m looking forward to going back to Hawaii and flying
again.''

   The House cast aside President Reagan's
objections Wednesday and passed a Defense Department budget bill
that restricts his arms control policies and Star Wars programs.
   The 252-172 decision in the Democratic-controlled chamber went
largely along party lines.
   The bill will eventually be sent to a conference committee to be
reconciled with the different Pentagon budget measure now on the
Senate floor.
   The Senate, meanwhile, voted Wednesday for a $4.55 billion Star
Wars budget, narrowly rejecting a move to cut deeply into Reagan's
cherished anti-missile research program.
   The House bill authorizes the Pentagon to spend $299.5 billion
in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, the same total as the Senate
plan and the amount Reagan approved last December in an agreement
with congressional leaders aimed at reducing federal budget
deficits. The current budget is about $299 billion.
   But the House added a ban on any Star Wars tests that violate
the so-called ``narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty, and also voted against buying any nuclear weapons
that violate the numerical limits in the unratified 1979 SALT II
nuclear arms treaty.
   The Senate, by a 51-45 margin, voted Wednesday afternoon to kill
a provision in that chamber's bill that would also ban weapons
beyond the SALT II limits.
   The House also added a directive telling Reagan to order the
military into the fight against illegal drug smuggling. The Senate
is likely to consider a similar proposal.
   Reagan opposes both arms restrictions and is also unhappy with
the $3.5 billion approved by the House for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known.
   Reagan had wanted $4.8 billion for Star Wars next year, compared
with the current SDI budget of $3.9 billion.
   In a letter to the House, Reagan said he was ``deeply
disappointed'' by the chamber's actions and said the restrictions
``would seriously undermine our position in negotiations with the
Soviet Union and (would) hold back the progress of the Strategic
Defense Initiative.''
   Reagan said he wants progress in nuclear arms control, but
added, ``We cannot do it alone. It is time for the House to step up
to these responsibilities and pass a defense authorization bill
that will strengthen our security.''
   But Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said, ``I don't believe the president has any reason to
be upset. I think it's a good bill. We gave the president a lot of
what he wanted.''
   Hours before the final House vote, the Senate voted 50-48
against a deep reduction in Star Wars.
   The Senate defeated a proposal by Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
to reduce the SDI budget to about $3.8 billion and devote the extra
$750 million to the space shuttle and a space station.
   Johnston's loss was similar to his defeats in each of the past
two years, when he failed by a single vote to slash the SDI budget.
Last year, Vice President George Bush cast the tie-breaking vote in
his role as the Senate's presiding officer.
   Congress has consistently scaled back Reagan's annual requests
for sharp increases in spending for the 5-year-old program SDI
program.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has said he would recommend
a Reagan veto of the entire Pentagon budget bill unless Congress
votes enough money for Star Wars.
   Johnston argued that ``it's going to be very, very difficult to
get that space station going unless we give it some more money. ...
What's the higher priority here, the space station and the shuttle
or SDI? The space station has a lot of defense implications. ...
Dollars are scarce.''
   But Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said Johnston's proposal ``would be
very detrimental to the defense budget.''
   Originally, Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., simply proposed
reducing the proposed SDI budget from $4.6 billion to $3.9 billion,
but that lost on a 66-29 vote.
   While the House measure restricts Reagan's arms control policies
and Star Wars, it granted Reagan's request for spending for a vast
variety of weapons.
   That total includes 180 F-16 jet fighter planes, 84 F-A-18 jets,
42 F-15 jets, a dozen F-14 jets, three new Navy destroyers, two
more attack submarines, one Trident missile-firing sub, the first
of the new ``Seawolf'' class subs and 611 M-1 tanks.

   A Taiwanese gangster was sentenced
Wednesday to 27 years to life in prison for the 1984 murder of a
Chinese-American journalist, a slaying he said the Taiwanese
government had ordered.
   Tung Kuei-sen, 36, a member of the Taiwan-based international
gang United Bamboo, was convicted in March of gunning down Henry
Liu in the garage of the writer's home in Daly City, a suburb of
San Francisco.
   With an ear cocked toward an interpreter, Tung, heard San Mateo
County Superior Court Judge Margaret J. Kemp call him guilty of
``political terrorism.''
   Tung drew 25 years to life for murder plus two years for use of
a firearm. Prosecutor Bob Bishop said Tung will be eligible for
parole in 17 years, eight months.
   The defendant was ordered to serve the sentence following
completion of a 20-year sentence for heroin smuggling. He is
serving that sentence at a federal prison in Lewisburg, Pa.
   The 52-year-old Liu was a columnist for Chinese-language
newspapers in San Francisco and had just published an unflattering
biography of Taiwanese President Chiang Ching-kuo, who died four
months ago.
   Helen Liu testified at Tung's trial that before her husband's
slaying, the Taiwanese government had sent former friends of Liu's
to try to persuade him to quit criticizing the government.
   Tung testified that Liu's killing was ordered by Chiang
Shiao-wu, grandson of former Chinese nationalist leader Chiang
Kai-shek and the son of former Chiang Ching-kuo.
   Tung said he thought he was being a patriot in carrying out the
slaying, and said at the close of the trial: ``This was an act of
the (Taiwan) government. ... (I was) a scapegoat for the Taiwan
government.''
   He said he went to trial so that he could apologize and reveal
the identities of those people behind the crime.
   In a letter to the court, Mrs. Liu had asked that Tung be shown
mercy, saying he ``entertained a very naive patriotism which was
shrewdly manipulated by the plotters who are still at large.''
   Mrs. Liu said she had been ``touched by the repentance publicly
expressed by Mr. Tung.''

<TEXT>
   Voters rejected three of five
candidates under criminal indictment and nominated a host of
unknowns to key offices in what the secretary of state called ``the
cleanest election in Mingo County history.''
   The poverty-stricken mountain coal mining county has been
saddled with a corrupt reputation for years. In 1986, the fire
chief was convicted of running a drug ring and the sheriff pleaded
guilty to buying his job for $100,000.
   Tuesday's primary election for Legislature, county commission,
sheriff and other posts marked the decline of ``slatemakers,''
powerbrokers who in the past have bought a person's vote for $2 or
a half-pint of bourbon, officials said.
   The three indicted officials who lost Tuesday were state Sen.
John Pat Fanning and Chief Magistrate Bill Webb, both seeking
re-election, and former state Rep. R. Doyle Van Meter II, who ran
for county assessor.
   Two indicted officials will be on the November ballot _ former
Magistrate Joey Kohari, who captured the Democratic nomination for
assessor, and surveyor Jim Webb.
   ``The results signal that an overwhelming majority of Mingo
Countians are determined to put an end to the kind of political
corruption which had drawn unfavorable attention from outsiders,''
Secretary of State Ken Hechler, the state's chief election officer,
said Wednesday. ``Now I trust this determination will stick and
that the clock won't be turned back in the future.''
   Fanning, Kohari, Van Meter and Bill Webb were among 15 political
figures indicted April 7 on charges of conspiring to control
elections through excessive political contributions to a Mingo
County political slate. Jim Webb was indicted last fall on bribery
and conspiracy charges for his role in a deed transaction.
   All have pleaded innocent.
   Of the 69 people running for 12 county-wide offices, 57 were
political novices and 43 had never run for office before. Five
novices were nominated, including four who never before had ran a
race.
   Former Sheriff Gerald Chafin won the Democratic nomination for
sheriff and will run in November for the post he held until 1980,
when political boss and subsequent Sheriff Johnie Owens led a
successful ouster suit against him.
   Kohari said his indictment made him ``the underdog.'' He said
his strategy was to explain the charges to voters. ``Apparently,
it's paid off,'' he said Wednesday. ``They believe me.''
   Jim Webb, of Chattaroy, won re-election to the surveyor's
office, a position with no salary and no official duties, by a wide
margin.
   Fanning, a Democrat from Wyoming County whose district also
covers Mingo, lost his state Senate seat to political newcomer A.
Keith Wagner. No Republican is scheduled to run against Wagner in
the November general election.
   Bill Webb ran fourth in a field of 11 in a race for three
magistrate positions. Dee Sidebottom, Webb's magistrate's
assistant, led the ticket.

<HEAD>Maneuvering To Form New Danish Government Now Wide Open</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material and editing throughout, UPDATING with neutral
negotiator named. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Margrethe II turned the
struggle to form a new Danish government into a battle royal on
Wednesday when she named a neutral politician to lead coalition
negotiations.
   Her unexpected choice of Svend Jakobsen, Parliament's chairman
since 1981, upset Prime Minister Poul Schlueter's hopes to quickly
reassemble his coalition of four center-right parties following
parliamentary elections on Tuesday.
   Normally the chief negotiator, called ``the royal
investigator,'' is the person most likely to become prime minister.
   But Jakobsen, 53, has said he does not want the job of prime
minister.
   The pro-NATO Schlueter gambled on an early election after
failing to stop a resolution in Parliament last month which
tightened enforcement of Denmark's peacetime ban on nuclear
weapons, a measure seen as a threat to NATO strategy.
   Election analysts said elections Tuesday for the 179-member
Folketing, or parliament, showed a modest shift to the right and
strengthened the parties giving the Western alliance unqualified
support.
   But the inconclusive results left the political field open to
both the government and the socialist opposition bloc to woo the
Social-Liberal party, which holds the balance of power.
   The issue of Denmark's relations with NATO faded in the
political confusion and uncertainty.
   Margrethe assigned Jakobsen to discuss a national policy agenda
with the eight parties in the Folketing as a prelude to formation
of a governing coalition.
   Emerging from Amalienborg Palace, Jakobsen pledged to ``strive
to be totally neutral'' in searching ``for a government program
supported by a broad majority.''
   Jakobsen was nominated by the socialist opposition to block
Schlueter from the position. Jakobsen won the backing of the
Social-Liberals.
   Schlueter submitted his resignation to the queen earlier
Wednesday, a formal step to launch coalition jockeying. The monarch
then held consultations with all the party leaders.
   After a second meeting with the queen in seven hours, Schlueter
said a majority supported Jakobsen to conduct the political talks,
although he said he had ``strong reservations'' about using the
office of parliamentary chairman ``in this political game.''
   Jakobsen is a former finance minister in a Social Democratic
government. But his present position in the legislature is supposed
to be above partisan politics.
   Jakobsen told reporters he would begin separate meetings with
the parties on Thursday.
   Earlier, Schlueter said the first aim of negotiations should be
to resolve the row which led to the election, the first vote in
four decades to be fought on a foreign policy issue.
   He indicated he wants to revise the resolution, which requires
the government to advise each visiting warship that nuclear weapons
are barred from Danish ports.
   Britain and the United States say the resolution undermines
their standing refusal to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear
arms on military vessels.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said in Washington
Wednesday that once a new Danish government is formed, the United
States will discuss with it the controversy over nuclear-armed
ships in Danish waters.
   ``We have always had an excellent relationship with the
government of Denmark and expect that relationship will continue
with the new government once it is formed,'' he said.
   In the election, Schlueter's four-party coalition won 70 seats,
the same number it held before, and the Social Democratic and the
Socialist People's parties lost two for a total of 79.
   Social-Liberals dropped one seat and have 10 in the new chamber.

   Shiite Moslem militias fought with
artillery and tanks Wednesday, the sixth day of their battle for
supremacy in south Beirut's battered sprawl of tin-roofed huts and
jerry-built apartment houses.
   Police said 33 people were killed and 160 wounded, bringing
total casualties to 187 dead and 532 wounded.
   The battle raged unchecked for eight hours. Heavy fighting
continued after a truce Syrian and Iranian mediators called for
10:30 a.m. between the mainstream Amal militia, backed by Syria,
and pro-Iranian Hezbollah.
   Another truce was announced Wednesday night, the third in two
days, and the Iranian Embassy said Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria
and Aly Khamenei of Iran were forming a four-man committee to
enforce a ``final cease-fire.''
   An embassy statement said Assad and Khamenei reached agreement
by telephone on a cease-fire to begin at 11 p.m. (4 p.m. EDT) and
deployment of truce observers. Another lull in the fighting
occurred after the truce deadline.
   About 60 percent of the 250,000 inhabitants of the Shiite slums
have fled. Those remaining huddled in basements and bomb shelters.
   Witnesses reported fires burning out of control, snipers
shooting from rooftops at moving vehicles, ambulances under attack
as they tried to pick wounded from the streets.
   Hospitals appealed for blood donations. The Sahel hospital,
closest to the battle zone, told rescuers through Moslem-run Voice
of Nation radio to take victims elsewhere because ``we can't cope
with the flood of casualties.''
   AP photographer Ali Mohammed, in the Ghobeiri neighborhood,
heard a woman shout through the shellfire: ``There is a wounded man
here! He is dying! Help us, please! Take us out of here!''
   No one could reach the building.
   The factional war reflects a contest between Syria and Iran for
influence with the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect. Its
focus is a 16-square-mile enclave next to the Beirut airport in
which most of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon are believed
held.
   Their captors in most cases are thought to be extremists linked
to the radical Hezbollah. There has been no word on the fate of the
captives, who include nine Americans.
   Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's military intelligence chief in
Lebanon, said: ``If the bloodletting continues, we will have no
other option but to respond to the pleas of the population and end
their ordeal.'' His statement was broadcast before the latest truce.
   Syria has 25,000 soldiers in Lebanon and, after 13 years of
civil war, was the nation's undisputed power broker until Iran
began challenging its influence.
   Syria sent 7,500 of the soldiers into Moslem west Beirut in
February 1987 to stop a factional battle primarily involving Amal
and Walid Jumblatt's Druse militia. The Syrians drove Hezbollah
from some west Beirut strongholds but has not entered the southern
slums.
   Salim Hoss, Lebanon's acting prime minister, accused militia
leaders of ``providing criminals with the means of killing and
destruction that burn a safe area.''
   ``We hold the leaders responsible for all the crimes committed
against humanity in south Beirut and urge them to order a
cease-fire before it is too late,'' he said in a statement.
   A slum resident, in a telephone call to the Voice of the Nation,
said: ``They are destroying our homes. They are killing our
children. They (militias) claim they want to protect us, but we
need to be protected from them.
   ``They've done worse than Israel did to us'' in the 1982
invasion, he said. ``We don't have water, power or food and we
don't know where to go.''
   A police spokesman said Amal forces led by tanks had dislodged
Hezbollah fighters from several areas on the western edge of the
slum, abutting the airport, and Hezbollah overran the main Amal
base east of the airport highway.
   Police said Amal brought 2,500 fighters from south Lebanon
during the Tuesday truce to reinforce its 4,000 men in south
Beirut. Hezbollah's fighting strength in the area is estimated at
3,000.

<HEAD>Navy Asked To Probe Rash Of Crashes Involving Attack Bombers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navy officials said Wednesday they are weighing a
request from two Washington state congressmen to investigate a
string of six crashes of the A-6 attack bomber that killed 10
people in the last year and a half.
   At least four of the crashes occurred during training runs and
all involved bombers from the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station
north of Seattle.
   Reps. Norm Dicks and Al Swift, both Democrats, signed a letter
Monday asking Navy Secretary William Ball to investigate, said
George Behan, a spokesman for Dicks.
   Ball is reviewing the request, Navy spokeswoman Lt. Kippy Burns
said in Washington, D.C.
   The latest crash took place May 5, about 100 miles south of
Seattle, when a $32 million A-6E Intruder on a night mission
hurtled into the Cascade Mountains at 400 mph to 500 mph, killing
the pilot and bombardier-navigator.
   Less than a month earlier, a crash on the same training route
claimed two lives.
   Since 1980, 27 Whidbey pilots and crew members have died in 25
crashes of the A-6 and its cousin, the EA-6B, said Mariana Graham,
base spokeswoman.
   Dicks, a member of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee, has asked the staff to look into the crashes to
determine whether congressional action is needed to alter the
training of pilots or correct problems with the aircraft.
   ``After six times, I think it's time to find out about what's
going on up there'' at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Dicks
said. The base is on Puget Sound's Whidbey Island, about 60 miles
north of Seattle.
   ``That's too many lives, too many planes,'' Dicks said.
   The training mission in last week's crash involves heading out
over the Pacific at 20,000 feet, then dropping to 500 feet as the
aircraft circles and heads inland, up and over the mountains toward
a bombing range.

<HEAD>Scientists Says Chernobyl Left Psychological Scars</HEAD>

   Scientists said Wednesday that Soviets
still suffer psychological scars from the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster more than two years after it took place.
   Soviet and Western scientists could reach no consensus on the
number of deaths that eventually may be linked to the explosion and
fire that destroyed the No. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl power plant
on April 26, 1986.
   An American doctor said cases of leukemia may begin to appear in
one to three years. A Soviet scientist said the number of voluntary
abortions in areas of Byelorussia near the plant increased 20
percent in the months after the accident.
   At least 31 people were killed at the plant 80 miles north of
Kiev, capital of the Soviet Ukraine. A huge cloud of invisible
radiation spread over Europe and eventually worked its way around
the world.
   Wednesday was the first day of three days devoted to a
conference on medical consequences of the disaster. It brought more
than 160 Soviet scientists together with delegates from 24 foreign
countries.
   ``The accident was very severe but the wounds are healing,''
said Hans Blix, general director of the International Atomic Energy
Agency. He said nuclear plants remain a feasible source of
electricity despite the accident.
   Yevgeny Chazov, the Soviet health minister, said in an opening
statement: ``Soviet scientists have no reason to conceal anything
about the accident.''
   Several Soviet delegates said the nation must combat what they
called ``radiophobia,'' an unreasonable fear of nuclear power.
   Oles Pyatak, deputy director of the Soviet Center for Radiation
Medicine, said scientists had noted increases in tension and
intestinal disorders attributable to stress, and the unwillingness
of some couples to have children. Viktor Knizhnikov, who heads a
radiation-safety laboratory, said rumors arose periodically about
the Chernobyl plant leaking radiation again. Reports in the
official press have said public opposition halted construction of
nuclear plants near Odessa in the southern Ukraine, the
Byelorussian capital of Minsk and Krasnodar in southern Russia.
   Knizhnikov told reporters of a 20 percent increase in voluntary
abortions in areas of Byelorussia just north of Chernobyl following
the accident.
   He said there was no evidence of an increase in spontaneous
abortions or birth defects, and virtually no chance any children
would have been born deformed.
   The high rate of abortions continued through 1986 but the number
then returned to normal, he said.
   Specialists have said the disaster could add 30,000 cancer
deaths to the 600 million expected in the next 50 years, said
Robert Gale, an American doctor who helped treat the worst cases of
radiation sickness.
   Half the extra cases would be in the Soviet Union, 40 percent in
the rest of Europe and the remaining 10 percent in North America
and Asia, he said.
   Gale emphasized that the figures were estimates and said: ``My
own feeling is that they may be on the high side, maybe by a factor
of 10.''
   An increase in leukemia also might be noticeable in one to three
years among the 135,000 people who were evacuated from an 18-mile
zone around the plant, Gale said.
   An extra 100 cases would be significant and easily detectable,
he said, and ``one may be able to precisely identify the cases
caused by radiation.''
   Some other American doctors disputed that.
   Fred Mettler, a radiologist and specialist in nuclear medicine
at the University of New Mexico, said there is no way to determine
the cause of a particular case of cancer.
   Because of a lack of information about how much and what kinds
of radiation people were exposed to, firm conclusions about the
medical effects would be difficult to reach, he said.
   Soviet officials said they had not been prepared to deal with
the Chernobyl accident and did not have enough trained workers or
reliable equipment to monitor the radiation.
   The accident was not even reported until three days after it
happened, when Sweden detected high radiation levels and demanded
an explanation.
   Their Western colleagues said the Soviets have done a good job
since.
   Officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency said
modifications of Soviet nuclear plants now under way would prevent
another accident of the Chernobyl type.

   Noriega's aides have told opposition leaders that the general
envisions stepping down on Aug. 12, the fifth anniversary of his
accession as commander of the defense forces.
   U.S. officials have said in recent days that they were trying to
negotiate an arrangement under which Noriega would leave Panama
immediately after his resignation and then return after 1990
presidential elections. It could not be confirmed independently
Wednesday night that agreement was reached on this point.
   Previously the administration had agreed not to extradite
Noriega on the drug charges if he went into political exile.
   Another issue under negotiation was the status of five to seven
close associates of Noriega in the defenseforces. The
administration has been seeking their resignation along with that
of Noriega, but the outcome of the discussion on this issue was
unclear.

<HEAD>Connecticut Revives Lottery System After 24-Hour Shutdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connecticut's million-dollar-a-day
lottery was revived late Wednesday after a 24-hour shutdown
following the discovery that tickets could be bought after the
winning numbers were announced.
   The company that provided new computers for the lottery
``assured us the problems have been fixed,'' said Gregory Zieman,
assistant chief of the lottery unit of the Division of Special
Revenue.
   Lottery officials said parts of the 2,200-terminal system were
operating at 7:30 p.m. but did not know how long it would take to
get all 2,200 terminals back on line.
   The new equipment went on line Sunday. The games were suspended
Tuesday evening.
   The flaw in the system was demonstrated by two Hartford ticket
agents who saw Monday's televised drawing then played the winning
numbers, officials said. The machines gave them tickets with
numbers dated Monday instead of Tuesday.
   The pair, Jose Rodriguez and Gilberto Pardo, startled lottery
officials Tuesday when they revealed what had happened and handed
back $16,500 in checks that had just been made out in their names.
   Lottery unit spokeswoman Ann Evans said she did not know whether
there were any other such incidents. Officials say codes of winning
tickets can be checked if a problem is suspected.
   The state operates daily lottery and Play Four games and
twice-weekly Lotto games with drawings on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Tuesday's drawings were held and winners' tickets will be honored
when the system resumes operating, said J. Blaine Lewis Jr., chief
of the Special Revenue lottery unit.
   The state sells $8 million in tickets a week and has a net
weekly profit of $3 million, Lewis said.
   The mixup compounded the headaches of the Division of Special
Revenue, which was forced to shut down two jai alai frontons
because of strike by players. The state gets $55,000 a day from jai
alai wagering, officials say.
   Earlier Wednesday, some lottery agents reported unhappy
customers.
   ``They're very angry about it,'' said Richard Shoztic, manager
of Bull's Head News and Variety in Stamford.
   ``They think the store owners have something to do with it and
don't realize it's someone else's problem,'' Shoztic said. ``A few
have said they would play in New York.''
   Lewis said the contract with the company that runs the lottery
system, General Instrument Co. of Hunt Valley, Md., stipulates that
the company will be penalized when the system is down for the
amount of the state's lost profits.
   General Instrument took over the system from G-Tech Corp. of
Providence, R.I., when it was awarded a five-year, $40 million
contract in December. General Instrument's bid was $11 million
lower than G-Tech's, according to Lewis.
   General Instrument also runs the Off-Track Betting computer and
ran the state's lottery system when it was begun in the early
1970s, he said.
   General Instrument officials did not immediately return calls
placed to their Wethersfield office.
   The company also provides equipment for the 1,200-terminal
Missouri lottery. Officials there said they experienced problems
when the system went on line in 1986 but did not have to shut it
down.

   About 50 Harvard Law School students,
most of them black, ended an overnight ``study-in'' Wednesday,
saying the dean had agreed to some of their demands for recruiting
more minority professors.
   ``We feel we were very successful over the last 24 hours,'' said
Robert Wilkins, president of the Black Law School Association,
which staged the protest in the outer office of Law School Dean
James Vorenberg.
   The students had demanded that additional black professors be
hired and that Vorenberg, who is retiring, be replaced by a black
professor. They remained at Vorenberg's office overnight.
   Wilkins said the dean agreed to seven of 12 demands, including
establishment of a fellowship to encourage blacks to teach at
Harvard; a policy statement expressing commitment to diversity in
hiring, and a broader role for students in searching for and hiring
minority faculty.
   Vorenberg did not immediately return telephone calls for comment.
   Vorenberg said he could not agree to demands to hire a tenured
black female professor by 1989 or to increase the number of tenured
faculty by 20 positions and filling them with professors from
diverse backgrounds, Wilkins said.
   Vorenberg also said he had no ability to fulfill the students'
demand that he be replaced by Derrick Bell, a black professor at
the law school, the student leader said.
   Harvard Law School has 61 tenured positions, two held by blacks.
Three black assistant professors, who do not have teunure, are on
the staff.

   Seven members of a radical leftist group that
used ``armed propaganda'' to protest government policies are
charged with setting off bombs in the U.S. Capitol and seven other
locations, the Justice Department said Wednesday.
   The seven defendants are charged with conspiring to set off a
bomb that blew a hole in a wall outside the U.S. Senate chamber on
Nov. 7, 1983, and damaged five paintings, U.S. Attorney Jay B.
Stephens said in a statement.
   The Capitol bomb also blew doors off the hinges outside the
office of Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., then the Senate minority
leader and now majority leader.
   Explosives were also detonated at three Washington-area military
installations and four locations in New York City between 1983 and
1985, including the FBI office on Staten Island and the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association office as part of the group's campaign of
``armed propaganda,'' Stephens said.
   The bombings damaged the buildings but did not injure anyone.
   The indictment was unsealed in U.S. District Court on the same
day that one of the defendants, Marilyn Buck, 40, was convicted in
New York of murder, armed robbery and racketeering in two 1981
armored truck robberies that resulted in the deaths of two guards
and two Nyack, N.Y policemen.
   Ms. Buck drove a getaway car in the unsuccessful robbery of a
Brink's armored truck carrying $1.6 million in Nanuet, N.Y. on Oct.
20, 1981.
   Linda Sue Evans, 41, one of the seven named in the April 20
indictment, is serving a sentence for harboring Ms. Buck when she
was a fugitive wanted for the Brinks heist. Evans also was
sentenced last year to 40 years imprisonment for illegally buying
guns in New Orleans in 1983.
   Federal authorities said they waited to unseal the five-count
indictment until Ms. Buck's trial had ended in federal court in
Manhattan.
   All but one of the defendants named in the five-count indictment
unsealed Wednesday are in custody on other charges, federal
officials said. Elizabeth Duke, the seventh defendant, is a
fugitive, officials said.
   Duke fled while awaiting trial on similar charges.
   The indictment identified the defendants as members of a group
that variously called itself the Revolutionary Fighting Group, the
Armed Resistance Unit and the Red Guerrilla Resistance.
   The Armed Resistance Unit claimed responsibility for the Capitol
bombing to protest the U.S. invasion of Grenada and involvement of
Marines in Lebanon.
   Other defendants named were: Laura Whitehorn, Susan Rosenberg,
Timothy Blunk and Alan Berkman.
   Besides the Capitol bombing, the group is charged with setting
off a bomb outside the National War College at Fort McNair here on
April 26, 1983, the Washington Navy Yard Computer Center on Aug.
18, 1983 and the Washington Navy Yard Officers Club on April 20,
1984.
   Bombs were also placed at the Federal Building on Staten Island,
N.Y., on Jan. 28, 1983; the Israeli Aircraft Industries building in
New York on April 5, 1984; and the South African consulate in New
York on Sept. 26, 1984. The bombing of the New York Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association occurred on Feb. 23, 1985.
   The indictment charged the defendants with conspiracy, malicious
damage of U.S. property and aiding and abetting.
   As part of the conspiracy, the indictment charged, the group
conducted surveillances of other potential bombing targets
including: the Old Executive Office Building next to the White
House; the Washington office of the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee; the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.; and the Army's
Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Md.
   Explosives and weapons, including dynamite, water gel, and other
material were stored in a Cherry Hill, N.J. storage bin and in a
garage in Doylestown, Pa., the indictment said.
   The blast in the U.S. Capitol occurred at about midnight and
blew a hole in the wall across a corridor from the Senate chamber.
The FBI concluded that three or four pounds of dynamite with a
dual-release timer was placed beneath a bench in an alcove in the
corridor outside the Senate chamber.
   It caused numerous cracks in the walls and the ornate ceiling of
the corridor but did not leave any lasting structural damage to the
Capitol.
   The indictment did not identify which members of the conspiracy
set off the bomb in the Capitol.
   After the bombing, a communique was mailed to National Public
Radio in Washington and a local public radio station, WAMU, that
said: ``We purposely aimed our attack at the institutions of
imperialist rule rather than at individual members of the ruling
class. We did not choose to kill any of them this time. But their
lives are not sacred,'' the indictment said.
   Credit was also claimed in communiques or calls to news
organizations for the other bombings to dramatize the group's
political goals, the indictment said.
   In his statement, Stephens said the defendants were charged with
being part of ``a secret organization which described itself as `a
communist politico-military organization' and which operated under
the names Revolutionary Fighting Group, Armed Resistance Unit and
the Red Guerrilla Resistance.''
   To protest government foreign and domestic policies, the members
of the group ``would plan and carry out acts of violence, which
they called `armed propaganda,' including the bombing of various
government and private buildings and property.''
   The indictment charged that the members of the group used
multiple aliases derived from the names of babies who died in the
late 1940s and early 1950s to obtain false passports, driver's
licenses as well as to get jobs, buy firearms and impersonate
police officers.
   The group armed itsef with Uzi submachine guns, shotguns,
handguns, silencers and such accessories as bulletproof body armor.
   Berkman and Blunk used a bogus search warrant to stage a Sept.
2, 1984 armed robbery of a Cromwell, Conn., supermarket, the
indictment said.
   Other potential targets said to be subjects of surveillance were
the Cuban American National Foundation and the law offices of
Smathers, Symington and Herlong, both in Washington. Summit
Aviation in Middletown, Del., was also the subject of surveillance
and training exercises for the bombing missions, the indictment
charged.
   Whitehorn, Evans and Buck were charged with conspiracy, while
all seven defendants were charged with malicious destruction of
property in connection with the bombings of the Capitol and the
three Washington military facilities.
   ``Let this be a warning to those who seek to influence the
policies of the United States government through violence and
terrorism that we will seek unrelentingly to bring them to
justice,'' Stephens said in his statement.
   ``Those who attack our sacred institutions of government and
seek to destroy the symbols of our democratic system ultimately
will have to pay the price.''
   Rosenberg, 32, and Blunk, 30, both of New York City, were
sentenced to 58 years imprisonment for possession of 600 pounds of
weapons and explosives seized during their arrest Nov. 29, 1985 in
Cherry Hill, N.J. They were arrested while placing the explosives
into a rented storage bin.
   Berkman, a physician, was sentenced to 10 years in prison last
year by a Philadelphia federal judge for possesion of explosives,
weapons and false identity cards.
   Whitehorn's was convicted of making false identity cards and
possessing firearms.
   Buck, meanwhile, faces a maximum life sentence for her
participation in the two Brink's robbberies in 1981. She and Mutulu
Shakur were also convicted of murder in death of a Brink's guard
killed during a June, 1981 armored truck robbery in the Bronx.
   The robberies were part of a string of attempted robberies and
robberies in New York and Connecticut.

<HEAD>Film Industry Wants More Controls on Cable TV `Monopoly'</HEAD>

   The president of the Motion Picture
Association of America urged Congress on Wednesday to rein in some
of the cable television industry's power to control the
entertainment marketplace.
   But leaders of the cable TV industry dismissed the movie
industry's concerns and rejected charges that cable TV has become
an unregulated monopoly.
   At a hearing marked by a few lively exchanges, MPAA President
Jack Valenti sparred with Ted Turner, president of Turner
Broadcasting System, and John Malone, president of
Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable company.
   ``Cable is no longer a babe in swaddling clothes,'' Valenti told
members of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
telecommunications, which is looking into the effects of cable
deregulation.
   Cable TV, he said, has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry
dominated by several large companies.
   ``Consumers are held hostage by their cable system. They have no
alternative. They can either commit suicide or go bowling,'' said
Valenti, who represents the major Hollywood studios and independent
producers.
   Malone and Turner defended their industry, saying it has brought
more than 50 basic channels and more than a dozen pay channels to
television viewers in more than half the country.
   ``Before cable, we had the three big networks and they dominated
what people saw. Now there are the three networks and more than 50
cable channels,'' Turner said.
   More than 80 percent of America's TV households can receive
cable, and about 52 percent of all households subscribe. The steady
increase in cable subscribership and in the amount of
cable-exclusive programming has cut into the audience of the
broadcast networks and the receipts of movie theaters.
   Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, said ``the cable industry has become the mouse that
roared,'' able to raise rates at will and decide what broadcast
signals to carry.
   Fritts urged Congress to pass a law requiring cable companies to
carry local broadcast signals and prohibit cable companies from
showing any syndicated program for which a local broadcaster has
purchased exclusive rights.
   As cable's clout has grown, it has been winning contracts away
from the broadcast networks to carry more and more major sports
events, and Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, wondered whether in the
future average sports fans will have to subscribe to cable to watch
their home teams play.
   Malone suggested that while Congress could pass a law to protect
broadcast coverage of sports events, it would be more prudent to
``wait to see what the free market does.''
   Malone disputed Valenti's claim that cable TV is a monopoly. For
movies, he said, consumers can go to the theater, rent video
cassettes or watch them on the broadcast networks.
   Malone also defended the investment his company and other large
cable companies have made in industry programming ventures, saying
that without this investment many of these channels would have gone
out of business. He
   cable companies helped shore up The Discovery Channel and
Turner's enterprise.
   Valenti, however, said such investments give cable companies
incentive to carry on their systems the services in which they have
an equity stake, denying viewers other programming choices.
   ``These monopolies can decide what the consumer is going to
see,'' Valenti said.

   The city of East St. Louis endangers its
police force by failing to equip officers properly, a prosecutor
said Wednesday at the opening of a trial on criminal charges of
reckless conduct against the city.
   But Mayor Carl Officer countered in afternoon testimony: ``I
know of no officer of the East St. Louis police department required
to go to work if they felt their safety was endangered.''
   The Mississippi River city, plagued by unemployment, crime and a
growing municipal debt, is accused of failing to supply its
seven-member patrol force with properly working radios and cars.
   Officials said it was the first Illinois city to be tried on
criminal charges. Convictions would carry fines of $1,000 on each
of nine misdemeanor counts, filed Feb. 22 by the St. Clair County
state's attorney.
   State's Attorney John Baricevic told Circuit Judge Robert
LeChien that some police had bought their own radios and that
detectives had used their own cars.
   The city ``was aware of the situation and recklessly ignored''
it, Baricevic said. The city had the money to correct the problems
but failed to do so, he said. He said he planned to call about 30
witnesses.
   The mayor testified the police-radio problems were routine.
``They are mechanical equipment. They are manmade; they break
down,'' he said. He contended some of the vehicle problems were due
to abuse by the police.
   East St. Louis City Attorney Sam Ross contended Wednesday that
there were no local, state or federal regulations saying
municipalities must provide officers with radios.
   Officer Ray Waggaman, a 16{-year East St. Louis police veteran,
testified that he felt endangered by problems with the radios and
cars.
   Waggaman said he bought his own portable radio in 1983 because
the police radio did not transmit or receive properly. He said he
was not reimbursed.
   Waggaman said he informed his shift commander repeatedly of the
problems, which included cars with bald tires and low oil and
without spotlights.
   During cross examination, Ross said there were no regulations to
define what a ``properly equipped'' vehicle was.
   ``It's a luxury, is it not?'' Ross asked Waggaman, referring to
the radios. ``It's for the convenience of the officer.''
   Waggaman said he knew of no regulations governing the equipment.
   Roosevelt Malone, a former alderman and former chairman of the
City Council's Public Safety Committee, testified that Police Chief
Isadore Chambers told the panel on numerous occasions that new
police equipment was needed.
   Chambers has said that while the force has six radios for its
patrol cars, he often had as many as seven uniformed officers on
the streets. When a seventh officer is available, two members of
the force must share a car so both have access to a radio.
   East St. Louis, once a thriving industrial city, became one of
the nation's poorest with the decline of the industries and the
exodus of whites in the 1960s.
   Sixty-one percent of the city's 55,000 residents receive some
kind of public assistance, and about 40 percent of its citizens are
unemployed.
   Officials say the city's financial problems show no sign of
subsiding. It recently reached a $4 million settlement with a man
seriously beaten by another inmate in the city jail in 1985.

<HEAD>Tentative Link Found Between New Herpes Virus, Cancer, Biologist
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A biologist said Wednesday that a newly
discovered herpes virus spread by casual contact might be a sixth
cancer-causing virus and appears to work with the AIDS virus in
wiping out the immune system of AIDS victims.
   Robert Gallo, the National Cancer Institute's chief of
tumor-cell biology, said more evidence was needed before the highly
contagious Herpes 6, or human B-lymphocyte virus, could be blamed
for causing certain types of cancers.
   Gallo spoke at the annual meeting of the American Society for
Microbiology, which convened here Sunday.
   Researchers have found a high prevalence of antibodies to the
Herpes 6 virus in people with Hodgkin's disease, Burkitt's
lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and childhood acute leukemia,
Gallo said.
   ``One could argue the virus must be playing a role to be
detected so readily in those tumors,'' Gallo said.
   Currently, five other viruses are believed to cause cancer. They
are hepatitis B, which can cause liver cancer; Epstein-Barr, which
can cause nasopharyngeal cancer; HTLV, which can cause leukemia;
papillomavirus, which may cause cervical cancer; and
cytomegalovirus, linked to prostate cancer.
   The Herpes 6 virus also has been found alongside the AIDS virus
in T-4 cells, which mastermind the immune system and are the prime
target of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Gallo said.
   Since the AIDS virus kills only a small percentage of T-4 cells
at a time, Gallo said, the new herpes virus might explain the total
annihilation of T-4 cells in AIDS patients.
   Tests to detect Herpes 6 have differed widely on its prevalence
in the United States. One test indicated that it is carried by
between 5 percent and 30 percent of the population; another
indicated between 70 percent and 90 percent.

   Jurors who convicted a woman of killing two
people with cyanide-laced Excedrin capsules will return to court
Friday for a hearing on allegations of jury tampering, a judge
ruled Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge William Dwyer granted a request to question
the 12 jurors by defense attorney Thomas Hillier II, who cited an
anonymous telephone call allegedly received by a juror during
deliberations.
   The jury Monday convicted Stella Nickell, 44, of killing her
husband, Bruce Nickell, 52, and Susan Katherine Snow, 40. Both had
swallowed Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules containing cyanide in
1986.
   Dwyer said the court by law must look into any allegations of
jury tampering, but he emphasized that in ordering the hearing, he
was ``not suggesting in the slightest any misconduct by any juror.''
   He invited Hillier and Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida to
submit questions to him. Dwyer said he would question jurors
himself under oath.
   Laurel Holliday, a juror, had told the judge before the verdict
that a female caller told her Mrs. Nickell had failed a lie
detector test, information that had not been allowed as evidence in
the three-week trial.
   The judge let Ms. Holliday stay on the jury after she said the
call would not influence her. Hillier concurred with that decision
at the time.
   Ms. Maida on Wednesday argued against the need for questioning,
saying any inference of misconduct was ``pure speculation.''
   Mrs. Nickell faces a maximum penalty of life in prison at
sentencing June 17.

   The 41st Cannes Film Festival opened
Wednesday evening with a gentle rain falling on a parade of
beautiful people.
   French actress Sandrine Bonnaire declared the start of the
two-week movie gala.
   This year's festival, which runs through May 23, is billed as a
quieter affair than last year's 40th anniversary extravaganza, but
enough big names were on hand to satisfy the star-spotters gathered
on the famous seaside promenade La Croisette.
   Actress Nastassja Kinski, dressed in rose taffeta, drew cries of
admiration upon her arrival.
   She is one of the nine members of the festival jury, which is
headed this year by veteran Italian director Ettore Scola.
   Ms. Bonnaire pronounced the festival open from the Palais des
Festivals, known as ``the cake'' for its layered structure.
   But the stars in everyone's minds were the dolphins, the stars
of ``Le Grand Bleu,'' the naturalist movie selected for the opening
night celebrations.
   French director Luc Besson kept his film under close wraps and
Wednesday night was its first public showing.
   ``Le Grand Bleu'' stars American actress Rosanna Arquette, who
played alongside Madonna in ``Desperately Seeking Susan.''
   Her co-star is Jean-Marc Barr who plays the French diver Jacques
Mayol, who dives without oxygen bottles.
   Much of the 2{-hour film was shot underwater, using cameras
designed especially for the film.
   ``Le Grand Bleu'' is not in the official competition. The first
of the 21 films competing for the Golden Palm award will be shown
Thursday.
   ``L'Oeuvre au Noir'' _ The Work in Black _ is directed by
Belgian Andre Delvaux, son of surrealist painter Paul Delvaux.
   Based on the novel of the same name, written by the late
Marguerite Yourcenar, the film is set in Flanders and Italy in the
16th century, with Zenon, an alchemist doctor as the main character.
   The background is one of religious upheaval and inquisitions.
   In an effort to encourage new talent in the cinema, the festival
jury has selected a number of films by young directors.
   ``A World Apart,'' a story of apartheid in South Africa, is the
first film made under the direction of Chris Menges from Britain.
   Menges made his name in the cinema as a director of photography,
working with leading directors such as Roland Joffe on the movie
``Mission.''
   China's emerging film industry is represented by the film,
``King of Children.'' This is the first time a Chinese film has
been included in the official selection at Cannes.
   Another Far Eastern film selected by the jury, is Kiju Yoshida's
``Onimaru,'' from Japan.
   The film promises a new regard on the novel ``Wuthering
Heights'' by the English romanticist, Emily Bronte.
   ``Three Sisters'' by German director Margarethe von Trotta, is
billed as a modern adaptation of the Anton Chekov play. The three
sisters are played by Fanny Ardant, Greta Scacchi and Valeria
Golino.
   Fifteen countries are represente in the official competition.

   Two men opened rifle fire
Wednesday in a city office of the small Calabrian town of Africo
Nuovo, killing an accountant and wounding a traffic officer,
Italian media reported.
   The Italian news agency AGI identified the accountant as Leo
Mollica and said he had a criminal record.
   Police said the attack appeared linked to a feud between rival
clans.
   In another killing, also said perhaps linked to the 'ndrangheta,
the Calabrian version of the Sicilian Mafia, a 61-year-old man was
shot and killed as he rode his motorbike on a road outside the
provincial capital of Reggio di Calabria, the Italian news agency
ANSA reported. It identified the man as Francesco Madafferi.
   The attackers in both cases escaped.
   Killings occurr regularly in Reggio di Calabria in what police
say is a battle to control drug trafficking and extortion rackets
and to gain lucrative construction contracts in the underdeveloped
south.

   Security forces and Sikh militants ceased
fire Wednesday as negotiations began to end the three-day siege of
Sikhism's holiest shrine, police and witnesses said.
   Up to 12 people were killed during the siege that started Monday
after Sikh militants began firing from the Golden Temple complex at
police posts on nearby rooftops.
   Elsewhere in Punjab state, five people were killed in attacks
late Tuesday night and early Wednesday, the United News of India
reported.
   The head Sikh priest, Jasbir Singh Rode, held inconclusive talks
with senior police officials late Wednesday as 2,500 paramilitary
troops around the 400-year-old temple and an estimated 100 Sikh
militants inside stopped firing.
   ``We have many options,'' Punjab Gov. S.S. Ray told a news
conference, referring to the talks. He did not elaborate.
   Militant Sikhs have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland since 1982.
   Although a majority in Punjab, Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of
India's total population of 800 million people. The Sikhs claim
they are discriminated against by Hindus, who make up 82 percent of
the nationwide population.
   An Associated Press correspondent allowed inside the shrine saw
the decomposing bodies of three men and one woman. Sikh militants
said the four were shot by security men firing from rooftops.
   Militants holding automatic weapons huddled behind marble
pillars and vowed to carry on their resistance.
   ``We will continue to die but we shall never be destroyed,''
said Sikh militant Nirvair Singh.
   Young Sikhs, most yet to sprout a beard, were seen carrying
automatic weapons and chanting ``Sikhs will rule!''
   Earlier plans to lift a curfew in most of Amritsar's old walled
city failed, police officer Singh said.
   The curfew was ordered Monday when Sikh extremists began firing
from the temple complex at rooftop police posts.
   A.A. Siddiqui, deputy inspector general of police, said at least
10 people have died and 10 have been injured since violence began
Monday.
   But Sikh militants inside the shrine said at least 12 people
have died.
   Three people were killed early Wednesday in a heavy exchange of
fire between extremists in the temple complex and security forces.
   In New Delhi, P. Chidambaram, minister of state for home
affairs, told Parliament Wednesday ``other forces'' were being
moved to Amritsar, the United News of India reported. He did not
elaborate.
   The Home Ministry is responsible for internal security.
   The army was sent into the Golden Temple complex in June 1984 to
drive Sikh extremists from the shrine. Later that year, Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh
bodyguards in revenge.
   Reports said Wednesday that police cut off electricity and water
to the temple. Amritsar city officials said lines were down but
said militants had cut them.
   Government spokesman J.F. Brar said extremists cut electrical
lines Tuesday night to make sure no lights inside the shrine would
illuminate their positions. He said this also cut the water supply,
as electricity is needed to operate the system's pumps.
   More than 800 pilgrims were evacuated from the complex Tuesday
to keep them out of the crossfire.
   The complex covers an area equivalent to more than five city
blocks. The temple is located in the center of a pool.

   Lech Walesa said Wednesday a nine-day
shipyard strike failed because it lacked nationwide support, but
``if necessary, we will try again.'' The government said it did not
plan to punish the strikers.
   Parliament enacted a law giving the government special powers to
speed its program of economic reform, which inspired more than two
weeks of strikes. The law retained the right of official trade
unions to strike.
   Strikers at the Lenin shipyard, where Walesa is an electrician,
sought recognition of a local chapter of Solidarity, which was
outlawed after the declaration of martial law in December 1981.
   About 1,000 workers who had occupied the yard without working,
the method strikers use in Poland, marching out Tuesday behind
Walesa, ending the job action.
   Walesa founded Solidarity, the first independent labor
federation in the Soviet bloc, during a summer of labor turmoil
that followed price increases in 1980.
   Wednesday was Poland's first strike-free day since April 24. The
labor unrest, involving six major strikes, was the worst since the
martial law crackdown on Solidarity.
   A major impetus for the strikes was the reduction or removal of
government subsidies, which increased prices of necessities an
average of 42 percent in the first three months of 1988. Strikers
demanded pay raises of up to 60 percent, and some were granted.
   Premier Zbigniew Messner referred to the strikes, and to
protests at several universities, when he introduced the Special
Powers Act in Parliament.
   He linked the unrest in part to dissatisfaction with the pace of
economic reform and declared: ``A decided section of the nation ..
. displayed a praiseworthy sense of responsibility'' by not
striking.
   ``The government knows many groups of the population still live
poorly, but none of the existing conflicts or any of the key social
and economic issues will be resolved by resorting to illegal
strikes,'' Messner said.
   Parliament passed the bill 382-0 with two abstentions. It gives
the government the right to take over enterprises or fire managers
who resist attempts to change the economic system. It also lets the
government intervene in setting prices and wages.
   It did not include a provision in an earlier draft that would
have abolished for this year the already limited right of official
unions to strike.
   The law is intended to counteract bureaucratic resistance to
economic reforms, make wages and prices more realistic, reduce
centralized controls, increase competition and foster private and
managerial enterprise.
   Walesa, 44, said stopping the strike ``showed our strength as
well as our helplessness.''
   Lack of support from the rest of the country hurt the strike,
said Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983.
   ``At times we were paralyzed because there were so few of us,''
he said. ``If there are people who think we lost, it is because we
still lack solidarity'' among workers nationwide.
   Addressing reporters at St. Brygida's church near the shipyard,
he said: ``If necessary we will try again. Nothing ended. Nothing
is finished.''
   He said the 15-member shipyard strike committee that held five
rounds of negotiations with management would not be dissolved.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told The Associated Press by
telephone the decision to give up the strike was ``judicious'' and
``so eloquent that it requires no comment whatsoever.''
   Asked what the government planned to do to the strikers, he
said: ``I can declare on behalf of the government that our policy
will be a positively non-repressive policy.''
   Urban said he was making the statement in principle and could
not guarantee the policy would encompass ``all the possible cases.''
   Some shipyard supervisors were back on the job Wednesday and
officials said normal work would resume Thursday. Walesa said he
was telephoned at home and asked why he was not at work and replied
that he didn't know he was supposed to be.
   Referring to his pledge during the strike to be the last to
leave the yard, Walesa told the journalists: ``I said I would leave
as the last one. Maybe I will go back as the last one too. Maybe
I'll ask for a vacation.''
   A commentary by the official news agency PAP said the end of the
strike showed the ``myth about Solidarity's might has fallen,'' but
strike committee chairman Alojzy Szablewski took this view:
   ``When the strikers were leaving the yard, I could see
Solidarity's revival.''

   President Reagan gave George Bush's
presidential bid his long-awaited endorsement Wednesday night,
saying ``I intend to campaign as as hard as I can'' for his vice
president.
   Reagan's endorsement, delivered at a $1,500-a-plate Republican
fund-raising dinner, came hours after Bush won the support of his
only remaining presidential rival, Pat Robertson.
   Although the president's backing was never in doubt, Reagan as
titular head of the party remained officially neutral while the GOP
race was contested, even though Bush clinched the nomination two
weeks ago.
   Reagan told his audience of 3,000 Republicans: ``I intend to
campaign as hard as I can. My candidate is a former member of
Congress, ambassador to China, ambassador to the United Nations,
Director of the CIA and national chairman of the Republican party.''
   ``I'm going to work as hard as I can to make Vice President
George Bush the next president of the United States.''
   In endorsing Bush, Reagan said he was breaking ``a silence I've
maintained for some time with regard to the presidential
candidates.''
   The president's terse endorsment came at the end of a speech in
which he cited the accomplishments of his adminstration. He
mentioned Bush three times, and on one of those occasions referred
to him as ``George Bosh.''
   ``Eight years ago, George Bush and I said to the American
people, `the time is now.' It still is. The story of America is one
of people who have made their dreams come true, by realizing that
the time for action is always now,'' Reagan said.
   At the end of Reagan's speech, Bush joined him at the podium and
the two held clasped hands aloft as hundreds of balloons were
released from the ceiling.
   Bush, who spoke before Reagan, praised the president, saying:
``You began a great national renewal. What an inspiration you have
been to all of us _ your simple humanity, your decency, your
strength.''
   Earlier, as Bush waved from a second-floor balconey in the Old
Executive Office Building, Robertson told reporters on the White
House drive below that he had given his endorsement to the vice
president during a private session.
   ``I will be making that official on Monday ... because the race
is pretty much over,'' Robertson said.
   The former television minister has won only 46 delegates in the
Republican primary and caucus competition. He said he was waiting
until Monday so his supporters would have a shot at winning
additional national convention seats at GOP caucuses this weekend
in Arizona and Virginia.
   ``I didn't ask anything for myself. I spoke about education and
the need to bring the 1984 platform into line with the realities of
1988,'' Robertson said. ``We definitely had a meeting of the minds
on the platform.''
   Robertson said he told Bush he would work to get his supporters
to back him.
   In a prelude to his formal endorsement, Reagan made his
intentions known at a meeting of GOP congressional leaders in the
Cabinet Room earlier Wednesday. The Republican leaders applauded
when Reagan and Bush entered the room.
   Vanquished Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Bob Dole, who
attended the session, later had some advice for Bush which he
shared with reporters.
   Dole said Bush would ``have to build on the Reagan record, build
on the Reagan constituency, try to hold it if you can. But sooner
or later, you're going to be out there running as _ it's going to
be the Bush campaign, the Bush agenda, the Bush vision for the
future. And I think that will develop in time. I think he can do
it.''
   On more specific advice on what Bush would have to do in the
coming months to get elected, Dole said, ``I think I'll leave that
to Bush. He did enough _ he took care of me all right.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the president's
endorsement of Bush ``the warmest of political embraces.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan would campaign for Bush even before the
Republican convention in August.
   ``I'm sure once we return from the summit (in Moscow May 29-June
2) there will be a number of events this summer,'' Fitzwater said.
   Reagan's blessing comes two weeks after the Pennsylvania primary
in which Bush won sufficient Republican convention delegates to
lock up the party nomination.

   Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis turned their
campaigns west on Wednesday toward final primaries in Oregon and
California, both firmly in command and focusing on the fall.
President Reagan, in a move that surprised no one, bestowed his
official blessing on Bush.
   ``I'm going to work as hard as I can to make Vice President
George Bush the next president of the United States,'' Reagan told
3,000 Republican faithful at a $1,500-a-plate fund-raising dinner
Wednesday night.
   ``I intend to campaign as hard as I can,'' said the president.
   In endorsing Bush, Reagan said he was breaking ``a silence I've
maintained for some time with regard to the presidential
candidates.''
   After Reagan spoke, Bush came to the podium and the two held
their clasped hands in the air as hundreds of balloons were
released from the ceiling.
   The lone remaining Republican opponent, television evangelist
Pat Robertson, bowed to the obvious at last and offered Bush his
endorsement.
   Robertson said he would suspend his own candidacy for the
Republican presidential nomination on Monday, weeks after he had
ceased active campaigning against the vice president. Later,
however, his campaign said he would discuss his campaign status on
Monday, but quoted Robertson as saying he is not withdrawing from
the race or releasing his delegates.
   Reagan delivered a political tease of sorts when he and Bush
walked into the Cabinet Room to meet with GOP congressional leaders
earlier Tuesday.
   ``I just have a very brief announcement to make,'' Reagan said,
``and that is that I'll have something to say about the campaign
tonight.''
   With two fresh primary wins in his column, Dukakis took a
high-speed train ride and denounced the Reagan administration for
not supporting rail service.
   ``One of the reasons our airports are so overburdened is that we
have been spending the last eight years without a national
transportation policy,'' Dukakis said.
   Bush, with a mathematical lock on the GOP convention, and
Dukakis, with a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead for the
Democratic nomination, were both flying to the West Coast on
Thursday to begin campaign swings.
   Both planned visits to Oregon, ahead of Tuesday's primary there,
and California, which ends the primary season June 7 along with New
Jersey, New Mexico and Montana.
   A Gallup poll of likely Democratic voters in California released
Wednesday indicated a big Dukakis lead, 67 percent to 26 percent
for remaining rival Jesse Jackson.
   Jackson campaigned in Portland, Ore., and shook off resounding
primary losses to Dukakis in West Virginia and Nebraska.
   Robertson appeared before reporters at the White House and said
he had given Bush his endorsement in a private meeting and would
get out of the race.
   ``I will be making that official on Monday ... because the race
is pretty much over,'' said Robertson, who won only 46 delegates in
a campaign that spent more than $20 million.
   He said ``I didn't ask anything for myself,'' and promised to
work to have his supporters back Bush.
   Asked if he would run again in 1992 if Bush loses this fall,
Robertson said: ``It's conceivable. It's not a certainty.''
   Robertson said he soon may return to the Christian Broadcasting
Network that he founded and which he left last fall to run for the
presidency. He said contributions and viewers have dropped
dramatically in the last year.
   ``I assumed that I had built a very competent staff and that
they would be able to run CBN in my absence,'' Robertson said in an
interview with the Norfolk, Va., Virginian-Pilot and Ledger-Star.
``I did not realize that my personal presence on `The 700 Club' was
as important as it is to the audience.''
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, rode two high-speed trains
being tested for use between Boston and New York and denounced the
Reagan administration for what he said was no national
transportation policy and a failure to support Amtrak.
   He rode the trains from Boston to Providence, R.I., and back, a
50-mile one-way trip that the train covered in 32 minutes. He said
equipment needed for hourly service between New York and Boston
would cost about $200 million.
   ``This is a very, very modest investment for what could be and
should be a profitable service,'' Dukakis said.
   Jackson spoke to about 1,800 students at the predominantly black
Jefferson High School in Portland. He exhorted them to reject drugs
and violence, and afterward led a 15-block anti-drug march from the
school through one of the city's most crime-ridden areas.
   ``You get those guns out of your pockets and the drugs out of
your life, and you can make a difference,'' he said.
   Jackson insisted he was in the race until the end, despite two
more landslide wins by Dukakis Tuesday night including a delegate
shutout of Jackson in West Virginia.
   Dukakis has moved within striking distance of the 2,081
delegates needed to nail down the Democratic nomination. According
to the latest Associated Press delegate count, Dukakis had 1,589 to
Jackson's 944.

   One of Vincent van Gogh's last paintings before
his suicide, an 1890 portrait of his innkeeper's teen-age daughter,
sold at auction Wednesday for a disappointing $13.7 million.
   ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux,'' sold at Christie's auction
house, was expected by art expects to bring $15 million.
   The anonymous buyer bid by telephone, paying the fourth highest
price at auction for a painting. The three highest prices were all
for Van Goghs.
   The picture of the 13-year-old girl was made a month before van
Gogh committed suicide at age 37 in 1890 in the village of Auvers
outside Paris. In an essay written when she was in her 70s, Adeline
Ravoux Carrie described the artist's final hours as he lay in his
room at her father's inn, dying of a gunshot wound.
   Interest in the painting was keen, experts had said before the
auction, in part because it serves as a link to the artist's last
days.
   But the standing-room-only crowd was still after the final bid;
there was no applause as is customary when a high price is paid for
an artwork in which interest has been expressed prior to the sale.
   ``Bidding wasn't too spirited. The price was disappointing,''
said Ellis Abraham, a New York attorney who was interested in
bidding for a client or himself.
   Auctioneer Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in
America, called the sale ``a wonderful price for a beautiful
picture.''
   The bidding started at $6 million. The $13.75 million included
the 10 percent commission paid to the auction house.
   The portrait last changed hands in 1980 when an anonymous buyer
purchased it at a Sotheby's auction for $1.98 million.
   Over the past 14 months, three of paintings by van Gogh _ who
sold almost nothing during his lifetime _ have fetched previously
unheard-of multimillion-dollar prices that shocked the art world.
   In March 1987, van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9 million
at Christie's in London to a Japanese insurance company. Three
months later, ``The Trinquetaille Bridge'' went for $20.2 million,
also at Christie's in London. It was bought by an unidentified
collector in Switzerland.
   Then, in November, history was made when van Gogh's ``Irises,''
a composition of purple flowers and green leaves set off by a
single white iris, sold at Sotheby's in New York for $53.9 million
to an anonymous buyer, the highest price paid at auction for a
painting.
   In the painting auctioned Wednesday, Adeline, dressed in blue,
sits in profile on a chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue
ribbon, her gaze is serene, her posture correct and her hands are
folded demurely in front of her. ``He observed her very deeply, and
when he came to paint her, he painted both the grace and stiff
awkwardness of an adolescent girl,'' said Michael Findlay, senior
vice president of Christie's and an expert on impressionist and
modern painting.
   But Mrs. Carrie, who died in 1965 at the age of 88, said in a
1956 essay that she didn't immediately appreciate the painting.
   ``I admit that I was only moderately satisfied with my portrait;
it was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true
to life,'' Mrs. Carrie wrote.
   However, she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying,
``Monsieur Vincent divined not the young girl I was, but the woman
I was to become.''
   Mrs. Carrie described van Gogh, who lived at her father's inn
during the last 2{ months of his life, as a disciplined artist and
``a soft and calm'' man who enjoyed playing with her baby sister.
   She described how a doctor and police were summoned after he
returned to the inn after shooting himself, and how his brother,
Theo, who was the artist's chief backer, came running from the
train station, his face ``distorted by grief.''
   At the same auction Wednesday, Alberto Giacometti's sculpture of
three walking men, ``Trois Hommes Qui Marchent,'' sold for $3.8
million, the most ever paid at auction for a 20th century sculpture.
   Pierre Renoir's painting ``L'Ombrelle'' of a woman sitting in a
garden with an umbrella in her hand brought $6.6 million.
   Mary Cassatt's painting ``The Conversation,'' of two women
talking to each other, sold for $4.51 million, a record for the
artist.

   A witness testified Wednesday that a man
accused in 16 slayings spoke of settling scores a month before a
shooting rampage that left two dead.
   ``He said he had a few people in town he'd like to get even
with,'' Paul Epperson, a bakery route salesman, said before the
prosecution rested its case against R. Gene Simmons.
   Simmons is charged with capital murder, attempted capital murder
and kidnapping during a 45-minute shooting rampage Dec. 28 in
Russellville.
   Police said Simmons used two .22-caliber revolvers that day to
kill Kathy Kendrick, 24, who friends say once rejected Simmons'
amorous attention, and James Chaffin, 33, who apparently was a
chance victim.
   Police said Simmons had a grudge against most of the people he
is accused of shooting. Others were wounded that day as four
Russellville businesses were terrorized by a pistol-wielding
intruder.
   After Simmons surrendered, police found the bodies of 14
relatives, including his wife, his children and grandchildren, at
his home near Dover. Police said they were killed during the
Christmas holidays. Simmons is to be tried July 18 in their deaths.
   Epperson said Simmons made the comments about getting even
during conversation at the convenience store where Simmons worked.
   ``Rusty Taylor was the only name he called,'' Epperson said,
referring to one of the four people Simmons is accused of wounding.
   Defense attorney Robert E. Irwin said the defense would have
only two or three witnesses. The defense opens its case Thursday.
   Earlier Wednesday, Joyce Butts, assisted to and from the witness
box by her husband, identified Simmons in the courtroom and said
they had a bad encounter once when both worked at a freight company
after she admonished him to do a better job. ``He got angry,'' she
said. ``He screamed, he shouted across the office that he didn't
get paid enough.''
   Mrs. Butts said the shooting resulted in nightmares. ``I see
things, scary,'' she said. ``I hear things. I see people. They
don't have faces. They're after me.''
   Vicky Jackson, who the prosecution says was taken hostage after
Mrs. Butts was shot at the freight company, recalled saying to
Simmons, ``Gene, please don't shoot me, please don't shoot me.''
   Ms. Jackson said she was cowering when Simmons, holding a gun to
her right temple, took her by the right arm and told her to get up.
   ``Vicky, I'm not going to hurt you,'' Ms. Jackson said Simmons
told her, ``I came to kill Joyce. I got everybody that hurt me. I'm
not going to hurt you.''
   Ms. Jackson said Simmons put down one of the two pistols, but he
kept the other one pointed at her and would not let her leave. She
added: ``Because he said he didn't want the police barreling in
there or barging in there. ... I guess he thought they wouldn't
shoot him if they had me there.''
   He refused to give her the other gun, she said.

<TEXT>
   Paraguay's authoritarian government
canceled a meeting between Pope John Paul II and civil leaders
scheduled for next week, but a church group said Wednesday it will
try to go ahead with the assembly.
   No meeting has been canceled on such short notice on any of the
pope's 36 previous foreign tours, and the incident raised new
tensions between the Roman Catholic Church in Paraguay and the
government of President Alfredo Stroessner.
   John Paul on Wednesday visited Cochabamba on Bolivia's desolate
high plains, where he listened to the lament of jobless miners and
poverty-ravaged peasants and pledged the church's support.
   The meeting next Tuesday was to be held in a government-owned
sports stadium in Paraguay's capital of Asuncion and was intended
to bring the pontiff into contact with a broad mix of civilians.
They were to include peasants, lawyers, religious leaders and
members of opposition parties not recognized by the government.
   The invitations to opposition leaders prompted government
criticism. Patria, the daily newspaper of Stroessner's ruling
Colorado Party, on Sunday described the meeting as a ``corrupt
assembly.''
   Patria reported Tuesday that government officials, citing
``security reasons,'' notified the pope's local envoy that the
meeting had been canceled.
   The Permanent Episcopal Council said it would search for another
site.
   John Paul is due to meet Stroessner soon after the pontiff
arrives from Peru next Monday. The pope is on a 13-day tour of four
South American countries _ Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay.
   The Vatican declined comment about the cancellation of the
meeting. ``For the moment, I have nothing to say,'' said Vatican
spokesman Joaquin Navarro, traveling with the pope.
   The government and Paraguay's bishops were at odds over the
planning of the pope's visit and there was little cooperation
between them.
   The church has criticized the government and its human rights
record. The Catholic radio station in Asuncion, Caritas, has
provided air time to government opponents.
   In the mining city of Oruro, Bolivia, Wednesday, an unemployed
tin miner, Juan Alborte Cartagna, wailed as he addressed the pope
on a stage, ``We are dying of hunger, Father. Help us ... We don't
have even a piece of bread.''
   The miner, who has three children, placed a steel mining hat on
the pope's head as tears streamed down the miner's face. The
gesture drew cheers from an audience estimated by the church at
160,000, many dressed in old or patched clothing.
   Oruro, with an unemployment rate easily double the national
average of 22 percent, is considered the center of misery in
Bolivia. The country is the poorest in South America.
   Later, the pope said a Mass for more than 200,000 people after
returning to Cochabamba.
   In a meeting with priests and seminarians he praised foreign
priests working in Bolivia, saying: ``You are exercising your
ministry with sacrifice and generosity in this, your adoptive
country.''
   A group of Bolivian bishops complained to the Vatican last month
about the appointment of three foreign-born bishops. Of Bolivia's
834 priests, 634 are foreigners.
   Later, the pope urged 22,000 young people in a Cochabamba sports
stadium to avoid the temptations of drugs, sex and Marxism.
   Cochabamba, a cocaine trafficking center in the country's
principal coca-growing region, called the Chapare, is plagued by
increasing drug use among the young.
   Coca processing is outlawed in Bolivia, but the country's drug
industry supplies an estimated one-third of the cocaine that
arrives in the United States and Europe.
   In Oruro, the pope was greeted by brass bands and groups of
dancers in multicolored sequined costumes and garishly painted
masks with twisting horns.
   Under blue skies, the pontiff addressed the crowd from a tall
stage that provided a clear view of the state-run San Jose mine,
from which most workers have been fired in a government austerity
program.
   ``I know of the many workers who have been displaced from their
jobs,'' John Paul said. ``The deep mines that years ago were the
great source of national wealth ... are now only mute witnesses to
so many lives silently consumed there.''
   The Bolivian church has been criticized by the country's
conservative government for backing the social security demands of
jobless miners and peasants.
   Because of a collapse in world tin prices, the government of
President Victor Paz Estenssoro shut down 14 of the 21 state-owned
mines, leaving 21,500 of 27,000 miners without jobs.

   The government denied Wednesday that
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega had agreed to step down as armed forces
commander and leave the country in return for dismissal of charges
against him in U.S. federal court.
   An administration source in Washington said the Reagan
administration had offered to drop drug-smuggling and
money-laundering charges against Noriega in return for the
general's retirement and exile.
   Boris Moreno, director of the government's National Information
System, or SNI, told The Associated Press: ``In Panama there have
been simple conversations on diverse subjects. There has been no
agreement about anything.
   ``Upon being informed of the existence of such reports, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega told SNI categorically, ``The sovereignty of
Panama is not negotiable and is indeclinable,'' Moreno said.
   He continued: ``Such reports only come from sources interested
in sidetracking the conversations and in aggravating the existing
situation. These reports form part of the confusion and
confrontation provoked by certain elements of the Washington
establishment.''
   The official news agency Panapress on Wednesday said that
``President Reagan entered in direct contact with General
Noriega.'' The agency did not elaborate.
   Moreno, when asked if that meant Reagan spoke by telephone with
Noriega, said he did not know.
   The source in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that under the proposed deal Noriega would step down, probably
in August, and he would stay out of Panama until after the next
presidential elections there.
   The U.S. government has called for Noriega's ouster since he was
indicted in federal court in Florida in February. The Reagan
administration has imposed a variety of economic sanctions on
Panama in recent months to try to hasten the departure of Noriega,
who is considered the power behind Panama's government.
   Raymond Takiff, one of Noriega's four U.S. lawyers, told the AP
in Miami that he was unaware of the alleged deal. Takiff and lawyer
Frank Rubino met with Noriega Tuesday in Panama City.
   Rubino had told the AP in Panama on Tuesday: ``At the moment
there are no plans for his (Noriega's) retirement.''
   Terence Kneebone, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Panama City,
said he had no knowledge of the alleged deal.
   Asked if State Department envoy Michael Kozak met in Panama on
Wednesday with the general or his representatives, Kneebone said,
``No comment.'' The Reagan administration has sent Kozak to Panama
in recent weeks to talk with Noriega.

   The Senate has decided to create a buffer
against the political consequences of deciding which of the
nation's 3,600 military installations should be closed _ a
commission that can be conveniently blamed if the folks back home
complain.
   The Senate voted 83-13 on Tuesday to create a 15-member
commission that would recommend which bases to close. The House is
expected to agree to the commission, senators said during debate
over the proposal that was tacked onto a Pentagon budget bill.
   Studies by the Pentagon and the Senate Armed Services Committee
have estimated that between $1 billion and $5 billion a year can be
saved if unneeded bases can be closed.

just two days after the House approved a similar bill with a calm

National Rifle Association went along.
   The NRA agreed to avoid a bruising gun control battle in
Congress when it became clear that no existing handguns would be

   Labor leaders said they ended an eight-day
strike at the Gdansk shipyard to avoid a police raid, but communist
authorities said the strike failed for lack of widespread support.
   Still, the government said two weeks of strikes that ended
Tuesday when Lech Walesa and about 1,000 haggard strikers marched
from the Lenin shipyard will compel it to speed up efforts to
revive Poland's crippled economy.
   Heads held high, the shipyard workers filed out of the yard
without a settlement but also without having backed down from
demands whose centerpiece was reinstatement of the yard's
Solidarity chapter.
   Police had surrounded the shipyard since Thursday and the
strikers had rejected government offers of wage increases, so
quitting was the ``best solution possible,'' said strike committee
chairman Alojzy Szablewski.

   Scientists who spent months
testing a 3,000-year-old mummy nicknamed Lady X say they've
developed a new way to prevent decay of Egypt's mummies and other
priceless antiquities.
   The technique involves construction of hermetically sealed
display cases filled with inert nitrogen gas, and ``will benefit
millions of objects in museums around the world,'' possibly
including Israel's 2,000-year-old Dead Sea Scrolls, said Luis
Monreal, director of the Getty Conservation Institute.
   A small-scale prototype of the display case, which contains
temperature and humidity sensors, a leak detector and almost no
oxygen, was unveiled Tuesday during a seminar attended by 100
scientists, museum officials and Egyptian dignitaries.

   The first spike in bank-lending rates since the
October stock market crash jolted Wall Street on Wednesday,
heralding a period of more expensive loans for purchases ranging
from plant machinery to homes and cars.
   Several big banks, pressured by increased costs of borrowing
money themselves, raised their prime lending rate from 8.5 percent
to 9 percent, nearly erasing the results of three decreases over
the last seven months. Chase Manhattan Bank led the move.
   The prime rate lags behind more subtle increases in interest
rates elsewhere. But the rate is closely watched because bankers
use it as a basis for calculating loans to businesses, as well as
determining many types of consumer loans, including increasingly
popular home-equity loans.

   Aging American, British and French comrades
who harbor the often agonizing memories of one of World War II's
most heroic missions gathered Wednesday for probably their last
full reunion, 44 years after they were parachuted behind enemy
lines.
   ``It took some of them this long to find each other, and they
won't let go,'' said Daphne Friele, who was an 18-year-old
secretary in the British intelligence office that trained 279
Americans, Britons and Frenchmen for a mission code-named
``Jedburgh.''
   Records of the operation remained top secret until 1985,
although many of those taking part have told their dramatic stories
of sabotaging German forces and supporting the European resistance.
The specially trained soldiers were dropped in teams of three with
a radio _ scattered across France, Belgium and The Netherlands _ in
advance of the June 6, 1944 Normandy landings.

   ABC's ``Supercarrier,'' launched earlier this
spring, immediately ran into heavy weather from the critics.
   The show, set aboard the fictitious USS Georgetown, has been
called a ripoff _ and a not particularly good one _ of the hit
movie ``Top Gun.''
   The Navy, after looking at a few scripts, hoisted anchor and
withdrew all support. Without the Navy, the show could no longer
film aboard the carrier or aloft with Navy planes.
   In the ratings, after six showings, ``Supercarrier'' ranks 68th
of 105 shows. Not great, but not so terrible, either, against the
likes of ``Murder, She Wrote'' on CBS and ``Family Ties'' on NBC.
And the ratings increase slightly in the half-hour after ``Family
Ties.''
   ``Supercarrier'' carries on using a sound stage in Valencia, 30
miles north of Los Angeles and more than 50 miles from the nearest
Navy base.
   ``People ask how we can do a show about an aircraft carrier
without Navy support,'' said executive producer Steven E. de Souza.
``Even when we had Navy support we only spent two weeks on a
carrier. It's very hard.
   ``We went to Jacksonville, Fla., and spent a fortune waiting to
get on the Forrestal. Then we had to go to Norfolk to get on the
John F. Kennedy. The day we were to shoot at the Long Beach Naval
Station we had to cancel because of Prince Andrew coming in. It
cost us $30,000.
   ``Add that to what we spent in Jacksonville and that's a lot of
money down the drain chasing the chimera of Navy cooperation. So,
we've been faking it.''
   De Souza said it was not the proposed story lines that caused
the Navy to drop its cooperation, as had been reported.
   ``The stories the Navy supposedly rejected never existed,'' he
said. ``We never had a story about the captain falling in love with
a woman pilot. The information we're getting is that the Navy's air
arm, the `brown shoes,' didn't like the show. And the reason they
didn't like it was that it isn't just about the pilots, as `Top
Gun' was.
   ``We have a lot of characters who are `black shoe' Navy and we
hear they're delighted with the show. We have a lot of regular
sailors that young people can identify with. Kids see `Top Gun,'
but they know they'll never go to college and never be an aviator.''
   De Souza said Chuck Fries Entertainment Inc., which makes the
show, was being pulled in different directions by the Navy and ABC.
   ``The Navy could never articulate exactly what it wanted,'' he
said. ``But they did say once they wanted us to show the crew
off-duty and at home. The network wanted the ship at sea and the
planes in the air.''
   The premise for ``Supercarrier,'' based loosely on the book of
the same name by George Wilson, is a good one. It focuses not only
on the pilots, but on the crew as well, from the captain down to
the newest member.
   The problem comes in the stories, which on some occasions seem
to have been salvaged from ``Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.'' The
show's characters come off as cartoons. You don't become involved
with them the way you do with the people on ``China Beach,''
another ABC military series that's doing much better in the ratings.
   In one episode two pilots from the Georgetown were duped by two
beautiful young women into flying a cargo plane to Mexico. The
plane was carrying guns stolen from the carrier. The pilots should
have been court-martialed for stupidity.
   The carrier was used to evacuate people from an island
threatened by either a volcano or a rebel army. It was impossible
to tell which. One sailor learned he had inadvertently proposed
marriage to an island girl _ something to do with goats. All it
needed was Maria Montez and someone to say, ``Give me the cobra
jewel.''
   The last episode has something to do with Nazi gold recovered
from a sunken ship by archaeologists. But there's more. It's packed
in poisoned grain, and it gets into the carrier's water system.
Where is Indiana Jones when you need him?

<HEAD>Air Force Tries to Put Brakes on Sonic Boom Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL KACZOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three ear-shattering booms
mark the flight of an F-111 thundering at supersonic speed just 200
feet above a test range in the Florida panhandle.
   The fighter-bomber drops an experimental bomb, then the pilot
yanks the throttle back to idle, cutting the jet's thrust 90
percent.
   In seconds, the plane's speed drops from 940 mph to just under
600 _ a radical maneuver designed to limit noise and damage from
sonic booms.
   Without it, windows might have shattered in Holley and Navarre,
which lie near the end of the range; with it, residents might not
even hear the booms.
   ``It's such a violent deceleration we are actually thrown
forward in the cockpit, held back by our seat straps,'' said Maj.
Dan Isbell in an interview. ``We try our best to be good neighbors.
We don't want to go around breaking people's windows.''
   Isbell, a test pilot from Chattanooga, Tenn., was describing a
typical mission at Mach 1.2, or just over the speed of sound, at
the Air Force's only supersonic test range in the eastern United
States. The special low-level missions test non-nuclear weaponry
being developed here, including so-called smart bombs that glide to
their targets with pinpoint accuracy.
   Col. Harvey Greenberg, Eglin's chief claims officer, said the
Air Force nationwide received 265 claims for $465,138 in the 1987
budget year, but paid only $67,003 for 160 claims deemed valid
while denying 80. Some claims carry over to the next year.
   Eglin accounted for 27 of the valid claims and $4,931 in
damages, Air Force records show.
   But it has been worse in the past. A single boom in 1984
produced 34 claims that cost Eglin $15,865.
   The only other places where the Air Force permits low-level
supersonic flights are Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., and certain
other desert areas in the West, Isbell said.
   But none is as close to populated areas as Eglin's Range B-70.
Holley and Navarre lie just five to seven miles to the west.
   The 13-mile-long range is in the western half of a
720-square-mile military reservation, about 10 miles northwest of
Fort Walton Beach, once billed as ``Home of the Sonic Boom.''
   Local newspapers and radio stations carry Air Force news
releases about impending supersonic flights so residents won't be
startled if they hear the booms, said George Roberts, a civilian
spokesman in Eglin's public affairs office. He said missions have
been canceled when the releases failed to make the newspapers.
   Predicting the strength of sonic booms is an inexact science
that depends on such variables as aircraft size, speed, altitude
and weather factors including wind, air pressure and temperature,
Isbell said.
   Temperature inversions are the most serious complication,
capable of bouncing the sonic shock waves great distances. Isbell
said inversions have been suspected of breaking windows as far away
as downtown Pensacola, about 30 miles to the west.
   The F-111 is the largest of several types of aircraft used in
low-level supersonic testing and thus produces the loudest and most
damaging booms.
   An aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound generally
creates three shock waves, one by its nose, another by its
midsection and the third by its tail, Isbell said.
   Shock waves are caused when air molecules cannot get out of the
way of a plane flying faster than the speed of sound.
   The booms, however, dissipate rapidly over distance. Those
produced at high altitudes rarely are heard on the ground, and
supersonic flight above 30,000 feet, or almost 6 miles up, is
unrestricted, Isbell said.
   Studies conducted by the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration, which was checking the potential for damage from
space shuttles, indicate window breakage is about the worst damage
that can be caused by an aircraft.
   Some people, however, give sonic booms credit for more.
   A man living just across the Alabama state line about 50 miles
west of Eglin once complained that a sonic boom knocked his mobile
home off its foundation. The man later admitted he hadn't heard a
sonic boom and wasn't even home at the time. He later told Isbell
that he first thought it was caused by dynamiting at a quarry
across the street until he saw a television news report about a
boom causing broken windows at nearby cities.
   The most recent effort to limit boom complaints has been setting
up special meters that register shock waves even if they are
inaudible, Isbell said.
   ``Although arming the Air Force is our mission, we will always
have a responsibility to be good neighbors,'' he said. ``Minimizing
sonic booms is one way to fulfill that responsibility.''

   A theologian for the National Association
of Evangelicals says carbon-14 tests on the Shroud of Turin will
not affect evangelical belief in Christ's resurrection, whatever
the results.
   ``It is no more than an interesting investigation,'' says the
Rev. Arthur Climenhaga, chairman of NAE's theological committee.
``Even if proof could be offered that the Shroud of Turin was the
shroud of Christ, that would be no more than an additional artifact
in the historical evidences of Christ's resurrection _ already so
well attested.''
   The Vatican is allowing the carbon-14 tests on bits of the
shroud, preserved in Turin, Italy, and bearing the image of a
crucified man, to determine its age, and whether it dates to the
time of Christ.
   Results of the tests are expected later this year.

<HEAD>For Farmers, No More Accounting `Out of Shoebox'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE BIGHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers who recently overcame their
aversion to computers, now must face another test: accounting.
   Yes, it's not enough to be computer literate to succeed in
agribusiness these days. You'd better understand the numbers you're
crunching as well.
   Bankers are telling farmers that accounting ``out of a shoebox''
is no longer good enough to support a loan application. Instead,
farmers must provide sophisticated data about their operations and
show they understand the figures.
   ``It makes a banker skittish when someone can't answer what we
consider basic questions,'' warns William Scarborough, a vice
president with Sanwa Bank.
   ``When I meet a customer who can talk intelligently with me
regarding financial plans, how to control that, how to optimize
returns and can present this type of information to us, it lends a
lot of credibility to the management and general character of the
operation.''
   Dave Esterman, president of Fresno-Madera Production Credit
Association, puts it more simply: ``Farmers have normally operated
out of a shoebox, and we're trying to get them out of that mode.''
   ``One question is obviously: `Are you a good farmer?''' says Tom
Gallo, vice president of Wells Fargo Bank, who along with the other
bankers participated in a recent seminar on agricultural computing
here.
   But he emphasized that it is not enough to be an expert about
all the technical details of farming and have limited understanding
of the farm's finances.
   ``The other aspect of being a good farm manager is being a
financial manager as well _ understanding where those numbers come
from and what they mean,'' Gallo said.
   What technical data do bankers want before they will consider
lending farmers money? Dave Smith, professor of farm management and
accounting at Fresno State University, offered this checklist:
   _Current business and personal financial statements, including a
full accounting of outstanding debts.
   _Three years' worth of tax returns.
   _A cash-flow budget.
   _Details of proposed programs for cropping and marketing, along
with a three- to five-year history of crop yields.
   _Land locations, maps and lease arrangements.
   _A list of trade suppliers and credit agreements.
   _A complete equipment list, including descriptions, ages and
serial numbers.
   _Partnership or corporate organization details.
   _Insurance coverage.
   ``The day when a farmer can just be a farmer and let his banker
be concerned about the financial aspects of his business is past,''
Esterman said.
   ``The farmer who can relay his financial message in a way we
understand and he also understands, with help from a computer, is
the type we are looking for _not the kind who comes in with bills
in his back pocket,'' he added.
   Gallo said that when he began in banking a decade ago, ``I
remember sitting down with customers at the kitchen table and
helping customers prepare an application statement. We've gotten
away from that.''
   Lenders often are unwilling to start with the farmer's own raw
financial figures, the bankers warned. They want information that
has been spot-checked by a certified public accountant for accuracy
or even audited as a more complete assurance of accuracy.
   That requires consistency and use of generally accepted
accounting principles, which were not widely followed on the farm
until about three or four years ago, Smith said.
   Smith said computers can help provide the more sophisticated
bookkeeping required on farms today. But Esterman cautioned that
merely switching to computer bookkeeping will do little good ``if
you are not in the habit of keeping good records, whether in a
notebook or otherwise.''

   When you're looking up when other people are
looking down you see things they can't possibly see, said the
economist, observing that the adage had particular meaning in his
profession.
   A lot of his colleagues are looking for bad news these days, he
sasee a lot of bad omens. They see the falling
jobless rate not as healthy but as a signal of inflation and higher
interest rates to come.
   They observe that the factory utilization rate iid, and so they s rising,
but
rather than seeing this as good news for depressed areas, they view
it as an indicator of stress on the economy, to be followed by
inflation.
   But there are things to be seen by looking up, too, said the
economist.
   You find, for instance, that the relatively low, 5.4 percent
civilian jobless rate doesn't necessarily mean the labor pool is
exhausted and that wages therefore must rise.
   There are plenty of people unemployed, close to 6.8 million in
fact. And, while some of these are unskilled teen-agers, many of
them are adult men eager to work. He observed that the jobless rate
today is higher for adult men than it was in May 1979, when the
economy was in a similar expansion mode.
   Since ding on plant and equipment should rise 8 percent
this year.
   We are in a capital spending boom, he said, explaining that it
would mean expanded capacity, thus limiting the strain on existing
capacity, and greater productivity, which would reduce inflation
pressures.
   Well, said the listener to the upward-looking economist, you
must concede that the Federal Reserve is concerned, that interest
rates have been edging higher.
   Of course, he said, and then he went into a long analysis of
pessimism. People today, he observed, were conditioned for the
worst by the 1970s, when the nation was harassed for years by
double-digit interest and inflation rates.
   But why, he asked, do we assume that any movement in either rate
must be for an extended period of time? Sure, he said, interest
rates might rise and inflation stir, but that doesn't mean they are
long-term phenomenons.
   He pointed out that higher interest rates are designed to slow
the economy. Why, he asked, do we think they won't do the job, that
they won't slow the expansion? And if expansion slows, he
continued, shouldn't rates then fall?
   There is one thing you must remember, he said. You should
remember that the economy is always at risk, every day and in many
ways. Danger is a given, as it is for all living things.
   But that, he concluded, does not mean that when the trend is
down it is down for all time _ that when things turn bad they
cannot be corrected. The economy is cyclical, he said, and that
means a downturn presages an upturn.

<TEXT>
   In a money-is-no-object land rush,
big egos and bigger bucks are tearing down grand but aging estates
on the world's highest-priced real estate to make room for lavish
super-shrines.
   The wealthy so-called Golden Triangle area _ Beverly Hills,
Bel-Air and Brentwood _ roars and rumbles and rings with the din of
bulldozers and power saws.
   Some residents consider the new megamansions architectural
obscenities. The enormous $12 million palace under construction for
television mogul Aaron Spelling is bigger than the White House and
has been dubbed ``The Hilton'' by disgusted neighbors.
   ``Our peaceful neighborhood has been shattered,'' said one, J.P.
Guerin.
   ``It's ostentatious and over-consumption,'' added another,
Audrey Irmas, who won a court injunction limiting construction
hours and the number of trucks permitted at the site. ``The
Spellings are very self-centered to come in and destroy a
neighborhood like this.''
   Mrs. Irmas called the mansion, which includes a bowling alley
and an entire floor of closets, ``the mental institution, because
you'd have to be crazy to build something like that.''
   ``That's nothing,'' said Elaine Young of the real estate firm
Alvarez, Hyland and Young. ``The biggest monument is going to be by
the Sultan of Brunei behind the Beverly Hills Hotel. He's torn down
five houses for a palace.''
   One was the estate of actor James Coburn, she said, adding: ``He
(the sultan) paid full price, $5 million, and it's a teardown.''
   Sentiment or nostalgia hold no sway in high-stakes real estate.
Homes once owned by James Cagney, Bing Crosby and others have
crumbled beneath bulldozer treads. Crosby's estate was just part of
the property Spelling leveled for his project.
   ``Everything is emotional. They want it, they buy it,'' said Ms.
Young. ``Nobody does a square footage cost on properties here
anymore.''
   Beverly Hills, where property value within the 5.6-square-mile
city limits is estimated at more than $5 billion, issued permits
for 28 teardown projects in 1985, 43 in 1986 and 51 last year, said
city spokesman Fred Cunningham. Fourteen have been granted so far
this year.
   The trend is to buy a ``bargain basement'' house for $1 million
or more, raze it and build a grand, gated kingdom.
   ``They are buying these charming homes and ripping them down and
building these things,'' said Mrs. Irmas.
   A new law allows a structure to occupy a maximum 55 percent of
the property. ``Some of these were really out of scale in the
neighborhood and we put in an emergency ordinance to stop it,''
Cunningham said.
   Architect Cliff May, father of the California ranch-style house,
is a critic of the huge projects.
   ``Good architecture is something that fits in the neighborhood,
but nowadays, many architects are building monuments to their
clients and the homes look like castles and mausoleums,'' May said.
   Talk show host and producer Merv Griffin has also plowed money
into real estate. A few years ago he spent $5 million, modest by
Beverly Hills standards, on a four-acre stone mansion and
completely refurbished it.
   Now he's carving out a homesite on 150 acres in the Santa Monica
Mountains near the Benedict Canyon homes of Ann-Margret and Cher.
Earth-moving equipment is readying a 16-acre plateau for a
Palladian villa.
   Author Sidney Sheldon bought a Sunset Boulevard teardown for his
future mansion, to be called Rose Hill.
   The megamansion brouhaha is not confined to the Golden Triangle.
On the exclusive Palos Verdes peninsula overlooking the Pacific,
the 49-room Via Visalia estate owned by Dennis and Mary Ellen
Hardin has provoked interest in an ordinance to limit structure
size. The home has been dubbed the ``Visalia Sheraton'' by angry
neighbors.
   ``I enjoyed not looking at all this,'' said neighbor Beth
Pinkley, who complains the house, with turrets, pillars and an
ornate brick and stone wall is an eyesore. It lures unsavory
``looky-loos,'' she said. ``It puts us at risk.''
   Elsewhere in Southern California, refurbishing old mansions _ as
opposed to tearing them down _ remains in vogue, particularly those
with plenty of square footage to knock around in. Examples include
The Knoll, a 35,000-square-foot estate remodeled by Kenny Rogers
and sold for $22 million to oilman Marvin Davis, and the Kirkeby,
the old ``Beverly Hillbillies'' estate undergoing extensive
remodeling by TV producer Jerry Perenchio.
   ``He stole that place for $13.5 million. It was the best buy in
town and will be worth $25 million when he's finished,'' Ms. Young
said of the Kirkeby.
   In the shadow of the Kirkeby is the modest $2.5 million home
where President and Mrs. Reagan will likely spend their post-White
House years. The value of the properly alone is estimated at almost
$3 million.
   Ms. Young said investors from all over the country are showing
up ``with suitcases full of money.''
   ``They don't even haggle over price,'' she said. ``You've got a
lot of people who have made money and this is a place to dispose of
it. Homes are much more important here than they are in New York,
and here people are much more into show.
   ``This is a definite show town. Everybody is trying to outdo
their neighbor, from cars to houses to designers to everything.''

   Television producer Aaron Spelling, who
created lavish prime-time fantasies Americans love, is building an
opulent real estate fantasy his neighbors hate.
   In this real-life drama with soap-opera overtones, the
56,500-square-foot Holmby Hills mansion has already been
immortalized in satirical song in ``An Ode to Spelling's Dwelling''
and is called ``The Mental Institution'' by a neighbor who says
only a crazy person would build it.
   Spelling, whose TV shows include ``Dynasty,'' ``Hotel'' and
``Fantasy Island,'' is himself tight-lipped about the $12 million
home mushrooming on the six-acre parcel he bought for $10 million,
said his publicist, Warren Cowan.
   The Spelling property was once anchored by the
10,000-square-foot Bing Crosby house and included two other homes,
all torn down for the new mansion.
   The French chateau-style structure, which will house Spelling,
wife Candy and two children, dwarfs other sizeable mansions in the
area. It is longer than a football field and has a roofline 51 feet
from the ground. Tons of natural limestone shipped from Italy will
cover the exterior.
   Inside will be a bowling alley, a screening room, a gymnasium,
garages for eight cars, a tennis court, an entire floor of closets
tucked between the soaring first and second floors and, of course,
a swimming pool.
   ``Aaron Spelling is not a superstar in this neighborhood, and
I'm not excited about the visibility of this wealth,'' said one
neighbor, J.P. Guerin. ``Yet, you have to look at this with a
certain amount of humor. If you don't laugh at it, you'll cry.''
   Composer John Perry of Ojai, Calif., said he was staggered by
published reports of Spelling's lavish home, so he knocked out a
calypso-style rap song with these lyrics:
   ``See Candy's jewels, see Aaron's money,
   ``Aaron doesn't think being picked on is funny.
   ``See Candy's clothes, see Aaron's pad,
   ``See Aaron and Candy's castle, make the neighbors mad.
   ``But they're livin' in splendor high above the crowds,
   ``60,000 square feet of heaven.
   ``That's Spelling's dwelling, I said Spelling's Dwelling...''

   Oil futures prices remain in what analysts call
a sluggish, directionless phase, partly because of nervousness
about OPEC's scheduled meeting next month over production cuts.
   Crude oil futures were mostly higher, gasoline futures generally
declined and heating oil was mixed Tuesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, settled down 8 cents at $17.46 per barrel. Most other
contract months showed small gains.
   Traders said the weakness in June crude reflected a continued
surplus of West Texas Intermediate and other light crude grades in
the spot market for immediate purchase.
   June contracts for unleaded regular gasoline edged up 0.03 cent
to close at 51.62 cents a gallon, but most other months fell. June
heating oil gained 0.07 cent to 47.74 cents a gallon. Shorter-term
contracts for heating oil rose while longer-term contracts slipped.
   Dealers said the market's jitters about OPEC's scheduled June 8
meeting had subdued trading volume.
   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
scheduled the meeting after failing to reach agreement on cutting
production in conjunction with non-OPEC producers at meeting last

<HEAD>Farm Credit System Reports $165 Million Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit System has posted its third
consecutive quarterly profit, a $165 million net in its first
fiscal quarter that reversed its loss of $155 million a year
earlier.
   The profit reported Tuesday was due entirely to a $160 million
reduction in the reserve for loan losses and a $10 million net gain
on other property owned.
   The system's net interest income of $146 million _ the
difference between interest income and interest expense _ fell
short of its other expenses of $151 million. A year earlier, the
system had net interest income of $149 million, less than the $164
million in other expenses.
   The Farm Credit System has been able to reduce its loan-loss
reserves because borrowers are considered better able to repay
their loans.
   ``The improvement in the agricultural economy experienced in the
latter half of 1987 continued into the first quarter of 1988,''
Alan D. Fass, president and chief executive of the Federal Farm
Credit Banks Funding Corp., said in a news release.
   Fass announced the Farm Credit System's profit jointly with H.
Brent Beesley, president and chief executive of the Farm Credit
Corporation of America.
   The Farm Credit System consists of 37 borrower-owned banks and
associations serving the rural economy. Congress put it on a more
secure footing last year by authorizing the issuance of up to $4
billion in government-backed, low-interest loans.
   The 1987 legislation, by increasing confidence in the Farm
Credit System, made it possible to narrow the interest-rate spreads
on Farm Credit debt obligations over U.S. Treasury securities.
   Fass said the first-quarter net interest income was boosted by
special factors, and may be lower in the rest of 1988.
   The allowance for loan losses as of March 31 was $2.744 billion,
down from $2.951 billion at the end of 1987 and $3.532 billion as
of March 31, 1987.

   A broad move by five big brokers to limit
computerized stock trading has won enthusiastic endorsement from
critics who claim the strategy has caused unwarranted price
convulsions and alienated many investors.
   But some question the effectiveness of the halt on index
arbitrage program trading, because four of the firms will continug
using the strategy for their clients' investments.
   Kidder Peabody & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co., PaineWebber Inc. and
Salomon Brothers Inc. on Tuesday announced limitations on program
trading for their own accounts only, while Bear Stearns & Co. said
it had imposed a total suspension.
   The moves marked the most aggressive voluntary steps yet to calm
an outcry over the strategy, which has been blamed for destructive
volatility in the stock market before and since the October crash.
   ``It is necessary for all to work toward the goal of restoring
confidence in and guaranteeing the vibrancy of the marketplace,''
John Gutfreund, chairman and chief executive of Salomon, said in a
statement that also reflected a view expressed by the other firms.
   ``Any action taken by member firms to tone volatility and
increase investor confidence should be applauded,'' said Richard
Torrenzano, spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange, which also
has taken steps to limit program trading. ``I think it's meaningful
and a step in the right direction.''
   Wall Street sources said the firms have been under enormous
pressure from stock exchanges, customers, lawmakers, and even their
own salespeople, for coordinated action to control the computerized
practice, which involves the massive purchase and sale of stock
index futures and the underlying stocks on which they are based.
   Although their action won't mean an end to program trading, some
traders said it should help limit the volatility because the
brokerages had used the technique much more frequently than their
customers did.
   ``We welcome their decision, of course,'' said Anthony A.
LaCroix, chairman, president and chief executive of Advest Inc., a
Hartford, Conn.-based securities firm that has urged tough
restrictions on program trading. ``We think it's a right one for
the capital markets in the long run, and will encourage individuals
to come back to the market.''
   Nevertheless, experts say proprietary program trading by these
brokerages has accounted for only about 20 percent of the total
volume of trades attributed to the strategy. Some critics said this
leaves plenty of room for more uncertainty.
   ``Liquidity in our financial markets has dried up, and this may
be the first sight of rain we've seen in a long time,'' said Rep.
Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the finance subcommittee of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee in reaction to the
suspensions. ``However, with customers still in the index arbitrage
business, the question remains if intra-day volatility will
increase or decrease.''
   Capital Guardian Trust Co. Chairman Robert G. Kirby, a member of
the presidential panel that investigated the stock crash, said the
big brokers probably had determined that bad publicity over the
technique didn't outweigh the profits they derived from it.
   ``These guys decided that life's too short,'' Kirby said. ``I
think they get the blame for all the volatility in the marketplace,
but all the volatility is going to go on, because of their
customers.''
   Most index arbitrage program trading is done on behalf of
institutional clients, such as pension funds and banks, who see the
strategy as one of the few moneymakers in a market that has
languished since the October crash.
   At the same time, program trading has frightened billions of
investor dollars out of the market because it can swing prices
violently without regard to a stock's real value. The result has
been a severe drop in trading volume and stock underwritings.
   Some said the actions Tuesday reflected a growing belief in the
securities industry that lawmakers would take steps aimed at
restoring investor confidence unless brokerage firms could reform
themselves.
   ``What's really developed is a tremendous fear by the Wall
Street commmunity that legislators may take significant action that
might be an over-reaction,'' said Jack Barbanel, a futures expert
at the Gruntal & Co. investment firm in New York.
   Goldman Sachs & Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Merrill Lynch
& Co. and First Boston Co. had previously announced suspensions of
index arbitrage program trading for their own accounts. But only
Goldman's was considered significant because the firm was among the
biggest users of the technique.

   Program trading is a catch-all term for a range
of computerized trading strategies that most often refers to index
arbitrage, which involves the rapid purchase and sale of stocks and
stock-index futures.
   In this strategy, traders attempt to profit on discrepancies
between the price of the actual stocks traded in New York and the
value of indexes based on them, such as the Standard & Poor's 500,
traded in Chicago.
   When the stocks trade at a significant discount to the index
futures, traders sell the futures and buy the stocks. Conversely,
when the index futures sell at a big enough discount from the
underlying stocks, traders sell the stocks and buy the index
futures.
   The speed at which these transactions are executed is crucial to
the program trading strategy because the price discrepancies
between stocks and stock-index futures are temporary during the
course of a trading session.
   Big brokerages use powerful computer programs that track these
discrepancies and instantly set off buy or sell programs when
conditions are deemed profitable.

   Forty-odd years of personal promotion failed
to make Wilbur Blank's orange-peeling invention a success, but a
few seconds of exposure on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' have sparked a
deluge of orders for the gadget.
   Commentator Andy Rooney's glowing comments and brief
demonstration of the device in a show broadcast several weeks ago
prompted an unprecedented wave of demand for the Quik Orange Peel,
which Blank has been selling in its current form for about eight
years.
   ``This has been mind-boggling,'' Blank's wife Jane said in an
interview from the couple's home in this west-central Illinois
town. ``We had no idea he was going to say anything about the
orange peel. You can't believe the reaction.''
   Rooney demonstrated the peeler _ which had been lying in his
desk for three years _ during a commentary on gadgets he gets in
the mail.
   ``This is one of the best things I ever got,'' Rooney said.
``It's changed my life.
   ``It really is magic. You can amaze your friends with this.''
   In the past two weeks, Blank and his Wil-Le Products Co. have
received dozens of mail and phone orders for the peeler, which he
sells in groups of five for $6.
   ``Last week, we sent out about 500 or 600 orders,'' Blank said.
``We're getting more every day.''
   Blank nearly had given up on ever selling the public on his
invention, which he developed in California while working as a
welder before World War II.
   ``I was fresh off the farm, and I got out to California and
found I loved oranges but hated to peel them,'' he said. ``That's
when I came up with my orange peeler.''
   The original model, made of stainless steel wire, looked more
like a bottle opener than an orange peeler. Blank's patent
application was rejected and for four decades tried unsuccessfully
to market the device.
   He showed his peeler to Fred Wadley at I.V. Die Co. in Peoria
about eight years ago, and Wadley fashioned one from
brightly-colored orange plastic.
   Wadley has produced about 30,000 peelers since then, but says
sales must soar before the product can be declared a commercial
success.
   Rooney isn't sure why he still had the peeler in his desk drawer
three years after Blank sent it to him.
   ``I just saw it in the drawer one day when I was looking for
something, and I decided to give it a try,'' Rooney said in a
telephone interview. ``I really liked it.''
   Rooney said viewers flooded the network with calls and letters
after the ``60 Minutes'' segment.
   ``We always get a lot of mail, but we got more than usual on
this. Letters are still coming in,'' he said.
   Rooney speculated that the benefits of prime-time exposure would
be fleeting, although a planned ``60 Minutes'' follow-up filmed at
the Blanks' home could help.
   Blank sold his blacksmith and welding shop two years ago, but
still runs a mobile home park and other business interests. He
isn't counting on the Quik Orange Peel to make him rich.
   ``I don't want to be a millionaire. I'd have too many people on
my back, then,'' he said. ``I'd be happy with about $90,000. I
could live real comfortably in Toulon on $90,000. Of course, if it
goes above that, I'm not going to turn it down.''

<HEAD>Showdown at USG Shareholders Meeting Over Hostile Takeover</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain; meeting scheduled to begin at 11
a.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle over Desert Partners L.P.'s attempted
hostile takeover of USG Corp. moves to the company's annual meeting
today, where Desert Partners has another chance to appeal to
shareholders for support.
   Directly at stake are six seats on USG's 15-member board of
directors.
   Desert Partners has nominated its own a slate of candidates for
the seats, rivaling USG's own slate, and is waging a hostile $2.2
billion buyout offer for the building products company as well.
   Most shareholders already have voted their choices by mail,
although those voting by mail may change their votes at the meeting.
   Election results were not expected today. Federal regulations
allow USG 10 days to tally the votes and announce the winners, said
USG spokeswoman Randi Killian.
   An election victory by the hostile bidder would not translate
into immediate control of USG by Desert Partners, a partnership led
by oilmen Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown of Midland, Tex.
   But a Desert Partners victory would indicate shareholder
approval of the group's demand that USG drop its ``poison pill''
takeover defense, a major impediment to the proposed acquisition.
   Desert Partners, which owns about 9.9 percent of USG's 51.5
million common shares outstanding, is offering $42 cash a share for
up to 39 million shares. The partnership proposes purchasing the
remaining shares for $42 worth of debt securities and warrants,
bringing the total indicated value of the deal to about $2.2
billion.
   USG has proposed to fight Desert Partners with a defensive
recapitalization, which would be submitted to a shareholder vote on
June 24. USG would borrow $2.2 billion to pay its shareholders $37
a share in cash, debentures with a face value of $5 and a share of
stock in the recapitalized corporation for each of their shares.

<TEXT>
   South Korea's shipbuilding orders have
decreased by 41.3 percent so far this year from the same period in
1987 because of the national currency's appreciation in foreign
exchange, officials said today.
   Orders received so far consist of 626,300 gross tons of export
ships and 800 gross tons of domestic ships, the officials said.
   But the officials also said that despite the sluggish orders,
local shipmakers still have a combined outstanding order of 6
million gross tons, enough to keep them busy until the first half
of next year.
   The value of the South Korean won has risen 7.43 percent against
the U.S. dollar so far this year. A higher won makes South Korean
exports more expensive abroad while lowering the prices of imports.

<TEXT>
   An outside review of the deadly 1984 gas
leak at a Bhopal, India plant was intended to objectively assesses
the cause of the disaster, Union Carbide Corp. says, although the
resulting report provides little new information on the incident.
   The report released Tuesday by the firm Arthur D. Little Inc.
supported Carbide's claims that sabotage by a disgruntled employee
caused the disaster. It also refuted as ``physically impossible''
the Indian government's contention that the disaster stemmed from
negligence.
   ``We wanted the world to know that somebody that had a
reputation that was worldwide and sterling...would look at things
critically,'' said Bud Holman, a Carbide attorney.
   The report did not provide a motive for sabotage or name the
worker believed responsible.
   But Holman said the company and the Indian government knew the
worker's identity, and it eventually would be revealed in court. He
said the worker wanted to punish a superior who had demoted him.
   Ashok Kalelkare, a senior vice president of Arthur D. Little,
based in Cambridge, Mass., presented the findings Tuesday to a
London symposium sponsored by the Institute of Chemical Engineers
of the United Kingdom.
   An Indian government attorney involved in the case on declined
comment on the report today, saying it would be ``improper while
we're in litigation.'' He insisted on anonymity.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Carbide
closed up 75 cents a share to $23.87{ on Tuesday.
   At least 2,850 people were killed and 20,000 injured when methyl
isocyanate gas leaked from a holding tank at Union Carbide India
Ltd.'s Bhopal plant on Dec. 3, 1984.
   More than 500,000 people have filed claims in the case and the
Indian government filed criminal charges against Carbide in
December.
   The Arthur D. Little report theorized that a worker entered the
plant's storage area during a shift change the night of Dec. 2,
1984, and hooked a rubber hose to the methyl isocyanate tank with
the intention of ruining the tank's contents.
   The chemical produces a deadly gas when mixed with water.
   ``The results of this investigation show, with virtual
certainty, that the Bhopal incident was caused by the entry of
water to the tank through a hose that had been connected directly
to the tank,'' the report stated. ``It is equally clear that those
most directly involved attempted to obfuscate these events.''
   The report was based on interviews with more than 70 former
employees of the now-closed plant.
   Among those interviewed was an unidentified instrument
supervisor who told investigators that the day after the disaster
he discovered a gauge on the chemical tank had been replaced with a
plug. Nearby, he also noticed a length of hose with water running
from it, the report said.
   The report theorized that the gauge was removed, the hose
inserted, and the hole filled with a plug once the water had been
added to the tank.
   The Indian government contends that water got into the chemical
tank when a worker failed to install a ``slip-blind,'' a device
that prevents water from backing up, while cleaning a filter about
400 feet away.
   But Arthur D. Little's report asserted the theory was
implausible for three reasons: the worker's hose pressure wasn't
high enough to raise the water to the level of the chemical tank; a
safety valve to prevent such a mishap was found in good working
order after the accident; and pipes that would have remained filled
with water after such an occurrence were dry.
   The report alleged that workers altered plant logs to hide that
they tried to drain the tank after realizing water had been added.
   The consultant's report was highly critical of the Indian
government, saying it stuck to the negligence theory despite
evidence to the contrary and hindered Union Carbide's ability to
discover what actually happened.
   The company finally got access to key plant records and through
them the names of plant employees when a U.S. magistrate ordered
India to produce copies of the documents as part of the civil suit
to which it was a party

   Tate and Lyle PLC said Wednesday it has extended
for one day its $1.38 billion takeover offer for Staley Continental
Inc. because of ongoing discussions with Staley over its
$35-per-share bid.
   Tate and Lyle said it would extend its offer to midnight
Wednesday New York time.
   Officials for Tate and Lyle and its merchant bank advisers
declined further comment on the move.
   The talks ``are at a delicate stage,'' said James Kerr Muir, a
Tate and Lyle spokesman.
   Staley, a U.S. sugar manufacturer, has contested the bid from
Tate and Lyle, a British sugar refiner and distributor. The
takeover move was first announced April 8.
   Tate and Lyle raised its bid to $35 a share on April 28 from an
original $32, a week after Staley's board of directors officially
rejected its initial approach.
   Tate and Lyle also has offered to buy Staley depository shares
for $53.15 each and preferred shares for $105.00 each.
   Tate and Lyle said it has increased its holdings of Staley
common stock to about 8.2 percent of the approximately 30 million
outstanding shares.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BMW of North America Inc. has recalled 1,256
four-wheel-drive 325iX cars to correct a possible defect that could
lead to a stuck throttle, the German car importer said.
   Owners were notified of the defect a month ago and most of the
cars have been repaired, including 400 that have yet to be sold and
were fixed at the port of entry, BMW spokesman Richard Brooks said
Tuesday.
   BMW said the cars' dipstick tube could be bent so that the
throttle can't move as far as it should and eventually could stick
either open or closed. On a car with the throttle stuck closed, the
engine won't run.
   Brooks said BMW has no reports of sticking throttles, nor of
accidents or injuries involving any of the cars, which were
introduced in November.

   The International Trade Commission plans to
impose import duties on forklift trucks allegedly ``dumped'' below
cost in the United States by Japanese manufacturers.
   In a unanimous ruling sought by Hyster Co. of Portland, Ore.,
the six-member commission said Tuesday that the U.S. forklift
industry had suffered ``material injury'' because of the Japanese
practices.
   The ruling means the importers of forklift trucks will have to
pay cash duties equal to the dumping margin on each Japanese
forklift they import. The Department of Commerce will determine the
dumping margins, with several expected to exceed 50 percent.
   The Commerce Department ruled last month that Japanese producers
had been dumping their forklifts in the United States. Japanese
manufacturers have not paid any duties since January 1986.
   In a petition filed in April 1987, Hyster and four labor unions
alleged that Japanese producers were using unfair tactics to claim
half of the U.S. market in small- to medium-capacity internal
combustion lift trucks.
   Such trucks comprise 70 percent of the U.S. market. List prices
range from $14,000 to $65,000.
   Hyster, along with the United Shop and Service Workers, the
Independent Lift Truck Builders Union, the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the
International Union, Allied Industrial Workers of America, claimed
the dumping practices were costing thousands of jobs in the United
States.
   ``We have placed the Japanese producers on notice that open
trade policies of the United States should not be abused through
illegal pricing and market-grabbing strategies,'' said William H.
Kilkenny, Hyster's chairman.
   ``We are hopeful that the element of fairness will return to our
U.S. marketplace,'' he said.
   Among the Japanese manufacturers affected by the ruling are
Kasagi, Komatsu, Nissan, Sanki, Sumitomo, Toyo Umpanki and Toyota.

   The stock market started off sharply lower in
active trading today, as share prices were hit by growing anxiety
about the prospect of higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 19.07 points at
1,984.58 at 10 a.m. EDT. The broader market also showed deep
losses. Declining stocks surpassed advancers by 6-to-1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 643 issues losing, only 151 gaining and
334 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board in the first half-hour of trading was
38.68 million shares.
   The nervousness about higher interest rates was fueled today by
comments by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson that
there could be an internationally coordinated boost in rates.
   Lawson, who made the comments in an interview with the Wall
Street Journal's overseas editions that was published today, noted
that a coordinated effort by West Germany, Japan and other leading
nations to hike interest rates ``is certainly possible'' following
the Federal Reserve's increase in short-term rates to curb U.S.
inflation.
   Separately, White House economist Beryl Sprinkel confirmed that
the Federal Reserve has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks.
He defended the move as making sense in the face of a strong
economy and recent growth in the money supply.
   The statements sent stock prices tumbling in Tokyo early today,
as the key 225-share Nikkei Index fell 251.20 points, or 0.92
percent, to close at 27,161.05.
   Share prices also headed lower in London and Frankfurt, West
Germany, before Wall Street opened for trading.
   The NYSE's composite index was down 1.48 at 144.27.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had lost
2.00 at 297.81.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones average settled at 2,003.65, up 6.30
points.
   Gainers edged out decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, with
745 up, 713 down and 507 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 131.2 million shares, compared
with 166.32 million on Monday.

<TEXT>
   The British government on Wednesday formally
agreed to contribute to a new lending facility of the International
Monetary Fund.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson indicated last December
that Britain would subsidize one-sixth of the total lending of the
so-called Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. Wednesday
morning, he exchanged letters finalizing Britain's contribution
with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus.
   Britain's subsidy is the largest announced by any country, and
will amount to $76 million a year by the mid-1990s, the Treasury
said.
   The United States is the only major IMF member that has not
agreed yet to contribute to the facility. A decision by the United
States has been delayed by budget talks.
   The facility was created to provide increased lending to
low-income countries undertaking economic adjustment programs. The
loans would be available at an extremely concessional interest rate
of 0.5 percent, and repayment of the principal of a loan would
begin 5 1-2 years after its disbursement and end 10 years later.

   British Airways wants to fly the supersonic
Concorde to Atlanta as part of its regularly scheduled service.
   ``I can't tell you when because I would then be in the position
of asking permission to do it. It will happen, but you won't know
it because it will drive in quietly,'' British Airways chairman,
Lord John King, told a British American Business Group luncheon
Tuesday.
   ``The plan would be to link (Atlanta) up with the Washington
service,'' King said.
   The tentative plan calls for three Concorde flights a week from
London to Washington to Atlanta. The airline now flies the Concorde
twice daily from London to New York and three times a week from
Miami to Washington to London.
   Atlanta would be a major new gateway for British Airways, King
said. He said he believes Atlanta could support Concorde service.
British Airways has seven of the supersonic planes.
   The Atlanta to London flight, with a stop in Washington,
probably would take about 5{ hours, according to British Airways
spokesman John Lampl. The fare probably would be around $6,000.
   That compares with current non-stop service from Atlanta to
London, an eight-hour flight which costs $677, if tickets are
purchased 21 days in advance.

<HEAD>Bank Failure Rate Could Reach Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bad loan portfolios in Texas have prompted the
state's banking chief to increase projections on the number of 1988
bank failures from 50 to 70.
   ``Bank failures have not subsided during the first part of 1988
and, in fact, are running ahead of last year's pace,'' said Texas
Banking Commissioner Kenneth Littlefield. ``We have not seen a
turnaround.''
   Last year, 50 Texas banks failed to set a national record. So
far this year, 23 have failed. Another 179 state-chartered banks
are on the regulators' problem list and Littlefield said Tuesday
that few will last until the state economy makes a rebound.
   He blamed troubled real estate loans for accelerating the
closure rates. In addition, he said problem assets are squeezing
net interest margins and forcing losses for the banks.
   But if the banks sell off those assets in a falling market, it
could mean even more losses as the banks absorb the difference
between the book and market values.
   ``A good number of Texas banks are in an almost helpless
situation,'' said Littlefield, who is encouraging federal aid for
banks rather than closing the institutions. ``Through more
aggressive use of open-bank assistance, much can be done (to help)
the smaller banks.''
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported Texas banks lost
almost $2 billion in 1987 and had $12.63 billion in bad loans and
repossed properties at the end of the year _ a 44 percent increase
over 1986.
   FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said owners of failing banks often
don't ask for assistance because they feel their case is hopeless.
Whitney said FDIC is working to merge failing banks to pay off
depositors.
   Of the 23 Texas failures, 13 were merged with other banks.

<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. will eliminate 800 managerial
and professional jobs from its U.S. Marketing Group, but expects to
be able to shift displaced employees to other positions in the
group, a company spokesman said.
   The job cuts are being made only in areas that do not have
direct contact with customers, such as public relations, said Xerox
spokesman John Rasor.
   The cutback is part of a companywide effort to reduce expenses
and then invest in areas that directly serve the customer, Rasor
said.
   Workers whose jobs are eliminated will initially fill jobs now
available because of a hiring freeze that has been in effect
throughout the group, which sells and services the company's
copiers.
   A. Barry Rand, the group's president, said Tuesday that layoffs
would be a last resort and that no one who takes another job with
the company will take a pay cut.
   The U.S. Marketing Group, headquartered in Rochester, employs
about 2,600 people here, and about 27,500 throughout the United
States. The cutback will affect 675 jobs in Rochester and 125 at
other locations, Rasor said.

<NOTE>Eds: updates with company announcement</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WARREN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Steel Co. today said it has signed a
contract to sell its steel plant in Warren to the Renco Group Inc.
of New York City.
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed in the company's
announcement.
   Included in the sale is LTV's Republic Drainage Products Co. in
Canton and its six plants, the company said.
   The Cleveland-based LTV Steel said completion of the sale is
targeted for June 30 and is subject to the approval of U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York, which has jurisdiction over LTV
Corp.'s reorganization proceedings.
   In 1986, the Dallas-based LTV Corp., parent company of LTV
Steel, filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code.
   LTV announced last November that it wanted to sell or find a
business partner for its Warren plant, which is the largest steel
mill remaining in the Mahoning Valley. The plant has about 2,200
employees.
   LTV described the Renco Group as a privately held concern with
15 diversified manufacturing and distribution operations nationwide.
   All employees at the Warren plant and the Republic Drainage
plants, including management, are expected to be retained, LTV said.
   LTV's coke plant in Warren is not included in the sale and will
continue to be part of LTV Steel, the company said.
   LTV President David H. Hoag said repairs to the Warren blast
furnace will be completed as scheduled later this summer.
   ``We believe this sale of the Warren Works and the drainage
products plants is in the best interest of LTV Steel, the affected
employees and local communities. We urge the employees, their
unions and the communities of the Mahoning Valley to extend their
welcome and cooperation to Renco as it becomes a major employer and
force in the local economy,'' Hoag said in a statement.
   U.S. Rep. James A. Traficant, D-Ohio, said he was informed of
the sales this morning by LTV officials. Traficant represents the
Mahoning Valley area.
   ``The good news is that they will retain all management and
hourly workers,'' said Traficant. ``The questionable news however
is that the group has very limited activity in the steel industry.
However, our local people have turned the plant around and made it
profitable.''
   Hoag said last fall that the sale would fit in with the
company's plans to concentrate its operations and capital
investment primarily in three flat-rolled facilities in Cleveland,
East Chicago, Ind., and Hennepin, Ill.
   The Warren plant has an annual raw steel production capacity of
1.5 million tons, the company said. It produces hot and cold rolled
sheet and strip steel, hot-dipped galvanized sheet steel, silicon
steel and terne plate.
   Republic Drainage buys half of the zinc-coated steel shiopped
out of the Warren Works. Republic Drainage employs 150 people at
plants in Canton; Owego, N.Y.; Charlotte, N.C.; Harrisburg, Pa.;
Bristol, Tenn. and Seneca, S.C.

<HEAD>Chrysler union withdrawing suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers Local 72 is withdrawing
a suit seeking to prevent Chrysler Corp. and the city of Detroit
from using federal money to move subcompact car production from
Kenosha to Detroit, the local's bargaining chief said.
   ``We're going to drop that one,'' Rudy Kuzel said Tuesday.
   ``They (company negotiators) asked for that because of some of
the economics they were compelled to give us. The lawsuit was a
bargaining chip.''
   The union lawsuit filed in February charged that Chrysler and
Detroit were illegally using a federal grant to remodel Chrysler's
Detroit plant for work it planned to move this July from Kenosha.
   Chrysler since has announced it will build the subcompact cars
in Kenosha until the end of the year, when it will stop all auto
assembly and stamping operations at Kenosha.
   Kuzel said Chrysler agreed to increased pension and other
monetary benefits for about 6,500 hourly workers and 8,000 retirees
because it did not want to risk $50 million in federal money it
would have lost had the union suit in U.S. District Court been
successful.
   The contract, which is to cover about 5,500 workers Chrysler
intends to lay off or retire at the end of the year, and about 900
hourly workers it will retain in its engine division, gives workers
severance and retirement options.
   Chrysler also has promised to keep the engine division at
Kenosha open for four years from Sept. 15, when the local contract
becomes effective.
   The portion of the contract that governs those who will be laid
off is a two-year agreement, Kuzel said in outlining the pact
Tuesday for union members who were to vote on it today.
   The contract proposal calls for return of $8,000 to $10,000 owed
each worker under an employee investment plan used to help then
financially-strapped American Motors Corp.
   Kuzel said workers would get the money back over two years but
would not get any interest or bonus payments. That would amount to
a total of about $58 million. Chrysler bought AMC last year.
   Kuzel said Chrysler also added $5 million to a $15 million job
bank fund that will be used to pay full wages to eligible workers
as long as the money lasts.
   The proposal also calls for payments of about $100 a week to
each laid-off worker under the union's supplemental unemployment
benefit fund.

   The bow-tied bunny still stands for sexy female
centerfolds, lively interviews and men's fashion tips, but behind
the flagship magazine a pragmatic new philosophy is emerging at
Playboy Enterprises Inc.
   Gone are the company-owned key clubs and casinos, the luxurious
Chicago mansion and the Big Bunny jetliner _ trappings that
reflected and reinforced founder Hugh Hefner's hedonistic image.
   In their place, Hefner's daughter, Christie, is building a
leaner organization that, while more fiscally sound, is decidedly
more staid _ right down to its recent acquisition of the Sarah
Coventry jewelry line.
   In six years as company president, the 35-year-old Ms. Hefner
has pared Playboy to its core of publishing, licensing and video
businesses. The proof of her pruning shows up on the bottom line:
profits in the past seven quarters.
   She took charge of a company that was reeling from the loss of
lucrative casino licenses in Great Britain, denial of permission to
operate a casino in Atlantic City, N.J., declining magazine sales
and a faltering cable television channel.
   Under her leadership, Playboy has closed the last of its
company-owned key clubs and disposed of its interests in movie
theaters, modeling and book and record clubs.
   ``The entire management team headed by Christie has repositioned
the company to the point where profitability is now the norm and
the potential for the future is probably brighter than at any time
in the last several years,'' said investment banker David Leibowitz
of American Securities Corp.
   Having righted and steadied the ship, Ms. Hefner is charting a
course for Playboy that partially follows the successful example of
an unlikely model: the Walt Disney Co.
   Just as Disney formed Touchstone Pictures and Buena Vista
Syndication to make and distribute movies with uncharacteristically
adult themes, Playboy hopes to expand by escaping its traditional
image.
   ``In our case it's sort of the flip side of Disney,'' Ms. Hefner
said in a recent interview.
   ``We make products for adults and under the Playboy name they
have a particular aura that is sexy and fun,'' she said. ``That's
an aura that works for certain products but not for others. If we
want to be able to expand as a licensor or publisher or video-film
creator, we'd like to be able to do that without the Playboy name
as a restriction.''
   So in addition to its array of Playboy and Playmate brand
videotapes, casual apparel, jewelry and accessories, the company
plans to become a distributor of similar products that will not
carry the Playboy name or bunny emblem _ and theoretically will
have a broader appeal.
   ``It's the mass market, that middle market, that's of most
interest to us,'' Ms. Hefner said.
   The first move in that direction was Playboy's quiet acquisition
of Sarah Coventry in November through its neutrally named new
subsidiary, Licensing Unlimited Inc.
   The new strategy doesn't mean the Playboy trademark has outlived
its usefulness. Playboy magazine, with an average paid circulation
last year of more than 3.6 million, is still the company's
strongest suit, though circulation may never again approach the
1972 zenith of 7.2 million.
   The magazine survived a government crackdown on pornography and
a ban by 7-Eleven stores in 1986, and contributed more than $98
million to Playboy's 1987 revenues of $162 million. Sales of video
products, including the revamped Playboy Channel and video
centerfolds, added about $29 million, followed by $23 million from
other publications and $10.5 million from licensing and
merchandising.
   Although the Playboy Channel has had trouble holding
subscribers, the company maintains high hopes for its video unit,
which just released its first Playmate video in eight months thanks
to a new distribution deal with HBO Video.
   Playboy's $11 million profit in 1987 and strong performance in
the first nine months of the current fiscal year followed a $62
million loss in 1986. Before turning profits in 1984 and '85, the
company had notched a string of losses stretching back to the first
quarter of fiscal 1982, the year Ms. Hefner took over.
   ``In the early years after I took over we were of necessity
mostly engaged in the business of closing down business, selling
off businesses and solving old problems,'' she said.
   ``In the last few years I've been much more able to put my mark
on the company and that's coincided with my father's desire to be
much less involved in the operations of the company.''
   Hefner, who lives in the Los Angeles Playboy Mansion, reduced
his involvement in the company after suffering a stroke about three
years ago. He retains the titles of chairman and chief executive
officer, still approves every Playboy magazine cover and centerfold
shot, and provides ``creative input'' on the home-video products.
   While she speaks admiringly of her father, whom she calls
``Hef,'' Ms. Hefner said the company he built into one of the great
business successes of the 1960s ran into trouble in the 1980s
because it hadn't kept pace with changing attitudes about leisure
time.
   Some analysts also blame her father's preoccupations.
   ``He (Hefner) spent more time supervising the photo sessions for
the centerfolds than he did reading the balance sheets of his
company,'' said Dan Lee of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   Hef's daughter, in contrast, is an active, thoroughly involved
boss. Described by Robyn Radomski, Playboy's chief spokeswoman, as
demanding and energetic, Ms. Hefner said she shares her father's
enthusiasm for business but not his penchant for pajama-clad
hobnobbing with the jet set.
   ``What I like to do is have the chance to speak to the National
Press Club or lecture on a case study on my management style at the
Harvard Business School or host a dinner party for high-level
prospective investors,'' she said.
   An honors graduate of Brandeis University with a degree in
English and American literature, Ms. Hefner joined Playboy in 1975
after working for a year as a journalist for the Boston Phoenix, a
weekly newspaper.
   Her parents divorced when she was 3 years old. Her mother,
Mildred, remarried and Christie used her stepfather's name, Gunn,
until 1973, when she renewed her relationship with her father and
took back the Hefner name.
   Ms. Hefner, who lives within walking distance of Playboy
headquarters, said she splits her working time between company
offices in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, where her boyfriend,
a television executive, resides.
   Ms. Hefner calls herself ``a business person, first and
foremost'' and a feminist.
   ``I realized many years ago that there would be some people out
there who would never be satisfied with what I did,'' she said.
   ``My mission in life is not to change everybody in the world. My
mission in life is to make the best of this extraordinary
opportunity and believe, as I do, that the vast majority of people
will judge me honestly and objectively.''

<DATELINE>SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every morning for the past seven or
eight years, a half-dozen men have met for coffee and cigarettes at
the oval table in the rear of Spring Hill's only restaurant, Poplar
House.
   The ``Roundtable,'' as the group of contractors and builders is
sometimes called, has watched with skepticism as the sleepy
Southern town prepares for its transformation into a regional
automaking center.
   Spring Hill, population 1,100, is the home of General Motors
Corp.'s multibillion-dollar Saturn plant, which is scheduled to
begin producing cars in 1990.
   But whether the investment is paying adequate dividends for
Spring Hill is a question that still sparks debate over morning
coffee here.
   Saturn is located in a kind of never-never land, on 2,450 acres
that are not taxed by any county, town or state government and that
officially lie in no town.
   ``It is its own empire,'' said James Brewer, a 68-year-old
engineer who has lived in Spring Hill for 40 years and is an
acknowledged leader of the ``Roundtable.''
   Brewer thinks Spring Hill is missing its chances to cash in on
the growth Saturn will bring to the area once its 3,000 employees
begin work.
   He abhors Mayor George Jones' efforts to toughen development
laws, which impose impact fees on new building and make it harder
for developers to erect fast-food restaurants, convenience stores
and the like.
   One regulation that particularly bothers Brewer is a new
ordinance that restricts the size of business signs to 2 feet by 2
feet.
   Everyone agrees they want to ensure their quality of life, but
to Brewer, quality of life includes fast food and the fast
development that has been experienced by other Southern boom towns.
   ``They're not doing anything to encourage people,'' Brewer said
of the town's stance toward developers.
   To the mayor, quality of life comes with controlled growth. For
example, he views the erratic building that has occurred around
Nashville in the past 10 years as incompatible with Spring Hill's
goals. If prepared, Spring Hill can avoid the overburdened roads
and services that frustrate Nashville residents, Jones said.
   GM announced in 1985 that it would build a $5 billion plant in
Spring Hill as a joint venture with the United Auto Workers. The
state, anxious to land the plant, promised to build a $50 million
highway to the town and provide $20 million to train workers the
plant would need.
   Almost all the Saturn employees will be UAW members who were
laid off in other states by GM.
   In return, Saturn agreed to make payments in lieu of taxes to
Maury County, which distributes money to neighboring towns.
   Land speculation cooled somewhat when GM said it would halve its
planned production at the plant to 250,000 cars a year. In fact,
more homes were built in 1980, before Saturn arrived, than in 1987.
But for every fallow field in Spring Hill there is a realtor's sign
advertising its availability, and even the skeptics admit the place
is bound to change as the startup date for Saturn nears.
   Within two years, the town will probably be unrecognizable.
Developers have begun submitting plans to build tracts of homes for
the newcomers. The largest proposal yet, by developer Howell R.
Pettigrew of Arlington, Texas, proposes building about 3,100
multifamily homes and 1,000 single-family homes on 11,000 acres off
the Saturn Parkway over a 20-year period.
   Pettigrew also plans to develop 195 acres for commercial use and
270 acres for industrial use, said Steve Campbell, who is working
on the proposal for Pettigrew.
   ``It's advanced Spring Hill probably 10 to 20 years already,''
Mayor Jones said of Saturn's effect on the town.
   The town has advanced, in Jones' view, by increasing its police
force from two to seven full-time officers, by building a town hall
to grow into and by updating its zoning regulations.
   The $1.2 million town hall, built with money from Saturn, moved
out of its one-room trailer (which was also donated by Saturn) to a
building on a 165-acre complex on a hill off Main Street. Called
``The Town Center at Spring Hill,'' the development eventually will
feature restaurants, stores and multifamily homes.
   Despite such plans, contractor Ray Williams is among those who
believe Spring Hill is chasing away developers by requiring them to
pay impact fees for services.
   ``The only thing I've ever built in Spring Hill is my house and
that'll probably be the only thing I ever build,'' Williams said.
   Williams, like Brewer, believes landowners should be able to do
as they please with their land. Farmers ``don't want people telling
them what to do,'' said Williams.
   Zoning regulations, such as the one governing sign size,
discourage prosperity, he said.
   ``Everybody in the country wants to go to Las Vegas to see those
signs, but who in the hell wants to go to Spring Hill?''
   Spring Hill resident Don Hickman, an engineer with South Central
Bell, is one who views the slow lurch into the future gladly.
   ``In the long term, Spring Hill will be a very attractive place
to live because of the strict zoning laws. We're not faced with the
tenement type projects,'' he said.
   ``We may have some lean years in Spring Hill, but in the long
run it's going to pay off.''

<HEAD>Saturn: Top Secret Import Weapon</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Saturn-Spring Hill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturing site for the Saturn
car lies between the towns of Spring Hill and Columbia, obscured
from view by a manmade rolling hillside bordered by a bright white
picket fence.
   After Saturn arrived, both towns annexed land as close to the
plant as possible, to take advantage of the housing and commercial
development that will follow the completion of a new parkway to the
plant.
   Despite their neighborly proximity, townspeople know little
about what goes on inside the compound. Saturn officials say the
town wanted them to place the plant out of view, while their
neighbors occasionally grumble that they are being intentionally
shut out.
   But Saturn is intended to be a mystery, a successful top-secret
weapon against import cars. General Motors Corp., which funds
Saturn as a subsidiary rather than a division of the company,
expects the plant to turn a profit immediately, said Laurie Kay, a
spokeswoman for Saturn.
   Almost a fourth of the plant has been completed since
construction began in June 1987. Saturn plans to offer a family of
Saturn cars _ subcompact and compacts _ in 1990 for the 1991 model
year, Ms. Kay said.
   State legislators who visited the sprawling site in March viewed
the half-completed powertrain building where car engines and
transmissions will be built. Construction also has begun on three
other buildings where cars will be assembled and painted before
rolling off the line.
   Part of the plan to make Saturn competitive with imports
involves approaching production work differently, and Saturn
officials _ along with their partners in the venture,
representatives of the United Auto Workers union _ are adopting
management techniques developed by the Japanese, said Ms. Kay.
   Employees will be involved in all aspects of production, from
understanding the cost of supplies to sales, she said.
   They will be on salaries rather than the traditional hourly wage
rates, with 20 percent of their pay based on the performance of the
company, Ms. Kay said.
   Saturn jobs will first be offered to the estimated 300,000 UAW
members who have been laid off around the United States by GM, said
Ms. Kay. About 6,000 people have applied for the 3,000 jobs that
are to be filled by mid-1989.
   The plant is designed to produce 250,000 cars a year initially.
GM plans to increase production, depending on the auto's reception
by car buyers.
   Saturn has begun reviewing about 1,700 applications for a
network of dealerships, which are expected to reach 123 cities by
the end of the first model year.
   Saturn has sent employees to Japan to study Japanese automaking
procedures, as well as to Germany, said Ms. Kay.
   ``We're looking very hard at everything. We're not inventing
everything,'' she said.
   ``We are taking a fresh look at what we do.''

<HEAD>Soybeans Open Sharply Higher; Grains Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices opened sharply higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to the Agriculture
Department's latest supply-and-demand estimates. Grain futures were
mixed.
   The soybean market's early gains of as much as 9{ cents a bushel
were expected after the USDA revised downward its estimate of the
U.S. soybean stockpile, predicting stocks would dwindle from 275
million bushels on this Aug. 31 to 145 million bushels a year later.
   The USDA also reduced its estimate for this year's Brazilian
soybean harvest to 17.6 million metric tons from 18 million metric
tons.
   ``This adds to the general feeling or perception that soybean
stocks are shrinking very quickly,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst
in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   The USDA report, issued Tuesday afternoon, was considered
neutral for corn futures, which opened slightly higher, and was
construed as somewhat bearish for wheat.
   The government predicted this year's winter wheat harvest would
be about 4 percent larger than last year's and that prediction
weighed on wheat futures this morning, Spilka said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.01{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to
1 cent higher with May at $1.99} a bushel; oats were \ cent lower
to \ cent higher with May at $1.62 a bushel; soybeans were 6{ cents
to 9{ cents higher with May at $7.14 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower and pork futures were higher in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .37 cent lower with June at 782.80
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .232 cent lower to .65 cent
higher with May at 79.97 cents a pound; hogs were .17 cent to .53
cent higher with June at 51.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .35 cent to .53 cent higher with May at 51.85 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Tuesday.

   The stock market was holding steady at sharply
lower levels at around midday today, weakened by investors' anxiety
about the prospect of higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 39.96 points at
1,963.69 at noon EDT, close to its level of an hour earlier but
widened from its initial losses.
   The broader market also showed deep declines. Losing stocks
outstripped advancers by about 6-to-1 on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 1,269 issues losing, only 182 gaining and 372
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board was 103.35 million shares, up from 61.95
million traded by the same time on Tuesday.
   The anxiety about higher interest rates was fueled today by
comments by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson that
there could be an internationally coordinated boost in rates.
   Lawson, who made the comments in an interview with the Wall
Street Journal's overseas editions that was published today, noted
that a coordinated effort by West Germany, Japan and other leading
nations to hike interest rates ``is certainly possible'' following
the Federal Reserve's increase in short-term rates to curb U.S.
inflation.
   Separately, White House economist Beryl Sprinkel confirmed that
the Fed has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks. He defended
the move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recent
growth in the money supply.
   Some observers and market players expect the Fed to raise its
key discount rate, the interest it charges big financial
institutions, possibly this week.
   Market analysts point out that hauntingly similar jitters about
rising interest rates were a big factor behind October's stock
collapse, and those memories are still fresh in the minds of
nervous investors.
   ``The major problem with the stock market has been the rise in
rates,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   The NYSE's composite index was down 2.20 at 143.55.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had lost
3.97 at 295.84.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Con Edison was down \

General Electric had lost { at 39 and Philips Petroleum was down \

<TEXT>
   Former Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan
called on Congress today to ban index arbitrage trading, saying the
computer-driven transactions are undermining public confidence in
the stock market.
   ``I don't think it's too extreme to say that overall confidence
in our free market system is threatened by this sort of scandal,''
Regan told the Senate Banking Committee. ``And that's what it is _
a scandal.''
   Regan, former chief executive of Wall Street's Merrill Lynch &
Co., has been the focus of attention recently for a book he has
written on his years as White House chief of staff under President
Reagan. Most attention has been drawn to his revelation that First
Lady Nancy Reagan regularly consulted an astrologer about the
president's schedule.
   Before Regan spoke, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., read Regan's
horoscope to him, which said that he could not ``force colleagues
to be more understanding'' until May 17.
   Regan did not respond, but said later that his testimony ``comes
at an interesting time in terms of my own personal activities.''
   Regan said that program trading is ``fundamentally changing and
endangering the basis on which our economy and stock market have
functioned for generations.''
   He said that although individuals still own most stocks,
institutions in recent years have dominated trading.
   ``If the public feels that the markets are rigged, not only in
favor of the big guy, but also in favor of some unidentified
computer-based trading strategy, then confidence in our markets,
indeed in our system, will plummet,'' Regan said.
   Regan called on the nation's financial markets and the federal
agencies that regulate them to impose their own restrictions on
program trading.
   In index arbitrage, traders use computers to profit from price
discrepancies between the stock and futures markets by
simultaneously buying in one market and selling in the other.
   At the same hearing, Charles R. Schwab, who heads his own
discount brokerage firm, said program trading should be totally
abolished.
   ``The individual investor in this country is angry,'' Schwab
said. ``Most of all, he is angry about Washington's failure to
enact reforms needed to promote greater stability in the securities
markets.''
   Regan and Schwab's comments came a day after five big Wall
Street firms announced they have halted index arbitrage trading for
their own accounts as a means of restoring investor confidence in
the stock market.
   However, Leo Melamed, chairman of the executive committee of the
board of governors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, defended
index arbitrage today at a breakfast meeting with reporters in
Washington.
   He acknowledged that some individual investors believe program
trading destabilizes the market, but he maintained that index
arbitrage does just the opposite because it ensurse that stock and
futures prices closely track each other.
   ``I'm not going to defend perception,'' he said. ``The reality
is it is not a factor (in the volatility). Index arbitrage was and
is a stabilizing factor.''
   ``I don't believe there's many individual investors who
understand the issue,'' he added.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange trades the most popular futures
contract, which is based on the Standard and Poor's 500.

<HEAD>Woolworth, Wal-Mart Report Strong First Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   F.W. Woolworth Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., two bright spots in
a mostly dismal first quarter for the retailing industry, on
Wednesday reported robust increases in their earnings for the
period.
   Woolworth said its net income for the three months ended April
30 totaled $35 million, or 54 cents per share, up nearly 21 percent
from $29 million, or 43 cents per share, in the first three months
of fiscal 1987.
   Sales rose to $1.71 billion from $1.53 billion.
   The first quarter of the retail fiscal year was a disappointment
for many storeowners as consumers continued to spend cautiously.
Woolworth's sales dipped more than 5 percent in April, but the
company fared better than most of the other big retailers in the
first two months of the year.
   Wal-Mart saw no letdown in its business during the quarter.
   The rapidly-expanding discount chain reported earnings of $153.6
million, or 27 cents a share, up nearly 40 percent from $110.4
million, or 19 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1987.
   Sales totaled $4.28 billion, up from $3.21 billion.
   Woolworth is believed to be a possible takeover target for Dart
Group Corp., which recently asked for federal permission to acquire
up to 15 percent of Woolworth stock. Dart has not yet made a bid
for Woolworth.
   Woolworth operates Woolworth general merchandise stores and
specialty retailers including Kinney Shoe, Foot Locker and Lady
Foot Locker.
   Wal-Mart operates more than 1,200 discount stores in 24 states.

<HEAD>Small Companies Outperformed Big Business, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies with fewer than 100 workers increased
employment at a faster rate than large businesses during the latter
half of 1987, but the number of new small firms decreased sharply
during the period, according to a study released Wednesday.
   Employment among small companies rose by 1.9 percent during the
last six months of 1987, compared with an increase of 0.6 percent
for larger businesses, a study by the American Express Small
Business Partnership showed.
   The partnership charts small business growth based on data from
7 million companies with fewer than 100 employees.
   During the latter half of 1987, new small business
incorporations plunged 7.71 percent.
   Sales of small business goods and services increased by 1.06
percent during the period, compared with an increase of 0.13
percent for their larger counterparts. The rate is down, however,
from the 1.27 percent increase in sales small businesses reported
during the first half of 1987.
   David Birch, who heads the small business partnership, noted
that small businesses ``held up well during this uncertain economic
period.''
   He noted that the first half of 1987 was ``a period of
uncharacteristically high levels of new business start-ups,'' and
therefore any decline in the latter half ``should be considered in
context.''
   Small businesses in the Pacific states posted the greatest
growth, with employment up 2.26 percent and sales up 1.52 percent.
Those in the South Atlantic region had the highest gain in
employment, which rose 2.31 percent, and a 1.25 percent increase in
sales.

<TEXT>
   Stock prices closed sharply lower Wednesday as
players dumped shares amid fears of higher interest rates.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed down
35.8 points, or 2 percent, at 1,756.8.
   Volume was a hefty 575.5 million shares, compared with Tuesday's
397.5 million.
   Stock prices opened lower as the market bearishly interpreted a
comment from Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson that major
industrialized nations might coordinate a worldwide hike in
interest rates.
   The comment, published in European editions of the Wall Street
Journal, pressured London for most of the session.
   During the day, the newspaper issued a statement saying it had
failed to fully report Lawson's remarks.
   Meanwhile, Chase Manhattan Bank boosted its prime lending rate a
half percentage point to 9 percent, the first increase since just
before the stock market crash in October.
   However, Charles Larkham, an equity analyst with the London
investment firm James Capel and Co. Ltd., said: ``We don't think
it's the beginning of a major lurch lower'' in stock prices.
   Another dealer said the rampant takeover talk that had fueled
the London market over the last month had run out of steam.
   ``The market had been spoiling for a sell-off for quite some
time and when no takeover bids panned out,'' players liquidated
their positions, he said.
   A lower finish in Tokyo earlier Wednesday added to the downward
pressure, several analysts said.
   A few bargain hunters were spotted late in the day attempting to
take advantage of the sharply lower prices, but the market failed
to make a significant turnaround, dealers said.
   ``Prices didn't have the stomach to bounce back by the end of
the day as they did Tuesday,'' one dealer said.

   Share prices dropped on Wall Street today, as
anxiety about the prospect for higher interest rates was heightened
by a rise in the prime lending rate by two major banks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 44.27 points at
1,959.38 at 2 p.m. EDT, widened from its losses earlier in the
session.
   The broader market also showed deep declines. Losing stocks
outstripped advancers by about 7-to-1 on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 1,375 issues losing, only 200 gaining and 336
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board was 138.82 million shares.
   Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank boosted their prime rates by a
half percentage point to 9 percent. They were the first increases
in the prime since just before October's stock market collapse.
   Chase was the first big bank to raise the key rate, which is
watched closely because bankers use it as a base rate for loans to
many businesses and for consumer loans, including mortgages.
Chase's move was announced around noon today after Wall Street had
already sustained sharp losses on interest-rate fears.
   ``It tends to reduce confidence in the stock market,'' said Hugh
Johnson, senior vice president of First Albany Corp. in Albany,
N.Y., referring to the increase in the prime rate.
   Higher interest rates, by raising the cost of borrowing, tend to
dampen companies' expansion plans and investments.
   The hike in the prime came against a background of growing
edginess about the outlook for interest rates.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson indicated
earlier today that there could be an internationally coordinated
boost in rates.
   Lawson, who made the comments in an interview with the Wall
Street Journal's overseas editions that was published today, noted
that a coordinated effort by West Germany, Japan and other leading
nations to hike interest rates ``is certainly possible'' following
the Federal Reserve's increase in short-term rates to curb U.S.
inflation.
   Separately, White House economist Beryl Sprinkel confirmed that
the Fed has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks. He defended
the move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recent
growth in the money supply.
   Some observers and market players expect the Fed to raise its
key discount rate, the interest it charges big financial
institutions, possibly this week.
   The NYSE's composite index was down 2.59 at 143.16.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
dropped 4.72 to 295.09.

<HEAD>Brazil Nearer Agreement With Banks Over Debt, Banker Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Brazilian delegation seeking to renegotiate
debt repayments may be able to reach a preliminary agreement with a
committee of international banks soon, the bank panel's chairman
says.
   According to Citicorp, William R. Rhodes, a bank official who is
chairman of the 14-bank committee, said in a speech Tuesday in
Washington that the committee had ``reached preliminary agreement
on nearly all major items'' in the talks. He said he expected an
overall agreement within ``a week or two,'' but added it could take
longer.
   Under negotiation is a $62 billion debt-restructuring package _
the largest ever undertaken _ which would cover more than half of
Brazil's $112 billion foreign debt.
   According to the text of his speech, Rhodes said that if a final
agreement could be worked out, it ``would bring Brazil fully
current on interest payments to commercial banks.''
   ``For the past month,'' Rhodes told the Council of the Americas
in Washington, ``I have been estimating that we would complete our
negotiations on a preliminary agreement within a week or so. We're
breaking new ground in some areas, which makes predictions on
timing difficult. However, we are very close.''
   Rhodes said the negotiators were working on stretching out
payments due on $62 million in debt over the next 20 years rather
than the eight years called for under the original loans.
   The points agreed to so far, Rhodes said, include new loans
totaling $5.2 billion to cover Brazilian external financing for
1987 through the first half of 1989.
   He said the World Bank's participation in the package will be
significant and the most extensive since the package negotiated
with Mexico in 1986 and will include substantial co-financing of
commercial bank loans.
   Rhodes noted that ``Brazil has been the focal point of the debt
crisis for the last year or so,'' beginning with its moratorium on
interest payments to commercials banks declared in February 1987.
   He said that ``some economists estimate that the moratorium cost
the country at least one to two billion dollars'' when the banks
retaliated by cutting off short-term credits and taking other
measures.

<HEAD>Royal-Dutch Shell Quarterly Profit Jumps 18.4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Companies, the world's
biggest oil concern, said Wednesday its net profit rose 18.4
percent in the first quarter from a year ago.
   Royal Dutch-Shell said earnings from its marine, marketing and
chemicals businesses improved but that exploration and production
earnings were down due to the combination of lower crude oil
prices, reduced natural gas sales and the strengthening of sterling
against the dollar.
   It said its net profit increased to 822 million pounds in the
first three months of 1987 from 694 million pounds in the same
period a year ago.
   Using average rates of exchange over the respective quarters,
that worked out to $1.48 billion, vs. $1.07 billion in the first
three months of 1987.
   Special items affecting the latest quarterly earnings were a
gain of 106 million pounds, or $200 million, from the sale of a
Hong Kong property and estimated after-tax inventory losses of 78
million pounds, or $147 million.
   The year-earlier period included inventory gains of 92 million
pounds, or $174 million dollars, Royal Dutch said.
   British companies' accounting method cannot be directly compared
to the method used by American companies, because of differences in
determining the value of inventories.
   Using the American method, Royal Dutch-Shell said, its net
profit spurted 49.5 percent to 900 million pounds, or $1.7 billion,
from 602 million pounds, or $1.14 billion.
   Royal Dutch-Shell, which is based in The Hague, the Netherlands,
and in London, said sales fell 5.2 percent to 13.63 billion pounds,
or $24.9 billion from 14.37 billion pounds.
   In dollars, that worked out to $24.9 billion in the latest
quarter, when the pound was stronger than the dollar, vs. $22.13
billion, in the year-ago period, when it was weaker.
   Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., the Dutch arm, controls 60 percent of
the company. Shell Transport and Trading Co. PLC, the group's
British arm, controls the remaining 40 percent.
   ``The outlook for exploration and production earnings depends on
whether the increases seen in crude oil prices since early March
can be sustained, despite recurring volatility,'' Royal Dutch-Shell
said in a statement.

<HEAD>Soybeans Soar On USDA Data; Grain Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to the
Agriculture Department's latest supply and demand report. Grain
futures retreated slightly.
   The surge in soybean prices was expected after the USDA, in a
report issued Tuesday afternoon, predicted the U.S. soybean
stockpile would dwindle from 275 million bushels this Aug. 31 to
145 million bushels a year later.
   The USDA also reduced its estimate for this year's Brazilian
soybean harvest from 18 million metric tons to 17.6 million metric
tons. A smaller Brazilian harvest could increase world demand for
U.S. soybeans.
   ``This just reaffirms the uptrend in the market and the bullish
attitude of the trade in the soybean complex, particularly in the
beans,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Tuesday's USDA report was seen as neutral for corn futures,
which finished modestly lower in Wednesday's session.
   The government predicted this year's winter wheat harvest would
be about 4 percent larger than last year's and that prediction
weighed on wheat futures Wednesday, Spilka said.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.03 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to
3\ cents lower with May at $1.97\ a bushel; oats were 3\ cents to
3} cents lower with May at 1.58{ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to
9\ cents higher with May at $7.12 a bushel.

<HEAD>Consumer Confidence Bounced Back In April, Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers' confidence rebounded in April,
suggesting consumer spending will remain strong in coming months,
the Conference Board said Wednesday.
   The business research organization said its index of consumer
confidence rose to 114.6 in April from 112.7 in March, leaving it
just below its level of 114.9 in February.
   The index peaked at 115.7 in September, the month before the
stock market crash. That was its highest level in 15 years.
   The index, based on a monthly survey of 5,000 households, is
considered an important indicator for the economy because consumer
spending accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product.
   Consumers have been spending cautiously in recent months, and
analysts have attributed their hesitance in part to concerns about
the economy.
   The base year for the consumer confidence index was 1985, when
it was at 100. Its margin of error is plus or minus 2 or 2.5
points, meaning the change from March to April is near the limit of
the margin of error.

<HEAD>Foreign Secretary Says Swiss Must Play Fair on Takeovers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said Wednesday
the Swiss government must be prepared to allow British companies to
make takeover bids in Switzerland without legal restrictions if
Swiss companies expect to be able to buy up British concerns.
   ``Swiss companies, for example, expect to make takeovers in our
market. Their government must ensure British firms can make
takeovers in theirs,'' said Howe at an agricultural forum in London.
   The foreign secretary made no direct mention of the 2.1 billion
pound, or $3.97 billion, hostile takeover offer by the Swiss
chocolate company Nestle S.A. for York-based Rowntree PLC, a
British confectioner.
   Jacobs Suchard S.A., another Swiss confectioner, also has built
up a 29.9 percent stake in Rowntree.
   The moves have been highly controversial in Britain because
Swiss companies are protected from takeover by Swiss law.
   Swiss companies are eager to buy operations within the European
Economic Community, of which Switzerland is not a member, to better
take advantage of the lack of barriers to takeovers.
   Howe said the EEC's plan to create a single barrier-free
European market by 1992 would make takeovers more of a two-way
process.

<HEAD>Sale of 37 Hospitals in 10 States Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Medical International Inc.
will sell 37 hospitals in 10 states to an employee group in a
transaction valued at $910 million, the company said Wednesday.
   The announcement follows sale of 15 hospitals and layoffs of
2,000 workers in the last 18 months in an attempt to boost earnings
at the hospital company. It considerably exceeds Chairman Walter L.
Weisman's prediction after the company's annual meeting in January
that between five and 20 hospitals would be sold in the next three
years.
   American Medical said the acute-care hospitals, which among them
have 4,200 beds, would be sold to a new company owned primarily by
an employees' stock ownership plan to be established at the new
company.
   The new company will be headed by Kenneth S. George, present
director of American Medical's Southwest region, and will have
headquarters in Dallas, the company said. American Medical will
retain an interest through an issue of preferred stock in the new
entity, which has not yet been named, said American Medical
spokesman Mick Taylor.
   American Medical is seeking bank loans to finance the planned
$600 million cash portion of the sale, Taylor said.
   The rest of the transaction would bring American Medical $310
million in preferred stock in the new company, assumed debt and
notes, the company said. The proceeds, estimated at $450 million
after taxes and expenses, will be used to pay off debt and buy back
stock.
   The company retains 48 hospitals and five psychiatric hospitals
in the United States and 22 hospitals and three psyciatric
hospitals overseas.
   ``This sale will allow AMI to focus singularly on improving the
earnings per share generated by our remaining asset base,'' Weisman
said.
   The hospitals to be sold are in Texas, California, Oklahoma,
Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Arkansas, South Carolina
and Georgia.
   Those hospitals had combined net revenue of $507 million in 1987.
   American Medical, which in March reported second-quarter profit
fell 13.9 percent to $24.1 million, is under pressure from the
holder of 5 percent of its stock to sell marginal operations. For
the first half of its fiscal year, profit rose 11.8 percent, to
$63.3 million, over the year earlier.

   Democrats stepped up their challenge Wednesday
to President Reagan on trade, threatening an all-out fight until
the November elections unless he drops his veto threat and signs a
1,000-page trade measure.
   ``Don't turn your back on America's future, Mr. President, don't
give American men and women a pink slip,'' Senate Majority Leader
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said at a congressional bill-signing
ceremony.
   The signing and a Capitol Hill rally held outside Democratic
national headquarters were parts of a show of political muscle
orchestrated by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, as a sendoff for
the bill before it goes to the president's desk.
   With 15 television cameras trained on him and scores of baffled
tourists wandering through, Wright signed the massive bill at a
ceremony in ornate Statuary Hall near the House chamber. Supporters
of the legislation applauded and Wright passed out pens that were
used in the ceremony.
   Senate President Pro Tempore John Stennis, D-Miss., was expected
to sign the measure quickly and return it to Wright for delivery to
the White House. Democratic leaders indicated they planned to have
it there by the end of the week.
   Wednesday's ceremonies clearly were aimed at casting the bill in
a flattering light and thus make a veto sound all the more harsh.
   Democrats said the issue was bound to strike a resonant chord on
the campaign trail. Party Chairman Paul Kirk said voters would
``rally to the banner of the Democratic Party'' in House and Senate
races.
   On hand for the rally were lawmakers, their aides, religious and
labor leaders and a handful of laid-off workers brought in by the
AFL-CIO for the occasion. Republicans were absent.
   At the bill's signing, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the
chairman of the House-Senate conference committee that drew up the
bill, urged Reagan to sign the measure.
   There have been recurrent reports of friction between
Rostenkowski and Wright over provisions of the bill that appeared
to guarantee a veto. Notable among them has been a feature
requiring companies with at least 100 employees to give 60-day
notice of plant closings and major layoffs.
   Rostenkowski's office said he had not been invited to the rally.
``But our nose isn't out of joint about it and neither should yours
be,'' press secretary Jim Jaffe said. He said the affair was
``being blown up.''
   In explaining his veto plan, Reagan has pinpointed the
plant-closings provision as well as the bill's curbs on Alaska oil
exports.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reaffirmed that
Reagan will veto the bill.
   The trade bill was one of the items discussed by Reagan in a
private meeting with Republican leaders of Congress. Afterward,
talking with reporters in the White House driveway, Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., expressed confidence that the veto will be
sustained.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill, said that after
Reagan's veto is upheld, the House could move ``very quickly'' to
enact a replacement bill, minus the provisions on Alaskan oil and
plant-closing notification.
   The centerpiece of the bill are provisions that would overhaul
the system under which the United States uses trade restrictions to
aid U.S. industries threatened by imports and retaliate against
international trade violations. For example, authority to order
retaliatory tariffs and quotas would be transferred from the
president to the U.S. trade representative.
   The bill has hundreds of other provisions, ranging from a
potential $2 billion in agricultural subsidies to repeal of the
windfall profits tax on oil company earnings.
   At the rally, Wright described House Majority Leader Thomas
Foley, D-Wash., as ``the architect'' of the legislation. Foley said
the support of Americans for the plant-closings feature were
``indicated in every poll.'' But he did not cite any specific poll
results and a morning news conference at which pollsters were
supposed to release results was canceled.
   The legislation passed the House 312-107, a margin more than
enough to override the expected veto. But it won final passage in
the Senate on April 27 three votes short of the two-thirds needed
for an override, and Democrats were still uncertain of just where
they would find the additional support.
   ``We'll consult the stars,'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said
wryly.
   The bill won final passage on April 27 but has been sitting on
Capitol Hill while the Democrats tried in vain to win over two
votes for a veto override by reopening the measure and stripping
out its restrictions on Alaska oil exports.

   Share prices dropped on Wall Street today, as
several major banks raised their prime lending rates and confirmed
investors' fears about higher interest rates.
   About a dozen big U.S. banks boosted their prime rates by a half
percentage point to 9 percent _ the first increase in the prime
since just before October's stock market collapse.
   Market analysts point out that hauntingly similar jitters about
rising interest rates were a big factor behind the Oct. 19 crash,
and those memories are still fresh in the minds of nervous
investors.
   ``The major problem with the stock market has been the rise in
rates,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Chase Manhattan Bank was the first big bank to raise the key
rate, which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base
rate for loans to many businesses and for consumer loans, including
mortgages. Chase's move was announced around noon today after Wall
Street had already sustained sharp losses on interest-rate fears.
   ``It tends to reduce confidence in the stock market,'' said Hugh

   The hike in the prime came against a background of growing
edginess about the outlook for interest rates.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson indicated

boost in rates.
   Lawson, who made the comments in an interview with the Wall

   Separately, White House economist Beryl Sprinkel confirmed that
the Fed has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks. He defended
the move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recent
growth in the money supply.
   Some observers and market players expect the Fed to raise its
key discount rate, the interest it charges big financial
institutions, possibly this week.
   Higher interest rates, by raising the cost of borrowing, tend to
dampen companies' expansion plans and investments.

   Procter & Gamble Co. is testing colored
diapers _ blue for boys, pink for girls _ in several states to see
if pastels catch on for baby's bottoms.
   The diapers, which bear the Luvs Deluxe brand name, also include
extra padding in the front for boys' diapers and in the middle for
the girls' version.
   The padding is part of a patented system aimed at better
absorption, P&G spokeswoman Carol Boyd said Wednesday. ``The
padding is just placed a little differently,'' she said.
   The diapers are being made available in Kansas, Oklahoma,
Missouri, Arkansas, and Evansville, Ind., as part of a market test,
Ms. Boyd said. P&G will see how well they're accepted before
deciding whether to market them across the country.
   ``It's too soon to know whether or not these diapers will be
available nationally,'' she said. ``Consumers ultimately will be
the ones to judge.''
   Parents' comments prompted P&G to offer the colored diapers, Ms.
Boyd said, adding that it's the first time the company has
attempted such an experment. ``Parents are the ones who told us
that they liked that. It was a fashion decision,'' she said.
   Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble has been locked in a tight
competition with Kimberly-Clark for the lead in disposable diaper
sales. P&G held two-thirds of the $3 billion U.S. retail market at
the start of the decade, but its Pampers brand slipped behind
Kimberly-Clark's Huggies in 1985. Good sales by the Luvs brand
helped P&G maintain the overall lead.
   P&G recaptured 60 percent of the market by 1986 with aggressive
marketing and product changes.
   P&G lost a legal battle with Kimberly-Clark last year when a
jury in Dallas ruled that the elasticized waistband in Huggies
disposables was not a patent infringement. P&G had asked for an
injunction to stop Kimberly-Clark from making elasticized Huggies,
saying the diapers violated P&G's patent for heat-shrinkable
material used in the Huggies waistbands.
   Procter & Gamble had overall sales of $17 billion in fiscal
1986-87. It makes and markets laundry and cleaning products,
personal care products, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage
products, and other items for business and industry.

   The first spike in bank-lending rates since the
October stock market crash jolted Wall Street on Wednesday,
heralding a period of more expensive loans for purchases ranging
from plant machinery to homes and cars.
   Several big banks, pressured by increased costs of borrowing
money themselves, raised their prime lending rate from 8.5 percent
to 9 percent, nearly erasing the results of three rate decreases
over the past seven months. Chase Manhattan Bank led the move and
was followed by competitors.
   The prime rate lags behind more subtle increases in interest
rates elsewhere. But the rate is closely watched because bankers
use it as a basis for calculating loans to businesses, as well as
determining many types of consumer loans, including increasingly
popular home-equity loans.
   Stock traders reacted badly to the rate rise, partly because it
aroused memories of the higher interest rates that preceded the
stock crash. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.80 points to
a three-month low of 1,965.85.
   The last time banks raised the prime rate was in September, when
it went from 8.75 percent to 9.25 percent. The rate retreated to 9
percent on Oct. 22, two days after the Black Monday stock collapse.
It fell to 8.75 percent Nov. 5 and to 8.5 percent Feb. 2.
   The prime-rate increase partly reflected moves by the Federal
Reserve, the nation's central bank, to nudge interest rates higher
in order to forestall sharp increases in inflation that many
analysts fear might accompany recent surprisingly strong economic
growth.
   The clearest evidence of that growth came last week when the
Labor Department said unemployment had hit a 14-year low. This
suggested worker shortages will rise, pushing up wages and
intensifying demands for goods and services that increase the cost
of living and doing business, many economists said.
   ``Interest rates are going up now basically because the Fed
dragged and dragged its feet and finally was presented with
incontrovertible evidence that the economy was doing well, perhaps
too well,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko
Securities International Inc. in New York. ``So the Fed couldn't
just sit by and do nothing.''
   Sandra Shaber, an economist at the Futures Group, a
Washington-based forcasting firm, said the prime rate increase
would have a broader effect now than in years past because it is no
longer just a benchmark rate for new loans to a bank's best
corporate customers.
   ``What does it mean for consumers? Once upon a time, the impact
would have been limited,'' she said. ``But now, because of the
increased use of home-equity loans and other adjustable rates, even
people who have current debt outstanding, they feel the effects.
Their financing costs rise. It squeezes their discretionary
spending in general.''
   The Fed has two fundamental choices in trying to balance
economic growth and inflation: It can control the amount of money
in the banking system and can adjust its key lending fee to
financial institutions, known as the discount rate. That rate has
stood at 6 percent since Sept. 4.
   Economists said it was clear the Fed had recently tightened the
amount of money in the banking system. But some doubted the Fed
would act quickly to raise the discount rate, which would be
considered a much stronger sign of tightening.
   ``My guess is the Fed will not try to push interest rates up
beyond current levels,'' said David Blitzer, chief economist for
Standard & Poor's Corp., a major investment research and
credit-rating concern.
   ``There will be concern about the impact on the economy,
especially in housing and auto sales,'' he said. ``Secondly, the
inflation fears are a little bit overdone.''
   Some economists said the low unemployment rates did not
necessarily mean impending inflation. They argued that despite
record numbers of people working, wages generally have not been
rising.
   Others said it was clear that higher prices are looming, partly
because of the increased cost of oil, grain and other commodities,
as well as the impact of a lower dollar, which makes imports more
expensive.
   Nevertheless, many economists agreed the Fed would remain
extremely reluctant to push up interest rates sharply and risk a
recession, especially in an election year.
   They also said the central bank had learned from the
double-digit inflation experience of the late 1970s that a little
tightening now eliminates the need for more severe action later.
   ``The Fed understands if you let this process get out of hand,
then you have a very hard time stopping it and you need incredibly
high interest rates,'' Brusca said. ``It wants to tap the brakes a
little bit rather than slam them on in a great fury.''

<HEAD>Dollar Rises In Domestic Trading; Gold Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar got a boost from rising interest
rates and closed higher against most major currencies in domestic
trading Wednesday after dipping overseas.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold bullion was bid at $448.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down
from $449.60 late Tuesday.
   The dollar began its climb shortly after noon, when the first of
a number of major banks announced they would hike their prime
lending rates to 9 percent from 8.5 percent.
   Frank Watson, a vice president at Swiss Bank Corp., noted that
the increase had been expected. Still, traders had to buy dollars
to cover their positions. The dollar also was supported by
indications that the Federal Reserve has tightened credit. ``The
dollar cannot go a lot lower in this environment of higher interest
rates,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust and
Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Trading was relatively dull and volume was light.
   The foreign exchange market appeared little affected by a report
that Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said major
industrialized nations might coordinate a worldwide hike in
interest rates.
   The comment, published in overseas editions of the Wall Street
Journal, sent the stock markets into a tailspin, although the
newspaper issued a statement saying it had failed to fully report
Lawson's remarks.
   ``People were looking at (the comments) but didn't know what he
meant,'' Holzer said.
   Traders could interpret the comments several ways. ``If the
stock market really came off, that could mean a flight to quality
by investors, and that's bullish for the dollar,'' Watson said.
``But it's bearish for the dollar if interest rates rise'' in
Europe and Japan.
   Trading was quite in Europe as many banks wound down their
operations ahead of Thursday's Ascension Day holiday, which is
observed by several countries.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.39 yen to a closing 124.24 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 124.23 yen. In
New York the dollar finished at 124.475 yen, up from 124.38 yen on
Tuesday.
   In London, it cost $1.8870 to buy one pound, more expensive than
$1.8825 late Tuesday. But in New York one pound cost $1.8815,
cheaper than Tuesday's $1.88425.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.68275 West German marks, up from
1.67795; 1.3995 Swiss francs, up from 1.39435; 5.70375 French
francs, up from 5.6905; 1,251.50 Italian lire, up from 1,247.35,
and 1.2314 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2380.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.6773 West German marks, down from 1.6783;
1.3935 Swiss francs, down from 1.3955; 5.6912 French francs, up
from 5.6905; 1.8830 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8815; 1,249.50
Italian lire, up from 1,248.00; and 1.2315 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2375.
   Gold prices rose overseas. In London, gold rose to a late bid
price of $449.30 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's
$446.50. In Zurich, gold was higher, closing at a bid $449.50
compared with $446.50 late Tuesday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose
$2.73 to close at a bid $451.68.
   But on the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $449.70 a
troy ounce, down from $450.10.
   Silver finished higher at $6.552 a troy ounce on New York's
Comex, compared with $6.45 on Tuesday. In London the metal was
trading at a late bid price of $6.55 a troy ounce, up from
Tuesday's $6.45.

   Much of the GI generation that fought in World
War II and returned home to create an economic and baby boom is
retiring in relative comfort, a Florida researcher reports.
   More than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double
the poverty level, and 12 percent form an elite with income from at
least three sources, according to Charles F. Longino of the
University of Miami.
   But elderly affluence isn't spread evenly across the nation,
Longino reports in the June edition of American Demographics
magazine.
   ``There are a cluster of states with a large share of the
comfortably retired,'' Longino said in analyzing 1980 Census data,
the most recent information available with sufficient detail for
the study.
   Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada and New Jersey had many of
the comfortably retired, while the pension elite made strong
showings in Connecticut and Washington, Longino found.
   The poverty level for a family of four was $8,414 in 1980.
   The World War II GIs reaped the benefits of government programs
that provided educations and home loans, cost-of-living escalators
for their Social Security benefits and federal laws protecting
private pensions, Longino noted. In addition, many were able to
invest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy.
   Longino looked at three groups of retirees in his study, those
aged 55 to 64, 65-74 and 75 and over in 1980. He termed them the GI
generation after the term ``Government Issue,'' which became a
popular for soldiers in the 1940s.
   Just over half (51.1 percent) of those in the 65-74 age group
were listed as comfortable, and 12.3 percent were in the elite
elite.''
   For the younger group, 59.1 percent were comfortable and 4.7
percent were in the elite. They were less likely to qualify as
elite since few were receiving Social Security in addition to other
retirement benefits.
   The oldest group listed 37.5 percent as comfortable and 8.5
percent as elite. Few in this group had income-generating assets
and most completed a large share of their working lives before
World War II, when pension benefits were less common and lower.
   Longino found the confortably retired of the 65-74 age group in
such resort and retirement states as Florida, Nevada and New
Jersey; in Connecticut, where many New York executives have
retired, and Hawaii.
   Hawaii has a large Asian population where extended families are
more common, a situation which boosts the household income measure
used as the basis for this calculation, Longino noted.
   For the pension elite, Connecticut and Washington placed well,
as did Florida, Maryland, New Jersey. Longino also noted that there
are clusters of affluent elderly in some metropolitan areas.
   He cited as examples Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Fla.; San
Diego and Palm Springs, Calif.; and along the east coast of Mobile
Bay, Ala.
   Longino is director of the Center for Social Research in Aging
at the University of Miami, and his work was partially funded by
the American Association of Retired Persons. American Demographics,
published by Dow Jones & Co. Inc., reports on population matters.
   Here is a state-by-state rundown of the percentage of Americans
aged 65-74 who are considered confortably retired, or among the
pension elite.
   Comfortably retired (CR) is defined as having income of twice
the poverty level. Pension elite (PE) means receiving from three
sources: Social Security, pensions and assets.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on
Wednesday approved a new stock index futures contract for the first
time since the October stock market crash.
   The commission voted unanimously to permit the Chicago Board of
Trade to trade contracts based on the Chicago Board of Options
Exchange 250 Stock Index and the CBOE 50 Stock Index.
   The action came only a day after five big Wall Street firms
announced that customer concerns about stock market volatility had
prompted them to stop for their own accounts a form of futures
trading known as index arbitrage.
   In index arbitrage, pension funds, mutual funds and other
institutional investors use computers to profit from momentary
price discrepancies between the stock and futures markets by
simultaneously buying in one market and selling in the other.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which governs the stock
market, has blamed index arbitrage for accelerating the Oct. 19
stock crash and for the continuing vulnerability of the market to
wild price swings.
   Former Treasury Secretary Donald Regan told the Senate Banking
Committee on Wednesday stock index trading should be suspended.
   However, Wendy L. Gramm, chairwoman of the CFTC, defended
futures index trading as ``important and beneficial ... (to) our
economic and financial system.''
   Commission member Robert R. Davis said the CFTC's approval of
the contracts Wednesday ``will illustrate that, while the events of
last October raise important policy issues, we are not prepared to
let competing market factions use government regulatory authority
to provide special status and competitive position to any faction,
to the detriment of the broader public interest.''
   The CBOE 50 and CBOE 250 are weighted indexes based on the
largest 50 and largest 250 stocks traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. A rival to the CBOT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
trades futures contracts based on the largest 100 and largest 500
stocks on the NYSE.
   Stock index futures allow an investor to buy a group of stocks
and to hedge the risk by purchasing offsetting futures contracts.
   ``The improvement in risk management afforded by the trading of
stock index contracts rebounds to the interest of millions of small
investors who rely on institutions to manage their savings,'' Ms.
Gramm said in a statement.
   She said the fears of some individual investors have made
futures trading ``a perceptual issue.'' But, she said, ``The way to
address it is through education of the public ... not by blocking
innovative products that can improve market efficiency.''

<HEAD>Gulf & Western Announces New Stock Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gulf & Western Inc., a major entertainment,
publishing and financial services company, announced another stock
buyback program Wednesday, its third in five years.
   The company said its board authorized the purchase of up to 10
million shares of its common stock in the open market. The plan,
designed to bolster the value of the shares that will remain on the
market, follows the completion of a 24 million-share buyback
adopted in 1985.
   The latest repurchase plan included 5.2 million shares snapped
up in the wake of last October's stock market crash, when scores of
companies bought back their own shares to help stave off further
price declines.
   Martin S. Davis, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
buybacks had enhanced shareholder value ``by giving each
shareholder increased ownership of the company.''
   Since the initial buyback was launched in 1983, about 44 million
shares have been repurchased at an average price of slightly over
$21 a share, the company said. Gulf & Western said it had about 118
million shares of common stock outstanding after adjustment for a
2-for-1 stock split on May 2.
   Analysts said Gulf & Western shares traded strongly on the New
York Stock Exchange in reaction to the announcement, but were
dragged down 37{ cents to $37 by the market's broad decline. The
Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 38 points to 1,965.85.
   The company's stock is up significantly from its 52-week low of
$29.75 a share, and analysts credit management for keeping a high
priority on shareholder interests.
   The buyback announcement follows the company's failed attempt to
acquire Western Publishing Group Inc., a children's book publisher
and commercial printer. Mark Manson of the investment firm
Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities said the company's cash flow
was strong enough to accomplish both the buyback and the
acquisition.
   ``It has strong momentum in its entertainment business,
stability in financial services and a mass of cash,'' said Manson.
   Gulf & Western's publishing holdings include Simon & Shuster,
which publishes books for mass circulation, and Prentice-Hall, an
educational and professional publisher. Its entertainment segment
includes Paramount Pictures.

   Stock prices dropped sharply Wednesday in edgy
trading, weakened by fears of higher interest rates that pushed the
Dow Jones industrial average to a three-month low.
   The key index of 30 premier stocks slid 37.80 points to
1,965.85, its lowest closing level since it closed at 1,961.54 on
Feb. 11. Most of the slippage occurred early in the session.
   Losing issues outstripped gainers by about 7-to-1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 1,363 issues declining, 238 advancing and
367 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 176.72 million shares, up from 131.2
million Tuesday.
   Wall Street's fear of higher interest rates were aggravated by
an announcement from big banks that they had raised their key prime
lending rate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent, the first rise since
the October crash.
   Hauntingly similar jitters about rising interest rates were a
big factor behind the crash _ and those memories are still fresh in
the minds of nervous investors.
   In addition, higher interest rates, by raising the cost of
borrowing, tend to dampen companies' expansion plans and
investments.
   ``The major problem with the stock market has been the rise in
rates,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Chase Manhattan Bank was the first big bank to raise the key
rate, which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base
rate for loans to many businesses and for consumer loans, including
some types of mortgages.
   ``It clearly hit a raw nerve ... this market was clearly
vulnerable,'' said Monte Gordon, vice president and director of
research for Dreyfus Corp.
   The hike in the prime came against a background of growing
edginess about the outlook for interest rates.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson reportedly
suggested that there could be an internationally coordinated boost
in rates.
   Lawson, who was quoted in an interview with the Wall Street
Journal's overseas edition Wednesday, noted that a coordinated
effort by West Germany, Japan and other leading nations to hike
interest rates ``is certainly possible'' following the Federal
Reserve's increase in short-term rates to curb U.S. inflation.
   Separately, White House economist Beryl Sprinkel confirmed that
the Fed has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Con Edison fell { to
42, General Electric lost } at 38}, AT&T was down \ at 26~, IBM
dropped 2[ to 108}, Texaco declined ] to 50[, Woolworth tumbled 1\
to 52}, American Express fell | to 22~ and Exxon eased { to 43|.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 204.86 million shares.
   The NYSE's composite index fell 2.27 to 143.48.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials declined 5.34 to
294.32, and S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 4.31 at 253.31.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index dropped
4.18 to 295.63.

   Burt Sugarman, the investor engaged
in a contentious takeover battle with Media General Inc., announced
that profits for his cement and game show company increased
five-fold in the first quarter.
   Earnings for Giant Group rose to $741,000, or 16 cents a share,
from $113,000, or 2 cents a share in the first qarter of 1987,
Sugarman announced Wednesday.
   Sales for the quarter ended March 31 were $15.1 million, up from
$14.9 million in the first quarter of 1987.
   Giant owns 24 percent of Barris Industries, producer of the
``Gong Show'' and ``Dating Game'' television shows.
   Sugarman didn't respond to a telephone request for an
explanation of the increase in profits.
   On Tuesday, Media General, the Richmond, Va.,-based newspaper
and television station owner, rejected Sugarman's latest bid of $70
per share for its stock. The offer, an increase over his previous
bid of $61.50 a share, was the latest round in an acrimonious legal
and financial battle over the takeover attempt.

<HEAD>Technicals, Supply Concerns Boost Pork Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork futures prices rose sharply Wednesday on a combination of
technical factors and indications that a seasonal downturn in hog
supplies had begun, analysts said.
   On other markets, cattle futures were mostly higher; stock-index
futures fell sharply and precious-metals futures dipped as the
prime lending rate rose; soybeans posted strong gains while grains
were lower; and energy futures advanced.
   The rally in pork futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was
powered mainly by technical buying based on traders' analyses of
price charts, market analysts said.
   For example, heavy buying occurred and selling interest
evaporated each time the contract for June delivery of hogs moved
above Tuesday's high price of 51.97 cents a pound, said Charles
Richardson, an analyst in Denver with Lind-Waldock & Co.
   On the fundamental side, some traders believed the annual drop
in hog supplies had begun, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in Chicago
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   More pigs are born in the fall than at any other time of year,
and most of those animals have been sold for slaughter by late
spring, Levitt said.
   ``Since Monday, the hog flow has dried up considerably and some
people feel this is the start of the seasonal move,'' he said.
   The drop in supplies means higher prices but ``we can also
expect an increase in volatility,'' Levitt said. ``The size of
today's advance is already giving us a prelude to that.''
   Cattle futures advanced in line with higher cash prices but
traders were cautious about establishing new positions ahead of
Monday's monthly cattle-on-feed report from the Agriculture
Department, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .62 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in June at 73.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .20 cent lower to .90 cent higher with May at 80 cents a
pound; hogs were .32 cent to 1.38 cent higher with June at 52.77
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to 1.75 cents
higher with May at 53.07 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures plunged along with stock prices as big banks
raised their prime lending rates from 8.5 percent to 9 percent. It
was the first increase in the closely watched rate since the
October stock market crash.
   Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange registered early losses in reaction to a sharp
drop in worldwide stock prices caused by interest rate fears,
analysts said.
   The second jolt came at midday when U.S. banks began announcing
higher prime lending rates.
   ``The market did not react well to the increase in interest
rates,'' said Robert Ray, an analyst in Chicago with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   The contract for June delivery of the S&P 500 index settled 5.20
points lower at 253.40.
   The precious-metals markets also registered disappointment at
the rise in interest rates but they absorbed the news in a matter
of hours, then began moving higher and finished nearly unchanged.
   ``The markets were aware that beyond the negatives of a higher
prime rate is the feeling that it fuels inflation, and that's
bullish for the precious metals,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, metals
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 40 cents lower
across the board with June at $451.20 a troy ounce; silver was 1.8
cents to 2 cents lower with May at $6.552 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures prices soared as much as 9{ cents a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to the Agriculture
Department's latest supply and demand report. Grain futures
retreated slightly.
   The surge in soybean prices was expected after the USDA, in a
report Tuesday afternoon, predicted the U.S. soybean stockpile
would dwindle from 275 million bushels this Aug. 31 to 145 million
bushels a year later.
   The report was seen as neutral for corn futures, which finished
modestly lower in Wednesday's session.
   The government predicted this year's winter wheat harvest would
be about 4 percent larger than last year's and that prediction
weighed on wheat futures Wednesday, analysts said.
   Wheat settled { cent to 1{ cents lower with May at $3.03 a
bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with May at $1.97 a
bushel; oats were 3\ cents to 3} cents lower with May at 1.58{ a
bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 9{ cents higher with May at $7.12
a bushel.
   Energy futures prices were mostly higher in quiet trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Unleaded gasoline made the greatest
gains because of a report showing heavy drawdowns of supplies over
the past week, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 18 cents
higher with June at $17.49 a barrel; heating oil was .28 cent lower
to .44 cent higher with June at 47.46 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .20 cent to .63 cent higher with June at 52.25 cents a
gallon.

<HEAD>World Markets React To Lawson Comments</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs with Journal statement; picks up 6th graf,
``The remarks ...</NOTE>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's comments that
there could be an internationally coordinated boost in interest
rates sent a rush of worry through world securities markets
Wednesday.
   Lawson, who made the comments in an interview with the Wall
Street Journal's overseas editions, noted that a coordinated effort
by West Germany, Japan and other leading nations to hike interest
rates ``is certainly possible'' following the Federal Reserve's
increase in short-term rates to curb U.S. inflation.
   The Journal later issued a statement saying it had not fully
reported Lawson's comments.
   Separately, White House economist Beryl Sprinkel confirmed that
the Federal Reserve has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks.
He defended the move as making sense in the face of a strong
economy and recent growth in the money supply.
   In reports published Wednesday in overseas editions of the Wall
Street Journal, Lawson noted, ``We did have very close coordination
in the immediate aftermath'' of October's stock market collapse.
   The Journal said later in a statement it had failed to fully
report Lawson's remarks.
   ``In an interview, Lawson was asked if there is a possibility
that governments may act in a coordinated way to raise rates in the
near future, as they have done to lower rates in the past. He
replied in part, `That is certainly possible....', '' the statement
said.
   ``However, the article failed to note that in response to a
follow-up question about the chances of coordinated interest rate
rises in the near future, Lawson would only state, `What I am
saying is that we do keep very closely in touch with each other. I
wouldn't go further than that'. ''
   In Tokyo, the Journal report sent stock prices tumbling. The key
225-share Nikkei Index fell 251.20 points, or 0.92 percent, to
close at 27,161.05.
   ``The remarks by Lawson came at a bad time, with the market
already worried about the U.S. refunding,'' said a trader in Tokyo,
referring to the quarterly sale of $26 billion in notes and bonds.
The three-day sale ends Thursday.
   Share prices also headed lower in London and Frankfurt.
   Prices on many bond markets also moved lower in response to the
comments by both Lawson and Sprinkel, sending interest rates
higher. Traders said U.S. treasuries, British, West German and
Japanese government issues all fell after the reports circulated.
In New York, the bellwether 30-year issue eased slightly in the
early going.
   Bond prices move in the opposite direction as interest rates.
   Several central banks refused to comment on the Lawson remarks.
   Any action by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates
would affect the U.S. dollar, Lawson noted. West Germany and Japan
have resisted boosting their interest rates ahead of a U.S. rate
hike for fear of weakening the dollar.
   In his interview with the Journal, Lawson also dismissed market
concern that the United States would resume a hands-off approach to
the dollar after the upcoming presidential election and allow the
dollar to fall again.
   Lawson predicted the group of seven major industrialized nations
would maintain their commitment to stabilize the dollar.
   Currency traders in New York dismissed Lawson's comments, and
the dollar continued to move in narrow, directionless activity.

<HEAD>Union Pacific Leases Space in Bethlehem Steel Headquarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Pacific Corp. on Wednesday signed a
lease for three floors of Bethlehem Steel Corp.'s headquarters,
where the railroad holding company plans to relocate most of its
executive offices.
   Union Pacific Corp., the holding company of Union Pacific
Railroad, will transfer as many as 120 employees from its New York
City office to the new Bethlehem corporate headquarters.
   Company officials said Union Pacific will still maintain a
presence in New York, but all executive offices _ including that of
President Drew Lewis _ will relocate to Martin Tower. The company
expects to begin relocation in late July and complete the move in
October.
   The Union Pacific lease represents the first step toward making
the building profitable for Bethelem. The steelmaker has tried to
unsuccessfully sell the building since last year. The tower was
built 16 years ago.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO Ad Campaign Aimed at Updating Union Image</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The AFL-CIO on Wednesday said a new $13
million broadcast advertising campaign was designed to show that
unions, like their workers, are interested in fairness, justice and
life outside the job.
   The ads, which all end with a chorus singing ``America works
best when we say union yes,'' have begun appearing on the
television networks and in 13 local markets. The 30-second spots
are expected to reach more than nine out of 10 of all American
homes at least four times.
   Radio spots will be aired as well, including one that urges
listeners to ask Congress to override President Reagan's expected
veto of the trade legislation. Unions have been pushing a provision
of the bill requiring mandatory notice of plant closings for large
companies.
   At a closed-circuit TV news conference to the 13 cities where
the TV ads will be shown, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said
``the labor movement has a long, well-documented record of fighting
for the rights and the standard of living of working Americans. But
in spite of that, there are still many Americans who have serious
misconceptions about what unions do and about whether or not they
are necessary in today's work place.''
   ``The goal of `Union Yes,''' he said, ``is to talk directly with
American workers about the value of unions in the work place today.
One of the best ways to do that now is through television.''
   Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America,
told reporters in Washington that the ads ``fill a need to let the
population at large know what the trade union movement stands for.''
   He said many Americans have ``a stereotype of unions and union
members. They see a heavyset fellow smoking a cigar and wearing a
$500 suit.''
   One commercial focuses on women, with a woman saying unions have
ensured fairness in promotions. Another, obviously pregnant, woman
says that because of unions she will be able to take time off to
have her baby and come back to a job.
   The first phase of the ad campaign runs through mid-June. The
second phase picks up on Labor Day in September. The campaign,
which is paid for with union dues, is expected to last two years.
   The ads will star actors Jack Lemmon, Tyne Daly and Howard
Hesseman.
   Local TV ads will run during May and June in New York, Los
Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston, Detroit,
Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Washington, Atlanta, Nashville, Tenn., and
Orlando, Fla.
