   City officials have asked for reports on whether
police prevented Fire Department divers from joining the search for
a victim trapped in a sightseeing helicopter that crashed and sank
in the East River.
   A fire lieutenant was quoted as saying he had eight divers at
the scene Sunday morning, but police kept them away at a time when
only two police divers were in the water.
   It took 90 minutes to find the helicopter in the river's murk
and free the trapped passenger, Takashi Oyama, a Japanese
businessman. Oyama, 29, was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he
died nine hours later.
   The pilot and three other passengers, none seriously injured,
escaped to the surface and were taken to hospitals.
   The National Transportation Safety Board also said it would look
into the issue of whether rescue was impeded by police-firefighter
rivalry if it received information that such a dispute had occurred.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said two police divers were in
the water by 10:37 a.m., 14 minutes after the first report of the
crash. By 10:45, nine divers were conducting a pattern search of
the area, he said.
   Fire Commissioner Joseph Bruno said two Fire Department divers
were there at 10:37 and that eight were on the scene by 10:45.
   Ward dismissed as a personal opinion an earlier statement by
Fire Lt. Patrick Brown of Rescue Co. 1 that the search was impeded
because his divers were not allowed to join it.
   ``It was the feeling of the police commander on the scene and in
fact the common practice of all experienced water rescuers that
uncoordinated search teams in the water at the same time is
dangerous and unproductive,'' Ward said in explaining why the Fire
Department's offer was declined.
   Bruno said the rescue effort was ``within the purview of the
Police Department and I have no problem with that. I do have a
problem with reports saying we are not needed and unnecessary. Our
feeling is that if resources were available, they should be
utilized.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he has asked for a report to ``find
out whether all of the assistance on the scene was properly used.''
   The mayor said he would not speculate before he got the
information.
   In line with rules laid down by Koch last year to end
jurisdiction disputes, police were in charge at Sunday's crash
site, a non-fire emergency. The Fire Department calls the shots at
fire emergencies.
   First Deputy Mayor Stanley Brezenoff said ``The only question is
were there enough divers in the water'' to make the rescue without
using fire divers.
   The crashed helicopter, a Bell Jet Ranger operated by Island
Helicopter Corp. of Garden City, plunged from 1,400 feet after a
15-to-20-minute tour of Manhattan.
   Frank Ghiorsi, chief of the federal safety board's New York
office, said particular attention would be given seat belts and the
pontoons, which separated from the craft on impact.
   Oyama was snarled in his belt and had to be cut free, said
Michael Rivadeneyra, one of divers who found the helicopter in 35
feet of water.

   People have been stealing poster ads on
commuter-train platforms promoting an art exhibit of Georgia
O'Keeffe's work, authorities said.
   ``They keep bringing them in here, razor-bladed out,'' said
Larry Dilger, service director with Winston Network Inc., the
billboard company that installs the posters.
   ``People must find it very attractive if they will take the time
to cut the things out.''
   Posters of the painting ``Red Poppy'' have been displayed in
many parts of the city to advertise a showing of the late Ms.
O'Keeffe's work at the Art Institute of Chicago.
   At least 35 of 200 posters on rapid-transit platforms are
missing. When cut, only white borders and the words ``Georgia
O'Keeffe 1887-1986'' remain.
   Norman Baxter, a vice president of Southwestern Bell Corp.,
which is sponsoring the exhibit, said he considers the thefts a
form of flattery for the artist, who was known for her large and
precise designs of flowers and the skulls of animals.

   Image is everything in the rough-and-tumble world
of Chicago politics, says Mayor Eugene Sawyer. But after four
months surrounded by the trappings of power, he admits his image
isn't what it should be.
   His enemies gripe about his willingness to reward friends. And
his friends gripe about his unwillingness to punish enemies.
   ``I might become a little more aggressive, harder than I used to
be, but that's because the job will make me so,'' the soft-spoken
mayor said during a recent interview.
   ``Everything you do or say in this office is political, or
somebody will couch it that way and force you to respond in a
political manner. You try to be a statesman, but hey, you better be
a politician, too,'' he added. ``Otherwise you won't be around very
long.''
   ``People have all kinds of plans for you, and I just say that if
I'm going to make a mistake, it will be one I made myself, not
something that somebody suggested to me,'' said Sawyer, 58.
   Sawyer became embroiled in a new controversy this weekend when
religious leaders accused mayoral community liaison aide Steve
Cokely of repeatedly using racial and religious slurs against Jews
and Christians in a series of tape-recorded lectures to followers
of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
   Mayoral spokesman Monroe Anderson said Sawyer planned to ask
Cokely, 35, to ``tune down his rhetoric,'' but did not plan to fire
him.
   Sawyer became mayor following the death in November of Harold
Washington, who became the city's first black mayor in 1983 and had
consolidated his power over the Cook County Democratic Party.
   Washington had served only eight months of his second term and
Sawyer must at some point face an election if he wants to stay in
office. But the date of the next mayoral election is up in the air.
   The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners ruled last week that
an election would be held in 1989 if City Clerk Walter Kozubowski
declared the mayor's office vacant. Kozubowski said he wouldn't do
so unless ordered by a court.
   His opposition virtually assures the controversy will be
resolved in court. Already, competing lawsuits arguing for either a
1989 or 1991 election are pending.
   Sawyer has said he is prepared to run whenever the next election
is scheduled.
   No matter what the date, observers say, the absence of a
political giant like Washington or the late Mayor Richard J. Daley
will show how splintered this city's once-vaunted Democratic
machine has become.
   ``There'll be so many people running _ black, white, green ...
that nobody will know what to do,'' said black activist Lu Palmer,
credited with organizing the grass-roots campaign that elected
Washington to his first term.
   ``And there's scores of people talking about running for
everything from dogcatcher to mayor and nobody's got the power to
tell them no,'' he continued.
   ``Machines move with precision. If there was a chief like
Harold, things would still be done with precision,'' he said. ``But
now you've got a lot of little chieftains and everybody's throwing
things in the way.''
   Sawyer has had a difficult time shouldering the mantle since he
was elected by a City Council coalition made up mostly of white,
anti-Washington aldermen.
   ``Some people were with Harold because they believed in him,
some because they feared him and some because he proved he could
win,'' said Alderman Danny Davis.
   ``Everybody knew there would be some slippage after he died,''
added Davis, ``but nobody knew how much.''
   The coalition that put Sawyer in office already has shown a
tendency to fray at the seams. His bloc held together long enough
to pass Washington's record budget, but grumbling set in almost
immediately afterward and many of Sawyer's legislative proposals
are languishing in the council.
   And during the primary elections in March, several black
aldermen who were among Sawyer's most identifiable supporters got
clobbered in races for party committeeman positions. Normally,
aldermen are shoo-ins for those posts.
   ``What that told me is that the voters in my ward don't like
him,'' said William Beavers, one of the aldermen, ``and they may
not be crazy about me standing behind him either.''

Employment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Welfare officials celebrating the first
anniversary of Mississippi's workfare program say they've shown
that even the nation's poorest state can take those who have never
had a steady job or who haven't worked in years off the dole.
   While Congress debated the most comprehensive welfare reform
bill in 50 years, Mississippi Department of Public Welfare
officials lauded their program for turning workfare jobs into
paying employment for 109 of the 765 food stamp recipients
participating so far.
   Welfare recipients, they said, may be pulling themselves up by
their own bootstraps largely because of the state's poverty.
   ``We're not distressed by the current economic situation. In
fact, I get a personal kick from trying to do more with less,''
Welfare Commissioner Thomas Brittain said.
   Mississippi has the lowest per capita income in the nation at
$10,204; 20 percent of its residents rely on food stamps.
   ``A lot of people, including some who work here in this
department, said workfare can't work in Mississippi,'' Brittain
recalled. ``The reasons they gave me for that is it's a rural-based
state, that we have high unemployment.''
   But Brittain said he knew workfare could work in Mississippi
because, although local governments and private non-profit groups
were short of revenue for needed services, there were ``tremendous
numbers of people on welfare who in my opinion were able to work.''
   Gloria Rutledge, a regional food program specialist in the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Atlanta office, agreed that
Mississippi's poverty has contributed to its workfare success.
   ``I don't know that this would have worked so well in some other
place,'' Rutledge said of the program, which requires clients to
work for government the number of hours times the minimum wage that
equals the value of their food stamp allotment.
   She said because so many Mississippi agencies can't afford to
hire people to perform necessary tasks they'll give workfare
participants doing those jobs more responsibility and training than
they would otherwise.
   She also noted that Mississippi workfare participants can more
easily be recommended to private industry as solid, proven
employees because they work an average of six months before
Brittain personally presents their resumes at a meeting of local
business owners and managers in their community.
   Rutledge said that with 16 counties participating so far,
Mississippi probably has the largest-scale food stamp workfare
program in the Southeast. Brittain said he hopes to include all of
the state's 82 counties within a few years.
   Each county's board of supervisors must opt to join
Mississippi's version of the federally authorized program.
Participating counties pay $12.50 monthly to cover each workfare
client's travel and other miscellaneous expenses, with the federal
government matching that amount.
   Food stamp recipients in participating counties must sign up for
workfare, Job Find or educational programs. In the past year, 1,972
of 5,448 clients in the participating counties opted to discontinue
receiving food stamps rather than meet the requirements of one of
the three options.
   Forty-four states have a workfare program tied to the Aid to
Families with Dependent Children program, according to federal
officials in Washington.
   Among the workfare success stories provided by Brittain is the
case of Cecil Walker, a longtime unemployed off-shore oilfield
worker. Walker began his workfare assignment as a novice in the
Welfare Department's printing office. His workfare training later
allowed him to select from among several print shop job offers _ at
what he said is a livable salary.
   ``It's something when your children say, `I want this and I want
that, Daddy,''' Walker said. ``Now, I can't get everything they
want, but I get everything they need and some of the things they
want.''

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Except for the thunder of aircraft
taking off and the showers of flares overhead, Soviet soldiers
serving at a base near Kabul airport could almost convince
themselves they are in the Soviet Union.
   The corrugated metal huts and wooden barracks are typical of
bases in their native land.
   Beside each cot in the bunkhouses are tubes of Soviet
toothpaste, Soviet soap and Soviet mirrors, purchased at the base
store.
   Russian women like Oksana Okulova serve breakfast, lunch and
dinner to the soldiers on Soviet crockery. Afterward, the women
wash up while the men go off to train Afghan government troops and
help them defend the city against attack by anti-communist rebels.
   The hearty breads cherished by Soviets are baked at the base
each day, and familiar foods like ham, cheese and apples are flown
in for the soldiers, who eschew the spicy Afghan dishes.
   But the flares, which are released by aircraft to deflect
heat-seeking Stinger missiles, serve as a reminder that the
soldiers are in danger, even inside the closely guarded confines of
the base.
   ``Of course it's dangerous flying here,'' Tiit Tommela, an army
major from Soviet Estonia, told visiting foreign journalists. ``We
have to take precautions against your Stingers.''
   Afghan guerrillas, who have been fighting the pro-Soviet
government for 10 years, use the U.S.-supplied missiles effectively
against government aircraft.
   Ms. Okulova, a 25-year-old who sought an escape from the
industrial Russian city of Voronezh, said the aviation dangers are
the only aspect of her life in Afghanistan she finds frightening.
   ``We hardly ever leave the base, so it's easy to just keep
occupied and not think about the fact that there is a war going
on,'' she said. ``We are forbidden to go to the markets, and when
we go on touring trips we travel as a group.''
   Officers refused to say how many soldiers serve at the sprawling
complex that provides security for the capital, Kabul, and the
aircraft serving it. It appears to house at least 1,000 Soviets.
   On Saturday, as the noon sun burst through rainclouds in the
mountains ringing Kabul, a squad of Soviet paratroopers in
camouflage jumpsuits lined up on the sports field to teach Afghans
the art of hand-to-hand combat.
   Nearby, soldiers worked with two German shepherds trained to
sniff out explosives hidden in items like canteens and matchboxes.
   ``There are occasional problems with the men,'' Ms. Okulova
admitted when asked how she and several dozen other service workers
deal with so many lonely soldiers far from home.
   But several factors limit the potential for romantic problems.
Strict rules forbid intimate relationships, there is little privacy
in the dormitories and barracks, and the women must work long
hours, Mrs. Okulova said.
   The Soviets plan to start pulling out of Afghanistan on May 15,
under an accord signed last month in Geneva. However, the Kabul
base may be one of the last closed by the Soviets.
   Because there is no firm exit date, the soldiers at the base
have a business-as-usual attitude, although they admit to being
eager to return home.
   ``We will go when we are told to go,'' said Alexander Alexandrov
of the Ukrainian city of Kharkov. ``Everything here is normal for
the time being, although we are of course happy that a settlement
has been reached in Geneva.''
   Soviet soldiers intervened in December 1979 to support the
government, and about 115,000 remain in Afghanistan.
   In keeping with Moscow's official contention that Afghanistan's
army is now strong enough to defend the country without Soviet
fighting power, the soldiers had high praise for the forces loyal
to President Najib.
   ``They will resolve their own problems,'' said Andrei Tarelkin,
a paratrooper from the Russian city of Ivanovo. He was one of
several decorated heroes turned out in full parade uniform Saturday
for the benefit of the visitors.
   ``The Afghan army is young, but it should be able to defend
itself.''
   Some Western observers here expect the rebel forces based in
Pakistan to move north and take control of parts of Afghanistan as
the Soviets retreat. Najib's regular army numbers only about 40,000
soldiers, many of them underage conscripts likely to flee if
government positions becomes indefensible.

   The top aide to a Maryland congressman jumped to
his death from a hotel window Sunday after The Washington Post
reported he had made bizarre demands of male staff members,
including asking one to do a striptease.
   Tom Pappas, 46, chief assistant to Rep. Roy P. Dyson, fell 18
stories to a seventh-floor roof of the Helmsley Palace Hotel, said
police spokesman Lt. Stephen Davis.
   The death appeared to be a suicide, Davis said. Pappas left a
note on hotel stationery, he said, but he declined to disclose its
contents.
   The Post article quoted former staff members as saying Dyson had
ceded control of his Washington office to Pappas. The newspaper
said Pappas used money from Dyson's re-election campaign to recruit
for a company Pappas owned, offering salaries up to $50,000 for
single young men, then coerced them to socialize with him.
   Dyson, a 39-year-old Democrat, was registered in a different
room from Pappas Sunday at the hotel, Davis said. The congressman
was interviewed by detectives, who would not comment on the
questioning.
   A hotel operator said a Roy P. Dyson was registered but was not
answering his phone.
   Dyson was elected to the House in 1980, unseating Rep. Robert A.
Bauman, a conservative Republican who was caught in a scandal when
the Post reported he was seen in public with young male prostitutes.
   The Post's front-page article about Dyson Sunday came as the
Federal Election Commission investigates allegations his campaign
disclosure reports concealed $6,650 in payments to Pappas.
   Pappas, paid $72,200 as Dyson's administrative assistant last
year, also owns a company, Pappenbauer Associates, that received
$119,642 in fees and expenses since 1980, a revised Dyson campaign
reports shows.
   Mark Frazer, Republican chairman in Dyson's district, told the
Easton (Md.) Star-Democrat he filed the complaint that led to the
FEC investigation, but it was the Post that had raised questions
about sexual discrimination and what Frazer called ``the apparently
established preference for young males in the recruiting and hiring
practices.''
   The newspaper quoted Dyson staff members as saying Pappas told
one male employee that he would have to perform a striptease at a
1987 office retreat. The unidentified aide refused.
   Scott Ourth, was quoted as saying that when he was recruited to
be Dyson's press secretary in December 1986 he was told he could
not date for a year and should devote all his time to the office.
Ourth quit within six months.
   The article also quoted Andy Hira, 22, a special assistant to
Pappas, as saying he was fired for refusing to stay at a party in
Dyson's Annapolis hotel suite last November, after Dyson announced
he would run for re-election in 1988. Fellow staff member James Fox
quit because of similar demands, Hira was quoted as saying.
   The newspaper quoted a memo from Pappas dated Nov. 14 as saying,
``...it is important for everyone on this staff to remember that
Tom Pappas is the chief of staff, responsible for everyone's
paycheck. When he expresses a wish, however slight, it should be
taken seriously.''
   Those interviewed were quoted as saying they did not believe the
pressure went beyond attending dinners and parties organized by
Pappas. Former aides also were quoted as saying Pappas excluded
female staff members from his social activities.
   The newspaper said Pappas issued a statement saying Dyson's
office ``has been run in an efficient and well-structured manner.
The office has been managed in a way which has served the people of
the 1st Congressional District of Maryland well for many years.''
   Neighbors and former staff members told the Post that Dyson
frequently stays at Pappas' large frame house in Accokeek, Md.,
about 20 miles south of Washington. Dyson's residence is further
south in St. Mary's County.

<HEAD>Atlanta Debates Saving `GWTW' Author's Apartment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Margaret Mitchell called it ``The Dump.'' And in
its current state, the apartment where she wrote much of ``Gone
With The Wind'' shows the effects of care by those who, frankly,
couldn't give a damn.
   The three-story brick and stucco building sits in the middle of
a muddy lot in midtown Atlanta. Its windows are broken or boarded,
its roof is sunken and torn, its walls are sooty.
   But a group with $850,000 in financial backing wants to save the
74-year-old building, saying it represents possibly the last chance
for Atlanta to properly honor one of its most celebrated residents.
   Developers, on the other hand, say ``The Dump'' can't be
restored and should be razed to create a park to complement a
recent flurry of construction in the neighborhood.
   Miss Mitchell and her husband, John Marsh, rented a first-floor
apartment at what was then called Windsor House Apartments from
1926 to 1932. She was killed in a 1949 automobile accident 13 years
after her epic novel of the Old South and Reconstruction was
published.
   The fate of the building is in federal court. Trammell Crow Co.,
which purchased the property in 1985, sued the city in January
after Mayor Andrew Young refused to sign a demolition permit for
the apartment building. Young had said he would support demolition
as a last resort, but the preservationist group came along and
Young agreed to try to save the building.
   Trammell Crow had begun landscaping work around the building.
Meanwhile, the group, Mitchell House Inc., is drumming up support
for a Mitchell memorial project.
   John Taylor, president of the group, says most of the other
Atlanta sites where Miss Mitchell lived have been destroyed,
leaving few physical reminders of the writer.
   `This is one of our last opportunities,'' he said.
   Taylor said wants to restore the building to the way it was in
Miss Mitchell's time, display the apartment where she did her
writing and establish a writer-in-residence program.
   While previous attempts at ``Gone With The Wind'' attractions
focused on the popular 1939 movie, Taylor said the apartment
project would emphasize Miss Mitchell's book.
   ``We'd like to keep the literary aspect in the forefront,'' he
said.
   The literary emphasis also would keep the project from becoming
merely a tourist attraction, he said, though the lack of a major
``Gone With The Wind'' center in Atlanta is a major impetus for the
effort.
   Taylor said the restoration effort has raised about $850,000 in
cash, pledges and pledged services. He said it also has the
endorsement from Miss Mitchell's only remaining heirs _ two nephews.
   Among the opponents are those who were acquainted with Miss
Mitchell and say she would be against the memorial.
   ``I'm opposed to saving what she called `The Dump' because
Margaret Mitchell herself told me on several occasions that she
wanted no museums or landmarks preserved in her memory,'' columnist
Celestine Sibley wrote recently in The Atlanta Constitution.
   But Taylor said there are many misconceptions about Miss
Mitchell, and the project would offer a chance to clarify her
background. And the recent announcement that a ``Gone With The
Wind'' sequel is being written by a Virginia author will generate
even more interest, he added.
   John Decker, marketing principal at Trammel Crow, said the
developer sponsored two studies of the site before deciding that
restoring the apartment was not feasible.
   One study, he said, found that the deterioration of the building
was worse than expected. The other concluded that the funds needed
for the project _ an estimated $2 million _ would not be available.
   If Trammel Crow's plans proceed, the park would have a
historical marker designating the site as the location of Miss
Mitchell's one-time residence, Decker said. Any surviving or
significant items from the building would be saved for inclusion in
a possible traveling museum of ``Gone With The Wind'' memorobilia,
he said.

   A World War II artillery shell that a boy had kept
in his toy box for six months exploded when he took it out to play,
and police said the blast killed him, injured his father and
destroyed their home.
   The Japanese Imperial Army shell exploded on Sunday, blowing out
the walls and windows of the boy's home in Obihiro in northern
Japan.
   The boy _ 9-year-old Takahiro Shibuya _ died from head injuries,
and his father, Satomi, 38, was injured in the stomach and one hand
when fragments of the shell hit him as he was walking outside the
home.
   Policeman Shinobu Kusakabe said the boy had kept the rusty
5-by-2 inch shell in his toy box since October. It not known where
the boy found the shell.

kitchens of the Columbus-based Battelle Memorial Institute, a
spokesman said.
   Food technologists at Battelle's laboratory in Geneva,
Switzerland, are licensing rights to the new chocolate formulation,
said laboratory spokesman Bernard L. Vollerin.
   ``Chocolate should melt in your mouth at approximately 37
degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) but it should not melt or
become fluid at outside temperatures at the same level,'' he said.
   The development would be a boon to candy distributors, who
cannot deliver chocolate during warm weather without expensive
refrigerated trucks, and it could keep chocolate sales steady
through the summertime and in hot-weather areas.
   Vollerin said consumers should not notice any difference in
appearance or taste.
   There's no secret ingredient other than ``some traces of natural
compounds,'' Vollerin said. ``It's the way we put them in. That's
the secret.''
   The process has been patented and licensed to a Japanese company
for marketing in the Orient, and negotiations are under way for the
licensing of U.S. and European rights, Vollerin said.
   If all goes well, test marketing could begin next year, he said.
   Geneva's food technology program also has developed new
cookie-baking techniques that spare heat-sensitive fillings such as
fresh fruit, nuts or chocolate chips, he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Scientists Leave U.S. Assured Test Ban Treaty Is
Cheat-Proof</HEAD>

   Soviet scientists toasted their U.S.
colleagues and then headed home after recording simulated low-yield
nuclear bomb blasts that both sides said showed cheating on a test
ban treaty could be detected.
   The successful weekend experiments in the Nevada desert and
similar ones last September in the Soviet Union used delicate
seismographs to detect minuscule shock waves from the explosions of
10- and 15-ton charges of dynamite, a fraction of the strength of
most nuclear weapons tests, from as far as 400 miles away.
   The experiments are expected to show that ``any chances for
cheating are about excluded'' under a test ban, Evgeni Velikhov,
vice president of the Soviet Academy and an adviser to Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, said Sunday.
   After seismometers detected the first detonation of 10 tons of
TNT on Friday, Charles Archambeau, a University of Colorado-Boulder
geophysics professor, said the experiments mean ``that we can more
accurately gauge the numbers and distribution of stations that will
be required to verify a low-threshold treaty.''
   Velikhov, wearing a sweatshirt that said, ``Arms are for Hugs,''
called a comprehensive test ban ``very important. It is extremely
important to stop the arms race.''
   The Soviets offered toast with vodka and beer on May Day, a
communist holiday.
   Scientists said they would turn to learning how to determine the
difference between nuclear weapons detonations and industrial
explosions by conducting more tests.
   Archambeau, head of the National Resources Defense Council's
seismic monitoring advisory committee, said he hoped both
governments would sponsor further experiments.
   The multimillion-dollar experiments in this country and in the
Soviet Union were conducted by the council, a private group, and by
the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   Archambeau and other scientists in the project had been
concerned that after the success of last year's research near the
Soviet test site, efforts here might be thwarted by Nevada's
fault-riddled geology, which soaks up sound waves. He said he was
relieved by the success of Saturday's final test.
   ``This is quite a strong signal. It's highly valuable,'' he said
after a 15-ton explosion 100 miles east of Carson City on Saturday
sent seismic needles quivering at the joint U.S.-Soviet monitoring
station in Deep Springs, Calif., 210 miles away.
   On Friday, 10 tons of TNT were detonated beneath the desert 100
miles north of Reno and another 10-ton shot was set off 50 miles
south of the Nevada Test Site.
   They were monitored at the joint station in Deep Springs, midway
between Reno and Las Vegas, and at two permanent Defense Council
installations closer to the Test Site 110 miles north of Las Vegas,
where all U.S. underground nuclear detonations are conducted. One
hundred forty additional temporary monitoring stations were set up
across Nevada.
   Friday's first test barely moved the seismometers at Deep
Springs and the second was not detected, but both showed up on more
sensitive digital instruments, said Holly Eissler, research
geophysicist at the University of California, San Diego.
   She noted that a limited nuclear test ban treaty passed by the
House last week forbids detonations larger than one kiloton, 100
times stronger than the 10-ton TNT blast.
   Thomas Cochran, senior staff scientist for the Defense Council
and a co-director of the test ban verification project, said the
council had spent about $3.5 million on the effort since it began
two years ago. He estimated the U.S. group's share of the weekend's
testing at about $300,000.

   A wintry storm moved into Colorado Sunday, piling snow up to a
foot deep in and west of the Rockies, whipping winds to 60 mph and
triggering a blinding dust storm blamed for two fatal traffic
pileups.
   Strong thunderstorms struck parts of Florida.
   Northwestern Wyoming got 8 inches of wet snow, closing the
eastern and southern entrances to Yellowstone National Park in the
morning. South of the park, 5 inches of snow was reported in Moose
and Jackson, where wet snow accumulating on power lines caused some
blackouts, the National Weather Service said.
   Up to 14 inches of snow was reported in the mountains and
foothills of south-central Montana.
   Snow also was widespread over eastern sections of Idaho and
northern Utah. Parts of eastern Idaho got 5 inches of snow
overnight. Up to 8 inches of snow was reported at Tooele, Utah,
with 7 inches at the Snowbird ski resort and 5 inches at Alta.
   In eastern Colorado, 50 mph winds spawned the dust storm, which
dropped visibility to zero and caused the pileups on Interstate 70
near Seibert about 45 miles west of the Kansas border, said Peter
Holmstedt of the Colorado State Patrol. Two motorists were killed,
and 17 people injured, authorities said.
   The incidents occurred in east- and westbound lanesof I-70
between Limon and Seibert. Nearly 45 miles of the highway was
closed for more than two hours before visibility improved.
   High trucks and trailers were banned from Interstate 80 at
Wendover, Utah, because of strong, gusty wind. Bryce Canyon, Utah,
reported gusts near 60 mph.
   In New Mexico, winds gusted to 80 mph in Ruidoso and 60 mph in
Albuquerque. Ruidoso's Sierra Blanca Regional Airport was closed.
   The northern and central high Plains also had gusty wind, with
gusts to more than 50 mph throughout the Dakotas and gusts to 60
mph in central Colorado at Gunnison and Trinidad.
   A day before, the difference in pressure between that storm and
a high-pressure front 700 miles off the West Coast generated 65 mph
wind in Southern California, generating waves that destroyed a
municipal pier and stranded 1,400 tourists on Santa Catalina Island.
   ``Whenever winds blow, it's due to a pressure difference, from
high to low, just like water running downhill,'' said Bob Grebe of
the weather service.
   On Sunday, the body of a man believed to be a boater who jumped
from a disabled craft in wind-tossed seas Saturday washed ashore
near the Los Angeles suburb of El Segundo, said Los Angeles County
Lifeguard Sgt. Tom Hargett.
   Another man knocked off a boat five miles north of Santa
Catalina Island on Saturday was missing Sunday, said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Charles Embleton.
   When the wind slammed 12-foot surf into the Redondo Beach
Municipal Pier on Saturday, a 155-foot section of the pier
collapsed, said city spokesman Jim Graham. A restaurant also was
damaged.
   An estimated 78,000 utility customers in Southern California had
power outages Saturday and some 1,400 tourists had to spend the
night on Catalina when the wind closed Avalon Harbor to the boats
that ferry island visitors.
   Hotels were full so tourists were sent to a local church. The
pastor farmed people out to parishioners, a high school gym and a
movie theater, said Donna Hunsucker, administrative assistant at
the Chamber of Commerce. Boats resumed running Sunday, she said.
   Strong thunderstorms rumbled across Southern Florida and the
Keys on Sunday, with three-quarter-inch hail and gusts up to 63 mph
reported near Marathon and Conch Key.
   Elsewhere, central New England had light showers.
   Monroe, La., posted a record low Sunday with a cool 43 degrees,
four degrees off the former mark set in 1965.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 27
degrees at Yellowstone National Park to 86 at McAllen, Texas. The
low for the day was 10 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   For Monday, occasionally heavy snow was forecast over central
and eastern Wyoming, south-central Montana and the northern
Colorado Rockies. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the northern Plains through Kansas into northwestern Texas.
Widespread showers were forecast across the northern Pacific Coast
region, with scattered showers across northern Maine.
   Highs only in the 30s were predicted across much of Wyoming; in
the 40s and 50s from the Pacific Northwest to the northern and
central Rockies, and across central and northern New England; in
the 80s from central and eastern Texas through the lower
Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast region to southern Florida, and
in the Arizona deserts; in the mid 90s to 100 across inland areas
of southern Texas; and in the 60s or 70s across much of the rest of
the nation.

   The nation's second largest automaker
today resumed operations after a 19-day strike in which workers won
a nearly 20 percent increase in their salaries.
   The automaker, Daewoo Motor Co., is a 50-50 joint venture with
General Motors Corp. of the United States.
   Daewoo's 6,000 employees returned to work after accepting an
11-point settlement that gave them, among other things, a
19.6-percent pay increase and some additional fringe benefits,
company officials said.
   They said the settlement increased the workers' monthly average
salary to $565, including fringe benefits. Daewoo's assembly line
workers went on strike April 12 and to demand a 26.6-percent pay
increase.
   Daewoo reached agreement with labor leaders over the weekend.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: On Lack of Charisma, Dukakis and Bush Sound Alike</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Michael Dukakis says seven years of
charisma in the White House was enough, George Bush would be the
first to acknowledge it's probably not a reference to him.
   ``You don't know how hard it's been to keep my own charisma in
check these past seven years,'' the vice president tells audiences,
tongue in cheek.
   On one subject, both Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner, and
Bush, who locked up the GOP presidential nomination earlier this
week, seem to agree. Both concede they are viewed as bland. And
both insist it's fine with them.
   Bush: ``What's wrong with being a boring sort of guy?''
   Dukakis: ``Maybe it's time for a little competence.''
   Are Bush and Dukakis really that boring?
   No, say the candidates themselves, not really. Both say their
wives don't think so, either.
   Yes, says John Sears, a political consultant who ran President
Reagan's 1976 campaign and the early part of his 1980 race.
   ``It's true at the moment. They're both saying they're managers.
That sounds pretty boring. We're looking for leaders here,'' he
said.
   In defense of Bush, Sears adds: ``In terms of one's ability to
compel deep feeling, the vice presidency is not an office in which
you can gain that.''
   In defense of Dukakis, Bob Beckel, who was Walter Mondale's
campaign manager in 1984, says: ``It's a good example of a guy who
understands his limitations and maximizes his assets. He didn't try
to make himself something he wasn't.''
   Neither Bush nor Dukakis has been able to evoke the kind of
passionate responses from audiences that, say, Reagan or Democratic
contender Jesse Jackson do regularly.
   The Massachusetts governor has been known to scratch jokes out
of prepared speeches. The vice president has a half dozen standard
jokes he uses regularly, but sometimes he muffs the delivery.
   Both are widely viewed as pragmatists, not ideologues.
   And when talking about themselves, the two men likely to be
rivals in the fall sound remarkably alike.
   ``People are not looking for a lot of pizazz out there. They're
looking for someone who's stable, whose had some experience, a
record of achievement, has values they can identify with. ...
Running for president is serious business.''
   Dukakis? No, Bush.
   Here's Dukakis: ``The fact is, after seven years of charisma,
it's time for accomplishment and a record.''
   Even when the candidates are insisting they really aren't all
that boring, they sound alike.
   Bush: ``My wife doesn't think that (I'm boring). I don't know
about Mrs. Dukakis, what she thinks. Or Mrs. Jesse Jackson. ... I
think that I'm a scintillating kind of guy.''
   Dukakis: ``People say I'm not a passionate guy. ... My wife
thinks I'm passionate and so does Playgirl Magazine.'' The
publication had put the Massachusetts governor on a list of
best-dressed males.
   Dukakis also is fond of pointing out that the word charisma,
like himself, is of Greek ancestry. He doesn't usually elaborate,
but the implication is that there must be a little charisma in him.
   Bush says he doesn't plan to change his image. He recently told
reporters he won't ``kind of suddenly get my hair colored and dance
up and down in a miniskirt or do something to show that I've got a
lot of jazz out there and drop a bunch of one-liners.''
   William Schneider, a political analyst with the American
Enterprise Institute, says both candidates are indeed boring _ and
should leave it at that. Efforts to appear otherwise come off as
sounding silly, Schneider suggested.
   ``Boring politicians do pretty well in this country,'' he said.
``Richard Nixon was pretty boring. Jimmy Carter was boring. Lyndon
Johnson seemed boring, at least in comparison with Barry Goldwater.
And we elected Reagan with a lot of reservations. He was too
interesting. But he was elected because of our desperate desire for
a change.''
   With two boring candidates running, that personality trait
should cancel itself out, Schneider suggested.
   But are they equally boring?
   ``Between them? Dukakis is a little more boring,'' Schneider
said.
   ``George Bush has more of a tendency to say foolish things. In
that sense, he's not boring. But the only way for him to make
himself not boring is by making himself into a joke.''
   Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was Carter's domestic affairs adviser,
said a presidential candidate with charisma is ``the exception
rather than the rule.''
   ``In 1976, Ford and Carter were not exactly accused of being
charismatic candidates,'' Eizenstat said.
   However, Eizenstat said it may be too early to rule out the
charisma factor entirely.
   ``Candidates take on a certain charisma, which will come out
when they're anointed as nominees of their parties, they may not
have now. All the hoopla of national conventions invests people
with a certain halo effect.''
   In any event, Eizenstat said he personally doesn't find either
Bush or Dukakis boring. Dull, perhaps, but not boring.
   ``I don't, because what turns me on are public policy issues and
people who are interested in discussing them.''

   The stakes in world-champion
banana-split making got a bit higher _ er, longer _ thanks to the
determined residents of this central Pennsylvania town.
   Using 33,000 bananas, 2,500 gallons of ice cream and 150 gallons
of chocolate syrup, Selinsgrove made a 4.5-mile-long banana split
Saturday in a bid to regain a place in the Guinness Book of World
Records.
   ``It's something for the town to say, `When we work together,
anything is possible,''' said Kelly Stoops, a Selinsgrove teacher
who organized the event to raise money for a community development
organization.
   About 24,000 people standing and sitting in front of one-foot
sections of the 12.6 million-calorie dessert dug in at 4:30 p.m.
Each paid $2 for the privilege.
   ``It was getting pretty soupy after a while,'' said Robert Linn
of New Berlin, who was standing near the middle of the giant split,
made in three sections up Market Street through the center of this
town of 5,500 residents.
   Selinsgrove set the record for the world's longest banana spilt
in 1982 with a 1.5-mile concoction, winning a place in the 1983
Guinness Book.
   But in 1983, New York high school students created a banana
split a tenth of a mile longer.
   Selinsgrove on Saturday outdid Zeta Beta Tau Sorority at Bowling
Green University in Ohio, which created a 4-mile banana split in
1985, organizers said.
   A surveying company would verify the length of the banana split
and send the results to Guinness.
   Six hundred captains each produced 40-foot sections of the
dessert, made in a cardboard trough from empty carpet rolls.
   In addition to the ice cream, bananas and chocolate sauce,
organizers sprinkled on 600 pounds of chopped nuts, 150 gallons
each of strawberries and pineapples and 24,000 cherries.

   If all the quarters given away to
casino customers here last year were combined in one roll, the
package would stretch from Atlantic City to the outskirts of St.
Louis, more than 917 miles.
   Customers received more than $218.4 million, or 10.9 million
pounds, in complimentary quarters last year just for walking in the
doors of the city's 12 casinos, according to financial reports the
gaming halls filed with the state Casino Control Commission.
   That translates into more than 873.6 million quarters _ more
quarters than the U.S. Mint made in 1978, the year the first casino
opened here.
   ``No wonder we can't get change people,'' one casino official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, quipped, referring to the
industry's difficulty in finding enough workers to sell coins on
casino floors.

   They tasted, tossed, and generally
touted horseradish at an outdoor bash in this Southern Illinois
community to honor the tangy root.
   ``We grow one-half to two-thirds of the world's crop in this
area. We think that's something,'' said Craig Keller, president of
the Tri-County Vegetable Growers Association, which sponsored the
first International Horseradish Festival on Saturday to promote
Madison County as the horseradish capital of the world.
   Both horseradish connoisseurs and novices strolled past the food
booths and displays in a Collinsville park.
   ``I love horseradish,'' said Melvin Lytle, 67, of Edwardsville.
``It clears the sinuses. And they say it's an aphrodisiac.''
   ``Honey and horseradish makes a good cough medicine,'' added his
wife, Helen, 66.
   In addition to tasting recipes made with horseradish, some
people participated in the Horseradish Olympics _ which included a
root toss, where contestants tried to lob foot-long horseradish
roots farther than anyone else, and a hot dog eating contest. The
dogs, of course, were slathered with horseradish.

   A supporter of extremist Lyndon LaRouche is
taking over the nation's second-largest local Democratic Party, but
concerned party members have stripped the post of most of its power
and even its office.
   Claude Jones stunned Texas' Harris County by winning election
March 8 as chairman.
   Jones, who was scheduled to take office today, blames his lack
of clout within the party on ``Democratic elitists'' who he says
are more concerned about their status than the party itself.
   ``There are some people in the Democratic Party that aren't
being very democratic,'' he said.
   The group's bylaws were changed by the party's 34-member
steering committee three days after the election, when Jones
narrowly defeated incumbent Larry Veselka.
   The unanimous final approval of the bylaw changes came April 15
by the 664-member executive committee, made up of precinct
chairmen. Jones tried to thwart the vote, but a state district
judge denied his request for a temporary restraining order.
   Embarrassed Democratic Party leaders say Jones was elected to
the 2-year-old post by accident because of his common name and the
race's obscurity. Veselka, an attorney, was unable to campaign in
the weeks before the election because he was involved in a trial
outside Houston.
   Jones says he won because he worked hard pushing LaRouche issues
that ``finally hit a nerve.''
   His election shocked party leaders, who face working under a
chairman associated since 1975 with a perennial presidential
candidate who claims the Queen of England is involved in drug
trafficking and has called for a quarantine of all AIDS patients.
   Jones, whom Veselka defeated in 1986, said his sole occupation
is working for LaRouche. He staffs solicitation booths the LaRouche
organization sponsors at airports and other public places.
   Harris County, which includes Houston, trails only Illinois'
Cook County, which includes Chicago, in size as an election
district. Harris County will send more delegates to the Democratic
National Convention this summer than 17 states.
   When Jones assumes his limited duties, he'll have no office at
the party's headquarters. Quarters that Veselka used are occupied
by another staffer, said Bill Ramsey, the party's executive
director.
   ``Mr. Jones will have access to any records he needs. He just
won't be able to come in and tell staffers what to do,'' Ramsey
said.
   Scott Ramsey, Jones' attorney, says the new bylaws prohibit his
client from performing his statutory duties, such as record-keeping
and handling the party's primary.
   But David Webb, the party's general counsel, counters that the
chairman's duties under the law are to handle the county primary,
which involves accepting applications and certifying the candidates.
   Under the old rules, the chairman raised funds for Democratic
candidates in the district and largely determined how that money
was spent.
   Now only the party's secretary and treasurer have access to the
money.
   ``Not very many people are going to give money if Claude Jones
is in control,'' Bill Ramsey said. He said Jones might not be able
to deliver the votes or might not want to support a mainstream
Democrat.
   Jones also will have little power to set priorities for the
local party.
   ``He will carry the title and preside over the meetings, but he
won't set the agenda. He can't stray from the agenda, either,''
Bill Ramsey said.
   For now, Jones said he isn't sure of his plans except that he
wants to bring more people into the Democratic Party during his
term. His attorney says they haven't ruled out a possible return to
court.
   Despite the squabbles, Jones has done one good thing, says
Barbara Stanley, a past county chairwoman: ``He has united the
Democratic Party of Harris County.''

   Democratic Party officials in suburban
Philadelphia's 5th Congressional District are stuck with a
candidate they don't want: a backer of political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche.
   One official said party leaders were focusing on other campaigns
when LaRouche backer Donald Hadley defeated Robert W. Houchins, a
little-known candidate endorsed by the party, in Tuesday's
congressional primary.
   Hadley, a sales representative from Drexel Hill, will face Rep.
Richard Schulze, a well-financed Republican, in November's election.
   Houchins has blamed his loss on the Democratic organization in
Montgomery, Chester and Delaware counties, which make up the
district, and on voters, whom he accused of ignorance.
   ``Charles Manson could run for office and get elected,'' he said
Friday.
   ``The county committees did not take LaRouche seriously, the
area leaders did not take him seriously and the committee people
did not take him seriously. ... So ultimately the voter didn't take
the LaRouche threat seriously.''
   Party leaders agreed.
   ``Of course, it's our party's responsibility and obviously we
failed,'' said Delaware County Democratic Committee Chairwoman
Dianne Merlino. ``We should have exercised our maximum effort to
promote Houchins.''
   On Friday, Montgomery County Democratic Chairman Philip Berg
called for Hadley to step down to let a ``legitimate candidate
run.''
   Berg said he would rather see Schulze win. ``It would be better
than having a LaRouchian,'' he said.
   LaRouche, a perennial presidential candidate, has promoted a
quarantine of AIDS victims and the colonization of Mars, and has
charged that Queen Elizabeth II of England is a drug dealer.
   He is on trial in Boston with six aides and five of his
political groups on charges they conspired to obstruct a federal
grand jury investigation. The grand jury was probing allegations
that more than $1 million was raised for LaRouche's 1984
presidential campaign through credit card and loan fraud
   In an interview with the Delaware County Times, Hadley said he
openly identified himself with LaRouche and won the election
because of voters' dissatisfaction with mainstream Democratic
candidates.
   But Berg and other Democrats contend that Hadley concealed the
affiliation.
   ``I don't believe there was anything indicating he was a
LaRouchian published by him. I think he was more surprised than
other people that he even won,'' Berg said. ``No one could even get
a hold of him. I never saw him, I never met him, he was never at
any meetings held by the Montgomery County Democratic Committee. I
never received one phone call from him, not one piece of literature
from him.''
   Hadley said he was in the streets daily ``talking face-to-face
with people, talking about why they're trying to railroad LaRouche,
why they're trying to keep him out of politics.''
   ``I told them what we've got to do to get the economy in shape.
... That's what people are interested in.''
   Ms. Merlino said Hadley won because he was first on the ballot,
the candidates' names were similar and the victor made
misrepresentations.
   ``I didn't think the problem would be so big that we couldn't
overcome it in Delaware County,'' she said. ``I should have done
more. I should have been more aware.''
   Delaware County was the only one of the three that carried
Houchins. Overall, Hadley had 10,667 votes, or 53 percent, and
Houchins had 9,298 votes, or 47 percent, with 99 percent of the
vote counted.
   Democrats in the Republican stronghold were busy backing
candidates in other races, Ms. Merlino said.
   Berg and Ms. Merlino said their committees will not back him.
State party Chairman Larry Yatch said he and his aides are studying
what measures to take in the election.
   Dana Scanlon, a spokeswoman for the LaRouche for President
campaign, said Hadley is unlikely to receive much funding but will
get help from LaRouche supporters.

<HEAD>Government Giving Indian Children Weak Education, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Indian children educated in schools
run by the federal government score worse on standardized tests
than 79 percent of students nationwide, a new report says.
   The report is the first such compilation of test scores at
schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, an Interior Department
official said. It was compiled by the bureau itself and has been
released to tribes and others for comment.
   The report blames many shortcomings on a lack of leadership _
sometimes actual lack of leaders, as shown by a 33 percent turnover
rate among principals, use of acting directors of the Office of
Indian Education Programs for five out of the past six years and 11
vacancies on the 40-person headquarters staff.
   Bureaucratic turf battles also contribute to the problems, it
says.
   ``Collegiality, the act of putting aside vested interests and
working for the good of the whole, is found in America's best
educational institutions but is often missing in the BIA system,
where administrators are sometimes more interested in shoring up
and expanding their administrative domain,'' the report says.
   The 260-page document asks tribal leaders, school boards and
others to consider an ``effective schools'' strategy including
steps to hold BIA educators more accountable for their students'
performance.
   It also suggests expanded authority to waive Indian hiring
preferences, and loans to educate prospective teachers that would
be increasingly forgiven the longer the teachers stayed at work in
a bureau school.
   The report says pressure to hire Indian teachers _ now 41
percent of the teaching staff _ means some are poorly trained and
``deficient in the basic reading, writing and mathematical skills
they were expected to teach.'' Some of those checked for the study
had failed state certification tests, which all teachers now are
supposed to pass.
   ``Matters of budgets, personnel, facilities and other
administrative tasks, rather than education itself, preoccupy too
many principals,'' the report added. ``Some BIA teachers seem to
begin with the expectation that their students will do poorly. ...
Too many responsible officials in BIA education do not seek to lead
but merely get by from day to day.''
   The bureau educates 37,917 Indian students, about 10 percen of
the nation's young Indians. About 30 percent attend boarding
schools and about 30 percent are in schools run by tribes under
contract with the bureau.
   The best schools barely approach average national scores.
Overall the bureau's students ranked in the 21st percentile on
standardized tests _ that is, they did worse than 79 percent of all
children taking the test.
   Only one of the bureau's district offices had a single grade
above the national median, the 50th percentile. The 27
second-graders of New Mexico's Northern Pueblo district averaged in
the 52nd percentile.
   Tribal leaders and school boards have had access to their own
scores before, but the report provides the first opportunity for
one tribe or area to compare its standing with another, said an
Interior Department official who discussed the document on
condition that he not be identified.
   The worst scores were recorded in the Chinle district of
Arizona, where 202 fourth-graders and 154 fifth-graders, mostly
from rural Navajo families, wound up in the 7th percentile.
   The report highlights some success stories, but at the same time
says the positive developments need to be pointed out more
effectively to other schools and areas.
   For instance, the Dilcon and Chuska boarding schools for Navajo
in the Fort Defiance district use a special curriculum requiring
students to write something every day. Their eighth-graders do
well, with Dilcon's two months ahead of the national average.

<HEAD>Error Causes Change In Winner Of Statewide Math Contest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORMAL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A numerical error led officials to crown the
wrong team winner of a state high school math contest, but a rival
suburban Chicago school reclaimed the honors after a recount,
officials said.
   Officials of the Illinois Council of Teachers of Mathematics
State Math Contest considered the appeal of New Trier High School's
coach and found he was right. Final score: New Trier 992, Evanston
Township High 979.
   A clerk tabulating the scores gave New Trier of Winnetka only
three points in one event Saturday when it should have received 33
in the competition at Illinois State University.
   ``We regret it was announced that Evanston was the first-place
winner,'' said Thomas Shilgalis, a contest official.
   ``It's really nice to win, it's gratifying to win, but winning
isn't why you do it,'' said John Benson, coach of Evanston's math
club. ``It's not football.''
   Some Evanston students were disappointed.
   ``We all started cheering and jumping up and down,'' senior
Catherine Epp said Sunday. ``We were in first place for the first
time, which was really fantastic.''
   Still, Epp, the individual winner in the geometry event, said,
``I think that having fun and learning good math is a lot more
important than whether we win state.''
   Saturday's win brought New Trier its eighth consecutive crown in
the contest and also pitted two schools whose rivalry is fierce _
in the classroom and the playing field.
   Rhoad called this year's event the ``battle of the giants''
because Evanston and New Trier placed high in a national written
math contest in March. Of the 14,000 schools entered, Evanston
placed first, a Canadian school placed second and New Trier was
third.
   At the weekend contest here, students competed in 13 events,
including a relay in which each member of a four-student team
worked on one-fourth of the problem.

<HEAD>Jackson: Campaign a Success, With or Without Nomination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson gazed from a balcony over the
sunny, riverfront lawn party where a well-dressed crowd sipped wine.
   ``No one ever told us it was going to be easy,'' Jackson shouted
to the 300 partygoers.
   But the candidate wanted his predominately black audience to
remember something: ``When you consider what we came from, we don't
have the ability to get tired.
   ``This is not just Iowa to Atlanta. This is from the back of the
bus in Montgomery to being within one of three to being the next
president.''
   It is a theme that has become increasingly prominent for Jackson
in recent days after his heavy losses in the Pennsylvania and New
York primaries.
   He is sounding a twofold message as he trails Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis down the home stretch of the primary season:
   First, he vows to fight on to win the nomination and raise
issues. But second, Jackson highlights the historic aspect of his
candidacy, casting it in terms that spell victory whether he wins
or loses the nomination.
   In the face of a new poll showing Dukakis with a 40-point lead
in Ohio, whose primary is Tuesday, Jackson appeared to be dwelling
increasingly on this over the weekend.
   By pointing to his unquestioned successes and the wide
acceptance his candidacy has received, Jackson paints his effort as
an outgrowth of the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and another
step on the road to full equality for blacks.
   He contrasts his bid for the White House with the grim days more
than two decades ago when people died fighting for just the right
to vote.
   So as he campaigns across Ohio, he tells church crowds and
rallies that his candidacy is far more than a journey from the Iowa
caucuses in February to this summer's Democratic convention in
Atlanta.
   It's a journey that began when blacks began rebelling in
Montgomery, Ala., against being forced to ride in the back of the
bus, he said.
   And it's a mission that must be carried forward by people like
the well-heeled crowd at the estate of physician Alfred Jefferson
in this Columbus suburb, he told them.
   He said reporters are asking him after his string of losses,
``How can you go on?''
   Jackson's answer: ``Do you know how far we've come? ... We're
almost to the top of the hill. We've come too far. We must press
forward.''
   The crowd laughed with acknowledgement when he pointed to the
strides they have made financially, saying, ``Most of us standing
here today are one generation out of chitlins.''
   To dramatize his point, Jackson related as he often does the
story of his humble South Carolina beginnings _ born to a teenage
mother and the married man next door, living in a house with
wallpaper for warmth not decoration, waiting to eat Thanksgiving
dinner until his mother came home with leftovers from the table of
the white people whose meal she had prepared.
   Jackson sometimes seems amazed himself as he tells the story.
   ``When I win, there are no more impossible dreams,'' he often
says.
   But in keeping with his portrayal of his candidacy as part of a
historical continuum, he told his Dublin audience that he expects
them to carry on the movement. He said they must ``translate this
movement'' into demands for blacks in positions of authority at
banks and universities and corporations where there are still
barriers, as well as in government.
   ``When I shake apples from the tree, you must pick up these
apples and make them into jelly and take them to the market,'' he
said.
   ``To have continuity in our struggle we must establish a
heritage of success in the government for all coming generations.''

<HEAD>Soviet Grain Goal Questioned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's grain production target for
1988 is unrealistic, despite Moscow's well-publicized ``intensive
technology program'' to boost agricultural output, according to an
Agriculture Department analyst.
   Christian J. Foster of the department's Economic Research
Service said this year's Soviet target is 235 million metric tons,
including wheat, corn and other grains.
   ``This total is unrealistic, even though it is only 2 million
tons above the 1987 goal,'' Foster said. ``Soviet plans continue to
call for unlikely grain output goals of 250 million to 255 million
tons by 1990 and 260 million to 280 million by 1995.''
   A major part of Soviet strategy is the intensive technology
program, which means greater use of better-quality fertilizers,
pesticides, seed and farm equipment. It also means use of these
production items should be concentrated on the best soils.
   Foster said that in 1986 almost 73 percent of the area planted
to wheat and other ``small'' grains was fertilized, a record. The
application rate per hectare (2.47 acres) was up 20 percent from
1985 and nearly 70 percent from 1980.
   ``Moreover, the fertilizers, which have often benefited mainly
weeds, have been increasingly supplemented by herbicides and other
plant protection agents (PPAs),'' he said in the May issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``To compensate for lower quality
domestically produced PPAs, emphasis has been placed on imports of
more potent chemicals from the West.''
   By 1990, Moscow plans to use intensive technology on as much as
50 million hectares, ``despite the fact that constraints to
broadening the program are already appearing in its slowing rate of
expansion,'' Foster said.
   The area for intensive technology rose about 10 million hectares
in 1986 from less than 19 million hectares in 1985, he said. But
the increase slowed to about 6 million hectares in 1987 and is
planned to increase only 4 million in 1988.
   ``Furthermore, the additional grain production from intensive
technology in 1987 was a reported 25 million tons, only 1 million
more than in 1986,'' Foster said. ``This is in spite of a reported
20 percent increase from 1986 in the area under the program.''
   Last year's Soviet grain output was 211.3 million tons, up only
1 percent from 1986, but Foster noted that it was the first time
ever that two consecutive grain crops of more than 200 million tons
had been harvested.
   Bad weather hurt the quality of 1987 grain, although the average
yield of 1.83 tons per hectare was second only to the record 1.85
tons harvested in 1978. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.
   Foster said the 1988 winter grain crop, which includes winter
wheat, rye and barley, was planted under favorable conditions last
fall and is thought to have suffered below-average winterkill.
   ``A concern of Soviet farmers in the New Lands this spring is
the lack of high-quality seed for spring grain,'' he said. ``The
quality of seed stocks was below average in the areas with
harvesting problems last year _ the Urals region, the Volga region,
northern Kazakhstan, West Siberia and the Non-Black Soil Zone.''
   A chronic problem for Soviet planners _ partly related to
climate and geography _ is the production of milling wheat, the
high-quality grain desired for bread, pasta and other food products.
   ``Their problems persist despite plans calling for
self-sufficiency in food grains, and despite wheat production twice
the size of food needs,'' Foster said.
   As a result, the Soviet Union has looked to foreign sources for
high-quality wheat to augment its own vast harvests of lower
quality grain. The United States, particularly since subsidized
prices have been available under USDA's Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP, has been the main beneficiary.
   In the international marketing year that will end June 30, the
Soviet Union will import around 22 million tons of wheat, with the
United States providing about half, up from less than 1 percent
just two years ago.
   ``The expected increase in the U.S. share of Soviet wheat
imports in 1987-88 likely will be at the expense of other primary
suppliers _ Canada, the EEC (European Economic Community),
Argentina and Australia,'' Foster said.

Violations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gunther Herbig said he planned to resign as
conductor of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra because of numerous
violations of his contract, a newspaper reported today.
   Herbig, the orchestra's conductor since 1984, told musicians
about his plans during intermission of Saturday night's concert. On
Sunday, he declined to discuss his resignation, effective when his
contract expires in 1990, The Detroit News said.
   Several musicians told newspaper that Herbig cited several
complaints, many of them related to the orchestra's financial
troubles.
   Among Herbig's complaints, they said, were cancellation of a
1989-90 tour of the Far East; refusal to guarantee frequent
domestic tours; reduction of the number of guaranteed musicians
from 103 to 97; and refusal to promise the orchestra will move in
1989-90 from Ford Auditorium to Orchestra Hall.
   ``Herbig told us that virtually the only thing they honored in
the contract was payment, and that even that was sometimes late,''
said Maxim Janowsky, a DSO bassist.
   Orchestra board Chairman Walter J. McCarthy Jr. said in a
statement Sunday that the orchestra's financial troubles caused the
board to fail to meet some terms of Herbig's contract.
   But it was the board's ``intention and hope to honor Maestro
Herbig's contract in every detail,'' the statement said.
   Herbig said he would complete a second three-year term under a
contract he signed in 1987, leaving 28 months to work with
management in finding a replacement.
   The orchestra in November, while musicians were in the midst of
a 12-week work stoppage, announced a deficit of $1.4 million for
the 1986-87 season, raising its cumulative deficit to $4.1 million
against an annual budget of $14 million.
   A deficit reduction campaign has been launched. But The News,
citing an unidentified source close to the orchestra, said
musicians were told last week an additional deficit of $400,000 was
anticipated for this season.

<TEXT>
   The 75-year-old president of the Cook County
Board denied allegations he traded patronage jobs for sexual
favors, saying he was guilty of nothing more than poor judgment and
having sex that ``hurt no one.''
   George Dunne, who is also chairman of the powerful county
Democratic Party, read a short statement at a news conference
Sunday, then got into a shouting match with a reporter, went to his
office and locked the door.
   In his statement, Dunne called the allegations ``repulsive'' and
said they were an attempt to smear a reputation built in 35 years
in public office.
   He said the allegations raised by the Better Government
Association, a private watchdog group, and Chicago television
station WMAQ, ``wrongfully portray me as some sort of perverted old
man.''
   The association contends that Dunne engaged in three-way sex and
strip poker with various pairs of four lesbian women at his farm
near Hebron between 1980, the year his wife died, and 1986.
   While Dunne acknowledges having sex with two women he later
hired, he said his actions ``were not sordid, filthy or illegal.''
   In his latest denial of the accusations, Dunne said he was
guilty of nothing except ``extremely poor judgment'' and ``having
relationships with the opposite sex, which hurt no one.''
   Dunne, president of the county's governing board for 19 years,
rejected the association's call that he resign.
   ``There is nothing that I have done over those years that has
violated the public trust in me,'' he said.
   He refused to say whether it was appropriate to hire women after
having sex with them, and told a WMAQ reporter who repeatedly asked
that question, ``You're the scum of the earth and so is the BGA.''
   BGA Executive Director J. Terrence Brunner has admitted that
``as far as we know,'' Dunne did not make sex a condition for
hiring the women.
   ``Within two weeks in two instances, the people are on the
public payroll,'' Brunner said Sunday. ``To me, that's an obvious
link. There's no doubt about it.''
   Three of the women Dunne allegedly had sex with are on the Cook
County payroll and one used to be, the Chicago Tribune reported
Sunday.
   The BGA says one of the women who had sex with Dunne has been an
officer with the county Forest Preserve police since 1984, and
another was hired by the preserve as a laborer in 1980.
   Don Rose, a former political aide to Mayors Harold Washington
and Jane Byrne, said he doubts Dunne broke any laws.
   ``It's clear that he simply used his immense hiring powers ...
in effect to pass out favors to friends,'' Rose said. ``That's not
illegal ... but it is exemplary of really terrible abuse of the
patronage system.
   ``This is the kind of scandal that has brought down
governments,'' he said. ``However, Chicago being what it is, you
find more people on the street commenting on his virility at age 75
than whether or not this was a heinous act.''

<TEXT>
   Beijing University, survivor of invasions,
repression and political warfare, commemorates on Wednesday its
90th anniversary as China's foremost center of learning.
   The celebrations have been pegged not to the college's founding
date in 1898 but to a famous uprising on May 4, 1919, that vaulted
Beijing University students into the vanguard of China's
revolutionary and nationalist movements.
   The university marks its birthday with symposiums on its great
thinkers, publication of books chronicling the university's role in
shaping modern China, sports competition and disco and folk dancing.
   But as it enters its 10th decade, Beida, as it is known in its
abbreviated Chinese form, faces yet another crisis, a lack of money
that educators claim could seriously erode its standards of
excellence.
   ``We have many problems,'' said Huang Huaicheng, director of the
president's office. ``Facilities are quite backward and need to be
renovated. Students live six to a room. There are not enough
classrooms and the library is inadequate. We can't even buy all the
books we need.''
   Huang said the school last year had to cut corners to make up a
$1.3 million gap between planned spending and funds of $8.1 million
from the government and other sources.
   He said there's no money left to boost pay for instructors, who
start out at less than $30 a month, about the same as an unskilled
laborer, and seldom make more than $55.
   Most of China's 1,000 universities share the same financial
plight. The government, acknowledging that education has been
neglected in the past, is spending more, but must give priority to
lower education in a nation still 20 percent illiterate.
   The government now is encouraging teachers to help out colleges
and bolster their meager incomes by moonlighting. Universities are
being told to make money by selling basic services and technology.
   Beida students and faculty, living up to their activist
traditions, have been the first to question the wisdom of this
policy. Students with shoeshine kits appeared on Beijing's central
Tiananmen Square to show what they thought of sideline jobs.
   Open letters to members of China's parliament and big-character
posters on the campus recently spoke of the ``crisis'' engendered
by the government's investing in industrial development rather than
its human resources.
   ``Beida students have a tradition of being concerned about the
future of the country,'' Huang said.
   University President Ding Shisin defended the protestors and
complained to Chinese journalists that some department heads at the
university didn't even have their own offices.
   Beijing University began in 1898 as the Peking Imperial
University. It was founded during the Qing Dynasty's ``100-Day
Reform,'' a short-lived effort to introduce some Western ideas in
government and education.
   For its first two decades, the school's main role was to turn
out government functionaries, and among its less kind nicknames
were ``the gambling den'' and ``fountainhead of ribaldry and
bawdiness.''
   That changed in 1916 when Cai Yuanpei, a classical scholar who
had studied in Europe, became president. Cai introduced Western
scholarship and coed education and brought in educators such as
Chen Duxiu, one of the fathers of Chinese leftism, and Hu Shi, who
studied under American pragmatist John Dewey and led the movement
to use the vernacular language in Chinese literature.
   One of China's first Marxists, Li Dazhao, was librarian and then
professor at Beida. Among his library assistants was Mao Tse-tung.
   Beida and other Beijing universities moved to the southwest
China city of Kunming after Japanese troops invaded the capital in
1937, returning only in 1946 after World War II ended.
   Three years later Mao came to power in Beijing, bringing with
him strong anti-intellectual biases.
   In 1957, when Mao encouraged critics to speak out with the
slogan, ``Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of
thought contend,'' Beida teachers declared that ``the masses want
to overthrow the Communist Party.'' They were among the first to be
purged in a subsequent crackdown.
   Ma Yinzhu, an American-educated economist, was replaced as
president in 1960 and disappeared shortly after knocking government
policies in a magazine article where he said, ``It is not enough to
destroy; one must build.''
   The first clashes of the disastrous Cultural Revolution began at
Beida in 1966 when Nie Yuanzi, a woman in the philosophy department
backed by Mao's wife Jiang Qing, leveled attacks on university
President Lu Ping.
   In the next few years hundreds on the campus were detained,
driven to suicide or murdered in armed battles between rival
radical factions.
   For a decade almost all classes were suspended and no degrees
were given. ``The Cultural Revolution brought overall destruction
to the university,'' Huang said.
   He said entrance exams were revived in 1977. The school now
accepts about one out of five examinees. It has offered degrees
since 1981.
   The school now has 20,000 students, including post-graduates and
special students, with a freshman class of about 2,000. Since its
merger in 1952 with Yanjing University, a former American
missionary college, it has occupied 500 acres of wooded land in
northwest Beijing.
   Qing Dynasty-style buildings with red pillars and slanted, tiled
roofs and surrounded by bamboo groves and lakes are one throwback
to the Yanjing period.
   One fixture that will be missing at 90th anniversary
celebrations will be a giant statue of Mao, torn down late one
night in April by university workmen. Teachers who helped build the
monolith during the early days of the Cultural Revolution applauded
its removal, saying it was one reminder of the past they could live
without.

<HEAD>Voters Overseas to Get Blank Ballots</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ballots without the names of specific
candidates will be available for the first time to an estimated 3
million Americans in other countries who are eligible to vote on
Nov. 8 for the next president.
   The new, fill-in-the-blank ballots are for people who may not be
able to get a regular absentee ballot submitted in time _ from a
remote mission in Africa, for example, or a submarine at sea for
months. But mostly they are for the victims of slow mail deliveries.
   Henry Valentino, head of the Federal Voting Assistance Program
Office, said a million of these write-in ballots will be sent in
July to all U.S. embassies and consulates and to the voting
officers attached to each military unit overseas. The object is to
increase the number of Americans who vote, even if they are
working, traveling or living abroad.
   Canada and Mexico have the largest number of such civilians. The
biggest numbers of military are in West Germany, Japan and South
Korea.
   Valentino estimates that in the 1984 election, about 55 percent
of the overseas military and 35 percent of civilians cast ballots.
For civilians, that was much lower than the national average of
53.1 percent.
   He also estimates on the basis of polls that 8.5 percent _
roughly 250,000 _ tried to vote but failed to get in a regular
absentee ballot and have it counted by voting authorities at home.
There were many causes, including failure to write the proper
office in time, failure of local authorities to mail the ballot in
time, failure of the voter to mail it back, or failure of local
deliveries abroad.
   Absentee ballots that arrive too late are not counted.
   ``We just got a court order Monday to make election officials in
Pennsylvania count absentee ballots received up to 10 days after
the April 26 primary,'' Valentino said in an interview.
   ``Most Pennsylvania election officials began mailing their
absentee ballots only two weeks before the election.''
   One reason for slow mailing by local authorities is that they
have to wait until candidates are named before they can start
printing.
   The blank absentee ballots will be usable only for federal
positions in the general election on Nov. 8. The voter must first
write for a regular absentee ballot from his or her district at
home, getting the application in at least 30 days before Election
Day.
   If the absentee ballot does not reach the voter in time, he or
she can write in the name of a choice for president, for senator if
there is a senatorial election in the state and for a member of the
House of Representatives.
   The names of political parties can be written instead, and such
tickets may be split.
   ``You can write the name of one party as your choice for
president and another party for the senator, if you don't write
individual names,'' Valentino explained.
   State authorities will have to count the write-in ballot as they
do regular absentee ballots.
   The write-ins are not to be used or distributed within the
United States, including Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and
American Samoa. But they will be sent to units deploying to
overseas assignments and to ships and submarines expected to be at
sea on Election Day.

   Special interest groups have supplied $53
million to congressional candidates in the last 15 months, with the
chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee making the
biggest haul.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who faces a challenge this fall
from Republican Rep. Beau Boulter, led the list of recipients of
political action committee money with $1.4 million.
   Bentsen also ranked as the largest overall fund-raiser among
candidates so far, with just over $5 million by March 31, compared
with Boulter's $365,000.
   The figures were released Sunday by the Federal Election
Commission, which said congressional candidates raised $180 million
overall in the first 15 months of the two-year cycle that
culminates with November's elections.
   Of that, it said, $53 million _ or 29 percent _ came from the
special-interest groups known as PACs.
   At the comparable time in 1986, House and Senate contenders had
raised $167 million, of which $41 million was in PAC money, a 24
percent share.
   The growing clout of special interests in congressional
elections has prompted Senate critics to seek voluntary restraints
on the amount of such money that can be spent by Senate candidates.
The Democratic push has been stymied by Republican filibusters.
   Overall, the 143 candidates for Senate seats raised $79 million
during the 15-month period, about $1 million less than at the
comparable time two years ago. The decrease was due in part to a
smaller number of candidates than in 1986.
   The 1,201 candidates for House seats had pulled in $101 million
as of March 31, a $14 million increase. The jump came in part
because 17 more incumbents are seeking re-election than two years
ago.
   Aside from Texas, Senate races in two other populous states _
California and Ohio _ also ranked high on the money lists.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., ranked second behind Bentsen in
overall fund raising, with more than $4 million collected toward
his contest with challenger Leo T. McCarthy, the Democratic
California lieutenant governor. McCarthy's receipts totaled $2.4
million.
   In Ohio, incumbent Sen. Howard Metzenbaum ranked third in fund
raising at $3.7 million, while his opponent, Republican Cleveland
Mayor George Voinovich, had raised $2.5 million.
   Among House races, the leader was Rep. Joseph DioGuardi, R-N.Y.,
who is trying to hold onto the traditionally Democratic seat he has
held for two terms. He raised $800,000 during the first 15 months
of the election season.
   Close behind were Reps. Mel Levine, D-Calif., with $750,000, and
Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., with $706,000.
   Top recipients of PAC money among House members were Budget
Committee Chairman William Gray, D-Pa., with $267,000, and Mary
Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, with $257,000. Also ranking high on that list
was Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich.,
with nearly $257,000 in special-interest money.

<HEAD>Quiet Negotiations Under Way on Clean Air, Acid Rain Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to control urban air pollution and
acid rain has been stalled in Congress but there are stirrings in
the House trenches and talk of an offensive in the Senate.
   Factions in the House Energy and Commerce Committee are finally
exchanging proposals in quiet negotiations that started only after
nine renegade Democrats led by Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., politely
grabbed the reins from warring chairmen.
   In the Senate, George Mitchell, D-Maine, is openly threatening a
parliamentary end-run around Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
an acid-rain control foe who has refused floor time to the Mitchell
clean air bill that has been ready for debate since last September.
   And on both sides of the Capitol, a new phrase has entered the
vocabulary of lawmakers and environmental lobbyists trying to break
the clean air logjam: Michael Dukakis.
   Their message is clear: the Clean Air Act will be strengthened,
possibly with the White House occupied by a man perceived to have a
stronger environmental commitment than Ronald Reagan or George Bush.
   Mitchell's name is creeping into this scenario. He is a
candidate to succeed Byrd next year when the West Virginian steps
down from the Senate's most powerful post.
   ``Hopefully, those who've tried to stop any legislation will
look at a new majority leader in the Senate and the possibility of
a Democratic administration in the White House and see that this is
the year to work out acid rain,'' says Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
the environmentalists' point man in the House.
   Time is running short. Congress, which will take time off for
the national political conventions and its own re-election
campaigns, has set an Aug. 31 deadline for action.
   That is the stopgap date set last December as the Clean Air
Act's deadline for metropolitan areas to meet standards for maximum
levels of ozone and carbon monoxide or risk sanctions like a ban on
construction of new pollution sources.
   More than 60 areas are not expected to attain the standards. The
debate in Congress is over how much more time they should be given
to reduce air pollution and what steps they must take to comply
with the health-based standards.
   The biggest apparent stumbling block on the House side is
whether to force automakers to produce vehicles with cleaner
emissions and install equipment to capture polluting gasoline fumes
during refueling.
   These are not pleasant questions for the powerful Energy and
Commerce chairman, John Dingell, D-Mich., who comes from an
automaking district.
   The acid rain component of the clean air struggle is far more
complicated for lawmakers trying to combat coal-burning plant
emissions that produce the fallout some scientists say poses human
health risks and harms lakes, coastal waters and building facades.
   Byrd illustrates part of the complications. West Virginia not
only has power plants that would need improvements under the
Mitchell bill but also a high-sulfur coal industry in the northern
part of the state. It could be hurt if power plants switch to
cleaner fuel like natural gas to meet the bill's requirements.
   Most of the utilities that would be affected by an acid rain
bill are in the Midwest. Lawmakers from that area don't want to see
their constituents' electricity bills run up by expensive
smokestack scrubbers to clean up emissions.
   Western lawmakers like the idea of being able to sell their
low-sulfur coal to the Midwest. But many don't like Waxman's idea
of a surtax on electric bills nationwide to soften the blow on
Midwestern ratepayers.
   The power companies, like the Reagan administration, don't want
any acid rain legislation at all. These foes argue that scientists
are divided over the effects of acid deposition and that the nation
should await the arrival of clean-coal technology being sought
under a $2.5 billion research program.
   Southerners are not bystanders. Acid rain problems have shown up
from Florida to Texas. Northeasterners, downwind from Midwestern
utilities, want action, as does the environmental lobby.
   Mitchell says he has been negotiating with colleagues, including
Byrd, to get his bill to the floor. He said in an interview last
week that supporters will take direct action if the leadership
doesn't call the bill up for debate.
   ``Clearly, there will be an effort to tack it on to something
else as an amendment,'' said Mitchell, one of 48 senators who have
written Byrd asking for floor time.
   Tina Evans, a Byrd spokeswoman, says the majority leader ``has
no plans to call up an acid rain bill.'' She quoted Byrd as saying:
``Any senator may at any time call up an amendment to any bill. I
would not be surprised if this is tried with acid rain.''
   Meanwhile, the clock is ticking toward Aug. 31 with some
supporters of tougher air pollution control laws vowing to oppose
another deadline extension.
   ``This really is a race with the clock,'' says Swift, adding
that his so-called Group of Nine hopes to have its own acid rain
plan drafted in two weeks in an effort to get movement on this
issue in Energy and Commerce.
   Waxman, co-sponsor of a tough acid rain bill with Rep. Gerry
Sikorski, D-Minn., says he soon may call his health subcommittee
back to the table to try to win approval of a clean air package and
throw the issue to Dingell's full committee.
   Waxman suspended bill-writing efforts nearly two months ago, his
panel still evenly split over the acid rain control question.

   A sightseeing helicopter carrying five people
crashed into the East River and sank Sunday, killing a passenger
who was trapped underwater for more than an hour and a half,
authorities said.
   The other four, including the 22-year-old pilot, were pulled out
of the murky water by police Harbor Unit officers who found two men
clinging to pontoons and two grasping for other bits of wreckage.
They were not seriously injured.
   The accident occurred almost three years to the day after a
helicopter operated by a subsidiary of the same company, Island
Helicopter Corp., plunged into the East River with eight people
aboard. One man, a Japanese businessman, died.
   In Sunday morning's accident, the helicopter had just completed
a 15-to-20-minute tour of Manhattan when it plunged into the river
about 15 blocks north of its destination, the 34th Street heliport,
police said.
   The aircraft, a Bell 206-B, was hovering about 1,000 feet above
the river awaiting permission to land when the pilot ``experienced
performance difficulties,'' said George Dempster, chairman of
Island Helicopters.
   The pilot activated emergency flotation pontoons and ``initiated
emergency landing procedures,'' Dempster said. On impact, however,
the flotation devices apparently separated from the rest of the
craft.
   Rescue efforts culminated in scuba divers finding a passenger
strapped to a rear seat of the helicopter on the bottom of the
river, 35 feet below the surface.
   The water temperature was in the mid-40s, and the man had been
under water more than 100 minutes, divers said.
   The passenger, identified as Takashi Oyama by the Japanese
Consulate, was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he died at 9:05
p.m., said Peter Schectman, a hospital adminstrator.
   Three of the others also were taken to Bellevue, where they were
listed in stable condition. They included the pilot, Robert
Marshall, of Sea Cliff, N.Y., and two passengers, Yuichiro Suzuki,
30, of Columbus, Ohio, and Furman Alexander, 34, a resident of
Australia.
   A passenger identified as Gotthelf Max Christian, 55, of Munich,
W. Germany, was taken to Cabrini Hospital, where he was in good
condition, according to a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Diane Kubler.
   Dempster described Marshall as an experienced pilot with 1,700
hours of flight time.
   Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board responded to the scene but had
no immediate comment on the cause.

<TEXT>
   Four months after he completed a
25-year prison term, Modesto Napoleon Ortigoza has yet to taste
freedom.
   The former army captain was convicted of killing a cadet in 1962
who allegedly learned of his involvement in a plot to overthrow
President Alfredo Stroessner, the Western Hemisphere's
longest-reigning leader.
   Ortigoza, 56, said in an interview in March that he was never
allowed to appear in court to plead his innocence and that his
confession was extracted by torture, including electric shocks on a
grill.
   ``When you are defenseless under the torturers, 10 in my case,
you give in and say what they want you to,'' Ortigoza told the AP.
   Ortigoza was released from prison on Dec. 20 but was put under
police custody in the town of San Estanislao, 85 miles northeast of
Asuncion.
   He was brought to Asuncion in February, where two
round-the-clock guards prevented him from leaving the home of his
invalid mother. The government said without elaboration that the
guards were protecting Ortigoza.
   He escaped March 25 with the help of an opposition leader. Both
fled one block to the residence of Colombian Ambassador Vicente
Martinez Emiliani.
   Colombia granted both political asylum but the Paraguayan
government has refused to act on Colombia's request for
safe-conduct passage out of the country for Ortigoza and the
dissident, Hermes Rafael Saguier. Emiliani recently said he has had
``no news'' on the pending requests for safe passage.
   Interior Minister Sabino Montanaro says his country is in no
rush to grant Ortigoza safe passage, calling him a ``common
criminal.''
   Government officials have branded Saguier, 40, a subversive and
compared Ortigoza's escape to the embassy ``a terrorist action.''
   Foreign Minister Carlos Augusto Saldivar declined to say when
the government would respond to Ortigoza's request for safe passage.
   ``It looks like it will be one of those things that will go on
and on and on indefinitely,'' said a European diplomatic who has
followed the situation closely. The diplomat spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Neither Ortigoza nor Saguier are allowed to speak to reporters
or to leave the ambassador's residence. Their lawyers, family and
close friends are the only ones permitted to visit.
   Paraguay's Human Rights Commission says Ortigoza's treatment is
meant to be a lesson to those who would conspire against
Stroessner, in power since 1954.
   Ortigoza's lawyer, Digno Britez, says the May 16-18 visit to
Paraguay by Pope John Paul II and Stroessner's trip to the United
Nations in June could help Ortigoza and Saguier gain safe passage
out of Paraguay.
   ``Stroessner would not want something like that to be brought up
while he visits the United Nations,'' Britez said, adding: ``Our
government is not a democracy so the consequences were pretty
predictable from the start.''

<HEAD>Oil Talks: Fasting, Jet Lag And `Near Non-OPEC Members'</HEAD>

   Some wondered what it would be like if
OPEC leaders met during Ramadan, the traditional Moslem month of
fasting that began April 18. Now we have the answer: grueling.
   Because some of the 13 delegations are mainly or exclusively
Christian, part of the cartel's oil negotiations took place during
the day. That's the normal time for OPEC business.
   But because the Moslem members prefer to slow down during their
sunrise-to-sunset fast, the formal OPEC sessions started late at
night, after the Moslems had eaten their ``breakfast.''
   As a result, some of the oil debate was in progress almost
around the clock.
   The non-Moslem oil ministers found it hard to cope with the
schedule, which forced them to try to sleep part of the day.
   One said he was taking pills to stay awake during the nighttime
sessions.
   Some said they felt as though they had been hit with jet lag,
minus the travel.

<TEXT>
   Often it's hard to understand why OPEC leaders have so much
trouble settling their differences over oil policy.
   Once in a while it's easy. Consider a comment by Ali Khalifa
Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, to reporters who asked whether he
was ready to give up his minority opposition to an OPEC plan:
   ``I usually am very reasonable and willing to discuss anything,
once our point of view has been accepted.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Another clue to why OPEC's meetings often last longer than would
seem necessary:
   ``We know that some (delegates) like to be out of our respective
countries,'' said an official from an African OPEC member. ``A
weekend in Europe _ not bad.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It's getting harder to classify the players in the international
oil game.
   Time was, and not long ago, you had two types: those in OPEC and
those outside it.
   At the latest OPEC conference the distinctions were a little
less clear.
   You had the usual 13 OPEC members. But you also had something
called ``non-OPEC,'' an unofficial association of six independent
oil-producing nations, including Mexico and China, that wants to
establish formal ties to the cartel without becoming members.
   Then you had three other oil producers _ Norway, the Canadian
province of Alberta and the state of Texas _ who wanted to rub
elbows with the OPEC leaders but still keep enough distance to
stand outside the ``non-OPEC'' camp.
   Some called these three ``near non-OPEC.''
   And then there are the rest, producers such as the Soviet Union
and Britain that want to have nothing to do with the cartel.

   Kent Hance, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission that
regulates the state's oil industry, met several staffers at OPEC
headquarters last week, including the deputy secretary general,
Fadhil Chalabi.
   He said he found them knowledgeable about oil but also very
cautious.
   ``I guess I would be, too, if I had 13 bosses,'' he said.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Rilwanu Lukman, a Nigerian, is the top OPEC boss, at least in
title. He is president of the formal conferences and the highest
ranking spokesman for the cartel.
   At the end of the latest meeting Lukman lashed out at the news
media, accusing it of trying to stampede OPEC into making decisions.
   ``Why should we make a decision just because you say we
should?'' he said in a high-pitched tone to one reporter.

   Bucky Badger, the University of Wisconsin

be back in action with a new one soon.
   The 4-foot-diameter, 19-pound head was stolen during an
off-campus party Friday, authorities said.
   Gavin Taylor, 21, one of four Buckys, said he had the costume at
his apartment in preparation for an appearance at the 14th annual
Midwest Rowing Championships at Lake Wingra on Saturday.
   Taylor said he left the party for a while and returned to find
someone had stolen the head.
   ``I couldn't just put the clothes on and pass as Bucky,'' he
said.
   The head is one of two used by the university and Bucky was
expected back in action soon, Taylor said.
   The heads are constructed out of fiberglass by fencing coach
John Gillham, who estimated the cost of each complete suit at $500.

   As the strike at the Lenin steelworks
entered its sixth day, 120 haggard workers appeared at the
facility's gate to receive flowers, food and words of support from
tearful family members.
   Most of the 50 wives, children and parents of the striking
workers remained outside the partially opened gate on Sunday, but a
some weeping wives stepped a few feet inside to embrace their
husbands.
   ``I know that my voice is breaking,'' strike leader Andrezej
Szewczuwaniec told the group. ``But I'm very moved. There is lot of
optimism in me because there is only one Polish heart, and it
cannot be split.''
   He told the families that the strike, which began Tuesday for
higher pay and union recognition, would continue today.
   ``We will not disappoint our wives, our sons, our mothers nor
you behind the gate,'' he said. When he stopped speaking, the crowd
began chanting, ``God bless you! God bless you!''
   The family members passed plastic bags of food and bunches of
flowers through the gate to the strikers, and the group sang
patriotic hymns from both sides of the fence.
   Earlier in the day, police had stopped some people from marching
to the plant. But police were nowhere around the main plant gates
at midafternoon, when the family members began arriving on foot or
by public transportation.
   The families offered words of support: ``We are with you. ... We
support you. ... Long live the mill.''
   ``We are all moved here,'' said another member of the strike
committee, Stanislaw Handzlik. ``Here we are seven years after
martial law and again we raise our hands, we raise our heads, we
raise our backs.
   ``We want to demand human and social rights that we deserve. We
want to assure you that we will go on with the strike.''
   After the speeches, the workers said ``Do widzenia'' _ ``Until
we see you again'' _ and marched back inside the plant.

   Sen. Paul Simon, who suspended his
Democratic presidential run last month, says he has no interest in
joining the national ticket as a vice presidential candidate.
   The Illinois Democrat said Sunday his lack of interest in the
No. 2 spot hasn't changed since his campaign was all but called off.
   ``In politics, you never say never,'' he told reporters. ``But
frankly, I doubt if I'd be interested even in the unlikely chance I
were asked.''
   Simon also said he thinks former Vice President Walter Mondale
wishes that he had stayed in the Senate instead of becoming
President Jimmy Carter's running mate in 1976.
   ``It's mainly a ceremonial thing, a lot of ribbon-cuttings and
funerals,'' Simon said. ``My interest in politics is policy making.
I'd sooner leave the ceremony to someone else.''
   Simon also said he has no intention of formally dropping out of
the race and releasing his 170 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, including 137 from Illinois.

   Gov. John Sununu, who ran George Bush's
successful New Hampshire campaign, will be the vice president's
spokesman during the drafting of the Republican platform at the
convention, a Bush campaign official said.
   Sununu was chairman of the Bush effort in New Hampshire that set
the vice president back on the road to the nomination after he had
lost to Sen. Bob Dole in the Iowa caucuses a week earlier.
   As ``official spokesman'' for Bush, Sununu will be his most
visible representative when the platform committee drafts the
party's statements on issues at the convention in New Orleans this
August.
   Bush's New England support, along with Sununu, included Gov.
John McKernan of Maine and Gov. Edward DiPrete of Rhode Island. The
latter two have not been offered jobs at the convention, Ron
Kaufman, Bush's Northeast political director, told the Boston

   The federal trial of a woman accused of killing
her husband and another woman with cyanide-laced Excedrin, the
nation's first murder-by-product-tampering case, is nearing its end.
   The jury in the trial of Stella Nickell, 44, was to hear closing
arguments today, then be charged by U.S. District Judge William
Dwyer before beginning its deliberations.
   If convicted, Mrs. Nickell could be sentenced to life in prison.
   She is accused of five instances of tampering with
over-the-counter medicine, including the two cases involving death.
She has denied any involvement in the deaths.
   According to prosecutors, Mrs. Nickell, unhappy in her marriage
and frustrated by more than $8,500 in debts, plotted the June 1986
death of Bruce Nickell, 52, to collect $176,000 in life insurance
benefits. They also said she placed other tainted pain-relievers on
the shelves of area drugstores to make the poisoning appear random.
   Sue Katherine Snow, 40, of Auburn, died two weeks after Nickell.
She swallowed poisoned Excedrin capsules, authorities said. The
Nickells apparently didn't know Ms. Snow.
   In sometimes tearful testimony Wednesday and Thursday, Mrs.
Nickell denied killing her husband of 12 years or knowing he had
more than $25,000 in life insurance.
   She said she did library research in 1983 and 1984 on poisonous
plants, including some containing cyanide, to protect children from
dangerous foliage on their rural property.
   Mrs. Nickell denied testimony by her 28-year-old daughter, Cindy
Hamilton, who said her mother had contemplated killing Nickell for
some time. Mrs. Nickell also denied testimony from another relative
who she had talked about reaping ``close to 200 grand'' in life
insurance benefits.
   Mrs. Nickell admitted that in the spring of 1986, she and her
sporadically-employed husband owed more than $8,500.
   But she insisted there was nothing macabre about the letters she
wrote to one bank shortly before Nickell's death indicating that
her ``marriage problems'' were almost over and that payments would
stay current.
   A prosecution rebuttal witness, Katherine Parker of Tacoma,
concluded testimony in the trial Thursday. She said that Ms.
Hamilton, her former roommate, had told her that Mrs. Nickell
talked of getting rid of her husband and asked how much cocaine it
would take to kill a person.

   The apparent suicide of Rep. Roy P. Dyson's top
aide sent shock waves through Maryland's political community, but
fellow Democrats predicted the congressman would be re-elected to a
fifth term.
   ``I don't think this reflects on Roy Dyson. At this point, I
would say it has no impact (on the election),'' said Rep. Benjamin
Cardin, a Democrat who represents Maryland's 3rd Congressional
District.
   The aide, Tom Pappas, 46, of Accokeek, was being investigated by
the Federal Election Commission over allegations that the
39-year-old Dyson's campaign disclosure reports concealed $6,650 in
payments to Pappas.
   Pappas' died Sunday, the day The Washington Post published a
story that described former aides' accounts of unorthodox job
demands Pappas made on young male congressional staffers and
allegations that Dyson had ceded control of his Washington office
to Pappas.
   ``I think the only thing I have to say is it's a real tragedy
that anybody gets to the place where they feel the alternative is
to take their life,'' said Rep. Steny Hoyer, of the 5th District.
   ``All the reports indicate apparently Mr. Pappas apparently did
some things that one would speculate from his actions that he felt
were very wrong,'' Hoyer said.
   ``None of the reports I've heard have indicated Mr. Dyson is
himself involved. If that is the case, I would see no reason that
he wouldn't be re-elected as he was in the past,'' said Hoyer, who
has known Dyson about 15 years.
   Eastern Shore Republicans, who are seeking to regain control of
the seat, also were shocked.
   ``I find it very difficult to be critical of Mr. Pappas at this
point,'' said Dyson's GOP opponent in the November election, Wayne
Gilchrest. ``Being critical at this point is not necessary.''
   He said the allegations in the Post story would have no effect
on the type of campaign he ran.
   ``Regardless of what happens in the Dyson camp, I have a certain
point of view I want to get across, and (it) doesn't change my
campaign.''

<HEAD>Cable Industry Growing Into `Goliath'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of being considered the little
sibling of broadcast television, some say the cable TV industry is
beginning to look more like Goliath than David.
   Cable TV, now watched by more than 50 percent of all American
households, has become a $12 billion industry that is gaining
viewers steadily, mostly at the expense of the broadcast networks.
   But with prosperity comes increased scrutiny, and in cable's
case Congress has been raising questions about concentration of
ownership within the industry, complaints of poor service and
rising rates. Some in Congress say it may be time to reregulate
cable TV.
   ``We have to pay attention to this,'' James P. Mooney, president
of the National Cable Television Association, told an audience at
the opening session of the group's annual convention Sunday.
   ``We can't rebuff our friends,'' he said. ``An important part of
good business is good politics.''
   More than 13,000 people are expected to attend the convention,
which runs through Tuesday.
   Most governmental regulation has been lifted from the industry.
The most recent deregulation came in January 1987 when most cable
systems were freed of municipal rate control. They now have more
control than ever on what viewers see and how much they pay.
   Deregulation brought increases in rates. The industry says the
average subscriber's bill rose 6.7 percent in the first six months
after price control was lifted, but critics in Congress cite
instances of rates going up by as much as 400 percent in some
systems.
   Despite the increase, subscribers continued to sign on. Cable
systems added more than 4 million subscribers in 1987, putting the
percentage of households receiving cable to nearly 52 percent _
about 45 million households.
   Now that many cable companies have finished building their
systems _ wiring more than 80 percent of the nation's households _
cable companies are starting to pay off their debt and are putting
their cash into programming.
   ``Programming is going to drive penetration,'' said James S.
Cownie, president of Heritage Communications of Des Moines, Iowa,
and NCTA chairman.
   ``That's going to move us up to the 70 percent saturation level
from 52 percent where we are now.''
   The industry has been encouraged by the success of its early
efforts, like Showtime's ``It's Garry Shandling's Show,'' a comedy
series now on Fox Broadcasting Co.
   The show is one of only a few that have moved from cable to
broadcast. Most of the migration is still from broadcast to cable,
which has become home to many an old syndicated rerun.
   But cable executives say that will change as cable systems pour
more money into developing their own programs.
   ``We should be more concerned with what the content will be than
where it comes from,'' said Michael S. Fuchs, chairman of Home Box
Office.
   HBO received praise for its recent program ``Dear America:
Letters Home from Vietnam.''
   Cable TV, particularly the Entertainment and Sports Programming
Network, ESPN, also has been landing some big sports contracts.
Exclusive cable contracts for big sports events, though, have been
criticized for denying viewing of these games to those who don't
subscribe to cable. Before cable came along, these games could be
seen free on broadcast TV.
   But cable is likely to continue its foray into sports
programming.
   ``There are more first run movies and sports on cable, and
that's going to continue,'' said Fuchs. ``The only things that will
get some protection (from cable-exclusive contracts) are big sports
events like the Superbowl.''

<HEAD>Feelings Mixed Whether Rebuilt Downtown Is Better</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COALINGA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coalinga's downtown business district,
devastated five years ago by one of California's strongest
earthquakes this century, is still struggling to recover.
   In one terrifying moment, the town's turn-of-the-century stores
buckled under the force of the quake.
   The 6.7-magnitude temblor on May 2, 1983, dealt its heaviest
toll to two blocks that held most of the community's retail stores.
All had to be razed.
   Today on the same land, modern one-story block buildings house
the merchants who hung on during the hard times after the quake in
the town of 8,000 residents about 200 miles southeast of San
Francisco.
   But vacant lots also mark much of downtown, raising concern that
there are too few shops left to attract enough customers to be
profitable.
   ``If there were other businesses, things would be working
tremendously; there are too many empty lots,'' said Marjorie Kerr,
who moved all the clothes from her dress shop to her less-damaged
home after the earthquake until she could get back in business,
first in a gymnasium, then a house trailer and now in the
rejuvenated downtown.
   Downtown businesses now include two dress shops, two banks, two
drug stores, a furniture store, a combination bicycle-computer shop
and a Sears mail order store. Other downtown offices house a weekly
newspaper, a lawyer, accountant and real estate agent.
   ``There are no coffee shops, so people don't come downtown as
much,'' said Mrs. Kerr. ``We need more retail in these two blocks,
not offices.''
   The city government, which aggressively secured a variety of
financing to recover from the quake, owns the rebuilt stores and is
trying to find more financing and more businesses to fill the empty
lots.
   The city subsidizes rents, charging about 34 cents a square
foot, said Glen Adams, a councilman and Chamber of Commerce
director. That's a sharp increase from the 10-20 cents per square
foot merchants paid for space in the structures wiped out by the
quake.
   Those increases make survival difficult for store owners who
were just making it under the old rents. Mrs. Kerr said the owners
of a jewelry store decided to retire after the earthquake, a
television store closed and one business owner died of stress while
struggling to keep going in a house trailer.
   Not all merchants have been hurt, however. The operators of
Service Pharmacy owned their building and it was fully insured,
enabling them to rebuild large enough for their needs and allow
space to rent out offices.
   Sales taxes, which indicate how much retail business a community
is doing, haven't climbed back to the level before the earthquake,
which left 47 injured and caused an estimated $31 million in
damage, said Alan Jacobsen, the public works director.
   But 2,873 building permits were issued in the five years since
for $41 million worth of new construction or rehabilitation, he
said.
   ``That's about one permit per building in town,'' Jacobsen said.
   There has been a net gain of 384 dwellings in Coalinga since the
earthquake, allowing the population to increase from 7,000 to
8,000, Jacobsen said.
   The city also has a new natural gas system, new sewer lines, a
new fire station, bus terminal, day care center, senior citizens
center, fitness center and community swimming pool.
   Despite the personal and financial trauma, Jacobsen feels the
earthquake ``was a real positive thing in making us clean up some
problems we had in buildings _ safety and that type of thing.''
   The quake was one of California's 10 strongest quakes this
century.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred
before the Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on
the Richter scale.

<HEAD>House Swallowed By Acre-size Sinkhole</HEAD>

   When the house started groaning and the
studs started popping, Bill Pivnick knew it was time to start
running _ a sinkhole was about to swallow his home.
   ``I knew what it was as soon as it occurred and I knew how
dangerous it could be,'' he said Sunday. ``I was afraid the walls
were going to come tumbling down and ceiling was going to
collapse.''
   Besides scaring Pivnick and his neighbors, the sinkhole that
opened up in a quiet middle-class development near here Friday
surprised geologists with its size and location.
   ``I call this a double freak sinkhole because it's so far south
and it's so big,'' William Wilson, a geologist with the Florida
Sinkhole Research Institute at the University of Central Florida,
said Saturday after examining the depression.
   The sinkhole, 20 feet deep and more than 200 feet wide, is one
of Florida's largest, Wilson said. ``At least one whole acre has
been swallowed up in one big gulp,'' he said.
   Neighbors rushed to Sebring Ridge on Friday evening to pack up
the possessions of people evacuated from the two houses consumed by
the sinkhole. During the weekend, as the water table began to
transform the sinkhole into a pond, neighbors started talked of
moving, Pivnick said.
   ``In a couple of weeks everybody's going to forget about the big
sinkhole in Sebring except the neighbors. They'll still be living
on the edge,'' said Pivnick, a psychologist for the Avon Park
Correctional Institution.
   Although police, fearing the house might plunge deeper, forbade
Pivnick and a visiting friend from collecting any of their
belongings, residents who were allowed to return have been generous
and upbeat.
   ``I've had like eight people offer to give me a place to stay _
gratis,'' Pivnick said. ``I've talked to my adjusters and they seem
to be very agreeable to helping me, but I had a friend visiting and
none of her stuff was covered.''
   Pivnick, 40, said his insurance will cover almost all the
contents of his $70,000 three-bedroom single-story home.
   ``The loss is kind of settling in now,'' Pivnick said. ``I'm
thinking about where I'm going to be living in three months.''
   Around dinner time Friday, when ``the house was groaning, the
studs were popping'' and the ground in the yard started to shift,
Pivnick said they could only run out and warn neighbors.
   ``(Then) the people of Sebring came in _ I've never seen
anything like it _ they arrived in pickups and packed up (neighbor
Nina Todd's) house in about five minutes,'' Pivnick said. Police
would not let them near his house.
   By Saturday, the sinkhole had stabilized with the evacuated Todd
house on one side, off its cracked foundation and bowed in the
center.
   A major cause of sinkholes is the altering of water tables
flowing through limestone and clay formations under the soil. A
sudden lowering of the water table caused by irrigation or drought,
for instance, can weaken walls and roofs of the underground
limestone caverns, leading to their collapse.

<DATELINE>SANDOVAL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a quote taped to her calendar that
sums up the vigor of 96-year-old Stella Bellamy: ``I am not afraid
of tomorrow, for I have seen yesterday and I love today.''
   Today, she takes more naps than when she started working at
First National Bank. Her hearing isn't the greatest; and when she
walks, it's a slow gait.
   But that hasn't kept her from her jobs as bank president,
village treasurer and insurance agent in this Southern Illinois
town of 1,700.
   She keeps up the pace, ``because I like it. I love my work.''
   ``I can't figure life without working,'' she added.
   Born in St. Louis in 1892, Mrs. Bellamy moved to Sandoval when
she was 3 months old. She graduated from the local high school in
1910 _ the year First National was chartered _ and became a
milliner.
   ``That's what I was gonna do,'' says the petite, white-haired,
bespectacled woman. ``Then women stopped wearing hats.''
   So in 1915 she joined the bank as a bookkeeper, and eventually
held other jobs, including cashier and teller. She worked next to
her husband, a cashier, from 1921 until he died in 1948.
   When he died, she took over as town treasurer, a post still
holds. In 1967, she became bank president.
   But that's not all. She's also treasurer of the local women's
club, and holds memberships on two village committees.
   ``I don't take any vacations,'' said Mrs. Bellamy, who has no
children. ``I don't have anyone here to take my place, and I think
if you have a job you better take care of it.''
   Since she suffered a mild heart attack last year, she doesn't
drive to work. A bank employee picks her up and drives her to the
home she shares with a retired teacher.
   ``She's 10 years younger than I am, but I have to take care of
her,'' said Mrs. Bellamy. ``I do the cooking. I'm a gourmet cook.''
   During the interview, Mrs. Bellamy was interrupted by some of
the bank regulars _ one woman told her about a friend in the
hospital and another talked about tulips.
   ``How you doing?'' said one friend.
   ``I'm up, but I'm not exactly at 'em,'' Mrs. Bellamy responsed.
   A teen-ager asked for a piece of candy and Mrs. Bellamy obliged,
but only after the girl repeated the request numerous times. ``I
don't hear very well,'' she explained.
   Though Mrs. Bellamy doesn't like the word ``quit'' _ she calls
it ``dirty'' _ she said she will retire in about a year.
   ``I don't know what I'll do if I don't work. You can't cook all
the time,'' she said, noting that her spare time is spent napping,
reading magazines and cooking.
   ``As you get older, you need more sleep,'' she said, laughing
and adding: ``Yeah, I still can think.''

<HEAD>Contras Return After Talks Stall, Want Next Round Held Outside
Nicaragua</HEAD>

   Contra leaders outraged over actions of the
Sandinistas said they want the next round of peace talks outside
Nicaragua, while President Daniel Ortega has insisted that any new
discussions take place in the country.
   Two of the five-member Nicaraguan Resistance, Adolfo Calero and
Joaquin Chamorro, returned here Sunday following the second round
of stalled talks.
   A key issue has been the workings of the cease-fire agreement
signed in Sapoa, Nicaragua, on March 23.
   ``They are hinging the entire cease-fire agreement on how goods
will be delivered instead of on the democratization of Nicaragua,''
Chamorro said. ``We had already agreed on how the goods will be
delivered, and now they bring it up again.''
   The leaders of the U.S.-backed rebels expressed outrage with the
actions of the leftist government during the talks, saying
Nicaraguan officials had reneged on promises and created an
oppressive atmosphere that jeopardizes future talks in the wartorn
country.
   ``They have been carrying on a succession of repressive actions
against the people of Nicaragua,'' Calero said.
   ``They have taken action against striking workers, the interior
minister has beaten one of Nicaragua's distinguished radio
reporters,'' he said, ``and we are forced to stay in our hotel like
it's a prison.''
   On Friday, Jose Castillo Osejo, director of the anti-Sandinista
Radio Corporation, claimed Interior Minister Tomas Borge summoned
him to his office, berated the radio's reporting of anti-government
demonstrations and punched him in the mouth.
   The next round of talks have been tentatively set for May 12-24.
Calero hopes they will be held outside of Nicaragua, maybe in
Guatemala, the Dominican Republic or Costa Rica.
   But Ortega harshly criticized the rebels in his May Day speech
Sunday in Managua, and insisted that the talks continue in
Nicaragua.
   ``It's tough to endure having them here in Managua. We have to
disinfect the entire city after these people leave,'' Ortega told
several thousand backers. ``But now that we're meeting in
Nicaragua, the meetings have to continue in Nicaragua.''
   Rebel leaders say the latest round of talks stalled over details
of how Contra forces may receive humanitarian supplies during a
pact that calls for rebels to enter truce zones. The government is
then to free 700 prisoners and allow Contras to join talks with
Nicaraguan political parties.
   The Contras on Friday rejected a Sandinista proposal that the
International Red Cross resupply the rebels.
   Chamorro said the Red Cross in Nicaragua is ``just another arm
of the Sandinista government.'' He preferred that a private carrier
agreeable to both sides bring in food, clothing and medicine.
   Sandinista police on Friday cordoned off the entrance to an
anti-government workers union where demonstrations had been taking
place. About 1,500 construction workers were protesting economic
measures enacted a week earlier.
   Thirty-eight of those workers are on a hunger strike in
Nicaragua, and Contra spokesman Jorge Rosales said Sunday that a
group of Nicaraguan exiles in Miami would lend support by starting
a similar hunger strike.

   Iranian radicals will try to win control
of Iran's Parliament in a runoff election on May 13 that could
determine the future course of the Islamic revolution.
   The staunchly anti-Western radicals made sizeable gains in the
first round of voting on April 8 for 188 of the 270 seats in the
Majlis, or parliament, but no faction won a majority. The runoff
will be for the 82 remaining seats.
   The results of the first round, announced by Iran's state-run
media, show a tilt toward the radicals, with some leading
conservatives losing their seats.
   The radicals could be helped in the runoff by the anti-American
passions that resulted after six Iranian vessels were destroyed or
disabled in the Persian Gulf in battles with the U.S. Navy on April
18.
   If the radicals win control of the legislature, they could use
that anti-American sentiment to adopt an even tougher stand against
U.S. intervention in the gulf over the next four-year parliamentary
term.
   Tehran Radio reported that just under 17 million Iranians voted
in the first round, about 80 percent of the electorate.
   Interior Ministry Ali-Akbar Mohtashemi, a hardliner whose power
is growing, declared that the turnout for the third parliamentary
election since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1979 revolution was a
record.
   Among the winners were Hojatoleslam Mehdi Karroubi, firebrand
head of Iran's Pilgrimage Bureau who is believed to have
masterminded riots in the holy city of Mecca last July. Karroubi, a
middle-ranking cleric, heads a radical group called Militant
Clergymen.
   According to figures released by Iran's Interior Ministry and
broadcast by Tehran Radio, he polled 971,752 votes in his Tehran
constituency, second only to House Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, one
of the most powerful figures in Iran.
   Rafsanjani, a close confidant of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
took more than 1.3 million votes, the highest single vote so far
announced.
   ``The results so far indicate that the third Majlis will be
heavily weighted in favor of the radicals, opening the way for
reformist legislation,'' said London-based analyst Vahe Petrossian
in the Middle East Economic Digest.
   However, Gary Sick, a former Iran specialst with the U.S.
National Security Agency, said in a telephone interview: ``The real
picture won't emerge until the runoffs ... and when the Majlis
elects the cabinet.''
   Nonetheless, the election is expected to produce big gains for
the radicals who are advocating major economic and social reforms
long blocked by conservative clerics and the ``Bazaaris,'' the
wealthy merchant class who have survived the revolution and still
wield considerable influence.
   Although the final makeup of the Majlis remains incomplete, the
first-round voting appears to have bolstered both Rafsanjani, who
favors economic reforms, and Prime Minister Hussein Musavi.
   Among other radicals who won were Ateqe Sediqi Rajai, widow of
the late President Mohammed Ali Rajai, and one of 35 women among
the 1,700 candidates.
   Rajai was assassinated with Prime Minister Mohammed Javad
Bahonar, when leftist opponents of Khomeini bombed Bahonar's office
Aug. 31, 1981.
   Another winner was Hadi Ghafari, an Islamic ideologue who
trained with the PLO in Lebanon and was a key figure in forming
Khomeini's Revolutionary Guards.
   He was among the winners in 14 of the 30 Tehran districts where
final results were announced, along with Fakhreddin Hejazi, another
firebrand mullah who got more than 700,000 votes, and former
Agriculture Minister Mohammad Salamati, with more than 500,000.
   One of the winners in the holy city of Qom was Hojatoleslam
Sadeq Khalkali, a former Islamic judge who ordered the execution of
hundreds of people by firing squad or the hangman's rope in the
early days of the revolution. Tehran Radio said he polled nearly
200,000 votes in the first ballot.
   Several leading conservatives were either knocked out of the
running or failed to win absolute majorities and now face runoff
competition May 13, according to monitored radio reports.
   Among them were Rafsanjani's deputy, Mohammad Yazdi, a prominent
deputy in the Majlis; and former Commerce Minister Habib
Asgarouladi.
   Former Interior Minister Ayatollah Ali-Akbar Nateq-Nouri, a
member of the now-disbanded hard-line Islamic Republic Party,
failed to get a clear majority and will have to run in the May 13
second round, Tehran Radio said.
   Nateq-Nouri, who was also briefly armed forces commander after
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr was ousted in 1982, now heads the
Hojati group, an extremist Islamic faction.
   Musavi's radicals held a slim majority in the last Majlis. But
he got a big boost from Khomeini before the election that could
improve that position.
   Khomeini, apparently seeking to break a legislative logjam he
feared was paralyzing the government and delaying badly needed
economic reforms, decreed sweeping powers for the government aimed
at increasing state control of the economy as advocated by Musavi.

   The first California condor born to captive
parents is downing about 30 minced mice a day and slowly gaining
weight, say keepers who are watching the bald, fluffy chick for
infection.
   ``So far so good,'' Martha Baker, spokeswoman for the San Diego
Wild Animal Park, said Sunday. ``We're not through the most
critical period, which is 72 hours.''
   The chick, named Molloko, an Indian word condor, was hatched
with human help Friday, boosting the endangered species' numbers to
28.
   It ate 28 mice Saturday and 30 more by Sunday afternoon, Ms.
Baker said.
   ``The appetite of the bird is very good,'' said Ms. Baker,
adding that the chick had regained its birth rate of 6} ounces. As
adults, the birds have a wingspan up to 10 feet.
   The chick had very bright eyes and its bodily functions seemed
to be operating correctly, she said.
   The fist-sized bird's attachment to its yolk sac, similar to a
human infant's umbilical cord, was healing well.
   Molloko hatched from an egg laid by the only pair of California
condors known to be actively breeding.
   All 28 California condors known to exist are in captivity: 15 at
the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo. Fourteen birds
are female. The chick's sex has not been determined.
   The flock includes 13 condors hatched from eggs taken in the
wild during the past five years. Molloko was the first addition
since April 1986, when a chick hatched at the park from an egg laid
in the wild.
   Efforts to save the California condor from extinction rest with
the captive breeding program. The last known condor in the wild was
captured last year.

State 102, about 40 miles north of Tucumcari, the FBI said.
   They are wanted for questioning in the Oct. 25, 1986, slayings
of George Brunton and Richard Stroud of West Frankfurt, Ill., said
William Brenon, special agent-in-charge of the FBI in Albuquerque.
   The Tripps were being held at the Santa Fe County Detention
Center on charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.
Arraignment was to be held today or Tuesday, the FBI said.
   Brenon said the couple had been living and working on a ranch in
northern New Mexico.
   ``America's Most Wanted'' appears regularly on the Fox

<HEAD>Frustrated American Rabbi Leaving Job In Communist East Berlin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After eight months on the job and several disputes
with Jewish leaders, the American rabbi who leads East Germany's
tiny Jewish community is heading home and may not return to
communist East Berlin.
   ``They attempted to silence me altogether,'' Rabbi Isaac Neuman
said of the leadership of East Berlin's Jewish community.
   Neuman, the communist country's first rabbi in 21 years, said:
``I don't want to come across as whining, or as an enemy of the
state or as being defeated.'' He added: ``I can at least say I have
tried. I cannot say I feel I have accomplished everything.''
   Neuman said he plans to return to Illinois on May 16.
   ``It's conceivable it (the return) is for good, but I may be
back in September. I have no intention of being here beyond 1988,
because the situation is too impossible to work.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, Neuman
compared his situation to a brief stint as a rabbi in Alabama in
the early 1960s when he ran into strong resistance for speaking out
in favor of civil rights for blacks.
   ``In a sense I feel the same kind of isolation,'' the feisty,
65-year-old reform rabbi said in his apartment in East Berlin.
   The Polish-born survivor of Auschwitz and nine other Nazi
concentration camps took over the post that had been empty since
1966. He is the rabbi for the less than 350 officially registered
Jews and about 100 people he says are ``on the fringes.''
   The largest Jewish community, with a little under 200 members,
is located in East Berlin. Others are in the cities of Halle,
Dresden and Leipzig.
   Neuman took over the post in September 1987, after retiring as
rabbi in Champaign, Illinois.
   Since then, he has run into several disputes with the head of
the Jewish community in East Berlin, whom he asked the AP not to
identify by name.
   ``Maybe he has orders from somewhere to keep me under control,''
Neuman says. ``He even controls my mail.''
   Neuman says there have been efforts within the Jewish community
to silence him, for example by making it difficult to teach adult
religious classes.
   ``I was told not to speak on Friday night because the service
was too long. But that's a lie,'' says Neuman. ``It was designed to
silence me.''
   He also has taken to task the editor of a government-run East
German newspaper for alleged inaccuracies in reporting about
Israel. He also is worried about anti-Semitism in the news media,
and points to the work of an East German cartoonist he says uses
such themes.
   Neuman also criticized the government's unwillingness to help
restore the dilapidated Jewish community building where he works.
   ``Yes, I have violated taboos,'' he says, but insists everything
he has done is permitted, even in East Germany.
   Neuman is paid by the East Berlin Jewish community, which in
turn receives funds from the communist government.
   The rabbi emphasized during the AP interview he had always
viewed his post as a ``temporary assignment.''
   Neuman said that he would return to his home in Champaign.
   Asked if he planned to write an autobiography, the rabbi replied
with a smile: ``I soon may have enough time.''
   While Neuman outlines his disagreements in East Berlin, there
has been some criticism of him as well.
   ``The Jewish community in East Berlin is startled by the
unconventionality and the independence of their rabbi,'' the
authoritative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper said of him
in a profile on April 19.
   The West German newspaper also said the ``tempermental rabbi''
had threatened to leave in the past.

   The last time Bobbie Lou Meserole stood under the
spotlights before an applauding crowd she was taking off the cloth
instead of putting it on.
   ``At one time, she was known as Shari Angel and she was the most
popular exotic dancer in Dallas,'' the Rev. W.V. Grant Jr. said
into the loudspeaker system of the Eagle's Nest Cathedral. ``And
from now on, she's going to be called the Reverend Bobbie Lou
Messerole.''
   The former stripper for Jack Ruby's Carousel nightclub was
ordained during a Sunday night service before the red-carpeted
altar of the sprawling church.
   ``I'm finally delivered from everything. I'm really with the
Lord,'' said Ms. Meserole, 54. ``I'm not with other people anymore.
I'm just a different person.''
   As a girl, Ms. Meserole said, she dreamed of becoming a nun
named sister Louise. She attended a private Catholic school until
her father made her quit when she was 13. She worked at a drug
store, and then at a hospital before falling on hard times and
moving into show business at 22.
   She was a stripper at Ruby's club in downtown Dallas and was
married to a locally popular comedian who once got into a fight
with Lee Harvey Oswald for heckling during an act and calling her
husband a communist.
   She was still working as a stripper at the Carousel when, on
Sunday morning, Nov. 24, 1963, she turned on her television the
weekend of President John F. Kennedy's assassination and saw her
boss pull a gun and fatally shoot Oswald in the basement of the
Dallas police station.
   By the time she was 35, she said, she turned to prostitution, to
alcohol and later to pills. Four years ago, while under treatment
at an Arlington hospital, she turned to God.
   ``I'm writing a book to help other people like me that were sick
and beat and were left for dead, so they don't have to live through
that,'' Ms. Meserole said. ``During a year in the sanitarium, I saw
a lot of people and they can be healed and my story will help.''
   She said she plans to preach, beginning with a downtown rally
later this month. But most of her work as an ordained minister of
Grant's charismatic International Deliverance Church will involve
counseling others.
   ``I'll go wherever the Lord leads me, but the county jail is
what I've got in my heart right now,'' she said. ``I want to go and
talk to the prostitutes and the alcoholics and the people with all
kind of problems.''
   She now spends six days a week cleaning homes for a living, and
said she didn't expect that to change much after the Sunday night
service. It's a far cry from the late 1950s and early '60s at the
Carousel, when she would dance along a runway, stripping to a
G-string and pasties as the top act in town.
   ``But it's still exciting in a different way,'' she said. ``And
it's a whole different life.''
   Grant, whose church recently moved into its huge hillside
complex on Dallas west side, said Ms. Meserole's message will be
heard by those he and other preachers can't reach.
   ``She can walk up to them and say, `I know what you're going
through,''' he said.

<HEAD>Rightist Leader Refuses to Endorse Chirac</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, France's extreme right leader,
refused to endorse conservative Premier Jacques Chirac but told
supporters not to vote for President Francois Mitterrand in the May
8 presidential runoff election.
   ``We are in a position of choosing between the bad and the
worst,'' Le Pen told 30,000 of his National Front followers in the
Tuileries Gardens in the heart of Paris on Sunday.
   Le Pen, who ran on an anti-immigration, ``French first''
platform, was eliminated along with six other candidates in
first-round voting April 24, but his surprisingly strong showing
means his National Front followers could influence the outcome of
the runoff.
   Le Pen called the runoff vote on May 8 ``a formality'' _ the
Socialist Mitterrand is widely considered a cinch to win.
   The right-wing candidate told his supporters to organize for the
future. ``Once the people of France are informed, we will be the
majority,'' he said.
   Hundreds of riot police sealed off the area, fearing clashes
with tens of thousands of unionists protesting Le Pen in
countermarches.
   Le Pen called his rally to honor May Day and Joan of Arc,
advancing her traditional feast day by a week because of the May 8
election. Le Pen has appropriated Joan of Arc as a National Front
symbol.
   Supporters first marched through the center of Paris, then moved
to the lushly green Tuileries where a Roman Catholic Mass was said
in Latin.
   Le Pen, 59, took 14.4 percent of the first-round vote, worrying
many who fear the National Front could awaken racist sentiments.
   Since April 24, Chirac has tried to attract Le Pen's following,
stressing the need to stop immigration and conserve France's
national identity _ top themes of Le Pen who claims that France,
inundated by immigrants from former North African colonies, is
being drained economically, socially and culturally.
   Le Pen called the Socialist president a traitor for his views on
immigrants and separatists in the strife-torn territory of New
Caledonia.
   ``No. No. No. Not a single vote for Francois Mitterrand,'' Le
Pen said from his rain-drenched stage in the elegant gardens
overlooking the Place de la Concorde and the Arch of Triumph.
   But Le Pen avoided a straight ``yes'' or ``no'' on Chirac, whom
he referred to as the ``residual candidate.''
   Le Pen spelled out three possibilities for his followers: stay
home, vote for Chirac ``to avoid the worst,'' or decide at the last
minute depending on Chirac's statements in the final week of the
campaign.
   ``If Jacques Chirac is defeated, he has only himself, his
friends and his allies to blame,'' Le Pen said. ``We have no
responsibility in the voting.''

   Western ambassadors watched May Day ceremonies in
the Soviet capital for the first time in nine years, ending a
boycott that followed the Soviet military drive into Afghanistan.
   Elsewhere, thousands of people attended rallies and parades on
the day honoring workers of the world.
   In Europe, security forces clashed with demonstrators in Poland,
and arrests were reported in East Berlin and Turkey.
   In Latin America, protesters threw sticks of dynamite at four
buildings in Peru, burned effigies of President Reagan in Honduras
and were dispersed by tear gas and water cannons in Chile.
   Troops also fired at marchers in the Philippines.
   In Moscow's Red Square, hundreds of thousands of people toted
banners extolling ``perestroika'' (economic restructuring),
``glasnost'' (openness) and other Communist Party programs.
   One sign called for good superpower relations and depicted a
handshake, the U.S. and Soviet flags, and the inscription ``Da!''
(Yes). In past years, some May Day floats denounced the United
States.
   Jack Matlock made the first May Day appearance by a U.S.
ambassador since the Soviets intervened in Afghanistan in 1979 to
aid a pro-Moscow government.
   ``I'm here today first of all because it is not a
military-oriented holiday, and because agreements have been signed
for the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan,'' Matlock said. ``Also,
our president is due in less than a month'' for his fourth summit
meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The West German envoy, Andreas Meyer-Landrut, said it was the
first time ambassadors from all 12 Common Market countries attended
May Day festivities since 1979.
   In Poland, thousands of people demonstrated in at least 15
cities across the nation, heeding a call by the Solidarity labor
federation for a national ``day of protest'' against price
increases and restriction of union activities. Scores of people
were detained and several people were injured in clashes with
police.
   Turkish authorities detained more than 100 people who tried to
mark May Day in Istanbul and Ankara, the Anatolia news agency said.
   Police rounded up half a dozen dissidents during the May Day
parade in communist East Berlin, including one who had chained
himself to a cross outside a church.
   In the Philippines, troops shot at May Day marchers south of
Manila. Organizers claimed the soldiers fired ``without
provocation'' into a crowd, wounding two people. Police said they
opened fire while chasing two suspected members of a communist
assassination team.
   Militant South African trade unions, barred from holding outdoor
rallies, held indoor meetings to celebrate May Day and protest the
government's clampdown on the black labor movement.
   Tens of thousands of workers in Santiago, Chile, gathered at a
rally called by the National Workers Commands, the country's
largest dissident labor federation. A 16-year-old youth was wounded
by a gunshot as police scattered demonstrators who tried to march
downtown to protest the military government. Some protesters were
detained, but police gave no figure.
   Demonstrators in Honduras burned effigies of Reagan and Honduran
President Jose Azcona Hoyo. Newspapers estimated 30,000 people took
part in the rallies in six cities.
   In Lima, Peru, demonstrators linked to the anti-government
guerrillas threw sticks of dynamite at two banks and two other
buildings during a May Day march through the capital. No one was
reported hurt.
   In Managua, Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega told a holiday
rally that troops would launch their biggest offensive ever against
rebels if they did not agree to extend a 60-day cease fire. A
two-month cease-fire began April 1.
   Government and rebel negotiators on Saturday ended three days of
talks in Managua without making progress toward a permanent end to
the civil war.

<HEAD>Japanese Stocks Close At Record High; Dollar Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices rose across the board today in the
Tokyo Stock Exchange while the dollar closed stronger.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the market's main barometer,
closed at a record high of 27,669.72, or 160.18 points higher than
Saturday's close.
   Volume was estimated at a moderate 900 million shares.
   Traders said electronics shares, such as Sony and Toshiba, were
rising.
   ``Many institutional investors are on vacation so today's
bullishness is largely caused by private investors,'' said a broker
at a major Japanese securities firm. ``They (private investors) are
expecting share prices to soar after Golden Week. So, they want to
make sure they buy shares beforehand,'' said the dealer, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Golden Week is the seven-day stretch that began Friday in which
Japan celebrates four national holidays. The Tokyo foreign exchange
market was closed Friday and all banks, financial institutions,
markets and most businesses will be closed Tuesday through Thursday
for the holidays.
   ``The major shift will show up after the holiday,'' the broker
added.
   Meanwhile, the dollar also rose to close the day's dealings at
125.33 yen, up 0.51 yen from Thursday's close of 124.82 yen.
   ``The general trend is the strong dollar, but there are hardly
any major moves at all,'' said Hiroaki Shukuzawa of the Sumitomo
Bank. ``The market saw recent U.S. economic indicators as favorable
and the dollar regained the losses it suffered after the poor
showings of the last month's U.S. trade figures.''

<HEAD>Lines Form As Illegal Aliens Make Last-Minute Applications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Undocumented aliens hoping to legalize their status have flocked
to immigration offices as the application deadline nears, and some
officials believe the cost of filing kept them away until the last
minute.
   ``You can't help but ask these people, `What have you been doing
the last 11 months?''' said Jesse Peterson, an official of the
Lima, Pa., legalization office, referring to the duration of the
amnesty program.
   Peterson attributed the surge in last-minute applications to
procrastination and fear about the program. He said Sunday that his
office processed over 300 applications last week.
   Undocumented aliens face a midnight Wednesday deadline to file
applications for legal status under the 1986 Immigration Reform and
Control Act. They must prove continuous residency in the United
States since Jan. 1, 1982. Filing is the first step toward
citizenship.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service office in Corpus
Christi, Texas, handled about 250 applications Saturday and Sunday,
said spokesman Carlos Paz, who believed many more would have shown
up had they expected the office to be open through the weekend.
   ``This whole month we have processed 1,858 people, which is
almost what we did in the first three or four months of the
program,'' Paz said.
   Paz said some applicants slept outside the center to complete
paperwork and wait for a work permit rather than file applications
and set a date for a later appointment.
   ``They're getting desperate because they've waited too long, and
some are still looking for additional paperwork and they're finding
out they don't have the documents,'' said Paz. ``And a lot of them
don't have the money (for the filing fee), let's face it.''
   More than 1,000 illegal aliens applied in Oklahoma City last
week _ fewer than expected, officials said.
   James Walsh, officer in charge of the office, said the poor
Oklahoma economy may have made it tough for some applicants to come
up with the filing fee of $185 a person or up to $420 per family.
He also cited the mobility of the illegal alien population for the
smaller than expected number of applicants.
   In New York, officials believe the number of applications will
exceed the revised target of 100,000. They cited a sharp upturn in
the number of aliens crowding INS offices in recent days.
   One illegal immigrant who applied last week, Luis Lopez, 38,
said receiving legal status means being able to work without fear
on a western Michigan farm.
   Lopez said he paid to be smuggled into the United States from
his native Mexico in 1972.
   ``I can look any man in the eye now and not be afraid,'' Lopez
said. ``I can walk straight, as a man should. The burden has been
lifted off my shoulders.''
   Wednesday's deadline does not apply to aliens applying for legal
status under the Seasonal Agricultural Worker provision of the
immigration reform act. They have until Nov. 30.
   With the amnesty program about to end, the government is
preparing to shift the emphasis to employers. The immigration
reform act mandates sanctions against employers who knowingly hire
undocumented workers.
   Starting June 1, the INS has the discretion to issue warning
citations or fine employers who violate the law. Currently, the INS
must initially issue warning citations.

<HEAD>Severe May Snow Storm Lashes Colorado, Wyoming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wyoming and Colorado braced for near-blizzard conditions today
as a May snow storm bore down on mountainous areas, dumping up to a
foot of new snow, while a line of thunderstorms swept over the
Great Plains.
   In Wyoming, winter storm warnings remained in effect today for
the eastern portion of the state, along with the Bighorn Mountains
and the Wind River Range. Evanston and Rock Springs were blanketed
by up to 7 inches of snow Sunday night.
   Up to a foot of new snow was expected today in the higher
elevations of eastern Wyoming, and near-blizzard conditions were
expected to develop this afternoon in the southeast quarter of the
state.
   A winter storm warning was in effect for the northern and
central mountains of Colorado, where 6 to 12 inches of snow was
expected. The storm warning also covered western South Dakota,
where up to a foot of snow was forecast.
   A winter storm watch was posted for the northeastern foothills
and higher elevations around the Pikes Peak and Palmer Divide areas
in Colorado.
   Meanwhile, strong thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold
front crossing the Great Plains. A thunderstorm in southeastern
Colorado brought high winds that uprooted trees and damaged yard
fences Sunday night.
   The line of thunderstorms extended from southwest Kansas into
west-central Texas early this morning. A tornado watch was posted
for a large part of the Texas panhandle, portions of northwest
Texas and much of the Oklahoma panhandle.
   Today's forecast called for rain scattered over northern Maine
and the northern half of the Pacific coast; rain with snow in the
mountains from the northern half of the Plains into the Rockies;
rain and thunderstorms across Oklahoma and much of Kansas and
strong and gusty winds over Mississippi and the southern Plains.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 30s and 40s over the
Rockies; the 50s and 60s over New England, the lower Great Lakes,
Virginia, West Virginia, northern Minnesota, the Dakotas, the
western central Plains, the upper Missouri Valley, and the northern
half of the Pacific Coast; the 80s over Florida, the central Gulf
Coast states, the lower Mississippi Valley, southeastern Texas and
the desert Southwest; the 70s over the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 13
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 74 degrees at Key
West, Fla.

<TEXT>
   Two bombs exploded early today in this
northeastern port city, injuring 16 people, two of them seriously.
A separatist group told a local newspaper it had planted the bombs.
   Police said one bomb placed near a window of a branch of the
Banco Central exploded at 2:05 a.m. (8:05 p.m. EDT Sunday) and
shattered the bank's windows.
   Soon after authorities arrived, a second bomb with more than
four pounds of shrapnel exploded in a nearby garbage container,
injuring 16 people.
   Two of them, a national policeman and a paramilitary civil
guard, were hospitalized with serious leg injuries. The other 14,
including four firemen and ten civilians, were treated for cuts at
a local hospital and released.
   The group Free Land, which supports independence for the
four-province region of Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the
capital, took responsibility for the two blasts in a telephone call
to the local Avui newspaper.
   The group has claimed responsibility for several attacks in
Barcelona, including a March 17 explosion at the British Consulate,
a bomb blast outside the U.S. Embassy last October and two attacks
on American businesses in 1987.

<HEAD>Three Officials Offer To Take Place Of New Caledonia Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three rightist elected officials
today offered to change places with 21 hostages held by Melanesian
militants, but the main separatist group ridiculed the proposal.
   Dick Ukeiwe, who represents New Caledonia in the French Senate,
said he and two members of the National Assembly, Jacques Lafleur
and Maurice Nenou, wished to ``take the place of the hostages to
bring an end to their ordeal and to assume fully our
responsibilities.''
   A group of Melanesians who killed four gendarmes in an attack
April 22 are still holding 21 officers hostage in a cave on Ouvea,
a small island off the eastern coast of New Caledonia.
   Bernard Pons, minister for overseas territories in Premier
Jacques Chirac's conservative government, endorsed the proposed
exchange and Noumea Mayor Jean Leques ordered all offices, shops
and bars in the capital closed at 4 p.m. (1 a.m. EDT) in support of
the idea.
   The Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, known by its
French initatials FLNKS, dismissed the offer and reiterated the
demand for a mediator with authority from Chirac and Socialist
President Francois Mitterrand to negotiate a referendum on
independence for the Pacific island territory.
   Hnalaine Uregei, a member of the FLNKS political bureau, told
reporters the exchange proposal was ``at the same time grotesque,
ridiculous and indecent.''
   On Sunday, the front rejected Monsignor Michel Calvet, Roman
Catholic archbishop of Noumea, as a mediator to negotiate the
release of the hostages.
   ``We want someone who would be representative of the colonial
power, who would have authority to commit the colonial power,''
Uregei said today.
   Uregei, Lafleur and Nenou are all members of Chirac's rightist
party, the Rally for the Republic, and among the most prominent
opponents of the separatist movement.
   Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of New
Caledonia's 145,000 population. About 36 percent of the population
is European, and the others are mostly Asian or Tahitian.
   The FNLKS is opposed to Chirac's plan for giving partial
autonomy to the territory, as endorsed last year in a referendum
boycotted by the separatists.
   On April 22, the rebels raided a post of the gendarmerie _
police under military command _ seizing 27 officers and killing
four. Twelve hostages were released, but eight others taken,
including the head of an anti-terrorism squad and an assistant
prosecutor.
   The prosecutor and the anti-terrorism squad leader were freed
and ordered to negotiate on behalf of the terrorists, but told the
remaining hostages would be killed if the two men did not return to
the cave hideout. Because of that threat, authorities still
consider the two as hostages, for a total of 23.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jimmy Swaggart's refusal to stop
appearing on two television shows produced by his ministry led the
Christian Broadcasting Network to drop the programs, a CBN
spokesman said.
   ``We had given Swaggart by mail a period of time to decide
whether to comply with our request that he not appear in the
shows,'' Earl Weirich, spokesman for the Virginia Beach, Va.-based
cable TV network, said Sunday.
   ``If he wasn't (going to appear) we would continue to carry the
shows. But we were notified that he thought that was not in the
best interest of Swaggart's evangelical association,'' said Weirich.
   The decision deprives Swaggart of the largest network carrying
his shows. CBN carries religious shows, children's shows,
documentaries, reruns of old TV series and family entertainment to
nearly 37 million homes, the spokesman said.
   Swaggart's ministry paid to air the shows, which had an average
viewership of 40,000 to 80,000 homes, said Weirich, who was in Los
Angeles for the annual convention of the National Cable Television
Association.
   On Sunday, the network canceled the weekly hour-long broadcast
of services from Swaggart's Louisiana church. It also pulled a
weekday morning Bible study called ``A Study in the Word,'' which
was replaced with a half-hour animated children's show of Bible
stories called ``Flying House.''
   The cancellations follow Swaggart's refusal to accept a yearlong
preaching suspension ordered by national directors of the Assembies
of God denomination. That followed a three-month suspension by the
Assemblies' Louisiana directors after Swaggart confessed publicly
to unspecified sins, which reportedly involved voyeurism with a New
Orleans prostitute.
   Swaggart has said he will resume preaching May 22.
   In the letter to Swaggart about two weeks ago, CBN offered to
retain the programs if he remained off them for the year, Weirich
said.
   A spokesman for Swaggart could not be reached because he does
not take calls on weekends.
   According to figures released by Arbitron last month, Swaggart's
weekly show had an audience of 1.961 million households in February
and the daily show was watched by 323,000 households.
   On Sunday, Swaggart, promising he would try to never again
criticize anyone, appealed for $6 million to save Jimmy Swaggart
Ministeries during one of his few national television appearances
since his unexplained ``moral failure.''
   Swaggart, who was joined by his wife, Frances, and son, Donnie,
said he was appearing neither as a preacher nor a teacher. He said
he was continuing to abide by his self-imposed, 90-day ban on those
activities.
   Swaggart did not talk about his alleged indiscretion or his
troubles with the Assemblies of God during the taped, hour-long
telecast. It aired in time slots that had featured Swaggart
preaching until his confession Feb. 1.
   Swaggart said the ministry's budget was devastated by his
problems.
   ``We have to raise the funds if we are to keep the ministry
going,'' Swaggart said. ``Stations will cancel if we cannot pay
them. We cannot pay them what we do not have.''

<HEAD>Disabled War Veteran Begins Attempt to Cross Nation in Sailplane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHULA VISTA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vietnam veteran who lost both legs
in combat took off in a sailplane in a 2,500-mile attempt to become
the first person to glide across the United States.
   The sailplane Eagle, with pilot Terry Frazier, 41, at the
controls, was lifted into the air by a tow plane Sunday at Brown
Field near the Mexican border.
   Frazier is trying to raise nearly $50,000 in pledges to help
maintain the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.
   Frazier, a nationally ranked sailplane competitor and English
professor, hopes to average about 200 miles a day, reaching Kitty
Hawk, N.C. _ the birthplace of aviation _ on May 19.
   Frazier plans to glide his 15-foot-long craft back to the
Charlotte (N.C.) Motor Speedway, landing inside the racetrack
grounds, to wave the starting flag for the May 22 Winston Cup
NASCAR stock car race.
   Others have tried similar flights, but have been forced to
complete part of the trip by hauling their sailplanes on a trailer,
he said.
   ``I'm not real concerned with whether I accomplish being the
first person to fly (a glider) the entire distance; I'm in it for
the challenge of making the flight,'' Frazier said before takeoff.
   Since taking up the sport six years ago, Frazier has conducted
one ``soar-a-thon'' a year to benefit charity. This is his first
transcontinental attempt, however, and he said the purpose makes it
even more special.
   ``I think the Vietnam Memorial is one of the most important
monuments we have. It's an opportunity for people to heal about the
war and come to grips with their feelings about Vietnam,'' Frazier
said.
   ``Every veteran I know who is still alive feels he's part of
that Vietnam Monument,'' said Frazier, who lost his legs in a 1967
morter attack that took the lives of six of his buddies and wounded
another 18.
   Proceeds from flight pledges will be given to Friends of the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a nonprofit group which helps maintain
the monument and assists in memorials for familes of deceased
veterans.
   Frazier has developed artificial legs that clamp onto his
glider's foot controls. He said he became hooked on gliding when he
saw his first one in flight 10 years ago.
   ``I don't even like planes that have engines or gas because when
I was in Vietnam I saw too many planes go down in flames,'' Frazier
said. ``I feel more secure in a plane with no fuel and no engine.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in thin European trading today,
helped by new interest in the U.S. currency from Tokyo traders who
reappeared briefly on the market. Gold prices fell.
   East Asian markets came back to life today as market players
returned to trading in Tokyo for one day before going into another
three-day holiday spell.
   The markets were closed in Tokyo on Friday for Emperor
Hirohito's birthday. Most major Japanese financial institutions are
to be closed May 3-5.
   Dealers said East Asian players were reacting belatedly to the
Friday report that the U.S. index of leading economic indicators
for March rose 0.8 percent. A 4 percent increase in U.S.
single-family home sales for March reported Friday also had a
favorable impact on trading, as did news that two small U.S. banks
had raised their prime lending rate to 8.75 percent from 8.5
percent.
   In addition, traders were opening new positions at the beginning
of the month, which was boosting the dollar, dealers said.
   However, trading was thin because foreign exchange and bullion
markets were closed today in London for a bank holiday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.51 yen to a closing 125.33 from 124.82
yen on Thursday.
   Later, in Europe, it was quoted at 125.28 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.6823 West German marks, up from 1.6725
   _1.4005 Swiss francs, up from 1.3910
   _5.7145 French francs, up from 5.6805
   _1.8844 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8745
   _1,251.00 Italian lire, up from 1,242.00
   _1.2285 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2280
   The British pound was quoted in Europe at $1.8705, compared with
$1.8785 Friday.
   Reported intervention by the Bank of England to stem the pound's
rise on Friday afternoon cast a slight pall on the pound's
near-term prospects, traders said.
   Gold fell in Zurich to a bid price of $447.50 from $449 on
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 2.06 to close at a bid $450.30.
   Silver was quoted in Zurich at a bid price of $6.48 a troy
ounce, up from Friday's late London bid price of $6.45.

<TEXT>
   An editor of the Communist Party journal Red Flag
said it will be replaced by a livelier new magazine that readers
will enjoy.
   Red Flag, for decades the definitive account of China's
political theory, will cease publication June 16 and be replaced
July 1 by the magazine Seek Truth. The new title comes from a
favorite slogan of Chinese leaders: ``Seek truth from facts.''
   The new magazine ``will firmly implement the policy of `let a
hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend' and
have lively theoretical discussion,'' said Su Xing, Red Flag's
associate editor.
   The ``100 flowers'' slogan refers to Mao Tse-tung's 1957 call
for intellectuals to freely voice criticisms of the party. The
campaign was followed in 1958 by a severe crackdown.
   ``In short ... we will publish a lively magazine that readers
will enjoy reading,'' Su, 30, said in an interview in the official
People's Daily.
   Sources said last December that the Communist Party Secretariat
decided to stop publishing Red Flag because other publications have
taken over its role as the voice of the party.
   Thoughts of China's leaders are now found in the People's Daily,
the weekly Outlook and the national Guangming Daily, which is aimed
at China's intellectuals.
   Red Flag once was required reading for Chinese and foreigners
trying to follow theoretical and political trends within the
Communist Party.
   However, it was increasingly ignored as it gained a reputation
for supporting the old-guard conservative line being displaced by
China's more pragmatic, reform-minded leaders.
   Su said Seek Truth would reflect the thinking of China's
leadership by discussing the reforms in China and looking into the
current political situation, especially the problems created by
reform.

<TEXT>
   Thirteen members of the Bandidos motorcycle gang
were arrested and eight others were being sought on federal
explosives and conspiracy charges stemming from two 1983 bombings,
an official said.
   Among those arrested Saturday in Corpus Christi, Longview and
Lubbock were top leaders of the national gang, said Richard Garner,
agent in charge of the Dallas office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
   The suspects are accused of staging the Dallas area bombings in
retaliation for an earlier 1983 clash with the rival Banche gang,
Garner said.
   The bikers were named in a 23-count sealed indictment returned
March 31 by a federal grand jury in Dallas, he said.
   Two other Bandidos members named in the indictment were already
in custody, Garner said.
   A bomb placed near the gas meter of a home in the Dallas suburb
of Lancaster exploded July 5, 1983. Later that day in Dallas, a man
and his 1-year-old daughter received minor injuries when a bomb
exploded inside the van they were in.
   Garner said the blasts were believed intended for members of the
Banches.
   ``Earlier in the year, in the spring of 1983, the Banches and
the Bandidos got into an altercation in Porter, Texas, that
resulted in one Bandido member being killed and several members of
each club being wounded,'' he said.
   Garner said a three-year investigation by the ATF and the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration turned up evidence that the
bombings were retaliatiory.
   Porter is about 25 miles north of Houston.
   Those arrested include Ronald Jerome Hodge, age unknown, of
Memphis, Tenn., identified by authorities as the Bandidos' national
president; Franklin D. Schmick, 44, of Lubbock, national vice
president; and William Jerry Pruett, 48, of Mansfield, Texas,
national secretary-treasurer.
   Garner said all face federal explosives and related conspiracy
charges and some may face further charges.
   The maximum federal penalty for receiving or possessing
destructive devices is 10 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine on
each count. The maximum penalty for the conspirarcy charge is five
years and a $250,000 fine.

   First lady Nancy Reagan sang ``Thanks for
the Memories'' to Bob Hope during taping of an NBC-TV special
honoring the comedian's 85th birthday and his 50th year with the
network.
   Mrs. Reagan was among more than three dozen celebrities to
salute Hope during the three-hour taping Sunday. The show is
scheduled to air May 16.
   ``Eighty-five is getting up in the middle of the night as often
as Burt Reynolds, but not for the same reason,'' quipped Hope,
whose actual birthday is May 29.
   Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Lucille Ball, Danny Thomas and
Dinah Shore, who appeared on Hope's first NBC television broadcast
in 1950, toasted and roasted the English-born comedian in song and
comedy.
   About 40 other stars sent their greetings via videotape,
including President Reagan, who introduced his wife to the audience
at NBC Studios. She sang Hope's theme song, ``Thanks for the
Memories,'' to him before wishing the entertainer a happy birthday.
   The taping was preceded by a black-tie cocktail party, said
Hope's publicist, Ken Kanter.
   Hope, who started with the network in 1938 with the weekly radio
``Pepsodent Show,'' said he doesn't feel his age.
   ``The number of years one has lived is not a reason to grow
old,'' he said.
   Hope maintains a schedule that would tire many people half his
age. He walks a mile a day around his home in nearby Toluca Lake
and plays golf whenever he can.

<HEAD>Economy Expanding Again, Purchasing Managers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy reversed a three-month slowdown in
April as production and new orders picked up sharply, according to
a survey of purchasing managers.
   The National Association of Purchasing Managers, a trade group
with about 30,000 members, said its index of economic activity
released Sunday rose to 54.9 percent last month from 53.3 percent
in March.
   The index had declined the first three months of the year,
indicating a slowing in economic growth. A reading above 50 percent
generally indicates economic expansion, while a reading below that
benchmark indicates the economy is declining, the group says.
   For the first four months of this year, the index has averaged
55.1 percent.
   The April increase was sparked by a surge in production.
Thirty-seven percent of the 250 purchasing managers surveyed
reported increased production at their companies, while 53 percent
said output remained the same as in March and 10 percent said it
fell. In March, 29 percent of the respondents said production was
up.
   Another factor boosting the index was an increase in new orders.
Thirty-seven percent of the respondents said they had more new
orders, compared with 29 percent in March. Forty-nine percent said
orders were running at the same rate of March and 14 percent said
they had fewer new orders.
   New orders tend to signal how well the economy will fare in
succeeding month. April's economic expansion was forecast by a
surge in new orders in March.

<TEXT>
   Irish Republican Army guerrillas
who killed three British soldiers and injured three in a car
bombing and an ambush may have escaped from the Netherlands, police
said today.
   ``It is easy to escape,'' police spokesman Louis Steens told
reporters in Roermond, six miles from the West German border. He
said it takes ``a short time to get away'' through relatively open
borders with Germany and Belgium.
   One British airman was killed and two injured in this
southeastern city when their car was sprayed with automatic weapons
fire early Sunday morning. An hour later, a car bomb in
Nieuwbergen, 30 miles north of Roermond, exploded, killing two
British airmen and severely injured a third.
   Police said the two attacks on the six servicemen, who were
visiting from their bases in West Germany, were closely coordinated.
   There are no border controls for passenger cars crossing the
Dutch-Belgian border 30 miles from Roermond. The West German border
is more tightly controlled but also has some unmanned crossings at
night.
   The IRA attacks were the group's first in the Netherlands since
the 1979 slaying of Britain's ambassador. British forces in West
Germany were told today to take extra precautions when traveling in
or near the Netherlands.
   Signs at border crossings near Roermond said ``BFG (British
Forces in Germany) Persons Advised Not To Enter Holland.''
   The Irish, British and Dutch governments immediately condemned
the attacks on the British soldiers. The British government said
the six airmen were off duty and unarmed when attacked.
   In Belfast, Northern Ireland, the IRA claimed responsibility on
Sunday.
   Steens told reporters today that ``there were a few witnesses
who spoke about a person they saw'' in Roermond when three Royal
Air Force enlisted men were fired on after getting into their car
parked outside a local cafe.
   ``It was a man,'' Steens said.
   Senior Aircraftsman Ian Shinner, 20, died instantly, while a
fellow airman was listed in serious condition at a local hospital
and a third was treated for minor shoulder injuries. The injured
men were not identified.
   In the Nieuwbergen attack the car carrying the three service was
torn apart by the blast as it pulled out of the parking lot of a
discotheque. Two airmen _ John Miller Reid, 22, and John Baxter, 21
_ were killed and a third, who was not identified was severely
injured.
   Police appeared at a loss for clues to the trail of the
assailants, and at the news conference declined to confirm reports
that the explosion that wrecked the car at Nieuwbergen was caused
by a bomb.
   Both border towns are frequent recreation destinations for
British troops stationed in West German border bases.
   The blast, which could be heard up to five miles away, caused a
fireball ``higher than the shops'' said Henk Mennink, who runs a
nearby snack bar.
   ``You could see two bodies hanging on the front seats, and
pieces of skin were lying at my door,'' Mennink told the AP on
Sunday.
   The victims were in the Netherlands for local festivities
marking the official 50th birthday of Dutch Queen Beatrix. Both
their cars carried British license plates.
   Police evacuated homes in Nieuwbergen on Sunday and searched
other British-registered cars for possible bombs.
   The IRA claim of responsibility was received by media in Belfast.
   The group's message said: ``We have a simple message for
(British Prime Minister) Mrs. (Margaret) Thatcher: Disengage from
Ireland and there will be peace. If not, there will be no haven for
your military personnel and you will regularly be at airports
awaiting your dead.''
   The message was an apparent reference to the British leader's
highly publicized March 23 trip to a Royal Air Force base for the
return of the bodies of two British soldiers killed four days
earlier at an IRA funeral in Belfast.
   The victims from Sunday's shooting attack were based at a Royal
Air Force base in Wildenrath, West Germany, and were members of 16
Squadron RAF Regiment, which mans the Rapier anti-aircraft defense.
The car bomb victims were from the RAF Laarbruch base in West
Germany. Their unit was not immediately known.

   The government will consider whether servicemen
should continue using special British license plates following the
Irish Republican Army's slaying of three airmen in the Netherlands,
a minister said today.
   The IRA has threatened to kill more British servicemen following
Sunday's attacks in which three airmen also were injured.
   The six servicemen were traveling in two cars with special
license plates. One car was sprayed with machine-gun fire. The
other was destoyed by a bomb.
   Several British lawmakers have criticized the license plates as
a ``giveaway'' to terrorists.
   Armed Forces Minister Ian Stewart was asked in a British
Broadcasting Corp. radio interview whether their continued use
would be looked at as part of the security review promised on
Sunday by Defense Secretary George Younger.
   ``Yes, it certainly will,'' he said. ``There are a number of
aspects we want to look into and that is certainly one of them. We
will want to draw any possible lessons from these attacks.''
   Stewart said the government would look into anything it could do
``to tighten up the security or increase the potential safety of
our lads.''
   The six servicemen, visiting the Netherlands from their bases in
West Germany, were unarmed and off duty when attacked, British
officials said.
   On Sunday and today, the British Forces Broadcasting Service
aired warnings to soldiers and airmen who were away from their
bases in West Germany: ``Terrorists only look at you for one
reason. Be alert. Stay alive.''
   The three men killed were identified by the British Defense
Ministry as Ian Shinner, 20, who was machine-gunned in Roermond,
and John Miller Reid, 22, and John Baxter, 21, who were blown up in
their car in Nieuwbergen.
   All three were senior airmen in the Royal Air Force Regiment
which guards air bases. They were visiting Dutch discotheques and
bars just across the border which stay open later than German ones.
   The three airmen were believed to be the first British military
fatalities caused by the IRA on the European continent. There had
been attacks on British bases but no deaths. Sunday's killings also
ended a 14-month lull in IRA attacks outside Northern Ireland.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the deaths with a statement
through the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau in Dublin, saying it
had a ``simple message'' for British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher:
   ``Disengage from Ireland and there will be peace. If not, then
there will be no haven for your military personnel and you will
regularly be at airports awaiting your dead.''
   The message referred to Mrs. Thatcher's much publicized visit to
Northolt Royal Air Force base in England on March 23 for the return
of the bodies of two British soldiers lynched in Belfast by
mourners at an IRA funeral which they had driven into.
   The killings were seen as retaliation for the March 6 shootings
by British security forces of three unarmed IRA members in
Gibraltar on March 6. The army said the guerrillas were preparing
to bomb an army parade.
   The British armed forces have nearly 70,000 personnel and 80,000
dependants stationed in West Germany at four RAF and five army
bases.
   Since launching its violent campaign to end British rule in
Northern Ireland in 1969, the IRA has killed 392 British soldiers
there and 24 in mainland Britain.
   The known death toll in Northern Ireland is 2,642, according to
Belfast police. It includes 253 police officers, 174 militia of the
British-trained Ulster Defense Regiment and 1,823 civilians.
   The IRA has a network of support in The Netherlands, Belgium and
West Germany. In 1986, Dutch police arrested two major IRA figures
who were involved in a 1983 escape from Belfast's Maze prison and
had spent several years in the Netherlands.

   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union reached a
seven-year high in April, with 1,077 allowed to leave, the agency
helping them to resettle announced today.
   April marked the third straight month of rising emigration,
bringing the total to 3,399 arriving in the Vienna, Austria,
transit center since Jan. 1, according to the Intergovernmental
Committee for Migration.
   The 1988 total is four times the number for all of 1986 but far
below 1979's peak of 51,330 Soviet Jewish emigrants. The 1987 total
was 8,011.
   More than 250,000 Jews have found new homes since the program
began in 1971. In the early years, most proceeded to Israel but
recently the share has declined.
   Of the 1,077 who arrived in Vienna in April, only 162 or 15
percent decided to settle in Israel, said spokeswoman Regina
Boucault. In March, the share had been 18 percent.

   New water rules have started for San
Francisco's 750,000 customers, but it will be at least two weeks
before residents find out how much water they will be alloted
without penalty.
   ``I would encourage (residents) to start saving water now and
not panic until they see how much they will get,'' said city Water
Department Manager James Cooney.
   Eventual penalties could include higher rates.
   The water rationing plan that has a goal of a 25 percent cutback
in useage started on Sunday, a day of dazzling spring sunshine.
   The water rules adopted last week by the city's Public Utilities
Commission prohibits hosing down sidewalks, using hoses without
shutoff valves to wash cars, operating decorative fountains and
automatic service of water to restaurant customers.
   The water-conservation regulations are the first for San
Francisco since the 1976-77 drought. The Public Utilities
Commission voted 4-to-0 for the rationing plan on Thursday, joining
other California regulators who have moved to curtail water use in
homes, businesses and on farms.
   San Francisco received about three inches less rainfall than
normal this season. It gets its water from the snow-fed Hetch
Hetchy system in Yosesmite National Park, where for the second
straight year the snow pack has been far below normal.

<HEAD>Tests Find Apparent Metal Fatigue on Crippled Airliner</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts one graf after 4th graf, ``Nall said ...,' to UPDATE
with comments by Nall today in NBC interview.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>KAHULUI, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Detailed analysis of a jetliner that had
part of its fuselage blown off while flying at 24,000 feet found
cracks apparently caused by metal fatigue, a federal official said.
   ``What appears preliminarily to be fatigue cracking'' was found
at six rivet holes on a metal strip running the length of the
aircraft, Joseph Nall of the National Transportation Safety Board
said at a news conference Sunday night.
   The cracks, measuring 0.2 to 0.6 inch, were discovered on the
metal strip, called the No. 10 stringer, that ran above the
passenger windows on the left side of the Aloha Airlines' Boeing
737, Nall said.
   Nall said all of the plane's rivets, as well as those on Aloha's
other 737s, were being tested electronically in an effort to find
any other cracks.
   In an interview on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, Nall said that
although the general question of metal fatigue in older jetliners
has been discussed and debated in the industry for years, the
safety board viewed the Aloha accident as calling ``significant
attention'' to the problem.
   The plane made an emergency landing Thursday at the airport in
this Maui Island town. The flight from Hilo to Honolulu carried 95
people, including 89 passengers.
   Twenty feet of the plane's upper fuselage covering first class
passengers tore away. A flight attendant who had worked 37 years
with Aloha, Clarabelle Lansing, 57, of Honolulu, apparently was
sucked from the plane to her death, while 61 other people were
injured.
   Seven remained at Maui Memorial Hospital on Sunday in stable
condition with burns and lacerations, nursing supervisor Beverly
Perreira said.
   The seven, who were sitting in the area of the rupture, mainly
in window seats, received their cuts from jagged sections of what
remained of the fuselage, Nall said.
   They also suffered wind burn, he said.
   Only 30 percent of the fuselage remained intact at the point of
the rupture.
   Nall said tests found that repairs made last November to two
cracks in the plane's No. 4 stringer, located farther up the
fuselage, appeared to have held.
   A service bulletin issued by Boeing in April told airlines to
look for corroding fasteners that hold pieces of the fuselage
together.
   Close inspection of the upper skin of early-model Boeing 737s
was ordered Oct. 5 by the Federal Aviation Administration after
routine inspections turned up cracks near where sections of sheet
metal overlap, officials said Friday. The agency warned the problem
could cause rapid cabin decompression, they said.
   Inspections carried out because of the FAA order turned up
nothing unusual, said Aloha Airlines spokeswoman Stephanie Ackerman.
   In the wake of the accident, the FAA has barred some of the
oldest versions of the 737 from flying above 23,000 feet.
   The order affects 66 plans, operated by Aloha, American and
Piedmont airlines, that have made more than 55,000 landings. The
Aloha plane, in service since 1969, had made 85,000 to 90,000
landings.
   Air and sea searchs failed to located any trace of the missing
fuselage section, officials said.
   The section tore away while the first officer, Mimi Tompkins,
was flying the plane at 322 mph to 333 mph, Nall said Saturday. The
flight crew donned oxygen masks as Tompkins turned the controls
over Capt. Robert Schornstheimer, he said.
   The plane hit the runway at 195 mph, 45 mph faster than a normal
landing, because Schornstheimer found the jet's flaps, used for
deceleration, would not work properly, Nall said.

   A member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, criticizing ``confused'' U.S. efforts in Panama, called
on the Reagan administration today to bring Central American
nations together to pressure Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega to resign.
   ``There's been no multilateral effort,'' Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.'' ``There's been
no effort to create a Central American solution.''
   Kerry said U.S. military and intelligence officials have been at
odds with the administration's diplomatic and economic efforts to
oust the Panamanian strongman, who ``has known since the beginning
that there's been a divided administration.''
   ``There's been no process of building a congressional and an
administration bipartisan foreign policy here, as we did for
instance in the Philippines,'' said Kerry.
   Noriega has also been bolstered by the lack of opposition to his
rule from Panama's neighbors, he said.
   ``If we were to isolate Noriega further from the support, the
small support he is currently getting,'' said Kerry, ``if we were
to bring pressure to bear from other Central American countries, so
that he knows there is a united front against him, which he is
aware does not exist today, you would increase your leverage.''
   Kerry's criticism came after reports this weekend that the
Reagan administration was negotiating a deal for Noriega to resign
but remain in the country.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker said Sunday that talks with
Noriega aimed at his removal from power are continued this weekend,
but he said only ``progress is being made.''
   Interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' Baker said he could
not discuss whether Noriega would be allowed to remain in Panama,
saying the talks were ``sensitive'' and were going on ``as we
talk.''
   Panama's commerce minister said Sunday that drug trafficking
charges must be dropped against Noriega before serious negotiations
can take place.
   The U.S. approach in the Noriega negotiations also was
criticized Sunday by Sen. Richard Lugar, a top Republican foreign
policy expert in the Senate, and by Panama's anti-Noriega
ambassador to the United States, Juan Sosa.
   Baker said he expected the U.S. goal of removing Noriega to be
met but declined to predict when or under what circumstances.
   ``I don't think it would be helpful for me to ... get into
hypothetical questions about leaving power, staying in Panama or
leaving power and getting out of Panama,'' he said.
   He said the announcement Saturday that the 40,000 Americans
living in Panama could pay utility, garbage and other bills to the
Noriega-controlled government so services could be resumed was not
a lifting of sanctions. He said such exemptions were contemplated
in the original orders cutting off public and private payments to
Panama.
   Administration officials said Friday that Noriega had agreed
during private talks with a Reagan administration envoy to step
down but not leave the country. However, the deal was denied by
officials in Panama City, and Panama Commerce Minister Mario
Rognoni on Sunday called the Miami indictment against Noriega on
drug trafficking charges a ``political ploy.''
   ``What we see is the United States acting as kind of a terrorist
group now, where they are trying to hold hostage General Noriega by
discrediting him, by making a political indictment, and then trying
to release the hostage by getting some changes to your benefit,''
said Rognoni in an interview on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David
Brinkley.''
   ``For us, the U.S. has to withdraw a political indictment that
was set to have him as hostage of the U.S. foreign policy, and
after that indictment is taken care of, then we can sit and discuss
anything you want with relation to the U.S.-Panama relationship,''
said Rognoni.
   Also appearing in separate interviews on the ABC program were
Lugar, R-Ind.; Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., and Sosa.
   Lugar, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
the United States should keep open the ``military option'' for
changing Panama's government but should not use force or make a
deal with Noriega without support from Panamanians and other Latin
American countries.
   He said the United States should be working with others rather
than ``having a unilateral emissary going back and forth, sometimes
without the apparent support of all elements of our government.''
   Hamilton also pushed for more regional involvement in U.S.
efforts against Noriega and said it would be ``a very severe
mistake'' to use military force in Panama.
   ``The Panamanian defense forces are not to be taken lightly,''
he said.
   Sosa, who supports ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, said
the U.S. negotiations with Noriega ``are not meaningful'' for the
opposition because ``the notion of him staying in the country is
unacceptable.''
   ``Drastic actions of an economic nature, of a political nature,
and some sort of military action will be needed to get him out,''
the envoy said. The military action, he said, should be by
Panamanians.

   Police confiscated weapons ranging from

   At least four people were arrested for investigation of assault
and drunkenness during Sunday night's violence at the United Irish
Cultural Center across from the San Francisco Zoo, police said.
   Within hours, two drive-by shootings occurred in other parts of
the city that may have been related to the battle at the hall, said
officer Dennis Norris.
   Although the fighting was at the Irish center, Norris said most
of those involved in the violence were black or Samoan.
   Officers confiscated an aluminum baseball bat, a tire iron, a
hoe, a shovel, 50 wooden clubs and other weapons, said police Sgt.
Ann Cazahous.
   Norris said a 16-year-old male was shot in the stomach from a
passing vehicle and in another incident a 20-year-old man was hit
in the arm with a blast from a shotgun.
   Both victims were in stable condition at San Francisco General
Hospital.

   Kansas schoolteachers could not smoke at
school under a bill sent to Gov. Mike Hayden.
   The bill, approved by the House late Saturday, would forbid the
use of all tobacco products inside public school buildings where
students are taught. School district workers could smoke in
administration or maintenance buildings where students don't attend
classes. Teachers could smoke outside schools.
   Several public school districts already ban all tobacco within
their buildings, said John Koepke, executive director of the Kansas
Association of School Boards. Many others allow teachers to smoke
in employee lounges, and some allow students to smoke in outside
areas.
   The bill, supported by Hayden, also would prohibit smoking in
juvenile detention centers and group homes for juveniles operated
by the state.

<TEXT>
   The loss of three sailors who died
aboard the submarine USS Bonefish was a loss for everyone in the
Navy family, a chaplain said during a weekend memorial service.
   ``All of us gathered here are in a very real sense one large
family,'' Navy chaplain Lt. Cmdr. Raymond Michener told a
congregation of about 500 at St. Michael's Lutheran Church on
Saturday.
   ``We are brought together by nothing else than the sea,'' he
said, adding ``we remember in sadness at our loss _ a son, a
brother, family members, crew members.
   ``We are also here to remember in joy ... and give thanksgiving
for the lives of our brothers,'' he added.
   The April 24 explosion and fire aboard the USS Bonefish off the
Florida coast killed three sailors and injured 22 others among the
92-member crew of the diesel electric submarine.
   Funerals for Lt. Ray Everts, 30, of Naoma, W. Va.; Petty Officer
1st Class Robert W. Bordelon Jr., 39, of Willis, Texas; and Petty
Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren, 21, of Pisgah Forest, N.C.,
were held over the weekend.
   During the memorial service under the white Gothic arches of the
church on the edge of the city's historic district, the crew of the
Bonefish dressed in their somber winter blue uniforms as a sign of
mourning. Other Navy personnel in the congregation wore their
summer whites.
   ``We loved these three valiant men,'' said Capt. James
Rutherford of Submarine Group Six _ the group to which the Bonefish
was assigned. ``Thank God for men like them who know the price of
liberty.''
   Vice Adm. Daniel Cooper, the commander of the Atlantic Fleet
submarine forces said ``it is all the men of the Bonefish we honor
today.''
   ``The miracle is that 89 men were rescued and the ship returned
to port through the heroic, professional and unselfish acts of
others,'' he added.
   The Bonefish was on exercises off the Florida coast at the time
of the accident. She was towed back to shore, arriving at the
Charleston Naval Base on Friday.
   A Navy investigation into the cause of the accident is under
way, said Lt. Cmdr. John Tull, a spokesman for the Charleston Naval
Base.

   Shell blasts and staccato bursts of
gunfire shook the capital today as police reported 12 people died
and 35 were wounded in factional fighting in Palestinian refugee
camps and neighboring Shiite Moslem slums.
   Meanwhile, the synod of Maronite Catholic bishops met in an
emergency session at the residence of the community's patriarch to
investigate the kidnapping, torture and killing of Monsignor Albert
Khreish, 53, head of the Maronite Spiritual Affairs Court.
   The meeting was chaired by the Nasrallah Sfeir, patriarch of the
850,000 Maronites who make up Lebanon's largest Christian community.
   Police said Khreish's bullet-riddled body was found Sunday by a
bird hunter in a pine tree forest near the Christian resort town of
Ghazir.
   Gunmen kidnapped the priest from his home in Jounieh, a
Christian port north of Beirut, on April 26. He was in his pajamas
when his body was found.
   Khreish was the nephew of Cardinal Mar Antonios Butros Khreish,
the Maronites' former patriarch.
   Police said there were scars indicating physical torture on
Khreish's face and that he had been shot at least 30 times.
   They had no immediate indication as to the reason for his
abduction and slaying in an area controlled by the Lebanese Forces,
the Christians' main militia.
   Christian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
victim's sister is the wife of the elder brother of Nayef Hawatmeh,
a Palestinian leader who heads the Moscow-oriented Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine.
   ``But no one can ascertain whether this has anything to do with
the murder,'' one source said.
   The Lebanese Forces militia is a bitter enemy of the
Palestinians, who have fought alongside other Moslems in Lebanon's
13-year-old civil war.
   Police said gunfire and shell blasts in Chatilla and Bourj
el-Barajneh refugee camps began Sunday and continued today between
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah guerrillas and Syrian-backed
dissidents.
   It was the first major clash between the two sides since
Arafat's reconciliation meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad
in Damascus last week.
   Police said they had no word on what touched off the clash. They
said both sides fired mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and
machine guns.
   At least two people were killed and 15 wounded in the two camps
in southern Beirut, the police report said.
   Ten people were killed and 20 wounded in fighting Sunday and
early today between two Shiite Moslem groups in the slums of Raml
el-Aali and Roweisse, police said. Police said fighters of the Atat
and Awad clans were battling for local dominance in the two
neighborhoods that adjoin Beirut's airport highway.
   Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Amal militia, the Shiites' main
paramilitary force, moved in after after midnight Sunday in a bid
to end the fighting.
   An Amal communique ordered both clans to lay down their arms and

   South Beirut's slums are outside the jurisdiction of a

   The force has restored some measure of order in west Beirut,
which had been plagued by kidnappings, assassinations and bank
robberies since the civil war began in 1975.

   The three-year marriage of chicken magnate Frank
Perdue and Kathleen Markey Perdue ended in divorce last week in
Salisbury, Md., a spokesman for Mrs. Perdue's lawyer said today.
   The terms of the divorce were not divulged, but Mrs. Perdue's
lawyer, Marvin Mitchelson, characterized the split as ``very
amicable,'' said the spokesman, Sy Presten.
   The marriage of May 4, 1985, had been the first for Mrs. Perdue,
38, a former vice president of Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street
firm.
   Perdue, 67, whose chicken business is headquartered in
Salisbury, had been married once before.

<HEAD>Convicted Murderer Commits Suicide In Cell After Escape Plans
Foiled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POLK CITY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A millionaire boatyard owner convicted in
the contract killing of his wife hated prison and killed himself
when an escape plan was foiled, his attorney and friends said.
   Robert Spearman was imprisoned for hiring two men who answered
an advertisement in Soldier of Fortune magazine to kill his wife,
Anita.
   He hanged himself Saturday in his single confinement cell at
Polk County Correctional Center, three days after authorities
thwarted a helicopter escape plan, said state corrections spokesman
Bob Macmaster.
   ``He was always talking about getting out, that he couldn't
stand it,'' said longtime friend Gene Fenno.
   The attempted breakout also did not come as a complete surprise
to another friend nor to his attorney, David Roth.
   ``Mr. Spearman is approaching 60 and serving a sentence which
would not permit him to be released until he's in his 80s,'' said
Roth, who represented Spearman. ``Someone in his position would not
have a great deal to lose.''
   Dyle Lee, a friend, said the escape attempt was ``not out of
character.''
   ``He's the type of person who does what he wants to, when he
wants to,'' Lee said.
   Spearman, 60, had been sentenced to life plus 20 years.
   ``He had tied one end of the bedsheet around his neck and the
other to the top bars in his confinement cell,'' Macmaster said.
``He was in the cell because he was an escape risk _ nobody thought
he would kill himself.''
   The suicide came after authorities uncovered his escape plans,
an elaborate scheme that included escape by stolen helicopter from
the Zephyrhills Correctional Institution in Tampa, where he had
been serving his sentence until Monday.
   Two undercover agents from the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement posing as pilots received $4,700 as a down payment on a
$54,700 contract to steal a helicopter and fly Spearman out of the
prison, said Ed Williams, agent in charge of the FDLE's Tampa
office.
   Spearman asked the undercover agents to have two machine guns
and four hand grenades aboard the helicopter, authorities said. He
intended to use the grenades to kill his prosecutor, Palm Beach
County Assistant State Attorney Moria Lasch, said John Joyce, an
FDLE spokesman in Tallahassee.
   Spearman was charged with attempted escape and weapons offenses.
Stepson Fred Douglas Laurent Jr. of Fort Lauderdale, a suspected
accomplice, was charged with the same offenses but remained at
large, authorities said.
   In his murder trial, prosecutors said Spearman wanted to get rid
of his cancer-stricken wife, a former West Palm Beach assistant
city manager, because he had fallen in love with his secretary and
didn't want a costly divorce. His wife was bludgeoned to death in
November 1985.
   Spearman was accused of paying $20,000 to Knoxville, Tenn., bar
manager Richard Savage, who placed the Soldier of Fortune
advertisement.
   Authorities contended Savage then sent Sean Doutre, 22, a
bouncer at his bar, to kill Mrs. Spearman. Savage, 39, was
convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison for his role.

<TEXT>
   Construction spending, powered by a big gain
in government projects, shot up 1.5 percent in March, the biggest
increase in almost a year.
   The Commerce Department said that construction spending rose to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $401.8 billion in March
following a 0.4 percent increase in February.
   The March advance was the biggest since a 2 percent gain in
April 1987 and reflected increases in all of the major categories.
   The advance was led by a 5.4 percent surge in spending on
government building projects, which climbed to an annual rate of
$82.3 billion, 8.1 percent higher than a year ago.
   Highway construction, the biggest single government category,
posted a 7 percent increase to an annual rate of $27.6 billion.
   Residential construction rose 0.8 percent in March to an annual
rate of $191.4 billion as a 2 percent increase in single-family
construction was nearly offset by a 3.6 percent decline in
multi-family construction.
   Non-residential construction edged up 0.3 percent to an annaul
rate of $92.3 billion with industrial construction, office building
and hotel construction all recording gains.
   The February and March increases followed declines of 2.3
percent in January and 0.02 percent in December. Analysts are
looking for only moderate strength in construction this year
because of widespread over-building of offices and apartments.

<HEAD>Court to Hear Administration Plea in Tax Case Involving Canadian
Citizens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear a
Reagan administration appeal aimed at making it easier for the U.S.
government to turn over tax information to a foreign government.
   The court said it will review a ruling that limited access by
Canadian officials to financial records of two Canadian citizens
with bank accounts in Washington state.
   The Canadian Department of National Revenue, the equivalent of
the Internal Revenue Service here, sought records of Philip Stuart
and Mons Kapoor. Both Canadian citizens have accounts with the
Northwestern Commercial Bank in Bellingham, Wash.
   The Canadian officials said they are investigating the two men's
tax liability for 1980, 1981 and 1982.
   The officials sought the help of the U.S. government under a
1942 treaty between the two nations, and the IRS issued summonses
to the bank in 1984.
   Stuart and Kapoor then asked a federal judge to block the
summonses. The judge declined, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled in their favor last year.
   The appeals court ordered the bank records withheld unless U.S.
officials state the Canadian tax investigation has not reached a
stage analogous to one in this country in which the IRS would refer
the case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.
   ``We do not believe that requiring the IRS to make such a
statement will unduly restrict the service's summonsing authority
or impede enforcement of summonses,'' the appeals court said.
   But administration lawyers said the ruling could hinder U.S.
treaty obligations and impair the ability of investigators here to
obtain foreign financial records.
   The ruling ``requires a treaty partner's tax investigation to
meet standards grounded in domestic policies that have no
application in the treaty partner's jurisdiction,'' the
government's appeal said.
   ``It unnecessarily hinders investigations that the United States
has pledged by treaty to assist and that are entirely proper under
the laws of the treaty partner,'' the appeal added.
   The United States has such tax treaties with 31 foreign
governments and also exchanges information under other agreements
reached with Carribean Basin nations.
   The case is U.S. vs. Stuart, 87-1064.

   A United Airlines Boeing 747 with 258 people aboard
landed safely today at New Tokyo International Airport after three
of its four engines failed, an airline official said.
   None of the 239 pasengers and 19 crew members aboard UAL Flight
97 from Los Angeles to Tokyo were injured, said the official,
Katsuro Isa.
   Isa said the Boeing 747-100 landed at 3:17 p.m. (2:17 a.m. EDT)
with emergency vehicles standing by at the airport in Narita, 40
miles northeast of Tokyo.
   He said the aircraft lost the use of one engine over the Pacific
Ocean approximately one hour and 15 minutes before landing, a
second engine about 30 minutes later and a third engine just prior
to landing.
   Isa said the captain requested and was granted an ``expedited
approach and emergency vehicles standing by.''
   The aircraft taxied under its own power to the terminal and the
passengers left the plane in a ``normal fashion,'' he said.
   Isa said the cause of the engine failures was under
investigation.
   Boeing spokesman David Jimenez, reached at home in Seattle this
morning, said he hadn't heard of the incident but wasn't surprised
the jet was able to land safely.
   ``Almost any aircraft we have is capable of operating on one
engine,'' he said. However, he said he didn't know of any other 747
losing power in three engines.
   A Transport Ministry official at the airport, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the aircraft flew to Narita rather
than other airports in northern Japan because the captain believed
he could reach it safely.
   Kyodo News Service quoted passengeers as saying they were
frightened when told by the crew to put on life jackets and
instructed in their use.
   ``We thought the plane would crash into the sea and we would be
killed'' Kyodo quoted Japanese passenger Tetsu Otani, 25, as saying
at the airport. However, he said the passengers remained calm.
   The agency quoted another passenger, Kazuko Kato, 25, as saying:
``I expected death at any moment.''
   Ms. Kato, who was on her honeymoon, told Kyodo that as the jet
landed, the passengers clapped wildly.
   ``We are lucky we are alive!'' Kyodo quoted Ms. Kato as telling
her husband.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Soviet emigres applauded Natan
Sharansky when they elected him chairman of a group of fellow
former Soviet refuseniks that plans to challenge Israel's
immigration policies.
   ``The recent arrival of a few thousand immigrants showed how bad
the immigrant absorption system is,'' Sharansky said at the meeting
Sunday. ``How can we talk about attracting tens of thousands of
immigrants to Israel when we can't even deal with the few thousand
who came last year?''
   The 40-year-old human rights activist, who spent nine years in
Soviet labor camps, conducted a three-week campaign to unite about
20 groups representing Soviet Jews into an umbrella lobbying forum.
   About 400 activists at the meeting spoke in Russian and proudly
displayed round blue badges designating them as delegates. There
are about 200,000 former Soviet Jews in Israel.
   Sharansky said he wants to set up a private fund to provide
low-interest housing loans for immigrants and create a company that
immigrants can go to for help in building low-cost housing.
   He also proposed an employment agency to help find work for
immigrants and clubs to help immigrants adjust to life in Israel.
   Sharansky said American Jewish organizations are ready to donate
funds directly to the immigrants on condition that they speak with
a single voice.
   His attempt to unite the emigres is not the first in the 19
years of Soviet Jewish emigration. Others have ended in failure,
among them an all-Soviet Jewish party that did not gather the
necessary votes to win a Parliament seat.
   Sharansky has the support of many activists and has succeeded in
bypassing political differences by declaring his forum a
non-political, non-affiliated group.
   ``We shall try to speak in one voice about the issues we agree
upon without involving political arguments,'' he said. But he
dismissed the notion that his movement may become a political party.
   Sharansky played a similar role among Soviet Jews refused
permission to leave the Soviet Union in the 1970s. The best known
Soviet dissident after Andrei Sakharov, he was arrested in 1977,
convicted of being a U.S. spy and sentenced to 13 years in Soviet
prisons. He and the United States denied he was a spy.
   Sharansky was released in February 1986 and came to Israel to
meet his wife Avital, who left the Soviet Union a day after they
were married in 1974.
   Sharansky was seen as a prize for political parties, but he has
called Israeli politics ``nightmarish.''
   ``For a long time I was very cautious about getting involved,''
he said. ``But now it's time to unite.''
   Others at the meeting expressed concern about the high number of
Soviet Jewish ``dropouts,'' Jews who decided to settle in the
United States or West European countries instead of Israel.
   Of more than 8,000 Jews permitted to leave the Soviet Union in
1987, only 20 percent settled in Israel. In April, 1,088 Jews left
the Soviet Union and only 180 came to Israel, Israeli reports said.

   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods climbed 1.6 percent in March, the biggest increase in three
months, the Commerce Department said today.
   The department said that orders for durable and non-durable
goods rose to a seasonally adjusted $216.08 billion in March, the
best showing since a 2 percent rise in December.
   The March advance represented surprising strength, especially
since the government had reported 10 days ago in a preliminary
report that orders for durable goods had remained frozen in March.
   That was changed today to show a healthy 1 percent increase,
reflecting new-found demand in orders for primary metals and
machinery and in the transportation sector.
   The 1.6 percent overall increase followed no change in February
and a slight 0.6 percent drop in January.
   During the first two months of the year, many businesses cut
back on orders in an effort to reduce a large buildup of unsold
goods.
   Originally there was concern that the big rise in unsold goods
that had occurred in the last three months of 1987 would topple the
country into a recession, especially if jittery consumers stopped
buying big-ticket items following the Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
   These fears proved unwarranted, however, as a rebound in
consumer spending helped propel the overall economy to healthy
growth at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first three months
of the year.
   The 1.6 percent March increase in factory orders was aided in
part by a 17.4 percent surge in demand for military equipment,
which rose to $10.04 billion. Without this big defense buildup, the
overall orders increase would have been a smaller 1 percent.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods fell 3.8 percent
to $32.5 billion. Despite the setback, analysts are still looking
for this sector to show strength this year as U.S. businesses boost
spending on expansion projects to meet rising demand.
   Orders for transportation equipment climbed 3.4 percent while
orders for primary metals such as steel were up 6.1 percent and
orders for non-electrical machinery advanced 2.1 percent.
   Orders for non-durable goods, items not expected to last three
years, rose 2.3 percent to $100.6 billion.
   Shipments of manufactured goods increased 2.6 percent to a
record high of $214.4 billion following a 0.8 percent February
increase.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that
construction spending rose 1.5 percent in March, the biggest
increase since April 1987.
   The advance was led by a 5.4 percent surge in spending on
government building projects, which climbed to an annual rate of
$82.3 billion, 8.1 percent higher than a year ago.

   Deposed President Ferdinand Marcos'
95-year-old mother was admitted to a government hospital after she
refused to eat for three days, her doctor said today.
   Dona Josefa Edralin Marcos was dehydrated and had a slight lung
infection on Sunday when she was admitted to the Veterans Medical
Center in suburban Manila, according to Dr. Sergio Brillantes.
   He said Mrs. Marcos' condition ``could become serious'' because
of her age, as well as her diabetes and high blood sugar level.
   Mrs. Marcos stayed behind in February 1986 when a
military-civilian uprising drove her son to exile in Hawaii and
brought President Corazon Aquino to power. Mrs. Aquino has refused
to allow Marcos to come back, saying his return would not be good
for the country.
   Presidential spokesman Ralph Tagle would not comment when asked
if Mrs. Aquino would allow Marcos to return because of his mother's
failing health.

<HEAD>Court Rules in Case of Rhode Island Newspaper that Published FBI
Information</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ruled that federal
lawyers procedurally botched a contempt-of-court case against a
Rhode Island newspaper that published FBI information about a Mafia
boss.
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices said the procedural flaw must result
in dismissing the government's appeal from a ruling that the
Providence Journal was justified in defying a judge's order barring
publication of the material.
   The newspaper thus had its federal appeals court victory
sustained without the Supreme Court ever reaching the merits of the
contempt-of-court case.
   ``Having concluded that the court-appointed prosecutor who
(appealed) and briefed and argued the case without the
authorization of the solicitor general may not represent the United
States before this court, we dismiss (the appeal),'' Justice Harry
A. Blackmun wrote.
   The flaw was called to the court's attention by the Journal's
lawyers, who requested that the case be tossed out.
   The controversy stems from publication of information the FBI
obtained about Raymond L.S. Patriarca, reputed longtime crime boss
for New England, by tapping his Providence telephone without court
approval from 1962 to 1965.
   The Journal was allowed access to FBI logs and memoranda from
the recordings in 1985, after Patriarca died.
   But Raymond J. Patriarca, son of the reputed crime figure,
challenged in court the information's release. He sought to bar
publication.
   U.S. District Judge Francis J. Boyle held hearings on
Patriarca's complaint on Nov. 13, 1985, and ordered the newspaper
not to publish anything from the FBI materials until a Nov. 15
hearing.
   The Journal on Nov. 14 published an article that included
information from the FBI logs and memoranda.
   Boyle then ruled that the newspaper and its executive editor,
Charles M. Hauser, were in contempt. He fined the Journal $100,000
and ordered Hauser to perform 200 hours of public service.
   But the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Boyle's
ruling. The appeals court said the order barring publication had
been ``transparently invalid'' and the newspaper therefore could
violate it with impunity.
   When Patriarca challenged release of the information, Boyle had
appointed Providence lawyer William A. Curran as a ``special
prosecutor'' to represent the federal government because the FBI
and Justice Department were defendants in Patriarca's lawsuit.
   Curran also represented the government in the appeals court, and
filed the Supreme Court appeal that was granted review last October.
   But Curran never received Justice Department permission to file
that appeal, and the Journal's lawyers said the lack of permission
was illegal.
   Federal law requires the solicitor general, the Justice
Department's top-ranking courtroom lawyer, to file virtually all
Supreme Court appeals for the government unless he authorizes
someone else to do so.
   Just why Curran was not authorized by Solicitor General Charles
Fried to file the appeal was not explained in briefs submitted to
the justices.
   The National Law Journal reported that sources close to the case
``blame the solicitor general's office, which, they say, showed
little interest in the case despite efforts by the special
prosecutor to maintain contact.''
   Writing for the court today, Blackmun said, ``Absent a proper
representative of the government as a petitioner in this criminal
prosecution, jurisdiction is lacking and the (appeal) heretofore
granted is now dismissed.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice John Paul Stevens
dissented. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the
case, U.S. vs. Providence Journal Co., 87-65.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis today complained that
President Reagan has failed to provide enough money for day-care
programs and called on him to endorse legislation to expand federal
funding for child care.
   One day earlier, during a stop in Toledo, the front-runner for
the Democratic presidential nomination said his likely November
opponent, Vice President George Bush, did nothing to stop the
Reagan administration from dealing with drug runners instead of
fighting the nation's drug problem.
   Today, at a day-care center in a Cincinnati high school, Dukakis
read a story to 12 children whose mothers attend the school.
   ``This is the kind of thing we need,'' Dukakis said of the
center. ``We need to have it as a matter of national policy.''
   The Massachusetts governor, wrapping up his Ohio campaign with
stops in four cities today, also called for stepped-up federal
efforts to help collect child support from delinquent fathers.
   Dukakis, looking for big wins Tuesday in Ohio and Indiana to
cement his position in the race, also said Sunday that community
intervention, not capital punishment, is the best way to curb drug
trafficking.
   Dukakis met Sunday with law enforcement officials in Toledo and
Akron, countering Bush's recent focus on crime and drugs with sharp
criticisms of past Reagan administration dealings with Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega. Noriega is now under U.S.
indictment on drug charges.
   Dukakis also suggested the administration tolerated drug
smugglers who were used to help resupply the administration-backed
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   ``What kind of message is that for the courageous police
officers, school superintendents, teachers, educators and parents
and the children of the United States of America?'' Dukakis asked
in Toledo.
   ``This is an administration that can't say no to drug dealers
itself. How can it tell our kids to do that?'' Dukakis asked. ``The
greatest threat to our security in this hemisphere is not the
Sandinistas, it's the avalanche of drugs that is flowing into this
country.''
   While he frequently attacked Bush, Dukakis made no direct
references to Jesse Jackson, his sole remaining active Democratic
rival. But he urged supporters to ignore a new poll showing him
with an overwhelming lead in the race for Ohio's 159 Democratic
delegates.
   ``My friends, pollsters don't vote, people do,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis used the backdrop of a county jail in Toledo and
confiscated drugs and weapons at a police station in Akron to
underscore his attacks on Reagan administration drug policy.
   Bush, the certain Republican nominee, has called on Dukakis and
Jackson to support the death penalty for major drug suppliers.
   ``It's been tried,'' said Dukakis, a staunch opponent of capital
punishment. ``It doesn't work.''
   Instead, he called for greater cooperation between federal,
state and local law enforcement and education officials and
increased federal funding for drug programs.
   Such efforts, Dukakis said, have been ``jerked around'' during
the Reagan years because of funding cuts.
   ``If we're going to solve the problem, it's got to be at the
community level,'' Dukakis said from the steps of the county jail
in Toledo.
   From there he went on to Tony Packo's, a restaurant often
referred to by the fictional character Max Klinger in the
television series ``M.A.S.H.''
   There, Dukakis lashed out at Attorney General Edwin Meese III, a
favorite target in his effort to tie Bush to a long list of
allegedly improper activity in the Reagan administration.
   ``I want to be a president who will appoint an attorney general
you and I can be proud of and who will put justice back in the
Department of Justice,'' Dukakis said.
   Earlier Sunday, in Cleveland, Dukakis said he could not describe
Bush's role as vice president because he had not distinguished
himself on any issue.
   ``I'm not sure I can answer what that role has been, frankly,
because he's such a blank slate,'' Dukakis said.
   While in Cleveland, Dukakis participated in a May Day parade in
a Polish neighborhood.
   The poll of Ohio residents released Sunday by the Akron Beacon
Journal showed Dukakis with a nearly 3-1 lead over Jackson _ 62
percent to 22 percent _ with 16 percent undecided and a 3.5
percentage point margin of error. The poll was conducted over 10
days beginning April 20.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Connecticut Police Search KKK Rally Attenders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let
Connecticut police conduct pat-down searches for weapons on all
people who attend Ku Klux Klan rallies.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that such
searches violated individuals' privacy rights.
   Bill Wilkinson, imperial wizard of the Invisible Empire, and
fellow KKK leader James Farrands sued Connecticut law enforcement
authorities to challenge pat-down searches conducted at KKK rallies
throughout the state from 1980 through 1984.
   The first KKK rally in Connecticut in some 50 years was held in
the rural town of Scotland eight years ago. Connecticut State
Police learned that groups with a history of violent confrontations
with the KKK planned several counter-demonstrations in Scotland.
   Police obtained a court injunction allowing them to set up
checkpoints and subject people headed to the rally site to pat-down
searches.
   The searches yielded seven guns, ammunition, 41 knives, two
swords, two machetes, five baseball bats, three pieces of pipe,
eight lengths of chain, two cans of mace, weighted knuckles and a
number of clubs.
   Such pat-down searches were conducted at most of the 16 KKK
rallies subsequently held in Connecticut communities, and yielded
similar weapons. At each, all people seeking to pass established
checkpoints near the rally sites were advised of their right to
turn back and avoid being frisked.
   U.S. District Judge Jose Cabranes ruled that the ban on
unreasonable police seaches contained in the Constitution's Fourth
Amendment was being violated by such pat-down searches.
   Citing a 1967 Supreme Court ruling on police pat-down searches,
Cabranes said such tactics are lawful only when officers have a
reasonable belief that a particular person poses a threat to public
safety.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals essentially upheld the
judge's ruling last Nov. 9.
   ``The mass pat-down searches conducted at these Klan rallies
went beyond the bounds established by the Fourth Amendment,'' the
appeals court ruled.
   But the 2nd Circuit court modified Cabranes' ruling to allow
police to search people and packages at such rallies with
magnetometers, devices that detect metal objects.
   State authorities then sought Supreme Court review, noting that
magnetometer searches do not detect non-metallic weapons such as
clubs and bats.
   Their appeal likened the pat-down searches to the growing number
of public places, such as the Supreme Court's building, that use
metal detectors.
   ``We enter courthouses and other governmental buildings today
expecting to pass through some sort of security system ... Similar
measures are employed with respect to air travel, public
appearances of high government officials or candidates for high
office, military installations, diplomatic facilities and
legislative chambers,'' the appeal said.
   ``We have seen too much ideologically related violence in our
time to ignore the threat it poses,'' the state authorities added.
``Niavete would be too costly.''
   The case is Kelly vs. Wilkinson, 87-1363.

   A man believed to be carrying a hand grenade and
a .38-caliber handgun held at least 10 people hostage today on the
25th floor of the AT&T building in lower Manhattan, police said.
   The incident began shortly before 9:30 a.m. at 22 Cortlandt St.
An initial report on the police radio said the man's wife worked on
that floor and he was having some difficulties.
   The name of the hostage-taker was not known.
   At first, the man was reported to be holding 15 people hostage.
After about 30 minutes, he let five people go, according to Lt.
Thomas Fahey, a police spokesman.
   Police sealed off the block, creating massive traffic jams in
the surrounding streets. The police hostage negotiating team set up
operations on the same floor as the hostage and was in contact with
the man, police said.

<HEAD>Court Refsues to Let States Tax Some Pension Fund Income in
Vermont Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let states
tax pension fund income from investments in federal government
securities.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Vermont
officials who said they should be allowed to tax the income after
it is distributed to retirees.
   The Vermont Supreme Court last December upheld a ruling by a
state judge who said the pension fund money is tax-exempt.
   Superior Court Judge Mathhew I. Katz of Windsor County ruled
that interest on federal obligations _ such as short-term
government borrowing _ is immune from state taxation even when the
income is passed on by a pension fund to a retired investor.
   ``In practical operation, the tax in question was in fact a
state tax on interest derived from federal obligations,'' Katz
said. The fact that pension money was passed on to someone other
than the fund itself does not eliminate the exemption enjoyed by
investments in federal securities, he said.
   The judge rejected arguments by state officials that interest on
a government security is exempt ``only in the hands of the original
recipient unless there is a specific federal statute to pass
through the tax-exempt character of such income.''
   Katz ruled in favor of Loren D. Keys, who when he retired in
1981 received a lump-sum distribution of $141,000 from a savings
plan in which he had invested.
   The money included $35,000 in interest on federal securities.
   Vermont officials said Keys owed an additional tax of $1,246 on
the income from the government obligations. The court rulings in
Keys' favor meant he received a tax refund of $203 plus interest.
   Vermont officials said a lot more was at stake. They said the
state court rulings could force them to examine the source of
payments from pension and mutual funds, corporate dividends and
even bank deposit interest and then eliminate from the state's tax
base any income traced to investments in federal obligations.
   The case is Vermont vs. Keys, 87-1583.

   Defense attorneys for accused
Colombian drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas said today they will rest
their case without calling any witnesses.
   The surprise announcement came on the defense's opening day
after U.S. District Judge Howell Melton denied defense attorneys'
motion for a 60-day delay to allow them time to pore over thousands
of documents introduced during the 22-week trial.
   Lehder, 38, allegedly one of the leaders of the violent Medellin
cartel, is accused of smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United
States from his private island of Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   Lehder's attorney, Edward Shohat, said today the defense
intended only to put some additional documents on the record.
   ``After moving exhibits in evidence, defendant Lehder intends to
rest his case this morning,'' Shohat said.
   Shohat's move came as a surprise. As late as last week, he had
estimated the defense would take two weeks.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller said he could not comment
on the decision itself, but added, ``you could honestly say I
looked surprised and stunned.''
   Stephen Weinbaum, attorney for Lehder's co-defendant Jack
Carlton Reed, 57, said outside the courtrooom he also expects to
rest his case immediately.
   However, Weinbaum said he doubted either side would have closing
arguments ready before the end of the week.
   Following Shohat's announcement, Melton called an hourlong
recess to discuss the defense documents.
   Much of the testimony in the Lehder trial has come from
convicted drug smugglers granted immunity from prosecution, from
others hoping to lessen their sentences and from some who are
awaiting sentencing.
   ``Carlos Lehder pursued a singular dream, a singular vision: to
be the king of cocaine transportation,'' U.S. Attorney Robert
Merkle said in his opening statement in Lehder's trial in
mid-November. ``He was to cocaine transportation what Henry Ford
was to cars.''
   Bahamian officials have also been mentioned during the trial,
with numerous witnesses alleging that Prime Minister Lynden O.
Pindling filled his pockets with bribes from smugglers such as
Lehder.
   Although no violence has been directly attributed to Lehder in
the six-month trial, many witnesses have testified about threats
communicated by Lehder and his workers.
   Lehder is also charged in separate indictments in Los Angeles
and Miami.
   The Miami indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of
the so-called Medellin cartel, believed to be responsible for 80
percent of the cocaine smuggled into United States _ a bonanza
worth $8 billion each year.

   A storm packing powerful wind dumped heavy snow on Western
mountains today, leaving more than a foot of snow in some areas,
after closing entrances to Yellowstone National Park and kicking up
dust storms blamed for two traffic deaths.
   The storm also contributed to weekend wind in Southern
California that left one boater dead and another missing and
believed drowned.
   It was easing eastward onto the Plains but Wyoming, first struck
by the storm on Saturday, was expected to continue feeling its
effects well into Tuesday.
   The National Weather Service predicted up to a foot of snow
today in higher elevations of eastern Wyoming and northern and
central Colorado and the Black Hills of western South Dakota.
Oregon's Cascade Mountains were expected to get up to 6 inches.
   The 7 a.m. temperature in northwestern Wyoming was just 10
degrees in Yellowstone National Park. The weather service warned
fruit growers along Utah's Wasatch Front that a hard freeze was
possible today and tonight.
   The storm left up to 14 inches of snow in the mountains and
foothills of south-central Montana.
   Eight inches of snow fell in northwestern Wyoming, closing
Yellowstone's eastern and southern entrances Sunday. South of the
park, 5 inches of snow was reported in Moose and Jackson, where
downed power lines caused blackouts.
   Heavy rain fell in advance of the snow, with 2.25 inches in 24
hours at Alliance, Neb., and 1.86 inches at Rapid City, S.D., the
weather service reported.
   Interstate 80 in Wyoming was closed today in Wyoming from
Laramie west to Walcott Junction and road conditions continued to
deteriorate as snowfall increased over the state's southern
section, police said. Wind gusting to 40 mph created blizzard
conditions around Cheyenne, parts of which had no power this
morning.
   Schools in Cheyenne were closed and workers in federal offices
there were told to follow their department's bad weather plan.
State government workers living in rural areas were told their pay
would not be docked if they chose not to drive into Cheyenne, said
Dennis Curran, spokesman for Gov. Mike Sullivan.
   Snow also was widespread over eastern sections of Idaho and
northern Utah. Parts of eastern Idaho got 5 inches of snow
overnight. Up to 8 inches was reported at Tooele, Utah, with 7
inches at the Snowbird ski resort east of Salt Lake City and 5
inches at Alta.
   ``The trees are loaded (with snow) and it's the kind of scene
ski films look for. In fact, one's coming in so they timed it just
right,'' said Mike Elwood of Snowbird.
   ``There's quite a few powder hounds, diehards out there,''
Elwood said. ``That's what they love and that's what they're
skiing.''
   In eastern Colorado, the storm unleashed 50 mph wind and caused
a dust storm. Visibility dropped to zero and two pileups occurred
on Interstate 70, killing two people and injuring 17, officials
said.
   ``Visibility was down to zero,'' said State Patrol Trooper James
E. Price. ``Dust was blowing so it covered everything like a film
of oil. You couldn't see in front of your face.''
   About 76 miles of I-70 between Limon and Burlington were closed
for more than two hours until visibility improved.
   In Utah, trucks and trailers with high profiles were banned from
Interstate 80 at Wendover because of the strong wind. Snow and wind
closed Interstate 15 north of Point of the Mountain south of Salt
Lake City for several hours.
   A young cougar that may have been separated from its mother by
the storm wandered into the Salt Lake City suburb of Holladay, said
Bill Bates, a biologist with the state Division of Wildlife
Resources. The cougar was shot with a tranquilizer gun and returned
to the mountains.
   In New Mexico, wind gusted to 80 mph in Ruidoso and 60 mph in
Albuquerque. Ruidoso's Sierra Blanca Regional Airport was closed.
   The northern and central high Plains also had high wind. Gusts
exceeding 50 mph were reported throughout the Dakotas and up to 60
mph in central Colorado.
   The wind whipped loose topsoil into a dust storm around
Aberdeen, S.D., forcing some drivers to turn on their headlights in
the middle of the day Sunday. Farmer Harry Pharis Jr. of rural
Groton said about 30 acres of newly sprouted barley was cut down by
the wind and blowing grit.
   The difference in pressure between the storm and a high-pressure
front off the West Coast generated 65 mph wind in Southern
California on Saturday, causing waves that destroyed a municipal
pier in Redondo Beach and stranded 1,400 tourists on Santa Catalina
Island.
   Boat service to Catalina resumed Sunday.
   The body of a man believed to have jumped from a disabled boat
washed ashore Sunday, said Los Angeles County Lifeguard Sgt. Tom
Hargett. Another man knocked off a boat Saturday near Catalina was
missing and believed drowned, said Coast Guard Petty Officer
Charles Embleton.

   Workers went on strike today at the Lenin
shipyard in Gdansk, birthplace of the Solidarity independent trade
movement, government and opposition spokesmen said.
   Government spokesman Zbigniew Augustynowicz said he did not know
how many shipyard workers were taking part in the strike. It
followed an appeal by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Sunday for a
``day of action'' to support striking steelworkers in southern
Poland.
   A banner at the shipyard gate said ``Sit-In Strike,'' said
Andrzej Gwiazda, a local Solidarity leader in Gdansk, speaking by
telephone. He said the strike began between 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.
   The strike was proclaimed in all departments of the shipyard and
at least 3,000 people were participating, according to Walesa, the
1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who is employed as an electrician
at the plant. Walesa's remarks were reported by Jacek Kuron, a
senior Solidarity adviser in Warsaw.
   Also today workers at an electronics factory in southwest Poland
ended a one-day work stoppage after they obtained a promise for a
$15 a month pay increase and possible further increases later in
the year, opposition spokesmen said.
   The work stoppage at the Dolmel electronics plant in Wroclaw
involved about about half of the plant's 3,500 workers, said
opposition and government spokesmen.
   At a rally held at 2 p.m., workers were told that management
promised the raise after two hours' negotiations, said Jozef
Pinior, a Wroclaw Solidarity leader at the plant. The workers then
decided to return to work Tuesday, he said.
   In Krakow, authorities locked the gates to the medieval
Jagiellonian University after students scheduled a rally there in
support of the striking steelworkers.
   Despite heavy police presence, dozens of students gathered
briefly at two locations in the Old City of Krakow with banners and
leaflets, said Wladyslaw Surdy, a spokesman for the strike. Police
detained 10 people, he said.
   Sunday, thousands of people heeded Solidarity's call for a
national day of protest and scores of demonstrators were arrested
in clashes with police in at least 19 cities.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said 90 people were detained
during the May Day protests. Solidarity spokesman Zbigniew
Romaszewski said authorities detained at least 200 people.
   There were scattered reports of injuries but figures were not
available.
   Meanwhile, steelworkers striking for a seventh day near Krakow
in southern Poland awaited an answer to a request for negotiations
with the deputy prime minister in charge of the economy.
   A secretary to Deputy Prime Minister Zdzislaw Sadowski said
Poland's economic and planning chief had not received a letter sent
Sunday by striking steelworkers. The letter invited Sadowski to
negotiate with them at the Lenin steelworks in Nowa Huta.
   A strike committee at the plant says it represents 16,000 of the
plant's 32,000 employees and is demanding recognition of their
union rights and a 50 percent raise on the average salary of $105 a
month.
   Management said that fewer than 1,000 strikers were at the Nowa
Huta plant Sunday. In Polish strikes, workers come to the plant
during their scheduled shifts but do no work.
   Urban said at least 12,000 people took part in illegal
demonstrations Sunday. Reports from witnesses and opposition
spokesmen put the number at more than 30,000.
   The demonstrations followed a week of strikes and the worst
labor unrest in Poland since the communist government suspended
Solidarity in December 1981. It later outlawed the trade federation.
   Solidarity had called for the demonstrations to protest a lack
of union freedom and the government's austerity policy which has
caused prices to rise by 42 percent recently.
   Romaszewski, the Solidarity spokesman who kept track of arrests,
complained of ``exceptional brutality'' by police in Wroclaw. He
said 84 demonstrators were detained there and claimed that that
even passive protesters were repeatedly beaten.
   In Gdansk on Sunday, Walesa told 6,000 supporters they must
support strikers at the Lenin steel mill.
   ``I demand from you solidarity with Nowa Huta tomorrow, in your
shipyards, in your ports and in your factories. I want it to be
effective. Show me tomorrow what you can do,'' he declared.
   After the rally, police with clubs attacked 500 militants who
tried to march through Gdansk. During the 40-minute melee,
protesters hurled rocks and police beat demonstrators. At least
four people were seen bleeding. Dozens were herded into police vans.
   The state-run news agency PAP said more than 9 million people
attended official May Day ceremonies nationwide.

<HEAD>Court Orders Further Hearings on New Jersey Man Accused of Helping
Nazis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ordered further lower
court hearings to determine whether a New Jersey man accused of
helping Nazis kill more than 2,000 Jews in Lithuania should be
stripped of his U.S. citizenship.
   By a 6-2 ruling, the court set aside a lower court ruling that
revoked the citizenship of 71-year-old Juozas Kungys, a retired
dental technician from Clifton, N.J.
   The decision means at least a temporary postponement in the
government's likely effort to deport Kungys.
   The justices also provided some guidelines for determining when
the government may strip the citizenship of those accused of lying
to gain entry to the United States and to win citizenship.
   Revoking citizenship _ a process called denaturalization _ is a
preliminary step leading to deportation.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in his opinion for the court, said
citizens generally may be denaturalized if their alleged
misstatements or concealments of facts ``had a natural tendency''
to influence decisions by immigration officials.
   Moreover, Scalia said another provision of immigration law
permits denaturalization if the misstatements demonstrate lack of
good moral character.
   The court ordered the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to
reconsider Kungys' case in light of the standards the justices
outlined today.
   The 3rd Circuit court stripped Kungys of his citizenship in
1986, clearing the way for his likely deportation.
   Kungys has lived in the United States since 1948 and became a
citizen in 1954.
   The government said he lived in Kedainiai, Lithuania, in 1941
when Germany's Nazi forces invaded that area, and that he aided in
atrocities against Lithuanian Jews.
   Government lawyers said Kungys, as a member of a miltiary
organization known as Sauliai, helped force more than 2,000 Jewish
men, women and children to undress and walk into ditches, where
they were shot.
   The 3rd Circuit court had ruled that Kungys made ``material
misrepresentations'' when applying for entry into this country and
when applying for citizenship.
   Kungys' lawyers said the alleged lies _ mispresentations about
his age and place of birth _ were not significant enough to cost
him his citizenship.
   Government officials said Kungys also lied about where he lived
during World War II in an effort to conceal his true identity.
   Justices Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor said in a
dissenting opinion that they would uphold the 3rd Circuit court
ruling stripping Kungys of his citizenship.
   The case is Kungys vs. U.S., 86-228.

<TEXT>
   Maryland's 1st Congressional District seat
was a hotbed of scandal and tragedy for Democrats and Republicans
before the apparent suicide of the top aide to Rep. Roy P. Dyson,
the incumbent.
   The problems date to the tenure of former Rep. Thomas Johnson, a
two-term Democrat, who was defeated in 1962 after being indicted
for accepting money from the Maryland savings and loan industry in
exchange for his political influence. After a series of legal
challenges, he went to prison in 1970.
   Johnson's successor, Rogers C.B. Morton, who later became
Republican national chairman, represented the sprawling Eastern
Shore district for five terms before resigning to accept an
appointment as President Richard M. Nixon's secretary of the
interior.
   William O. Mills, a Republican elected in a special 1971
election to fill the vacancy, shot himself to death in 1973 amid
news accounts that he failed to report a $25,000 campaign
contribution from the Committee to Reelect the President, an
undisclosed fund of Nixon's re-election finance committee.
   Newspaper reports at the time said Morton made an unusual
personal appeal to then-Attorney General John Mitchell for money to
help finance the congressional campaign of Morton's close friend
Mills. But Mills' death and the deaths of three campaign managers
in an automobile accident made it almost impossible to trace the
cash contribution.
   Robert E. Bauman, a leading conservative, was elected in 1973 to
replace Mills. But he was defeated in 1980 by Dyson after being
implicated in a sex scandal.
   A charge that Bauman solicited sex from a 16-year-old male
prostitute was dropped after Bauman agreed to be counseled for
alchoholism. He later acknowledged his homosexuality, publishing an
autobiography in 1986 that detailed his marriage, homosexual life
and drinking problem. His marriage was annulled in 1982.

   A sightseeing helicopter that crashed into the
East River, killing a Japanese businessman and injuring the four
other people aboard, fell out of the sky ``like a stone,'' a
survivor says.
   The Bell 206-B Jet Ranger plunged 1,400 feet into the river
Sunday minutes before it was to land. It quickly sank to a depth of
35 feet in the 40-degree water.
   The 22-year-old pilot had been trying to make an emergency
landing and had radioed that the helicopter was experiencing
``performance difficulties,'' said Island Helicopter Corp. Chairman
George Dempster, whose company owns the aircraft.
   Frank Ghiorsi, head of the National Transportation Safety
Board's New York office, said the aircraft was taken to Island
Helicopter's Long Island base for a mechanical investigation.
   Passenger Christian Pelikan said he heard a ``loud, whistling
noise,'' then the helicopter fell ``like a stone into the water.''
   The pilot had activated emergency flotation pontoons, but they
apparently separated from the craft on impact, Dempster said.
   The cabin darkened and filled with water, Pelikan said.
   ``I couldn't open the seat belt,'' the 55-year-old West German
businessman said. ``After about 45 seconds, I slipped out of the
safety belt and found a hole in the door, perhaps it was a window.
I do not know. I could not see.''
   Pelikan, the pilot and two other passengers who made their way
to surface were pulled out of the water by police. They were not
seriously hurt.
   A police scuba diver found the fourth passenger strapped into a
rear seat in the helicopter 1{ hours later, and cut him loose.
   The passenger, identified by the Japanese Consulate as Takashi
Oyama, was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he died, said Peter
Schectman, a hospital administrator.
   Oyama worked for Honda Inc. in Japan, the consulate said.
   Three of the survivors were also taken to Bellevue, where they
were listed in stable condition today. Pelikan was at the Ear and
Eye Infirmary in satisfactory condition.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board are investigating the accident, said
Kathleen Bergen, an FAA spokeswoman.
   The pilot, Robert Marshall of Sea Cliff, was experienced and had
1,700 hours of flight time, Dempster said.

<HEAD>Dissident Scientist Published Five Books Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, an outspoken critic of
Marxism in China, published or edited five scientific works last
year, an authoritative weekly said today in a lengthy article
chronicling Fang's academic achievements.
   ``Writing and editing five books in one year is my record,'' the
Beijing Review quoted Fang as saying. ``It may be the result of my
concentrated effort.''
   One of the books, ``Creation of Cosmology,'' was co-published
with his wife Li Shuxian, a physics teacher at Beijing University,
where the couple live.
   Fang, 52, was expelled from the Communist Party and fired from
his job as vice president of the University of Science and
Technology in Anhui province in January 1987 after being accused of
inciting students to stage pro-democracy demonstrations.
   The official media, however, has stressed in several pieces on
Fang that he enjoys academic freedom at the Beijing Observatory,
where he has been working since last year.
   Since losing his university job ``for outspokenly advocating
bourgeois liberalist views,'' the Beijing Review said, ``Fang has
achieved a great deal in his research work.''
   The article said Fang was allowed to visit Italy for the 12th
time last summer for academic activities, during which he reached
an agreement with the Italian Foreign Ministry to jointly build an
international exchange center for astrophysics in Beijing.
   While in Italy, friends urged him to stay abroad, but Fang
refused, saying that as a scientist he had a social responsibility,
the weekly said.
   It did not mention an interview Fang gave to the West German
magazine Der Spiegel while in Rome in which he said that ``Marxism
is a thing of the past'' and that ``democracy that comes from above
is no democracy, it is nothing but a relaxation of control.''
   The Beijing Review quoted Fang as saying that last year's
student demonstrations and Chinese authorities' ensuing campaign
against bourgeois liberalization, or Western ideas, at least made
people think.
   ``I haven't done an all-round, deep study of China's politics
and economy. I just speak my own mind,'' he said.
   He said the Chinese people have high hopes in the Communist
Party following a major party congress last fall in which leaders
committed the party to long-range political and economic reforms.

   A witness said a stuck throttle may
have caused a race car to spin out of control, killing one person
and injuring five at the state fairgrounds.
   ``There was general chaos, a lot of dust, screaming and
running,'' Kent Gray, who was taking pictures at the event, said
Sunday. ``The driver walked away from the accident in tears.''
   State Police Trooper Nelson Capitano said the car, equipped with
large wheels, hit spectators who were watching the ``mud bog''
event of the General Tire 4-Wheel and Off-Road Jamboree Spring
Nationals.
   ``The vehicle going through the mud bog lost control and went
through a fence that was 350 feet from the end of the bog, and hit
spectators who were 95 feet back of the fence,'' Capitano said.
   ``He just couldn't stop. We don't know if something mechanical
broke or what. We're investigating,'' he said.
   Gray said that when the car got out of the mud bog it made a
loud noise as though the throttle was stuck.
   The car crashed sideways through a wire and wood fence that was
erected for crowd control, then ``rocketed'' toward a group of 30
to 50 spectators at a high rate of speed, Gray said.
   The mud bog is a heavily watered route, 200 feet long, that
includes steep hills.
   Kevin W. Huntley, 23, of Moline, died of massive multiple
injuries, said Sangamon County Coroner Norm Richter.
   Huntley was apparently run over by the car, Richter said.
   Brian T. Luber, 9, of Jacksonville was in critical condition
today at St. John's Hospital, said spokeswoman Mary Jo Gardiner.
   Josephine Gron, 32, of Hobart, Ind., was in serious condition,
and Steve Gand, 23, of Springfield was in fair condition, Ms.
Gardiner said.
   Lewis C. Angeli, 15, of Springfield, was treated and released.
   The driver, Michael Keeney, 31, of Coon Rapids, Minn., was caged
in the car and escaped without serious injury. He was treated at
Memorial Medical Center and released.
   The vehicle was impounded and Keeney was interviewed, but no
charges were expected, Capitano said.

<HEAD>Efficiency Gain Nearly Reverses Previous Quarter's Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The efficiency of the nation's businesses in
churning out goods and services improved at an annual rate of 0.9
percent in the first quarter of 1988, nearly reversing a
deterioration of 1 percent in the last three months of 1987, the
government said today.
   Despite an increase of nearly a million new jobs from January
through March, non-farm businesses raised the total number of hours
worked by only 1.7 percent while achieving a 2.7 percent increase
in output.
   And for the first time since late 1986, workers overall are
keeping up with inflation, the Labor Department said.
   Wages and benefits increased at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in
the first quarter, raising the labor costs associated with each
service or product by 2.4 percent. Those labor costs had
skyrocketed at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the final quarter
of 1987 on a massive employment surge.
   However, after taking inflation into account _ as measured by
relative changes in total output and prices _ the wage gains
yielded not a penny more of purchasing power.
   The 0.9 percent improvement in productivity for non-farm
businesses, which are responsible for about three-fourths of the
nation's economic activity, is only slightly ahead of the 0.8
percent increase for all of 1987.
   Earlier figures had shown a 0.3 percent increase in the fourth
quarter of last year, but those were revised in today's report to a
1 percent deterioration.
   Manufacturing, which still accounts for about one-fourth of the
country's gross national product, continued to lead the effort in
restoring U.S. competitiveness.
   Manufacturers' productivity increased at an annual rate of 2.9
percent in the first quarter with a 4.3 percent increase in output
on only a 1.3 percent increase in the number of hours worked in the
nation's factories.
   For the first time since early 1986, factory workers actually
kept ahead of inflation.
   Nominal wage gains averaging 3.9 percent annually in the first
quarter _ the biggest jump in about three years _ increased the
purchasing power of manufacturing employees by one-half of 1
percent after dropping 2.2 percent in 1987.
   It also raised the labor costs associated with each item coming
off the assembly lines by 1 percent, compared with a nearly 2
percent drop in labor costs in 1987.

<HEAD>Influential Senators Say `No' to Lease-back Space Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four senators who hold sway over NASA spending
say they will not authorize a $700 million scheme to lease an
unmanned robot space factory from the private developers who would
build and own it.
   In a letter to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the senators said that neither the Reagan
administration nor NASA has done the studies to justify such an
expenditure. They directed the space agency to contract with the
National Academy of Sciences to ``undertake a thorough and
independent review'' to be completed by next March.
   President Reagan proposed that the government agree in advance
to lease 70 percent of the so-called Commercially Developed Space
Facility at $140 million a year for five years.
   The private facility would be carried into orbit by the space
shuttle and revisited periodically by astronauts who would service
the factory and bring back its products.
   ``The committee feels that a $700 million budget commitment,
especially in these times of severe budget constraints, should be
based on a detailed assessment of the nation's microgravity
research requirements and capabilities,'' the senators told NASA
administrator James C. Fletcher.
   The letter, dated last Thursday, was signed by the chairman of
the Senate Commerce Committee, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.; the
panel's ranking Republican, Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, and by
senators Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., and Larry Pressler, R-S.C., the
chairman and ranking Republican member of the space subcommittee.
   The administration has sought the facility, which could be ready
for launch in the next decade, as an interim facility to be used
until the proposed manned space station is in orbit in the mid- to
late-1990s.

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis called George Bush a
``blank slate'' and urged him to speak out on breaches of law and
ethics in the Reagan administration. Jesse Jackson talked today of
``a historical dimension'' of his campaign after spending the night
at a union organizer's home.
   Jackson, in comments today in the Cleveland suburb of Berea,
Ohio, said he'd stayed at the modest home of steelworker union
organizer Valentino Fulimeni to bring attention to laborers who he
said have been hurt by administration economic policies.
   ``There simply are two dimensions to this campaign,'' he said.
Besides the race for the presidential nomination, there is ``a
historical dimension. It is part of the thrust to open up the
American political system ... the thrust to empower locked-out
people.''
   One day earlier, as Dukakis was criticizing Bush, Jackson made
fun of Dukakis, saying: ``The kitchen is clean and cool _ ain't
nothin' cooking.''
   The two Democratic rivals and Bush, the guaranteed Republican
nominee, were campaigning today in Ohio on the eve of the state's
primary. The District of Columbia and Indiana have primaries the
same day, but Ohio offers the biggest delegate prize.
   Dukakis, at a day care center in a high school today, complained
that President Reagan has failed to provide enough money for
day-care programs and called on him to endorse legislation to
expand federal funding for child care.
   ``This is the kind of thing we need,'' Dukakis said of the
Cincinnati high school center. ``We need to have it as a matter of
national policy.''
   Jackson, who preached a pair of Sunday sermons in Cleveland,
vowed to ``turn up the heat'' on rival Dukakis. And he brushed
aside surveys suggesting the Massachusetts governor holds a nearly
3-1 lead in Ohio, where 159 Democratic delegates are at stake
Tuesday.
   A poll conducted Friday and Saturday by the Gallup Organization
showed Dukakis with a 65 percent to 23 percent lead over Jackson
among Democrats most likely to participate in the Ohio primary _
results similar to two other polls. All had potential margins of
sampling error of about plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   A poll published Sunday in the Akron Beacon Journal suggested
Dukakis had the support of 62 percent of registered Democrats,
while Jackson had 22 percent and 16 percent were undecided or
supported other candidates.
   Another survey, for the Columbus Dispatch, had similar results _
64 percent for Dukakis to Jackson's 24 percent, with 14 percent for
others. Dukakis also picked up the support of the Cleveland Plain
Dealer, Ohio's largest newspaper.
   The current Associated Press delegate count puts Dukakis at
1,277 and Jackson at 852. But Jackson professed optimism.
   ``Our campaign of hope continues,'' Jackson told backers. ``Our
support base gets broader and bigger every day.''
   Jackson was airing ads in Ohio portraying himself as a candidate
of change, in contrast to Bush and Dukakis. He implied that
Dukakis' cautious style amounted to a lack of leadership.
   ``The kitchen is clean and cool,'' he said. ``Ain't nothin'
cooking.''
   Dukakis spent Sunday sounding law-and-order themes, visiting a
police station in Akron and stopping at Toledo's county jail. And
he hammered away at the Reagan administration, saying that under
it, ``rule of law and respect for the Constitution have not been
the order of the day.''
   In calling for tougher anti-drug efforts, Dukakis cited the
administration's history of dealings with Panamanian strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``How can we tell our kids to say no to drugs when we have an
administration that can't say no to drugs and drug dealers?'' he
said.
   The Massachusetts governor also suggested the administration
could not effectively fight drugs with its top law enforcement
official _ Attorney General Edwin Meese III _ embroiled in his own
legal problems. The attorney general is the subject of a nearly
yearlong criminal investigation.
   ``It's got to begin at the top, with a Department of Justice
that knows what justice and rule of law is all about,'' Dukakis
said in Akron. ``We've got an attorney general that should have
left the office a long time ago _ and you know that and I know
that.''
   Later, in Cleveland, Dukakis said Bush ought to air his views
more fully on Reagan administration policymaking and on
controversial matters like Meese's legal problems.
   ``I'm not sure I can answer what that role has been, frankly,
because he's such a blank slate. One doesn't know. I hope we'll
learn as time goes on,'' Dukakis said.
   Democratic Party chief Paul Kirk also criticized Bush for not
being ``sufficiently outraged'' to get involved in the Meese matter.
   ``There comes a time when personal cronyism ... must be replaced
by a loyalty to public honor,'' he said in an address at the
University of Notre Dame.
   Bush said last week that if Meese were found innocent of the
allegations against him, he would ``certainly'' hire him.
   Bush now has 1,163 delegates, according to the AP tally _ more
than the 1,139 delegates needed to nominate. Former television
evangelist Pat Robertson is still technically a candidate but has
just 42 delegates.

   State Assemblyman Tom Hayden
confronted some South Vietnamese protesters outside his home with a
baseball bat, police said. However, a spokesman for Hayden said the
politician was carrying a bat because he was on his way to coach a
Little League baseball game.
   No injuries were reported and no arrests were made Saturday
outside the home Hayden shares with his wife, actress Jane Fonda,
said Santa Monica Police Sgt. Walter Hard. Miss Fonda, a two-time
Oscar winner, is in Mexico filming the movie ``Old Gringo,'' with
Gregory Peck and Jimmy Smits.
   About 25 people, most of them South Vietnamese, participated in
the protest, carrying signs and calling Hayden a traitor and liar,
Hard said.
   ``Some of them activated the intercom at his front gate and
began chanting into it,'' Hard said. ``It created a confrontation
between the demonstrators and Hayden, who was carrying a baseball
bat.''
   ``He came out swearing at the Vietnamese,'' said Bob Zirgulis of
the International Human Rights Watch, which organized the protest.
   ``We were completely stunned and taken aback that this
politician would go berserk. He actually went berserk,'' Zirgulis
said.
   Hayden, a baseball enthusiast, was on his way to coach a Little
League game when he met the demonstrators on the sidewalk outside
his home, his spokesman, Bill Schulz, said Sunday.
   ``He said he `chewed them out like (Los Angeles Dodgers Coach)
Tommy Lasorda would have had they been banging on his gate,'''
Schulz quoted Hayden as saying.
   Hayden's opponent in the June 7 primary, Alex Cota, was also at
the demonstration, which Hayden accused Cota of staging. Both are
Democrats. On Sunday, Schulz also termed the protest political
shenanigans.
   ``That is totally false,'' Cota responded Sunday. ``I did not
organize the demonstration at all. I came only as an observer after
I heard about the demonstration.''
   The protest was staged to coincide with the 13th anniversary of
the fall of South Vietnam to the communists, Zirgulis said. But the
group also wanted Hayden to apologize for past remarks they feel
were insulting to the Vietnamese, he added.
   Those remarks were made by Hayden in June 1987 about a
U.S.-based Vietnamese gang whom he described as a ``bully element''
involved in shootings, extortion and efforts to raise money to
overthrow the Hanoi government.
   The Santa Monica Democrat, who is seeking his fifth term in the
state Assembly, has often been a target of protests over his
anti-war activities, as has Miss Fonda.
   Hayden was one of the so-called ``Chicago 7'' who were convicted
for their role in protests during the 1968 Democratic National
Convention in Chicago. The convictions later were overturned.
   He was elected to the state legislature in 1982.

   Paul Haldron played hooky so he could watch the
snooker world championships. But when he told his boss he had been
absent due to stomach pains, his boss said, ``You looked all right
on TV'' and fired him.
   The television cameras screening the event live to about 10
million viewers picked him out in the audience at the Crucible
Theater in Sheffield in northern England, the Daily Mail reported
Monday.
   Among the 10 million was Michael Mohr, managing director of
Thomas Dudley Engineering in Sedgley, 60 miles to the southwest,
who dismissed Haldron when he reported to work the next day.
   ``It never occured to me that I would be picked up by the
cameras and have my face beamed to the whole country,'' Haldron, a
27-year-old truck driver, was quoted as saying. ``I have since seen
a video of the day's snooker and saw myself as clearly as if I had
been playing.''

   About 400 leftists rampaged through a working
class section of Berlin, smashing windows, erecting barricades and
pelting police with rocks, officials said Monday.
   Police said 134 people were arrested and 53 police officers
injured in the violence in West Berlin's Kreuzberg district. But
the city policemen's union said that 87 officers had been injured.
   City officials said the violence late Sunday and early Monday
was a sign of what officials could expect in September, when
finance chiefs gather in West Berlin for a World Bank meeting.
   ``This was just a trial run for the World Bank meeting,'' city
interior affairs chief Wilhelm Kewenig said.
   Some stores were looted after the windows were smashed, a police
statement said. Police said one group of hooded men broke into an
apartment and roughed up a 21-year-old man who had been
photographing the melee.
   The vandalism started after an estimated 8,000 people marched in
a May Day parade in the working class neighborhood of Kreuzberg.
   Young leftists in the Kreuzberg district, an area of high
unemployment, stage protests nearly every year on May Day.
   Demonstrations are anticipated during the World Bank meeting
here. Leftists maintain Western bankers should forgive the debts of
heavily indebted developing nations.

   Eritrean rebels said they shelled
Ethiopia's second biggest port, Massawa, and killed 222 government
troops in a battle near Asmara, the region's capital.
   In a clandestine radio broadcast monitored Sunday in Nairobi,
the Eritrean People's Liberation Front said it did not have full
details of the Massawa attack but that ``our combatants inflicted
heavy losses.''
   The radio said front guerrillas fought government troops Friday
at Bahri. The site is near Asmara, Ethiopia's second largest town,
673 miles north of the capital, Addis Ababa.
   ``During this fierce battle our combatants put out of action
about 600 Dergue (government) soldiers. These include 222 soldiers
killed and 375 wounded,'' the rebels said.
   The government rarely comments on rebel claims and there was no
other means of confirming the report.
   On April 19, rebels shelled Assab, Ethiopia's main Red Sea port
in Eritrea. Government-owned Ethiopian News Agency reported the
attack.
   Rebels seeking a separate nation in the northern province of
Eritrea have been fighting the central government in Addis Ababa
for 27 years, the longest civil war in Africa.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam announced in March that his
government is preparing a huge offensive against the rebels, who
have captured several towns in major victories this year.

   More than 65,000 Taiwanese have visited
the Chinese mainland since the Nationalist government eased a
38-year-old travel ban to the mainland last October, the Interior
Ministry said Monday.
   A ministry statement said that by the end of April, another
75,000 people had received approval for making trips to mainland
through a third country.
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war to the Communists, allow people to travel to the mainland
only for family reunions. The government still bans other contacts
with China.
   Interior Minister Wu Poh-hsiung told reporters that authorities
would review the current policy over the next two months to decide
whether to further ease the restrictions on travel to China.
   Some Taiwanese have called for athletic, cultural and other
exchanges with China.

<HEAD>Vietnam Asks For Aid As It Heads Into Another Year of Bad Harvests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vietnam is asking for urgent assistance
from the West because its staple crop, rice, is being ravaged by
bad weather, disease and insects.
   Top Vietnamese government officials told representatives of
foreign embassies and relief agencies on April 14 that these same
problems had caused a shortfall of more than 1.6 million tons of
foodgrain last year.
   According to a Western diplomat who attended the meeting in
Hanoi, the Vietnamese said there was a risk of famine in some
provinces and that some villages in the northern part of the
country hadn't had rice for weeks.
   Two days before the meeting, Vietnam's official domestic radio
said the first crop of 1988 was developing poorly because of lack
of sunlight in the first three months. Twenty percent of the
cultivated area can be rated poor, Radio Hanoi said in a broadcast
monitored in Bangkok.
   The broadcast said nearly 74,130 acres were affected by insects
and diseases and 247,000 acres by root suffocation disease.
   Another 321,100 acres lacked sufficient water, and the water
level of ponds, lakes and reservoirs has dropped 6.5 to 19.5 feet
compared with previous years, it said.
   Storms and typhoons also are expected to take their annual heavy
toll on crops after the rainy season arrives in a few months.
   Communist-ruled Vietnam, one of the world's poorest nations,
annually suffers from a combination of stagnant food production and
high population growth.
   The new pragmatic leadership has stressed reforms based on
material incentives to try to boost agricultural production.
   Western relief officials interviewed last year said there were
no signs of starvation on any significant scale among the country's
63 million people, but that there was widespread and serious
malnutrition, especially among children.
   In the April 14 meeting, the Vietnamese asked for insecticide
and fertilizer which the Western diplomat estimated would cost $100
million.
   He said he doubted the international community would provide the
full amount.
   On April 26, Khmer Rouge guerrillas fighting Vietnamese troops
occupying Cambodia said the West should exploit Vietnam's food
plight by increasing pressure for a Vietnamese pullout.
   ``If aid is given ... it would be like a transfusion of fresh
blood into the body of a blood-starved Vietnam writhing in its
death throes, thus reviving it and enabling it to carry on its war
of aggression in Cambodia,'' a guerrilla radio broadcast said.
   The Khmer Rouge, the strongest of three anti-Vietnamese
guerrilla groups, massacred millions of people when it ruled
Cambodia from 1975 until 1978, when the Vietnamese invaded.

<HEAD>BIA Seeking Advice from Indian Parents on Upgrading Schools</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs, concerned about
the weak education its schools are delivering, is asking Indians
how it should strengthen the instruction of their children.
   A new report from the bureau documenting test scores worse than
those of 79 percent of the nation's students calls on tribal school
boards, councils and others to consider an improvement strategy
emphasizing strong principals held accountable for results.
   Of the bureau districts, what it calls ``agencies,'' only one
showed children scoring above the national median for their grade.
   Tribal leaders and school boards have had access to their own
scores before. But the new report commissioned by Ross Swimmer,
assistant interior secretary for Indian affairs, provides the first
opportunity for one tribe or area to compare its standing with
another, said an Interior Department official who discussed the
document on condition of anonymity.
   The authors conceded that it will be difficult to install new
leaders and revitalizing a system that appears too often to be
going through the motions.
   Calling the system ``in dire need of improvment,'' the report
said: ``It is no secret that BIA education is today an organization
lacking in a sense of direction.''
   ``Its most productive members often feel that any successes they
achieve occur despite the system, rather than with its support.
   ``Collegiality, the act of putting aside vested interests and
working for the good of the whole, is found in America's best
educational institutions but is often missing in the BIA system,
where administrators are sometimes more interested in shoring up
and expanding their administrative domain.''
   Drawing on research findings being promoted by the Department of
Education, the report said:
   ``It is the principal above all who needs to insist on high
standards of achievement for students and teachers and to
communicate the firm expectation that these standards will be met.
Some BIA teachers seem to begin with the expectation that their
students will do poorly.''
   The bureau educates 37,917 Indian students, about 10 percent of
the nation's young Indians and about as many pupils as the public
schools of Oklahoma City, Okla. or Corpus Christi, Texas. About 30
percent attend boarding schools and about 30 percent are in schools
run by tribes under contract with the bureau.
   Few of the students even approached national averages on
standard tests administered in the 1985-1986 school year.
   The highest scores appeared in New Mexico's Northern Pueblo
agency, where 27 second-graders averaged in the 52nd percentile.
This means they did better than 52 percent of all students taking
the test.
   The Laguna agency, also in New Mexico, showed an average in the
46th percentile for its 63 second-graders, and schools not
affiliated with an agency in the eastern states showed 73
sixth-graders in the 49th percentile.
   The worst scores were recorded in the Chinle district of
Arizona, where 202 fourth-graders and 154 fifth-graders, mostly
from rural Navajo families, wound up in the 7th percentile.
   The report highlights some success stories but says the system
needs a systematic way of spreading knowledge of successes to other
areas.
   For instance, the Dilcon and Chuska boarding schools for Navajo
in the Fort Defiance, Ariz., district use a special curriculum
requiring students to write something every day. Their
eighth-graders do well, with Dilcon's two months ahead of the
national average and Chuska's a year above the bureau average,
though a year behind the nation.
   Because of the isolation of the schools, administrative demands,
pay falling behind the public schools and other reasons, the bureau
system has an annual turnover rate of 33 percent per year among
principals and 20 percent among all professionals.
   Among other recommendations, the report calls for consideration
of education loans for prospective teachers, with a larger fraction
forgiven the longer the teacher stays in the system; for recruiting
retired people with valuable knowledge who might like a second
career; and for easing the requirement that Indians be given
preference as principals.

<HEAD>Despite Unrest, Canal Business is `Embarrassingly' Good, Official
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Panama Canal is thriving despite
anti-government unrest and U.S. pressure to oust strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, a canal official says.
   ``Business is almost embarrassingly high,'' said Richard A.
Wainio, chief of economic research and market development for the
bilateral Panama Canal Commission, which runs the waterway linking
the Atlantic and Pacific.
   During the first five months of fiscal year 1988, toll revenues
came to $143.6 million, exceeding estimated revenues by $4.6
million, Wainio said in a recent interview.
   The commission, made up of five American and five Panamanian
government representatives, was set up under a 1977 treaty that
will turn the canal over to Panama in 1999.
   Wainio said neither Panama nor the United States wants to
jeopardize canal operations.
   But there is an impasse over canal revenues because the United
States refuses to recognize Noriega's rule and is trying to force
him out as chief of Panama's Defense Forces.
   The United States has been withholding payments of about $18
million in canal revenues from the Noriega government ever since
the general, under indictment in U.S. federal courts on
drug-trafficking charges, fired President Eric Arturo Delvalle on
Feb. 26.
   In a thinly veiled coup, Noriega had the National Legislature,
which he dominates, oust Delvalle one day after the president tried
to fire the general. The United States still recognizes Delvalle as
the legitimate president.
   Wainio said that canal expenses during the rest of 1988 are
expected to wipe out any revenue surplus.
   The treaty specifies that any surplus revenue, up to $10 million
annually during the life of the treaty, be turned over to the
Panamanian government.
   The United States paid Panama nearly $79 million for use of the
canal in fiscal 1987. Payments in fiscal 1988 are expected to total
$80 million.
   For now, the Reagan administration is depositing the payments in
an escrow account in the United States.
   The commission employs nearly 8,000 people, including
Panamanians and American citizens. Wainio said the employees have
shown up for work regularly.
   The canal has not been affected by violent anti-Noriega
demonstrations that have rocked the rest of the country since June.
In March, a two-week general strike shut down much of the
Panamanian economy, but it had no effect on the canal.
   ``The Panamanians are not going to take a chance of doing
anything that would upset canal operations. They will be taking
over in 1999,'' Wainio said.
   Wainio said that during the first five months of fiscal 1988, a
total of 5,017 vessels navigated through the canal, compared with a
projected figure 5,061.
   Commodities, especially grain, and containerized cargo,
accounted for msot of the increase in cargo.

   A top federal health official says he hopes
the surgeon general's coming declaration that nicotine is addictive
will prompt the public to give cigarette smoking the same attention
as heroin and cocaine use.
   ``When we call this drug an addicting drug, we have to take it
more seriously than we currently do,'' Ronald M. Davis, director of
the federal Office of Smoking and Health, said Sunday on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation'' program. ``We have to at least give it the
serious attention that we do for the illicit drugs such as heroin,
cocaine, etc.''
   Davis said the report by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop will be
issued in the next few weeks and will mark the first time a federal
official with such a high rank will have declared nicotine
addictive.
   Although not directly under Koop in the Department of Health and
Human Services organizational structure, the Office of Smoking and
Health is among several federal agencies working at the direction
of the surgeon general in developing material for the annual
smoking report.
   While there was no question Davis is familiar with the contents
of the report, department officials expressed surprise that he
discussed them in advance of the formal release, tentatively
scheduled May 16.
   Public Health Service spokesman Jim Brown said Koop will not
discuss the report in advance of its release.
   Walker Merryman, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, said
that Davis's statements appear to be based on Koop's upcoming
report, ``which, apparently, he has seen. We have not, and do not
intend to comment on something we have not seen.''
   Davis did not specify what steps should be taken once Koop
issues his report, but he questioned the way cigarettes are
distributed.
   ``Why ... do we sell tobacco products in vending machines?'' he
asked. ``We don't allow other addicting drugs to be sold in vending
machines. Why do we allow free samples of the product to be sent
through the mail? Or to be passed out on public property where kids
and others have free access to them?''
   In the past, surgeon generals' reports on smoking have triggered
both controversy and some strong actions, and Davis said he
expected the same to occur this time.
   ``What we saw with the last surgeon general's report in 1986,
which documented the health effects of passive smoking, that
passive smoking can cause lung cancer, we saw that that accelerated
the trend toward restricting or banning smoking in public places
and in the work place,'' Davis said. ``We would expect that this
upcoming report would lead to serious consideration of what should
be the appropriate public policies for this drug.''
   Among the changes prompted by the 1986 report is the recently
inaugurated ban on smoking on commercial airplane flights that last
two hours or less.
   ``We've been saying for many years now that nicotine is an
addicting drug, just like cocaine, just like heroin, and other
drugs that people commonly accept as addicting,'' he said. ``But
this report, which will be released in a few weeks, looks at the
evidence in far greater detail than we've ever looked at before. It
compares this drug, nicotine, versus other drugs.
   ``And we hope that once the public begins to understand that
this is more than just a simple habit, we will begin to take this
behavior more seriously than we do,'' Davis said.
   The lack of federal regulations on cigarettes is due to the
historical social acceptability of smoking ``and probably the
political influence of the tobacco industry,'' Davis said.
   About 27 percent of the adult population smokes cigarettes,
compared with 42 percent in 1964 when the first surgeon general's
report documenting health risk from smoking was released, Davis
said.

   The United Methodist governing conference today
voted strongly to retain its rules forbidding ordination of
``self-avowed, practicing homosexuals.''
   After an hourlong, tense debate, delegates voted, 676 to 293, to
maintain the restriction, assailed by some as unfair and even
unenforceable.
   Attorney John Stumbo of Topeka, Kans., a delegate, said the
regulation was a ``legal nightmare in terms of provability'' since
self-incrimination violates the concept of due process.
   Another lawyer-delegate, Scott Williams of Muncy, Pa., argued,
however, that the rule was essential and that ``many people owuld
leave the church if it is not retained.''
   The action came shortly after the delegates also had voted
overwhelmingly not to substitute a more liberal section about the
ordained ministry.
   Several other questions related to homosexuality still were
before the conference, including a section of the church discipline
calling ``the practice of homosexuality ... in compatible with
Christian teaching.''
   United Methodists have struggled for 18 years with the status of
homosexuals in the nation's second-largest Protestant denomination.
Delegates the issue the most important before their quadrennial
governing conference.
   An advance poll indicated three-fourths of the 996 delegates
oppose any easing of present restrictions.
   But powerful national agencies of the denomination have urged
modifications in disciplines condeming homosexual practice and
barring active homosexuals from the clergy.
   The issue reached a decisive stage on the seventh day of the
11-day conference, which previously has been occupied in committee
sessions, with floor action now beginning.
   The 9.6-million-member denomination, larger than any Protestant
body in the country except for Southern Baptists, first established
standards against active homosexuality in 1972, following several
years of debate.
   Controversy about the issue has gone on ever since, including at
the last three general conferences.
   ``The sides are too polarized to find any common ground,'' said
the Rev. Elliott Wright of New York City.
   At issue were three sections in the denomination's Book of
Discipline, including:
   A section on social principles terms homosexual persons of
``sacred worth,'' entitled to church participation, care and other
human and civil rights, but adds:
   ``We do not condone the practice of homosexuality and consider
this practice incompatible with Christian teaching.''
   Another section on the ordained ministry says clergy must uphold
``fidelity in marriage and celibacy in singleness,'' adding:
   ``Since the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with
Christian teaching, self-avowed practicing homosexuals are not to
be accepted'' in the ordained ministry.
   A section on administrative order bars use of any church funds
for homosexual groups or ``to promote acceptance of homosexuality.''
   Changes to modify or eliminate the various restrictions were
sought by three denominational boards, along with a women's
commission and youth unit.
   But the church's bishops have urged maintenance of the present
standards.
   Hundreds of petitions on one side or the other have poured in
from regional and local church units and individuals.
   Bishop Earl G. Hunt Jr. of Lakeland, Fla., outgoing president of
the Council of Bishops, says relaxing rules on homosexuality would
lead to an ``angry exodus'' from the church. He adds:
   ``Any legislation that opens the way for the acceptance of
homosexuality as an alternate, normal lifestyle within the
Christian community would be impossible for vast numbers of United
Methodists all over the world to accept.''
   Representatives of a homosexual caucus, Affirmation, said they
had little hope of any change, but wouldn't leave the church over
it.
   ``We are not surrendering the church to its most narrow and
bigoted elements,'' said Morris Floyd of Minneapolis. He told
reporters Sunday that ``heterosexism'' was behind discrimination
against homosexuals.
   Meanwhile, Bishop F. Herbert Skeete of Philadelphia called the
church's plan to start a new university in Africa ``one of the most
exciting missional opportunities we have faced in years.''
   He said the church in Africa ``stands on the threshold of a new
and exciting time.''
   Delegates voted overwhelmingly Saturday to establish the
university in Zimbabwe, with an initial funding of about $20
million. Zimbabwe Methodists have donated a 1,000-acre site for the
project.
   The denomination has 128 colleges and universities in the United
States, but the African institution will be the first one there.
   ``An Africa dream'' Bishop Emilio de Carvalho of Angola called
the project, saying the institution's design and leadership would
be African.

<TEXT>
   Postal executives this week will be introduced
to a new breed of postal clerk that may never smile, but which also
never frowns or gets cranky or takes a break when there's a line
waiting.
   It's the new face of postal technology _ automated postal clerks
_ and they will begin ``greeting'' the American public later this
summer.
   The clerks, Infopost and Autopost, will be on display at the
U.S. Postal Service's Third Advanced Technology Conference in
Washington this week.
   Infopost, which answers customer questions, already is whirring
away in test form. It will be deployed to post offices in the
Washington area this summer to see how it does in real-life
meetings with the public.
   Autopost, which weighs mail, takes money, makes change and sells
postage, is still being built, although a wooden mockup will be on
display. Field tests of a working model are expected in the fall.
   These are but two of the developments that will be under
discussion at the three-day international conference, where
technical managers will exchange ideas about speeding mail movement.
   Improved mail-handling technology is critical to speeding up
movement of the increasing volume of mail while holding down costs,
explained Kenneth Hunter, senior assistant postmaster general for
management information and research technology.
   Postal officials say the agency needs automation to avoid being
swamped by the 250 billion pieces of mail expected by the year 2000.
   Other developments described by U.S. postal officials at a
preconference briefing last week included machines that can arrange
letters and parcels so the addresses all face the same way, read
ZIP codes and handle a variety of other tasks.
   Teaching machines to read handwriting, for example, is something
technicians have struggled with in hopes of developing equipment to
find and read ZIP codes and then print a bar code on the letter _
like those black lines used on supermarket items.
   With the bar code, already widely used by business mailers,
letters can be sorted more quickly.
   Other items under discussion will include laser equipment to
help sort mail, automatic truck loading equipment and robots to
move mail containers and do other jobs.
   On hand to see the American work and discuss developments in
their own nations will be officials from 16 foreign countries,
including Australia, Canada, West Germany, Britain, Japan, the
Soviet Union, Switzerland and Uruguay.
   While these executives may long for high-speed mail sorters and
cargo handlers, the public face of technology will be embodied in
Infopost and Autopost. People accustomed to automatic banking
machines will likely find the new machinery familiar.
   Infopost offers information on a television-type screen which
the customer touches to enter questions. It can respond either with
an answer or with more questions.
   Asked about rates for overseas mail, for example, the machine
can ask the weight of the item, tell what types of things are
allowed to be mailed to the country in question, and give the rates
and expected delivery time for various mail. It also will print the
information on a slip of paper if asked.
   While Infopost deals with just information, Autopost _ also
using an interactive television screen _ is a mailing station.
   It contains a scale which weighs the item to be mailed and asks
for the destination ZIP code. With that information it outlines
mailing options _ first class, priority mail, Express Mail or
parcel post, for example _ and tells the cost of each option and
how long it is expected to take for delivery.
   The customer can then feed coins, bills or a bank cash card into
the machine, and it will make change and issue a postage-meter-like
strip to be stuck on the letter or parcel. It will also give a
receipt, if asked.
   The item to be mailed can then be dropped into a mailbox.
   While Infopost and Autopost are planned for tryouts in lobbies
of post offices, eventually they could be extended to shopping
malls, supermarkets and other locations, according to postal
managers.
   Each will be connected to a central commuter, which will monitor
the supply of postage and change, and call for a technician if
problems develop. The computer will sound an alert if someone tries
to break into the machines.
   The machines should be able to handle an estimated 68 percent of
post office customer business, the Postal Service estimates,
freeing clerks for more complex transactions.

<HEAD>Huge Pole, Flag Raising Ruckus</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON-ON-THE-BRAZOS, Texas (AP) _ A question of crass
versus class has Texans feuding over whether to hoist a flag and
pole 13 stories high at the spot where the state's forefathers
declared independence from Mexico in 1836.
   The 325-foot flagpole would fly a Texas flag one-eighth the size
of a football field over a local park. The flagpole, which
purportedly would be the world's largest, would be about 245 feet
shorter than the San Jacinto Monument near Houston, The Dallas
Morning News reported.
   Edward Smith, a banker from nearby Brenham, wants to donate the
flag and pole. ``Anyone that finds the Texas flag crass and
tasteless sure isn't much of a Texan,'' Smith said at last week's
public hearing on the flagpole proposal.
   Historical purists say the pole and flag would destroy the
dignity of ``the Philadelphia of Texas'' and create a carnival
atmosphere at the park.
   ``Somehow the giant pole strikes me as more appropriate for Six
Flags or AstroWorld,'' Texas A&M University professor Don Ivey said
in a reference to theme parks at the spirited hearing.
   Gus Sanders, a businessman from nearby Chappell Hill, also said
he was opposed to the giant banner and pole.
   ``You Texans,'' said the Louisiana native, ``certainly don't
need to raise your flag any higher.''
   But some residents of this hamlet of Washington, which surrounds
the scenic park that runs to the banks of the Brazos River, say the
flagpole is a banner idea.
   In the hearing conducted by the Parks and Wildlife Department,
Mrs. Arthur Bushrer said the flagpole would be a boon to the
tourist industry and added she was not bothered by claims it would
reinforce the image of Texans being ``insufferable braggarts.''
   ``Everything about Texas is big,'' she said. ```Big as Texas'
used to be something we were proud of. We had big hats, big cars,
big people. We were big in heart and big in pride.''
   Hal Moorman, president of Washington-on-the-Brazos State Park
Association, argued that because of the state's fiscal situation,
the donated flag may not be replaced when it wears out.
   Parks and Wildlife Department staff will make a recommendation
to the agency's nine commissioners, who are expected to deliver a
decision May 12.
   Smith refuses to reveal the cost of the pole and flag, but park
officials estimated they cost at least $100,000.
   The record tallest flagpole _ 299 feet, 7 inches _ was raised in
San Francisco during an international exposition in 1915, according
to the ``Guinness Book of World Records.''
   If the flag isn't raised at the park, Aggie professor Ivey has
another suggestion.
   ``Place it,'' he said referring to the arch football rival
several hundred miles to the north, ``on an island in Lake Texoma
where it would be visible from the University of Oklahoma.''

   Iran-Contra figure Oliver North today told
graduates of the university founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell that
criminal charges against him are an honor and part of a legal
battle he will win.
   ``Those accusations are not a brand _ they are an honor,'' North
told a cheering crowd gathered for his commencement speech at
Liberty University.
   ``God willing, with your prayers and support, we will prevail,
even in Washington,'' North said, a day after his retirement as a
Marine lieutenant colonel.
   North lashed out at congressmen and a special prosecutor who
have charged him with diverting money from an Iranian arms deal to
rebels seeking to overthrow Nicaragua's Marxist government.
   ``We must not just choose the right president'' in 1988, North
said. ``We need a better Congress.''
   In introducing North, Falwell, an independent Baptist preacher,
compared North to Jesus Christ after noting that journalists had
asked him why he chose the indicted North as a commencement speaker.
   ``We serve a savior who was indicted and convicted and
crucified,'' Falwell told some 900 graduating students at the
campus of nearly 8,000 that is part of Falwell's religious empire
in this central Virginia city.
   Earlier, a Falwell spokesman said the evangelist probably would
back North for public office.
   ``He said last night to a reporter he would probably support him
for any state office,'' Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for the
evangelist, told reporters.
   Members of a group trying to draft North for a U.S. Senate
campaign from Virginia were among the thousands who showed up at
Liberty University to watch North make his first public statements
since his indictment in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The chairman of the Draft North for U.S. Senate Committee, Jamey
R. Wheeler, declined to say whether North supports the effort.
   ``He hasn't been telling us to stop, and that's an encouraging
sign,'' Wheeler said. He would not say what the group would do if
North did tell them to halt their drive.
   North, who testified before Congress and later was indicted for
his role in the Reagan administration's most-publicized scandal, is
a fine role model for young people, De Moss said earlier.
   ``We wouldn't have him here if we thought he was a bad role
model,'' he said. ``By and large, this is a politically
conservative school. By and large, we haven't had much opposition.''
   The 8,000-student Liberty University in this central Virginia
city is part of Falwell's religious empire. Falwell plans to
present North with an honorary doctorate in the humanities.
   North's speech today comes a day after his retirement as a
Marine lieutenant colonel.
   North is under indictment on charges he conspired to defraud the
government by illegally diverting profits from Iranian arms sales
to Contra rebels seeking to overthrow Nicaragua's Marxist
government.
   About 60 people from four area peace activist groups, carrying
signs that read ``Ollie Not for President'' and ``Real Heroes Don't
Lie,'' demonstrated in downtown Lynchburg against North's
appearance at the ceremony.
   ``Colonel North is certainly a national figure,'' DeMoss said.
``He's, in Dr. Falwell's opinion, a great American and somebody who
our graduates would remember for a long time as their commencement
speaker.''
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III delivered the commencement
address at Liberty last year.
   Falwell this spring started a national petition drive seeking a
pardon for North. The independent Baptist preacher said he hoped to
present 2 million signatures to President Reagan within the next
few weeks.

<HEAD>U.S. Arms Sales Could Rise $3.3 Billion</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs to UPDATE with the State calls report
misleading; picks up 3rd graf, `The request...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. arms sales abroad could jump by $3.3
billion, to more than $15 billion this year, with much of the
increase going to the Middle East, The New York Times reported
today.
   But State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the Times
report was misleading because a confidential report on which the
story was based does not reflect anticipated sales. He said it
considers only sales which are ``eligible'' for approval during the
calendar year.
   Since U.S. law requires inclusion of all sales that might be
approved, many of which will not take place, ``it would be wrong to
characterize the report in any way as a sales plan or to attribute
any significance to changes in dollar amounts from one year to
another,'' Redman said.
   The report cited by the Times, sent by the State Department to
Congress, lists potential sales to 33 countries. Israel would get
$3.6 billion worth of arms and Egypt $2.7 billion, the Times said.
   The request gives more attention to the Persian Gulf region than
requests of previous years, with the Reagan administration asking
for advanced arms and equipment for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain
and the United Arab Emirates to counter threats from Iran, the
newspaper said.
   Elsewhere, one of the biggest possible purchasers is South
Korea, with a potential $3.3 billion in arms, the report said.
   The president is required to submit an arms sale proposal to
Congress each year, but the master list has rarely become public.
   In the last fiscal year, the United States delivered $11.7
billion in military equipment and services to foreign governments
and $2 billion more was sold directly by manufacturers, according
to the Defense Department. Arms sales abroad peaked in 1982 at
$17.7 billion.
   Egypt was the biggest gainer this year, having bought $378
million last year, the Times said. Most of that was in tanks, it
said.
   Israel would receive nearly $2.8 million worth of helicopters
and F-16 jet fighters under the proposal, the newspaper said.
   Pakistan is listed as a potential buyer of $797 million in
equipment this year, compared with $138 million last year.
   Military sales to the Philippines would decline to $45 million
from $108 million, according to the Times.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   ANTITRUST LAWS
   
   The court said a manufacturer does not always violate federal
antitrust law when agreeing with one retailer to stop doing
business with another who sells at discount prices.
   The justices, by a 6-2 vote, said such a ``vertical restraint''
imposed by a manufacturer on a retailer becomes illegal only when
``it includes some agreement on price or price levels.''
   The case is Business Electronics Corp. vs. Sharp Electronics
Corp., 86-1910.
   
   CONTEMPT-OF-COURT
   
   The court ruled that federal lawyers procedurally botched a
contempt-of-court case against a Rhode Island newspaper that
published FBI information about a Mafia boss.
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices said the procedural flaw must result
in dismissing the government's appeal from a ruling that the
Providence Journal was justified in defying a judge's order barring
publication of the material.
   The case is U.S. vs. Providence Journal Co., 87-65.
   
   TAX INFORMATION
   
   The court agreed to hear a Reagan administration appeal aimed at
making it easier for the U.S. government to turn over tax
information to a foreign government.
   The court said it will review a ruling that limited access by
Canadian officials to financial records of two Canadian citizens
with bank accounts in Washington state.
   The case is U.S. vs. Stuart, 87-1064.
   
   KUNGYS
   
   The court ordered further lower court hearings to determine
whether a New Jersey man accused of helping Nazis kill more than
2,000 Jews in Lithuania should be stripped of his U.S. citizenship.
   By a 6-2 ruling, the court set aside a lower court ruling that
revoked the citizenship of 71-year-old Juozas Kungys, a retired
dental technician from Clifton, N.J.
   The case is Kungys vs. U.S., 86-228.
   
   KU KLUX KLAN SEARCHES
   
   The court refused to let Connecticut police conduct pat-down
searches for weapons on all people who attend Ku Klux Klan rallies.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that such
searches violated individuals' privacy rights.
   The case is Kelly vs. Wilkinson, 87-1363.
   
   EVIDENCE
   
   The court made it easier for federal prosecutors to introduce
evidence in criminal trials of prior ``bad acts'' by defendants
when the purpose is other than proving bad moral character.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices upheld the conviction of a Michigan
man sentenced to a year in prison for possessing stolen videotapes.
   The case is Huddleston vs. U.S., 87-6.
   
   SECURITIES
   
   The court refused to let states tax pension fund income from
investments in federal government securities.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Vermont
officials who said they should be allowed to tax the income after
it is distributed to retirees.
   The case is Vermont vs. Keys, 87-1583.
   
   FISHING RIGHTS
   
   The Supreme Court today refused to award nearly $3 million in
attorneys' fees to Indian tribes who won a lengthy court battle
against Washington state officials over fishing rights.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck
down the award on grounds a federal law reimbursing lawyers who
represent the winning side in civil rights cases does not apply to
the Indians' lawsuit.
   The case is Makah Tribe vs. State of Washington, 87-1390.

<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III on Monday
struck the first 1988 U.S. Olympic coins during a ceremony at the
Denver Mint. The coins commemorate U.S. athletes' participation in
the 1988 Olympic Games.
   Sales of the $5 gold and $1 silver coins are expected to raise
$49 million, which will be sent to the U.S. Olympic Committee to
train present and future Olympians. The gold coins will sell for
$35, and the silver coins for $7.
   Congress has authorized the minting of a million gold coins and
10 million silver coins as keepsakes of the 1988 Olympics.
   Other dignitaries besides Baker present at the ceremony included
Katherine D. Orteza, the U.S. treasurer; Donna Pope, director of
the Mint, and several past and present U.S. Olympians.
   The coins will be available in mid-August at retail stores, coin
and precious metals dealers and participating banks and financial
institutions.

   The Supreme Court said today a manufacturer
does not always violate federal antitrust law when agreeing with
one retailer to stop doing business with another who sells at
discount prices.
   The justices, by a 6-2 vote, said such a ``vertical restraint''
imposed by a manufacturer on a retailer becomes illegal only when
``it includes some agreement on price or price levels.''
   The decision, a significant one for antitrust law, is a victory
for Sharp Electronics Corp. and a setback for a former Houston
retailer of Sharp calculators.
   Business Electronics Corp., owned and operated by Kelton
Ehrensberger, was the exclusive retailer of Sharp calculators in
Houston from 1968 to 1972.
   During that period, Sharp became dissatisfied with BEC's
performance. Sharp contended that it was unhappy with BEC's failure
to meet sales quotas but a federal jury found that Sharp was
dissatisfied with BEC's policy of selling calculators at prices
lower than those suggested by Sharp.
   Sharp in 1972 appointed Hartwell's Office World as a second
retailer of its calculators in Houston, and in 1973 terminated
BEC's dealership. Hartwell had told Sharp that it o the best possible job
at
home before expanding coverage elsewhere, he said.
   Ingersoll, who took over the family newspaper business when he
was 27, has focused on buying newspapers and turning them around by
modernizing and streamlining their operations and targeting their
markets.
   ``Lean, capable management is at the heart of all successful
companies,'' said Ingersoll, whose company has a 1988 revenue
projection of $706 million with an operating cash flow of about
$180 million.
   Ingersoll said one of his corporate goals is to take advantage
of opportunities in European countries and eventually to turn the
company into an American-owned international publishing company.

<HEAD>Judge Bans Press In Surrogate Case</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ A judge has barred the press from a hearing
involving a custody fight between a couple and a surrogate mother,
saying the case was essentially a closed-door adoption proceeding.
   Superior Court Judge Lloyd von der Mehden issued his ruling
April 25 despite appeals by attorneys representing several San
Francisco Bay area news organizations, including the San Francisco
Chronicle, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, the Marin Independent
Journal and San Francisco television station KRON.
   Nancy Barrass signed a contract in 1985 to bear a child for Tim
and Charlotte Myers of Napa after being artificially inseminated
with sperm provided by the husband. She was paid $9,000 when the
boy was born in 1986.
   Barrass, a Novato resident, says she had no intention of giving
the couple full custody of the child. She wants to be legally
recognized as the boy's mother and granted liberal visitation
rights.
   The case is ``more than just a normal adoption matter,'' said
Robert Faux, one of the attorneys who want the hearing opened.
   ``It's important to have the facts and issues before the public
because this is a whole field that has great importance to the
public,'' he said.
   He also said secrecy was not needed because the names of all
parties in the case are already known and have been mentioned in
earlier news stories.

<HEAD>Five Parties Form Coalition after Long Impasse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Five parties reached agreement Monday on
forming a new government, which would end an impasse that began
when the last coalition fell in a language dispute Oct. 19.
   Wilfried Martens, prime minister of the last government and now
serving as caretaker, also would lead the new coalition.
   Jean-Luc Dehaene, a Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat who spent
more than four months negotiating an accord, said he expected
approval at meetings of the five parties Thursday. Involved are the
Dutch- and French-speaking wings of the Socialists and Christian
Democrats and the nationalist, Dutch-speaking Volksunie.
   Keeping Martens as head of the 35th Belgian government since
World War II ``is the best guarantee for continued stability,''
Dehaene told reporters. He said the coalition should be installed
``within three weeks.''
   It will continue the previous center-right administration's
economic austerity program, including tax reform and reductions in
public spending, he said.
   ``The most immediate problems to which government policies must
respond are those of employment and the budget,'' he said.
   The Martens coalition dissolved Oct. 19 in a linguistic dispute
between wings of both his Christian Democrats and conservative
coalition parties from Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern half
of Belgium, and Wallonia, where the language is French.
   In the Dec. 13 elections, the government parties won only 110 of
the 212 Parliament seats, a loss of five, and negotiations on
forming a new government have continued since.
   If the five-party coalition comes together it will control 150
seats, well above the two-thirds legislative majority needed for
constitutional amendments that would increase regional autonomy in
Flanders and Wallonia.
   Dehaene, social affairs minister in the last government, began
negotiations with the five parties Jan. 22 after coalition talks by
two Socialist politicians failed.
   Belgium's population is split between 4.5 million people who
speak French and 5.5 million to whom Dutch is native.

   It has Angie Dickinson scripts, a Bobby
Vee sweater and a replica of the bubble machine that became a
trademark of bandleader Lawrence Welk. But the North Dakota Hall of
Fame, despite years of effort, is still short of the money it needs
to display its exhibits to the public.
   The hall, conceived as a way of recognizing prominent North
Dakotans in fields of endeavor ranging from dairy production to
sportswriting, resembles nothing so much as the cluttered attic of
an eccentric relative.
   It takes up most of a columned office building north of the
state Capitol, but it's not officially open and a visitor is
greeted by an expanse of empty floor space.
   Piles of logs, stacks of bricks and bags of dried leaves rest in
one corner. A potbellied iron stove stands near an old-fashioned
white porcelain sink.
   A 1950s-style malt shop booth and five Welk bandstands, painted
with the Strasburg native's ``LW'' script, sit incongruously in the
center of the main display floor.
   Most of the Hall of Fame's possessions are locked in eight small
rooms, from plaques to books to a mannequin dressed in the uniform
of former Minnesota Vikings standout Dave Osborn. A life-size
cutout of Welk, holding his conductor's baton, stands next to the
football player.
   The white-suited Welk likeness was once stationed on the main
floor, said Jim Kennedy, the hall's executive director. But it was
moved into a room ``because when I'd come in here, (if) it was a
bit dark, he'd kind of startle me,'' Kennedy said. ``It is pretty
realistic looking.''
   Also stashed away are a number of wax dummies, some dressed in
Indian garb, that once were the property of the defunct Great
Plains Museum near Mandan.
   Kennedy and Gary Pearson, a broadcast executive who first
thought of the hall of fame idea five years ago, concede its
development has been slower than expected.
   But Pearson, who has been meeting recently with a number of
non-profit groups in an attempt to obtain contributions, said he
remained optimistic.
   ``We're continuing to move ... except it's taking us a little
bit longer than we thought,'' Pearson said. ``At this point, we
need to work harder at it. We have been.''
   The hall has been adept at publicity, organizing high-profile
North Dakota appearances by Miss Dickinson _ a native of Kulm,
south of Jamestown _ and former CBS News commentator Eric Sevareid,
who was born in Velva, several miles southeast of Minot.
   But promoters have been unable to translate the exposure into
enough money to put the hall into shape. Pearson estimates it will
take $200,000 to $250,000 to organize and staff it for a year.
   So far, the hall has raised $10,000 through a car raffle and a
small sum from selling memberships, said Kennedy.
   ``We don't have very much (money) at all,'' Kennedy said last
week. ``We're just squeaking.''
   Once the hall is set up, Pearson believes it could draw as many
as 90,000 people annually, paying a $2 entrance fee, he said. That
is roughly half the number of vistors that the nearby state
Heritage Center draws each year, he said.
   ``We're not looking at any gigantic amount of money,'' Pearson
said.
   Celebrities such as Miss Dickinson, Welk, Sevareid and pop
singer Vee, who grew up in Fargo, are the highlights of the hall,
Kennedy said. However, its primary goal is to spotlight North
Dakota groups such as the Boy Scouts, civic club dignitaries and
sporting organizations.
   The celebrities ``hopefully are what will make people come in
off the interstate,'' Kennedy said. ``Once they're here, they can
enjoy the rest of it ....
   ``Not too many are going to pull in just to see who the North
Dakota water user of the year is.''

   A man with a gun and a ``bomb-grenade device,''
apparently distraught over losing custody of his two children, took
15 people hostage today at an office building in the Wall Street
area, but released them within several hours and then surrendered.
   Alice McGillion, a police spokeswoman, said 14 of the hostages
slipped away when he let them go to the bathroom, make photocopies
or run other errands.
   ``When the last man was there, he (the gunman) turned to him and
said, `OK, you can go too,''' McGillion said.
   The hostages were apparently unharmed, authorities said. Traffic
in the surrounding streets of lower Manhattan was tied up by the
incident, which drew the police bomb squad and other specialized
police units.
   Members of the police hostage negotiating team moved into
offices on the floor where the hostages were taken.
   The man, identified as Bill Saunders and believed to be a former
AT&T employee, then surrendered at around noon, police said. His
former wife, who works in the office where he took the hostages,
was in Trenton, N.J., this morning seeking a permanent restraining
order against him.
   McGillion said Saunders never threatened the hostages or made
any demands. She said he told the employees in the AT&T offices
that ``he did not want to hurt them, that they were really not a
part of this.''
   ``He's emotional. He's in the midst of a domestic situation,''
McGillion said of Saunders.
   Saunders went to the 25th floor of the building around 9:30
a.m., looking for his former wife, Geraldine. McGillion said the
couple were divorced three years ago and were fighting over custody
of the children.
   Police rushed his former wife to the scene when Saunders
surrendered without incident about 11:20 a.m. Police did not
immediately determine whether the grenade device was real.
   The charges against Saunders, whose age and home address were
not immediately known, had not been determined, said police
spokeswoman Diane Kubler.
   ``On Saturday he threatened her life and she went and got a
temporary order which was served on him yesterday,'' she said. ``He
showed up at her office this morning but she wasn't there. She was
down in Trenton ... getting a permanent restraining order.''
   EMS Capt. Steven Khur said EMS technicians evaluated the freed
hostages on the 24th floor of the building. ``It appears none of
the hostages have received any injuries, just trauma.'' Khur said.

<HEAD>Boom in US Exports, Japanese Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. exports and Japanese imports both boomed
last year, while the United States slowed the pace of its buying
abroad and Japanese sales actually declined, the International
Monetary Fund reported Monday.
   But the United States still bought $173.7 billion worth of goods
more than it sold, up from $169.8 billion the year before.
   Japan's surplus dropped to $80.4 billion from $83.2 billion in
1986.
   Dollar figures reflect the drop in the value of the U.S.
currency in terms of the yen as well as the actual amount of the
goods traded. This drop reduces the value of foreign sales and
increases the cost of imports. In Japan and West Germany, the
effect is the opposite: imports are cheaper and sales bring in less
money, in terms of dollars.
   The drop of the dollar was so large that it outweighed the
increase of U.S. exports in the final balance. At the end of March,
the dollar was worth 8.65 percent less than it was 12 months
earlier, the fund calculates.
   In terms of actual goods sold, U.S. exports rose 13.2 percent
for the year, against only 1 percent in 1986. Imports still grew by
2.2 percent but that was much less than the 10.9 percent of the
year before.
   Japanese imports rose by 6.1 percent in the first nine months of
1987, a considerable increase though less than the 12.8 percent of
1986. Exports dropped by 2.4 percent, more than double the 1
percent of 1986.
   The fund calls these ``real adjustments in trade patterns.'' But
it notes that trade remains way out of balance.
   West Germany raised its imports by 5.2. percent _ somewhat less
than the 5.9 percent increase the previous year. But it also
increased its foreign sales by 2.8 percent, considerably more than
the 0.9 percent rise in 1986.
   The Germans increased their trade surplus to $65.8 billion in
1987 from $52.2 billion a year earlier.
   Taken as a whole, the 21 countries that the fund calls
``industrial'' bought more than they sold to poorer areas: $85.4
billion worth, up from $66.1 billion in 1986. Neither the Soviet
Union nor any other country with a communust government is included
in this category.
   For poorer countries, the fund's monthly ``IMF Memorandum''
emphasized the rise in prices paid by consumers.
   ``Inflation rose sharply in the developing countries in 1987,
led by a sharp acceleration of inflation in the Western
Hemisphere,'' it reported.
   In the Americas, the rise was 118.8 percent, up from 82.2 in
1986, but still below the 161.4 rise in 1985.
   The Third World's three biggest debtors also had the biggest
price rises: 229.7 percent in Brazil, 131.8 percent in Mexico and
131.3 percent in Argentina.
   For the fund's 130 poor countries, inflation was put at 40.1
percent, compared with 29.3 percent in 1986. The rise was moderated
by the record in Asia, where the rate was held to 6.9 percent, up
from only 5.4 percent in a year.

<HEAD>Activists Form Network of Groups in Hungary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 200 people gathered in a central
Budapest restaurant on May Day to form communist Hungary's first
network of activist groups, a participant said Monday.
   The Network of Free Initiatives was formed after 45 dissidents
issued a petition on March 17 calling for the formation of an
umbrella organization of independent political, ecological,
religious and youth groups in support of democracy in Hungary.
   ``We seek to achieve changes in ways already contained in the
constitution,'' the participant quoted dissident writer Janos Kiss
as telling the Sunday meeting at the Hagi restaurant. The
participant spoke by telephone from Budapest on condition of
anonymity.
   Speakers at the gathering, which included leading Hungarian
dissidents, emphasized that the Network of Free Initiatives wants
to work for change by peaceful means.
   The participants elected about 50 representatives to a council
that will lead the new network. In addition to Kiss, they include
leading dissident Miklos Haraszti, Olympic pentathlete Andras
Balczo, writer Peter Esterhazy, and historian Gyorgy Litvan.
   Also elected were representatives of a youth group and of a
newly formed independent union of intellectuals, as well as members
of religious and ecological organizations.
   The meeting adopted a four-point resolution protesting
government attempts to crack down on the Democratic Forum, a loose
association of several hundred intellectuals, the participant said.
   The resolution also protested the recent expulsion of four
liberals from the Communist party, the exclusion of independent
ecology groups from a government-sponsored environmental
organization and the death of Czechoslovak dissident Pavel Wonka in
a Czech jail last week, the participant said.
   Sunday's statement echoed most of the points introduced in the
March 17 petition, which called on the communist government to
overcome Hungary's current economic and social crisis by engaging
in dialogue ``in good faith'' with representatives of Hungarian
society.
   The statement also called for a multiparty parliamentary
democracy in Hungary.
   The March document, obtained by the Associated Press, appealed
for ``good neighborly relations'' with the Soviet Union, but said
Hungary should remain a sovereign nation as well as ``an equal
member of the European family of nations.''
   The petition has been signed by 726 people since it was issued.
   In recent months, the number of independent activist initiatives
has mushroomed in Hungary. Several of these groups have defied
police warnings and continued to organize meetings.
   The participant said the 50-member network council would meet
Wednesday night to thrash out a position paper entitled ``There Is
a Way Out,'' which reflects the network's views on how to solve
Hungary's current problems.
   Hungary is burdened by a gross hard currency debt of $16
billion, the highest per capita in the East bloc. Austerity
measures introduced by the communist government this year have
meant widespread belt-tightening for the country's 10.6 million

   The House today gave final congressional
approval to a bill granting neVeterans     05-w benefits to the ``atomic
veterans''
who were exposed to radiation in the U.S. occupation of Japan
during 1945 or in post-war tests of American atomic weapons.
   The 326-2 vote sends the bill to President Reagan, who may veto
it. Administration officials contend the measure is not based on
firm scientific evidence. The Senate passed the measure a week ago
by a 48-30 vote.
   The bill grants new benefits to the estimated 250,000 U.S.
service personnel who were in Hia
Republic in Phoenix.

   A congressman's top aide wrote a poem, then
leaped to his death from a luxury hotel the day a newspaper said he
made unorthodox demands on male staffers' personal time, including
that one perform a strip tease, police said.
   Tom Pappas, 46, chief assistant to Rep. Roy P. Dyson, D-Md.,
fell 16 floors from his Helmsley Palace Hotel room on Sunday
afternoon after discussing the effect of The Washington Post story
with friends, police said.
   One friend said Pappas was worried Sunday morning that the
article had irreparably damaged his career but didn't seem
depressed.
   Dyson, Pappas and another aide were in New York to meet with a
lawyer and attend the Broadway musical ``Phantom of the Opera,''
police said.
   Pappas left a poem on hotel stationery, said a police spokesman,
Lt. Stephen Davis, who would not reveal the contents. He said the
death appeared to be suicide.
   Pappas, who had a room on the 24th floor, landed on an
eighth-floor ledge, police said.
   Dyson and the second aide, Todd Skipper, had checked out by this
morning, said a hotel detective who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   Today, Dyson's office in Washington, which said it did not know
his whereabouts, issued a brief statement by Dyson expressing
sympathy to Pappas' friends and family.
   ``Tom was my friend and political ally for almost two decades,''
Dyson said. ``All of us who had the privilege of working with him
will miss him more than we can say.''
   In Sunday's front-page story in the Post, Dyson staffers said
Pappas had taken control of the office from the 39-year-old
Democrat, and that Pappas pressured male staffers to socialize with
Pappas.
   One staffer quit and another was fired after they refused to
attend a private party Dyson held at a Maryland hotel suite last
November, the newspaper reported.
   Staffers told the Post that Pappas, who was divorced, told one
male staffer he would have to perform a strip tease in 1987 at an
office retreat in Virginia. The staffer refused, the Post said.
   The article came as the Federal Election Commission investigates
allegations Dyson's campaign disclosure reports concealed $6,650 in
payments to Pappas.
   Pappas, who was paid $72,200 as Dyson's administrative assistant
last year, also owns a company, Pappenbauer Associates, that
received $119,642 in fees and expenses since 1980, a revised Dyson
campaign report shows.
   Pappas helped engineer Dyson's first election to the Maryland
House of Delegates in 1974 and his successful 1980 bid to unseat
Rep. Robert E. Bauman, after the conservative Republican was
arrested for soliciting sex from a 16-year-old male prostitute.
   The charge later was dropped but Bauman acknowledged he was
homosexual and an alcoholic.
   Political consultant Michael Ford said he talked by phone with
Pappas about the Post article for 25 minutes Sunday morning. Pappas
told Ford he was worried that the article had irreparably damaged
his career and had hurt Dyson's re-election chances, the Post
reported today.
   ``I told him, `You've done nothing illegal, you've done nothing
immoral and therefore I think you can deal with this,''' Ford said,
adding he didn't believe Pappas was depressed.
   Pappas, however, ``felt in his own mind that it was a fait
accompli _ that nothing could be done about it,'' Ford said.
   Those interviewed by the Post said they did not believe that the
pressure to socialize with Pappas and others on the staff went
beyond the dinners and events that Pappas organized.
   One press secretary, Scott Ourth, told the Post he was hired
with the requirement that he not date for a year. When Ourth began
dating, ``He called me the `wayward son,''' Ourth recalled. ``He
told me, `You've lost the focus.''' Ourth quit six months after
taking the job.
   Sunday's article quoted a memo from Pappas dated Nov. 14 as
saying, ``...it is important for everyone on this staff to remember
that Tom Pappas is the chief of staff, responsible for everyone's
paycheck. When he expresses a wish, however slight, it should be
taken seriously.''
   A classified ad in the Hannibal (Mo.) Courier-Post placed by
Pappenbauer Associates offered salaries up to $50,000. ``Wanted A
Young Man in A Hurry,'' it said, asking, ``Are you single and
willing to travel?'' The ad asked for a writing sample and recent
photograph.
   Former aides were quoted as saying Pappas excluded female
staffers from his social activities.
   Lawyers for the Dyson campaign advised Pappas not to talk to the
Post, according to Ford and Joe Trippi, a campaign spokesman.
   Neighbors and former staff members told the Post that Dyson, who
is single, frequently stayed at Pappas' large frame house in
Accokeek, Md.

   Archaeologists plan to excavate what one
describes as ``a prehistoric city'' next summer along the Snake
River in Hells Canyon.
   The U.S. Forest Service dig will focus on seven sites along two
miles of the river's Idaho shoreline at Pittsburg Landing, a
popular boat-launching area, said Bruce R. Womack, chief
archaeologist for the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area.
   ``This is more than a site,'' he said. ``You can think of it
like a prehistoric city, in a sense,'' although all of the sites
may not have been occupied simultaneously.
   Pittsburg Landing, one of the few relatively flat areas at river
level inside the gorge, was or prehistoric
encampments, Womack said.
   Hells Canyon contains nearly 1,000 known archaeological sites,
including primitive picture writings and rock carvings called
pictographs and petroglyphs, anciea natural spot fnt Indian rock shelters,
burial
sites and pit house villages dating back 7,000 to 10,000 years,
according to the Forest Service.
   Womack said a crew of up to 12 people will be involved in the
4-month dig and an identical dig in summer 1989. Much of the effort
will focus on ancient house pits, semi-subterranean homes created
by digging 3 to 4 feet into the ground.
   Evidence collected in preliminary work during the past winter
suggests the sites probably have not bhunters often were unaware that they
were
breaking the law when they excavated burial sites and pit houses.
   ``The people who are doing it now know it's illegal and are in
it for the money,'' Womack said.

   A fugitive suspected in a two-year crime spree
that included bank robberies and a shootout with police has been
tracked down through his fascination with high-performance cars.
   Forty FBI agents staked out an auto show at Hershey, Pa., and
arrested Ray Allen Minnick, a convicted bank robber accused in a
series of crimes in the Baltimore area. He was armed but was
arrested without incident Saturday.
   In Harrisburg, Pa., U.S. Magistrate J. Andrew Smyzer today
scheduled a preliminary hearing and bail hearing Thursday morning
for Minnick.
   FBI agent Joseph V. Corless said Minnick's arrest was based in
part on a profile that reflected Minnick's interest in race cars
and his habit of frequenting automotive flea markets. Agents also
received a tip that Minnick would be at the show, but would not say
where it came from.
   Agents posing as gate attendants at the auto show spotted
Minnick when he entered and identified him from an ``X'' tattoo on
his left hand, Corless said.
   He was carrying two concealed handguns and $15,000, Corless
said. A search of his car turned up more weapons, including a fully
loaded machine gun with five loaded magazines, a shotgun, a couple
of switchblade knives and a machete.
   FBI agents had been trying to apprehend Minnick, 40, since
February 1986, when he escaped from Howard County after his alleged
involvement in an armed holdup of a supermarket and a shootout with
Howard County police, the FBI said.
   He is suspected in at least eight robberies of banks and savings
and loans in the Baltimore area and is wanted in connection with
other robberies in Maryland and Pennsylvania, the FBI said.
   The FBI first investigated Minnick in 1972 for the armed robbery
of the First National Bank of Columbia. He was convicted and was
sentenced to 20 years in prison, and was paroled in 1981.

   Crossbreeding between prairie chickens and
grouse is common, but one prairie chicken has taken things a step
further by courting a brown pickup truck as the object of his
affections.
   He arrived at the J.B. and Pat Fischer ranch 23 miles south of
here in late March and has stayed, probably hoping he can convince
the pickup to agree to a mixed marriage of sorts.
   ``He likes my pickup,'' Fischer said. ``He runs toward it
whenever I drive across the meadow, stamps his feet and performs
his ritual for me. I have seen a few grouse near where he stays,
but he tends to ignore them.''
   Prairie chickens ``boom'' and grouse ``dance'' as they gather
for their spring courtship rituals, which are common to both
species and are similar. Prairie chickens inflate large orange air
sacs on their neck, erect tufts of neck feathers and produce a deep
resonant ``boom'' that can be heard for nearly a mile in calm
weather.

   When the halls of Woodland Park
Junior High became a little too gnarly for Principal Charles
Lutgen, he thought it was time students gave him a lesson in the
slang of the day.
   ``I'd hear things,'' he said, ``and I'd think, gosh, is that
good or bad or indifferent?''
   The principal found his answer in ``Slang Struck: A Handbook for
Parents To Better Understand What We're Talking About,'' a
137-word, student-compiled guide.
   The idea for the handbook came from English teacher Lynn
Heintzman. Encouraged by the principal, she tacked a piece of
poster board on the classroom wall and invited students to write in
and ``keep it clean.''
   Included in the handbook are such terms as babe (nice-looking);
stud muffin (nice-looking male); majorly (very, very important);
sweetness (special); and gnarly (cool).
   But the new handbook is in danger of obsolescence already. Some
of the words in ``Slang Struck'' already have different meanings.

   The Alaska Airlines Eskimo is getting a
``cooler'' look for what company officials hope will be a hot
marketing campaign.
   Sunglasses are being added to the popular logo on the tails of
jets serving California routes, company officials announced Sunday.
Flight crews and ground workers also are to wear shades until the
promotion ends in late June.
   ``We are emphasizing our interest and commitment to California
and having a little fun while we do it,'' said Bill McKnight, vice
president of marketing.
   Since 1979, when Alaska added three flights to San Francisco,
the company has grown to one of the major carriers along the West
Coast with 105 flights a day from 10 California airports.
   The Eskimo logo seemed an endangered species earlier this year
after a new, stylized emblem was designed as a potential
replacement, but howls of protest from Fairbanks to San Diego put
that idea on ice.

<HEAD>Dukakis Slowly Brings Lieutenant Governor Into Statehouse Inner
Circle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The day after the March 15 presidential primary in
Illinois, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis hustled home for a
meeting on a thorny state subject: furloughs for first-degree
murderers.
   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy attended the closed-door meeting of the
anti-crime council, and when Dukakis realized that it was the first
time his potential successor had attended the top-level monthly
gathering, he made her a permanent council member on the spot.
   Dukakis slowly has brought his lieutenant governor closer to the
center of state government as his chances of winning the Democratic
presidential nomination have improved.
   As that has happened, advocates, lobbyists and interest groups
have begun seeking out the first woman to hold statewide office in
Massachusetts history.
   ``There have been people coming into my office since early last
year wanting to sort of talk about the `what ifs?''' Murphy said in
an interview. ``I've carefully stayed away from that because it
seemed to me the most important thing I can do for him is to stay
focused on the day to day managing of this state.''
   She still does not meet regularly with Dukakis _ weekly meetings
are scheduled to begin later this month. And she has performed
largely ceremonial duties as lieutenant governor, other than
lobbying for administration priorities and sitting on boards such
as the local government advisory council.
   ``The agreement has been that the governor will set the policy
and Evelyn will help us execute it just like the rest of us,'' said
Dukakis' chief secretary, Hale Champion.
   Only if Dukakis wins the nomination, Champion said, would Murphy
be brought inside the administration.
   Dukakis has said he has no intention of yielding office unless
he wins in November; and even then, he said he might not step down
as governor until he is inaugurated as presient.
   ``Nobody asked John Kennedy to resign from the Senate; nobody
has asked George Bush to resign the vice presidency,'' he said
recently.
   Despite her two stints as a Dukakis cabinet secretary, some
distance remains between the state's two top elected officials.
   In 1986, Dukakis operatives worked behind the scenes in an
unsuccessful effort to block Murphy's nomination for the lieutenant
governorship. At the 1986 state convention, Dukakis aides leaked
the story that Murphy was a political traitor after Dukakis' defeat
in 1978 by trying to stay on in the administration of political
archrival Ed King.
   In 1982, Murphy won no friends in the Dukakis camp when she
remained neutral in Dukakis' successful comeback bid against King.
   Today, she says her role remains limited because it allows
Dukakis to demonstrate leadership at home. But it also leaves her
politically vulnerable, should she inherit the governorship, to
fiscal decisions the Dukakis administration makes now.
   ``It is for him a very important aspect of his campaign
nationally to be able to show people throughout the country as the
governor of this state and as a political candidate and as a
political leader what he can do,'' Murphy said.
   As the state's fiscal picture has tightened recently, Murphy has
taken an increasing interest in planning the state budget that will
carry into next year _ beyond the presidential inauguration. By
June, Murphy said she will present Dukakis her budget analysis and
outline possible disagreements with the governor's plan.
   ``From the day the governor set off to be president over a year
ago now, Hale Champion and I have been meeting daily, building up
the agenda of discussion,'' Murphy said.
   Murphy, 47, served as Dukakis' secretary of environmental
affairs in his first term and as secretary of economics early in
his second term. She holds a doctorate in economics from Duke
University.
   As is the case with any lieutenant governor or even the vice
president, Murphy has few official duties. She has spent her time
on a project called Blueprint 2000, a program to map out the
state's future in areas such as transportation and economics.

<HEAD>`Romance Romance,' A New Musical, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds four grafs with what other critics said. No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Romance Romance'' is a hit and a miss.
   The show, which opened Sunday at the Helen Hayes Theater, is
made up of two one-act musicals, a form of song and dance rarely
seen on Broadway. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick tried it more than
20 years ago with ``The Apple Tree,'' musical versions of short
stories by Mark Twain, Jules Feiffer and Frank R. Stockton. They
had varying degrees of success.
   So do the creators of ``Romance Romance.'' Barry Harman, who
supplied the book, lyrics and direction, and Keith Herrmann, who
wrote the music, have gone to a short story by Arthur Schnitzler
and a play by Jules Renard for their double bill.
   It's the curtain raiser, ``The Little Comedy,'' that proves to
be the more agreeable. The witty Schnitzler short story, set in
turn-of-the-century Vienna, adapts well to the stage. The tale is
told in the form of letters to old friends. The format is not as
confining as one might think because the missives are acted out by
the two main characters.
   The letter writers, Alfred and Josefine, are bored, jaded
members of the Viennese upper crust. They toss away lovers like
yesterday's strudel. For a little excitement, the two of them go
slumming and meet in a park. He pretends to be a penniless poet.
She becomes a poor shopgirl. Poverty attracts, at least for a while.
   Reality finally sets in, and both are relieved to discover they
are from the same wealthy social set. The two lovers will get
married. But don't expect the union to last, they both say at the
fadeout.
   Harman keeps the slender story spinning and although his rhymes
are often predictable, they at least illuminate the characters or
advance the tightly focused plot. Herrmann's music has the
appropriate old world charm, especially a lilting title song. ``The
Little Comedy'' is a crisp confection topped with just the right
amount of sour cream.
   But things turn soggy in Act 2, a moist little musical called
``Summer Share.'' The locale is a trendy Hamptons beach house
shared by two married couples. Monica is Sam's best friend, even
though they are married to other people. So how long will it be
before they have an affair? Well, they think about it for a long
time. So do their mates. And so does the audience, left squirming
while the two would-be lovers make up their minds.
   The characters are sketched so skimpily that it's impossible to
work up interest in any of them, especially after they keep
insisting how wonderful their marriages are.
   Although ``Summer Share'' claims to be the more modern of the
two shows, it is also the more sentimental and shopworn. The
evening ends with the characters urging theatergoers to ``cherish
your romantic notions.''
   Scott Bakula is an ingratiating, handsome leading man. He's
rakish and debonair in the first musical, pensive and appealing in
the second. As the unrepentant coquette, Alison Fraser is
perfection in the first act, but the sappy material defeats her in
the second musical. Deborah Graham and Robert Hoshour are properly
morose as the left-out spouses in Act 2.
   Steven Rubin's modest settings are in keeping with the modest
tone of the whole evening, while Steven Jones' costumes capture the
spirit of both eras.
   The musicals, originally done last fall at a tiny
off-off-Broadway theater, have undergone some reworking in their
transfers to the larger Helen Hayes. ``Summer Share'' received the
biggest rehab, but the fixing didn't do much good.
   ``Romance Romance'' offers two looks at love, one lively, the
other leaden. Stay until intermission and you'll have an
entertaining time.

   What other critics said:
   In the New York Times, Walter Goodman said ```Romance, Romance,'
lately the littlest musical off-off-Broadway, has made it uptown,
in a slightly enhanced production that loses nothing of the charm
and intelligence of the original ... In a Broadway season so full
of pretentiousness, this show is delightfully small scale ...''
   Howard Kissel in the Daily News wrote, ``For all its virtues,
`Romance, Romance' is a show that keeps you at a distance ...
Ultimately, the material is arch and clever. You don't feel you're
rediscovering simple affection. Rather, you feel you're being let
in on a joke.''
   In the New York Post, Clive Barnes said, ``Just as the evening
is a pair of sketches, the show's joys and disappointments are
mixed.'' Barnes praised the two leads, Scott Bakula and Alison
Fraser, but added, ``The sad thing is that the musical _ or at
least the music _ doesn't really support them.''

   The United States on Monday urged the Polish
government to negotiate with its labor unions and to refrain from
using force against striking workers.
   ``The current strikes in Poland demonstrate more clearly than
ever that successful economic reform and recovery require genuine
dialogue between the government and society,'' State Department
spokesman Charles Redman said. ``In our view, such dialogue must
allow for the expression of working peoples' concerns and rights.''
   Redman added that ``the use of force ... cannot contribute to
national reconciliation.''
   The Solidarity trade union movement complained of ``exceptional
brutality'' by police in clashes with protesters Sunday in Poland.
   Thousands of Polish workers are striking to back demands for
increased pay to offset price hikes of 42 percent caused by the
government's austerity program. The week-long work stoppages are
described as the worst labor unrest in Poland since the communist
government suspended Solidarity in December 1981.
   Redman said the United States supports the Polish government's
economic reform program and is willing to help in its
implementation. But he added that ``such help is feasible only if
the difficult economic changes needed are supported by a broad
spectrum of Polish society.''
   The reforms that began in 1986 have included a thinning of the
government bureaucracy and encouragement of private enterprise.
   One U.S. official said the Reagan administration was willing to
help Poland _ if agreement is reached between the government and
the unions _ by supporting its loan requests to the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund.
   Poland owes some $40 billion, the largest chunk to West Germany
and a ``significant'' sum to the United States, the official said.
   The United States, which is the largest contributor to both
institutions, would be willing to support loan programs ``if Poland
is serious'' about future reforms, said the official, who spoke
only on condition he not be named.
   The United States improved its ties with Poland after the Polish
government released all political prisoners at the end of 1986.
Cultural and economic ties were restored, and both countries
exchanged ambassadors in March.

<HEAD>Militants Reject Offer To Trade Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Melanesian separatists rejected an
offer Monday by three rightist elected officials to trade places
with nearly two dozen police hostages being held in a cave.
   Dick Ukeiwe, who represents this French Pacific island territory
in the French Senate, announced at a meeting of New Caledonia's new
regional assembly that he and two National Assembly members,
Jacques Lafleur and Maurice Nenou, wished to ``take the place of
the hostages to bring an end to their ordeal.''
   Bernard Pons, minister for overseas territories in Premier
Jacques Chirac's conservative government, praised the offer and
said it could bring movement in the stalemated hostage drama.
   Noumea Mayor Jean Leques ordered all offices, shops, schools and
bars closed at 4 p.m. in support of the idea. Even taxi drivers
stopped work in the capital, a stronghold of pro-French,
anti-independence sentiment.
   But the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front rejected the
offer and repeated its demand for a mediator to negotiate terms for
a referendum on independence for the Pacific island territory.
   ``We want someone who would be representative of the colonial
power, who would have authority to commit the colonial power,''
Hnalaine Uregei, a member of the front's political bureau, told a
news conference.
   He said the proposal from the three officials was ``at the same
time grotesque, ridiculous and indecent'' and said they knew it
would not be taken seriously.
   New Caledonia has become an issue in next Sunday's presidential
election between Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, who urges
dialogue with the separatists, and Chirac, who calls them a small
band of terrorists.
   A recent opinion poll in France found 41 percent in favor of
independence for the territory, 34 percent opposed and 25 percent
giving no opinion. But among those who voted for Chirac in the
first round April 24, only 24 percent back independence and 58
percent want to keep New Caledonia part of France.
   Ukeiwe, Lafleur and Nenou are members of Chirac's rightist
party, the Rally for the Republic, and are prominent opponents of
the separatist movement.
   About 43 percent of New Caledonia's 145,000 people are native
Melanesians, known as Kanaks, and many of them favor independence.
About 36 percent are Europeans, who generally want to remain part
of France. The rest are mostly Asian or Polynesian.
   On April 22, the rebels raided a rural police post on the island
of Ouvea, seized 27 military policemen and killed four others. They
released 12 hostages but took eight more, including the head of an
anti-terrorism squad and an assistant prosecutor.
   The remaining hostages are being held in a cave in a remote part
of Ouvea, which lies off the east coast of New Caledonia's main
island, La Grande Terre.
   The prosecutor and the anti-terrorism squad leader were allowed
to leave the cave hideout and ordered to negotiate on behalf of the
terrorists, but were old the remaining hostages would be killed if
the two did not return. Because of that threat, authorities still
consider them hostages for a total of 23.
   The front, which calls the 23 ``prisoners of war,'' said in a
statement Monday that they were ``in good health and well
cared-for.''

<HEAD>U.S. Jewish Conference Schedules Pre-Summit Vigil in Helsinki</HEAD>

   American Jewish leaders said Monday they will
hold a religious service and a vigil in Helsinki, Finland, before
the Moscow summit as a way of drawing attention to the plight of
Soviet Jews.
   The events, organized by the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, will take place May 27-28 while President Reagan is in
Finland.
   Reagan, who is scheduled to fly to Moscow on May 29 for the
three-day summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, has been
invited to the Friday night service at the Helsinki synagogue.
Organizers said they did not know if he would attend.
   Morris B. Abram, chairman of the national conference, told
reporters the activities in Helsinki are designed to impress upon
Soviet leaders the conference's commitment to seeing Soviet Jews
accorded more freedom.
   He said his group will continue the campaign ``to free Soviet
Jewry so they can emigrate ... and to permit those who wish to
remain to live as Jews without any limitations and without any
discrimination against them.''
   The conference estimates that as many as 400,000 Jews are
seeking to leave the Soviet Union, but have been denied exit
permits. There are more than 2 million Jews in the Soviet Union,
which has about one-fifth of the world's Jewish population.
   Jews have been persecuted for practicing their faith in the
state-controlled society and are often discriminated against.
   Soviet Jews are planning an event in Moscow during the summit,
but conference officials refused to provide details, fearing
organizers might be subjected to harassment by Soviet officials.
   When Gorbachev visited Washington for a summit last December,
supporters of Soviet Jews staged a massive demonstration near the
White House. Vice President George Bush attended that rally.
   Abram and Richard Maass, head of the conference's Moscow task
force, also said they want the Soviet Union to abide by the 1975
Helsinki Final Act that proclaimed that people have a right to
leave a country freely.
   Gorbachev and other Soviet officials have voiced irritation at
the attention the United States focuses on human rights. In recent
speeches Reagan has urged the Soviets to allow more freedom of
speech and religion, and his aides say he will revisit that subject
in a talk Wednesday in Chicago.
   The conference will hold a day-long ``Summit Action Day for
Soviet Jews'' Tuesday in Washington, where Secretary of State
George P. Shultz is to speak.
   Also attending will be Joseph Begun, a mathematician who was
allowed to emigrate in January after spending many years in Soviet
labor camps.
   The American Jews say that under Gorbachev, the treatment of
Soviet Jews has been mixed. On the one hand, there has been some
improvement in cultural life, such as the creation of a Hebrew
study group in one region.
   But the number of Jews allowed to emigrate is still a trickle
compared with the 1970s, and some emigration laws have been
tightened.

   Israel closed a Palestinian weekly today,
charging it was funded by terrorist groups, and a Palestinian
teen-ager was electrocuted while climbing on a utility pole with an
outlawed Palestinian flag.
   This afternoon, NBC News reported Israeli troops mounted a major
offensive into Lebanon, pushing more than five miles into the Bekaa
Valley in pursuit of Palestinian guerrillas. Beirut radio stations
carried no reports of any such troop movement.
   The Interior Ministry shut down the Jerusalem-based Al Awdah, a
weekly published in English and Arabic, determining it was ``a tool
for terror organizations,'' according to ministry spokeswoman Tova
Elinson.
   The closure order was delivered today to magazine editor Ibrahim
Kareen, who also heads the Palestine Press Service.
   The press service was a key source of information on the
occupied territories before it was banned for six months beginning
March 30. It has maintained contacts with foreign journalists.
   Israeli officials have padlocked several Arab news organizations
since unrest erupted in the occupied territories five months ago.
They contend the organizations have helped fuel Arab riots.
   Kareen denied Al Awdah received funding from terror groups. He
said money to run the magazine came from subscribers.
   ``This was a political decision,'' Kareen said. ``Maltreatment
of journalists has become government policy.''
   Kareen said Al Awdah, which was founded six years ago and has a
combined circulation of about 10,000, was the first Palestinian
publication to interview Israelis face-to-face in an effort to
promote dialogue.
   ``Now, the only relationship left is of occupied and occupier,''
Kareen said. ``The occupier will harass, the occupied will resist,
and dreams of having a dialogue ... seem the product of naivete.''
   In a related development, the Supreme Court heard an appeal from
the Israeli editor of a left-wing newspaper who was arrested five
days ago and has been denied a meeting with her lawyer.
   Michal Schwartz was one of three Israeli editors of the pro-Arab
Derech Hanitzotz who were arrested for security offenses over the
past few weeks.
   The newspaper was shut down in February on charges of being
connected to the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
a Syrian-backed Palestinian faction led by Nayef Hawatmeh.
   State prosecutor Malhiel Ballas argued Ms. Schwartz' lawyer was
likely to leak to the public details of the secret investigation if
she saw her client.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Nidal Abdulhak, 16, from the
village of Beit Wazan, died Sunday night in Nablus' Al Ittihad
Hospital, the army said.
   Hospital officials quoted family members as saying he was
electrocuted when he was ordered to remove a Palestinian flag from
a utility pole. The army said he apparently was killed while
hanging a flag.
   In south Lebanon, members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army militia repulsed an attack by Arab guerrillas who shelled a
militia outpost in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone, Israel
radio said.
   The South Lebanon Army returned fire, aiming at guerrilla bases
north of the security zone, the report said. It did not provide
further details.
   Army officials said they were checking the report.
   On Sunday, the army suspended an officer in command of soldiers
who killed an Arab stonethrower, and 13 Palestinians were injured
in scattered clashes with Israeli troops throughout the occupied
territories.
   The protests broke out as Palestinians responded to a call by
underground leaders to hold a ``day of confrontation with Israeli
troops.''
   In the most serious incident, troops shot and killed a
22-year-old Palestinian in the village of Fakua near Jenin, 50
miles north of Jerusalem.
   The officer heading the patrol was suspended from duty until the
army finishes investigating the incident, an army spokesman said.
He refused to elaborate, but Israel radio said the soldiers may not
have been justified in opening fire.
   The shooting brought the Palestinian death toll in the uprising
to 176. An Israeli teen-ager and one soldier have also died.

   Some sour notes came from the Detroit Symphony
Orchestra's conductor over the weekend.
   Gunther Herbig, the orchestra's conductor since 1984, told
musicians during intermission of Saturday night's concert that he
plans to quit, the Detroit News reported Monday. Several musicians
told the newspaper that Herbig cited several complaints, many of
them related to the orchestra's financial troubles. On Sunday, he
declined to discuss his resignation, effective when his contract
expires in 1990.
   ``Herbig told us that virtually the only thing they honored in
the contract was payment, and that even that was sometimes late,''
said Maxim Janowsky, a bassist with the orchestra.
   Orchestra board Chairman Walter J. McCarthy Jr. said the
orchestra's financial troubles caused the board to fail to meet
some terms, but it was the board's ``intention and hope to honor
Maestro Herbig's contract in every detail.''

   Chicken magnate Frank Perdue's three-year
marriage has come to an end.
   Frank Perdue and Kathleen Markey Perdue were divorced last week
in Salisbury, Md., a spokesman for Mrs. Perdue's lawyer said Monday.
   The terms of the divorce were not divulged, but Mrs. Perdue's
lawyer, Marvin Mitchelson, characterized thesplit as ``very
amicable,'' said the spokesman, Sy Presten.
   The marriage on May 4, 1985, had been the first for Mrs. Perdue,
38, a former vice president of Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street
firm.
   Perdue, 67, whose chicken business is headquartered in
Salisbury, had been married once before.

   Muhammad Ali's manager says it was a ``big
misunderstanding'' that caused police to issue a bulletin that the
former heavyweight boxing champion was missing.
   Ali left his hotel room Sunday morning for a walk and a hotel
clerk, fearing he might not be able to take care of himself, phoned
police.
   Soon after, Ali was seen walking peacefully along the street.
   ``I wasn't worried about him,'' said his manager, Avudi Mahdi.
``I didn't even get out of bed when the hotel staff called me. I
told them Ali can take care of himself.''
   In 1984, Ali checked into a New York hospital complaining of
symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease.
   He was in the city for a fund-raising dinner for Rep. Joe
Kennedy of Massachusetts.

establishment of a Women's Peace Institute to promote disarmament.
   She made the call Monday came after chairing a three-day
conference aboard a Greek cruise ship for members of Women for a

   ``The world's true enemies are hunger, disease, racism, poverty,
inequality violence and not other nations and other peoples,'' Mrs.

research on issues of world peace.''
   Mrs. Papandreou said the institute should be financed by a

   The practice of pediatrics today should
include pressing for better day care and schools, Dr. Benjamin
Spock said Monday as he celebrated his 85th birthday at Creighton
University's Center for Healthy Aging.
   ``The first job for pediatricians today should be to go around
stirring things up ... to make a better life for all our
children,'' Spock said.
   Medicine has eradicated many of the childhood diseases, but has
done ``almost nothing on issues really crucial to the child,'' he
said.
   Spock called the weakening of the extended family ``a great
mistake.''
   ``Many people consider it a curse if they have an older person
living with them,'' he said. ``It's a great help to live in an
extended family'' with a built-in babysitter or consultant on baby
matters.
   ``Young people do owe it to their parents ... to provide for
them,'' he said. ``We're very neglectful of the old.''

   Members of a congressional committee scolded
the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday
for failing to require that companies establish tougher auditing
procedures.
   Such a recommendation was among several made last October by a
private task force headed by former SEC Commissioner James Treadway.
   The Treadway Commission proposed that the SEC require publicly
traded companies to have independent audit committees, composed of
people from outside the corporation, to double-check financial
statements. The New York Stock Exchange already requires companies
it lists to have such committees.
   The SEC, however, has decided to only urge the nation's
financial markets and other industry groups that oversee securities
trading to ``consider upgrading and expanding the scope of their
standards with respect to audit committees,'' SEC Chairman David S.
Ruder told the House Energy and Commerce oversight and
investigations subcommittee.
   Subcommittee Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich., noted that the
Treadway Commission had concluded that fraudulent financial
reporting was a major problem and should be addressed by the
government.
   ``Somebody's got to do something to see to it that we have
confidence in our system ...,'' Dingell told Ruder. ``One of the
reasons the (Securities and Exchange) Commission is drawing pay is
to do that.''
   Another subcommittee member, Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he was
``amazed'' that the SEC ``plans to pass the buck to others.''
   Ruder said SEC officials were wary of imposing the requirement
because of a fear that it would be too costly for small businesses.
   However, he added there had been ``strong disagreement'' among
the SEC's commissioners over implementing the proposal. He said he
himself favored the idea and believed that a mechanism could be
worked out to reduce the burden on small companies.

   Manslaughter charges have been filed
against the driver of a car that smashed into a U.S. Navy van at
the Navy base here, killing five sailors and their driver and
injuringfour people, officials say.
   The car was speeding on the base's main road when the fiery
wreck occurred Saturday night, base spokesman Lt. Bob Hines said
Sunday. All those killed were in the van, which was more heavily
damaged by fire than by the car, Hines said.
   Lt. Russ Greer, a spokesman at Atlantic Fleet headquarters in
Norfolk, Va., identified the five sailors killed as Seaman Recruit
Michael W. Bauman of Clovis, N.M.; Storekeeper-Seaman Brent D.
Jervey of Gainesville, Fla.; Boatswain's Mate 1st Class John F.
Piper of Monongahela, Pa.; Seaman Jeffrey M. Rais, of Cincinnati;
and Petty Officer 1st Class Frederick W. Vilmar of Saginaw, Mich.
   Greer said three injured sailors were evacuated in serious
condition to the Brooke Army Burn Center in San Antonio, Texas.
   He identified them as Aircraft Storekeeper Recruit Demetric L.
Cofield of Harrisburg, Pa.; Ship's Serviceman Prentice D. Johnson
of Indianapolis; and Fireman Darren Stevenson of Chester, Pa.
   Greer said the ages of the victims were not immediately
available, nor were the names of the driver of the car or of the
civilian Navy employee who was driving the van.
   The private car's driver, who is not a U.S. citizen, was charged
with six counts of manslaughter and was under guard at the base
hospital in Guantanamo, where he was listed in stable condition,
according to Lt. Cmdr. Aaron Long, another Atlantic Fleet spokesman
in Norfolk.
   A base security vehicle observed the car speeding about 1{ miles
before it crashed into the taxi van, which was operated by the
base's retail exchange, Long said. The security vehicle followed
the car but could go no faster than 40 mph, he said.
   ``The vehicle outran the naval station vehicle,'' but the
accident was not a result of ``hot pursuit,'' he said. ``The
security vehicle did not see the accident occur.''
   Long said the speed limit on the base is 25 mph.
   About 7,000 people, including military personnel and civilian
workers, live on the base at the southeastern tip of communist
Cuba. The facility, which is enclosed and surrounded by a
minefield, serves as the main training site for the Atlantic Fleet.

<HEAD>Children Trapped After Hospital Collapses and Kills 14</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new wing of a children's hospital
collapsed Monday in Kashmir, and at least 14 people died in a crush
of bricks and concrete. Dozens of children, their moans growing
fainter, were feared trapped.
   ``There are fewer and fewer signs of life,'' one official said.
Rescuers were pumping oxygen and drinking water through the debris
in hopes of sustaining any survivors.
   The three-story building disintegrated shortly after sunrise in
Jammu, winter capital of the northern state of Kashmir.
   The wing, completed in 1985, had been lined with cracks. An
older wing remained standing.
   More than 16 hours after the building came tumbling down, Indian
army rescue teams were trying to remove the debris by hand and with
cranes, but hopes were fading. Some rescuers pulled severed limbs
from the wreckage.
   ``I heard children moaning in the morning, but in late evening
there was nothing, a kind of strange silence amid the noise of
rescue work,'' said Kashmir Times reporter Arun Joshi. ``They may
be dying.''
   By evening, 14 bodies and 29 survivors had been found. Some news
reports placed the death toll as high as 30.
   ``But the worst is yet to come. At least 50 children and their
parents or attendants are trapped on the first floor,'' Joshi said
in a telephone call to New Delhi. ``It is a terrible sight up
here.''
   Joshi said a total of at least 75 children and their parents or
attendants were caught in the hospital.
   A police spokesman in Jammu, 340 miles north of New Delhi, said
the collapse was caused by a weak foundation in the new wing of the
hospital.
   ``The entire new wing has come down. Much of it has just gone
inside the earth,'' spokesman Satish Gupta said.
   The government ordered an investigation, and three civil
engineers who were responsible for construction were suspended.
   Gupta said it will take at least 24 hours to remove the debris.
   ``Until then it is all guesswork, but we fear the toll will go
up,'' he said.
   The new wing, which housed three wards, collapsed at 6:30 a.m.
Joshi said the wing contained 51 beds, but some were shared by two
children.
   ``I saw limbs of children being recovered from the debris. The
death toll is likely to go up unless by providence the children are
saved,'' said Joshi.
   Joshi said there had been cracks in the ground floor walls. He
said a doctor told him the cracks widened Sunday and that he
evacuated 35 children.
   Jammu, with a population of 500,000, is the second largest city
in Kashmir, which borders Pakistan and China.
   Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, the highest government official
in Kashmir state, rushed back to Jammu from Srinagar, where he was
attending a ceremony marking the seasonal shifting of the state
capital.

<HEAD>High Court Ruling Seen as Blow To Discount Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP)_ The Supreme Court, in an antitrust ruling that
could make bargain-hunting more difficult, said Monday that
manufacturers do not always act illegally when they agree with
retailers to stop supplying discount stores.
   By a 6-2 vote, the court said such action by a manufacturer
becomes illegal only when ``it includes some agreement on price or
price levels.''
   The ruling makes it easier for manufacturers to avoid antitrust
liability when, acting on requests from competing retailers, they
stop doing business with stores that cut prices.
   ``At the margin, this can make life harder for discounters,''
said Diane P. Wood, an antitrust professor at the University of
Chicago Law School.
   Noting that bills pending in Congress would outlaw such tactics
by manufacturers, she said, ``The legislation reflects a fear that
discounters could go out of business or find it harder to get
merchandise without such protection.''
   In other action Monday, the court:
   _Ordered further hearings to determine whether a New Jersey man
accused of helping Nazis kill more than 2,000 Jews in Lithuania
should be stripped of his U.S. citizenship.
   _Ruled that a procedural miscue by federal lawyers must result
in dismissing the government's contempt-of-court prosecution
against a Rhode Island newspaper that published FBI information
about a Mafia boss.
   _Agreed to consider a case from Washington state that makes it
easier for the federal government to turn over U.S. tax information
to a foreign government.
   _Refused to let Connecticut police subject all people who attend
Ku Klux Klan rallies to pat-down searches for weapons. The justices
let stand rulings that such searches violated individuals' privacy
rights.
   The court's antitrust decision is a victory for Sharp
Electronics Corp. and a setback for a former Houston retailer of
Sharp calculators.
   Business Electronics Corp., owned and operated by Kelton
Ehrensberger, was the exclusive retailer of Sharp calculators in
Houston from 1968 to 1972. During that period, Sharp became
dissatisfied with BEC's performance. Sharp contended it was unhappy
with BEC's failure to meet sales quotas.
   But a federal jury found that Sharp was dissatisfied with BEC's
policy of selling calculators at prices lower than those suggested
by Sharp.
   Sharp in 1972 appointed Hartwell's Office World as a second
retailer of its calculators in Houston, and in 1973 terminated
BEC's dealership. Hartwell had told Sharp it would quit
distributing its products unless Sharp ended its relationship with
BEC.
   BEC then sued Sharp, and a federal jury awarded BEC $600,000 in
damages. Under federal antitrust law, that amount was tripled to
$1.8 million.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, threw out the
jury verdict and sent the case back for a new trial. Monday's
decision upheld the appeals court ruling.
   Writing for the high court, Justice Antonin Scalia said the
trial judge erred in telling the jury it could rule against Sharp
if it found that BEC was terminated to reduce price competition in
the Houston retail market.
   ``There has been no showing here that an agreement between a
manufacturer and a dealer to terminate a `price cutter,' without a
further agreement on the price or price levels to be charged by the
remaining dealer, almost always tends to restrict competition and
reduce output,'' Scalia said.
   ``A vertical restraint (one imposed by a manufacturer on a
retailer) is not illegal per se unless it includes some agreement
on price or price levels,'' he said.
   If the Sharp-Hartwell agreement had included a price level at
which Sharp's calculators had to be sold, however, the agreement
could have been ruled illegal automatically.
   Nothing in Monday's ruling bars a manufacturer acting by itself
from continuing to tell retailers that its products must be sold at
certain prices. The legislation pending in Congress would outlaw
even those pricing tactics.
   Scalia was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun
and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Byron R. White dissented in a
23-page opinion authored by Stevens, and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
did not participate in the case.

<HEAD>Not Enough AID Money Going to Third World Women, Studies Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agency for International Development
doesn't pay enough attention to women in the Third World, despite
their roles in farming and other areas of commerce, two studies say.
   Reacting to the independent studies, members of Congress have
introduced a bill they say would redress the situation by requiring
the AID office that oversees women in developing nations to spend
$10 million annually. Last year the office spent about $2 million.
   The bill _ introduced by Democratic Reps. Mickey Leland of Texas
and Pat Schroeder of Colorado in one chamber and Sen. Barbara
Mikulski of Maryland in the other _ also would order AID to place
women in 50 percent of positions in training programs abroad.
   ``Much has been said and written about incorporating women in
development efforts, but far too little has been done,'' Schroeder
and Leland said in a joint letter to colleagues.
   The bill, which has 89 co-sponsors in the House, is being
promoted by Bread for the World, a Christian group that lobbies
against hunger and poverty.
   That group plans a letter-writing campaign to encourage AID to
increase benefits given to women in developing countries, said
president Art Simon, the brother of Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   AID opposes the bill, even though Alan Woods, the agency's new
director, is ``committed to AID's efforts to integrate women into
developing economies,'' spokesman Jerry Lipson said.
   Although the agency believes more needs to be done for women in
developing countries, the legislation would create an additional
layer of bureaucracy and cut down on AID's flexibility, he said.
   Agency officials think the legislation is like ``using an
elephant to deal with a fly,'' he said.
   Moreover, he said that while Americans recognize the importance
of women in the Third World, AID officials sometimes run into
roadblocks in developing countries where women frequently have
inferior status.
   What prompted congressional interest were two independent
studies _ commissioned by AID and completed in 1987 _ that said AID
programs often are inattentive to women.
   ``AID's women in development policy is not being implemented
fully or vigorously, and there is little enthusiasm and few
incentives for doing so,'' Development Associates Inc., a
consulting group, wrote in a December report.
   Unless there is agency-wide acceptance of the policy of
incorporating women, it will be ``marginally useful at best,'' the
study said.
   While lip-service is given to the importance of women's roles in
development, the policy is not a ``serious concern'' for many AID
managers, the study said.
   Numerous studies have demonstrated the vital role women play in
a developing nation's economy.
   In Africa, for instace, it is estimated that women are
responsible for growing more than 80 percent of the food consumed
in the home.
   Case studies in Botswana, Kenya and the Caribbean, for example,
show that when there is widespread male migration, women's earnings
are the mainstay for subsistence expenditures.
   Women also play a large role in informal commerce, serving as
traders and merchants in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. In a
community in Bolivia, women's earning from handicrafts tided
families over during a drought.
   The failure to take women into account can undermine some
development projects, according to a report written by Alice
Carloni for AID in April 1987.
   The Botswana Agricultural College Expansion project was rated
highly successful in developing an agricultural training
institution.
   But the project may not ultimately improve the lives of farm
families if the extension service continues to bypass female
farmers who play a major role in agriculture, the study said.
   In another project in Nepal, architects focused too narrowly on
the domestic role women play, the study said. The women were taught
to use a different type of stove designed to reduce deforestation,
but were not educated on broader conservation topics.

   President Reagan told Finnish Prime Minister
Harri Holkeri on Monday that ``progress had been made'' in
U.S.-Soviet relations and expressed his appreciation for Finland's
support in light of the upcoming Moscow summit, a White House
spokesman said.
   The two men met for 30 minutes in the Oval Office and the prime
minister presented Reagan with a medal commemorating the 350th
anniversary of the first Finnish settlement in America, in what is
now Wilmington, Del., presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
in a statement.
   They also discussed the summit and Reagan's visit to Helsinki

   ``The president said that progress had been made in U.S.
relations with the U.S.S.R. and expressed appreciation for
Finland's support for that policy,'' Fitzwater said.
   Holker is visiting the United States to open a Finnish exhibit

<TEXT>
   After a 30-year rift, entertainers Dean Martin
and Jerry Lewis will appear on the same stage later this month for
a benefit performance, a newspaper reported.
   Martin, who recently recovered from a kidney operation, and
Lewis will perform at the sold-out May 14 Friars Club event for
Barbara Sinatra's charities, The Daily News reported Sunday.
   However, Susan Reynolds, publicist for the Sinatras, said ``it's
unequivocally untrue. They (Martin and Lewis) weren't asked to
perform and they won't be.''
   Martin and Lewis, she said, were asked individually to attend,
and it was uncertain whether both would show up.
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca will be the master of
ceremonies of the benefit at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Speakers
will include Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., two other members
of the ``Rat Pack.'' Also scheduled to appear are Lucille Ball,
Angie Dickinson, Sophia Loren, Dinah Shore, Don Rickels, Dionne
Warwick and Gregory Peck.
   Last week, Martin praised Lewis' work with the Muscular
Dystrophy Association after returning to the stage following
recuperation. The kidney problem forced Martin to drop out of a
recent cross-country Rat Pack reunion tour with Davis and Sinatra.
   Calls by The Associated Press to Martin's agent Mort Viner and
publicist Warren Cowan went unanswered Sunday. The AP also left a
message Sunday at Lewis' offices in Las Vegas, Nev.

   President Roh Tae-woo replaced the
head of the governing party with a moderate Monday and was expected
to reshuffle his Cabinet after the opposition took control of the
National Assembly.
   In a speech Monday, Roh adopted a conciliatory attitude to the
opposition, which won parliamentary elections April 26.
   Government officials said Roh would reshuffle his Cabinet and
replace rightists with moderates.
   ``Hardliners and those with military background are not
considered for nomination,'' said one source, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Police, meanwhile, stopped opposition activists from circulating
a petition calling for an investigation of former President Chun
Doo-hwan.
   Roh nominated moderate Yun Gil-jung, 71, to head the Democratic
Justice Party and replce Chae Moon-shik. Other senior party
officials appointed later in the day were all moderates.
   Opposition candidates made a surprisingly strong showing in the
National Assembly elections, depriving the Roh's party of its
majority for the first time in South Korea's 40-year history.
   ``We lost the elections but we have not lost our fair and just
attitude. We have no regrets about holding fair elections,'' Roh
told a meeting of party officials.
   Roh said the opposition-dominated National Assembly would pose a
serious problem but his party should tackle it under the principle
of ``dialogue and compromise.''
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, whose Party for Peace and
Democracy emerged as the largest opposition party, on Monday called
for a parliamentary investigation into past wrongdoings under
ex-President Chun.
   Kim, 62, demanded that the National Assembly probe alleged
corruption involving Chun and and his family and a 1980
anti-government uprising in the southern city of Kwangju, during
which nearly 200 people were killed.
   But Kim said the investigation could be delayed if it would
affect a successful staging of the Olympic Games in Seoul in
September.
   Chun, whose term ended Feb. 24, has come under fire for alleged
involvement in large-scale financial scandals. His younger brother,
Chun Kyung-hwan, was arrested in March on charges of embezzling
official funds.
   Opposition politicians are pushing a petition drive to collect 1
million signatures to demand the former president be subpoenaed for
investigation. About 300,000 signatures have been collected, they
said.
   But police Monday banned collection of signatures in the streets
for the petition. No official reason was given for the action.
   Kim said he would support a probe of Chun's alleged financial
wrongdoings but opposed putting him on trial because he was a
president.
   Aides said Kim would once again be appointed to lead his party
at a convention scheduled for Saturday. He resigned the party
presidency two months ago to help unite the divided opposition.
   Kim Dae-jung emerged from the elections in a far stronger
postion than rival opposition leader Kim Young-sam. Both Kims ran
for president against Roh and split the opposition ticket, allowing
Roh to win.

   Orders to U.S. factories registered a
surprising 1.6 percent upward surge in March as strong export
demand and heavy defense orders reversed weakness in the previous
two months, the government reported Monday.
   The Commerce Department said that orders for durable and
non-durable goods climbed to $216.08 billion, an increase of $3.43
billion from the February level.
   The 1.6 percent advance was the first increase this year after
orders had shown no improvement in February and actually fell 0.6
percent in January following a 2 percent December gain.
   Analysts had expected a much smaller March advance of around 0.3
percent. They said the report showed demand was rebounding
following a brief period when businesses cut back to work down a
high backlog of unsold goods.
   At the beginning of the year, economists had been so worried
about the big rise in inventories that they were forecasting order
cutbacks and job layoffs could topple the country into a recession.
   But the orders report on Monday, following strong employment
gains and big rises in consumer spending, showed that the economy
regained its footing in the early part of this year.
   ``It is clear that we have a stronger economy than people had
been expecting. The crash had much less effect than people had
feared,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc.
   The government reported last week that the overall economy, as
measured by the gross national product, rose at a healthy 2.3
percent annual rate from January through March, far better than the
recession many had predicted.
   Wyss said DRI had boosted its economic forecast for the entire
year to show growth of 2.8 percent, very close to the
administration's prediction of 2.9 percent GNP growth this year.
   Charles Renfro, chief economist of Alphametrics Corp., a
forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said manufacturing orders
should continue growing as stronger growth in Europe and the weaker
dollar boosts export demand even more. The administration is
counting on rising export demand to account for nearly half of all
GNP growth this year.
   ``We are still a very important high-technology economy,
producing goods that the world needs, and the strength in orders
reflects that,'' Renfro said.
   The March increase was particularly surprising in view of the
fact that only 10 days ago the government had reported that orders
for durable goods, items expected to last more than three years,
were unchanged in March. In Monday's report, that was revised to
show a healthy 1 percent gain in durable goods, reflecting
new-found strength in machinery, steel and transportation.
   Orders for non-durable goods climbed at an even faster pace,
rising by 2.3 percent to $100.6 billion.
   The overall increase of 1.6 percent reflected a big 17.4 percent
jump in demand for military equipment, following a 6 percent drop
in this volatile category in February.
   Without the rise in military orders, total orders would have
climbed a smaller 1 percent, still the sixth gain in non-defense
orders in the past seven months.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods fell 3.8 percent
to $32.5 billion, but analysts discounted the setback and said they
were still looking for strength as businesses boost spending to
expand production facilities to meet rising demand.
   Orders for transportation equipment climbed 3.4 percent while
orders for primary metals such as steel were up an even larger 6.1
percent in March.
   Shipments of manufactured goods increased 2.6 percent to a
record high of $214.4 billion following a 0.8 percent February
increase.

   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis edged rival Jesse Jackson in Minnesota's seven
congressional district conventions with the Massachusetts governor
collecting a larger share of national delegates.
   Dukakis captured 19 delegates at the weekend conventions,
Jackson picked up 14 and eight were uncommitted. Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon, who has suspended his presidential campaign, won two
delegates to the Democratic National Convention, scheduled July
18-21 in Atlanta.
   Eight delegates at stake in the eighth congressional district
will be chosen next weekend, and the remaining 27 delegates will be
picked at the state convention on June 12.
   Minnesota also has nine ``super delegates,'' including former
Vice President Walter Mondale.
   Both Dukakis and Jackson fared better than their vote totals in
the presidential preference poll taken Feb. 23 at the precinct
caucuses, where Dukakis got 33.5 percent and Jackson had 19.9
percent. The two candidates also improved on their strategists'
expectations.
   ``The major thing we're seeing in congressional district after
congressional district, is undecideds largely coming to Dukakis,''
said a jubilant Gary Cerkvenik, state coordinator for Dukakis.
Cerkvenik had predicted that Dukakis would win 13 to 15 delegates.
   ``We're broadening our base; it's a long election process,''
said Scott Adams, a spokesman for the Jackson campaign which
expected its candidate to capture 12 or 13 delegates.
   All told in Minnesota, Dukakis has 32 delegates, Jackson 24 and
Simon two. Twenty delegates remain uncommitted, according to The
Associated Press count.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush, who has a
mathematical lock on the nomination, added one delegate to his
total of four and former television evangelist Pat Robertson picked
up two delegates. Five of the 12 delegates picked at this stage of
the GOP process remain uncommitted.
   Minnesota Republicans choose another 12 delegates this weekend
at four congressional district conventions. The final seven members
of the state's 31 delegates will be selected at the state
convention June 16-18.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Strikes Back At Critics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary William Bennett struck
back Monday at critics who charge he is too negative about the
nation's educational system, saying it has not made sufficient
progress in the last five years.
   Bennett said he gave ``a fair amount of praise'' to improvements
in a report issued last week on the fifth anniversary of ``A Nation
at Risk,'' the devastating analysis issued by his predecessor,
Terrel Bell.
   ``We can show some progress since 1983,'' Bennett said in a
speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Despite that progress, I
cannot come candidly before the American people and say that
everything's great.''
   Bennett said the five-year update, ``American Education: Making
it Work,'' had provoked a firestorm of criticism although ``no one
has challenged any facts in it.''
   In the report, released last week, Bennett said progress has
been too slow and ``we are still at risk.''
   He told the Chamber of Commerce that the ``educational
establishment'' gave him grades of C's and D's on the report, but
``I don't give a tinker's damn what they give me as long as they
get to work improving American education.''
   Bennett said fewer than 2 percent of American students can write
a clear, detailed, coherent narrative and only 3 percent of high
school seniors scored above 600 on their verbal SATs last year.
   He said middle-class kids usually can survive the decline of an
education system but lower-class children end up losing their only
chance for a better life.
   ``So if I seem a bit edgy at times about improving our education
system, there's a good reason,'' he said.
   Bennett told the audience they should go to see the film ``Stand
and Deliver'' for an example of how American education can be made
to succeed without huge infusions of cash.
   The movie, based on the true story of Jaime Escalante, is about
an East Los Angeles calculus teacher who tames a class of inner
city Hispanic teen-agers through force of personality. The kids end
up learning calculus and going to college.
   Bennett, often at odds with teachers' groups, said Escalante had
never been nominated by anyone for a teacher-of-the-year award.
``Why?'' he asked. ``Because he's an embarrassment. He proves you
can do it.''

   Construction spending surged 1.5 percent in
March, the biggest increase in almost a year, as government
spending offset weakness in other areas, the Commerce Department
said Monday.
   The department said construction projects were being built at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $401.8 billion in March,
following a 0.4 percent increase in February.
   The March advance, which was the biggest since a 2 percent rise
in April 1987, was a bit puzzling to economists, who have been
forecasting generally sluggish activity in the building industry
this year.
   ``Construction is doing considerably better than anyone was
expecting. It is simply remarkable,'' said Michael Sumichrast, an
economist and publisher of a construction industry newsletter.
   The strength last month came in large part from a 5.4 percent
boom in government construction projects, which analysts said
reflected increased outlays for highway construction that Congress
approved last year over President Reagan's veto.
   In March, the increase of 7 percent pushed highway spending, the
largest category in the government sector, to an annual rate of
$27.6 billion, 16.9 percent higher than a year ago.
   Residential construction rose a modest 0.8 percent in March to
an annual rate of $191.4 billion, as a 2 percent increase in
single-family construction was largely offset by a 3.6 percent
decline in multi-family construction.
   Non-residential construction edged up 0.3 percent to an annual
rate of $92.3 billion, with industrial, office building and hotel
construction all recording gains.
   Industrial construction posted a strong 7.7 percent increase,
reflecting expansion projects by businesses experiencing high
operating rates.
   The February and March increases in total construction followed
declines of 2.3 percent in January and 0.02 percent in December.
   ``After a period of weakness, construction is coming back,
largely because of the strength in the government sector,'' said
David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass.
   Wyss said the rise in spending confirmed reports by the Labor
Department that showed jobs have increased by 200,000 over the past
two months in the construction industry.
   Analysts said they were still not looking for much strength in
private construction this year because of the high vacancy rates
for apartments and office buildings and the continued adverse
effects of the 1986 tax overhaul legislation on these types of
investments.

   Vice President George Bush accused Michael
Dukakis Monday of unfounded criticism of Reagan administration
actions in Panama, asserting that U.S. efforts could be set back by
``some kind of macho statement out of Harvard.''
   Earlier, in Mishawaka, Ind., Bush called congressional Democrats
short-sighted for cutting President Reagan's military requests and
said the nation could be hurt if an inexperienced Democrat is
elected president.
   ``Inexperience in foreign policy could hurt not only our
national security, but also our economic health,'' said Bush, who
has previously criticized Democratic Dukakis' lack of foreign
policy experience.
   Bush, who has already won enough delegates to sew up the
Republican presidential nomination, campaigned Monday in Indiana
and Ohio one day before the two states have their primaries.
   In Vandalia, fielding questions from Butler High School
students, Bush was asked whether it was true, as Dukakis has
charged, that the United States had paid Panama's strongman Manuel
Noriega $200,000 a year.
   ``I can't wait for Mr. Dukakis to discuss the Noriega matter,''
Bush replied. ``And I'd say, `What would you do about it?' It's
fine sitting out there. You see, you can make a lot of unfounded
criticism. But what's his suggestion? What's he going to do, and do
it in a way that handles the delicate Central American
relationships that we're building?''
   ``We're moving towards democracy. Ninety percent are now living
under democracy in this hemisphere. We don't want to set that back
by some kind of macho statement out of Harvard,'' Bush said.
Dukakis, after being turned out of office in 1978, lectured at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   Bush said of the Massachusetts governor: ``One of the beautiful
things about being a new candidate without a heck of a lot of
experience in foreign affairs is you can make dramatic statements
without necessarily having the proof.''
   He said he was ``somewhat inhibited'' from discussing the
situation in Panama because he was once CIA director. But he did
say, ``When it became demonstrably clear that Noriega was involved
in drugs, we moved against him, with an indictment.''
   Bush said the United States does not want to hurt the Panamanian
people or take steps that appear as a ``great bullying,
gringoes-of-the-North kind of overstatement of power. ... We're
still living down some of the military intervention of the United
States in Central America.''
   In Indiana, he said, ``The country wants to move ahead, not go
back to the misery we inherited through the very policies (Jesse)
Jackson and Dukakis are talking about.''
   Bush appeared at an airport rally in South Bend, then visited an
AM-General factory in nearby Mishawaka and took a short ride in a
Hummer, a fast-moving successor to the military Jeep. He told 500
workers he would try to keep their production line open.
   AM-General has made 48,000 of the vehicles since 1983 and has
contracts for nearly 20,000 more. However, the Army has shelved
plans to buy more Hummers for 1990 and beyond because of budget
constraints.
   Bush said the United States, despite progress in nuclear arms
talks with the Soviets, stll faces ``a substantial imbalance'' in
conventional forces around the world. He said the Soviets have
``twice as many tanks and artillery pieces as the Western alliance.
   ``As we seek to reduce our reliance on nuclear weapons, it's
critical that we maintain, strengthen and modernize our
conventional deterrent in Europe,'' he said. ``The Hummer is an
integral part of that.''
   ``We took a $31 billion cut in defense because of the opposition
in the Congress, a lot of it affecting what happens on this very
production line in the future. ... I think it's shortsighted to
fool around with the defense muscle of the United States of
America,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Plant-Closings Provision of Trade Bill a Sure Loser</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan vowed anew Monday to veto a
major revision of trade laws and said a controversial provision
requiring advance notification of plant closings was ``like playing
Russian roulette with a machine gun.''
   Reagan's veto promise, in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce's annual meeting, drew loud applause from the audience of
about 2,000 people. They also cheered his statement that capital
gains taxes should be cut sometime in the future.
   The trade bill, expected to reach the White House this week, won
final congressional approval in the Senate last Thursday on a 63-36
vote, three votes short of the margin needed to overturn a veto.
   One provision would require all but the smallest businesses to
provide a 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
The bill specifies exceptions for companies in serious financial
trouble.
   ``The plant-closing restriction is the bill's worst provision,
not the only bad one,'' Reagan said. He did not cite any other
features he considered objectionable, although the administration
has complained about the bill's curbs on Alaska oil exports.
   He said some supporters of the notification provision say it
will not hurt, noting that many European countries have similar
restrictions.
   ``Yep, and that's among the reasons for Europe's poor job
performance over the last six years,'' Reagan said.
   ``If we had done as poorly, our unemployment rate would be up
like theirs, not down from 10.8 percent to 5.5 percent,'' Reagan
said. ``What would organized labor say then?''
   ``Anyone who would copy Europe in this way is no friend to
American workers,'' he added. ``For America, plant-closing
restrictions are like playing Russian roulette with a machine gun _
a sure loser.''

   Palestinian factions fought with mortars
and machine guns in Beirut's refugee camps Monday, and Shiite
Moslem clans battled each other in neighboring slums. Police said
19 people were killed and 68 wounded.
   Lebanon's Christian community was shaken by the discovery of the
bullet-riddled body of a prominent Maronite Catholic priest five
days after he was kidnapped from his home in Jounieh, a Christian
port city.
   Fighting in the Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camps
pitted guerrillas of Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat's mainstream Fatah against Syrian-backed dissidents, police
reported.
   It was the first such battle since Arafat and President Hafez
Assad of Syria took steps toward reconciliation last week in
Damascus.
   Police said they had no information on what caused the clash,
which began Sunday night and continued Monday. Both sides used
mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns.
   Intense fighting kept reporters and photographers out of the
area.
   PLO spokesmen said Arafat's supporters overran three of the four
main positions in Chatilla held by fighters of Col. Saeed Mousa's
Fatah-Uprising faction.
   At least eight combatants were killed and 43 others wounded in
the two camps on Beirut's southern flank, the police report said.
   A 50-man committee including members of several guerrilla
factions and Lebanese Moslem groups was organized late Monday to
try for a cease-fire, the police report said.
   Eleven people were killed and 25 wounded in night-long fighting
between two Shiite clans in the Raml el-Aali and Roweisse slums,
police reported.
   They said fighters of the Atat and Awad clans were battling for
dominance in the two districts along the airport highway near Bourj
el-Barajneh.
   Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Amal militia, the main Shiite
force, moved in after midnight to enforce a cease-fire.
   An Amal statement ordered both clans to put down their arms and
leave the streets, declaring that violators would be shot on sight,
but sporadic sniping persisted Monday.
   The 7,500 soldiers Syria deployed in Moslem west Beirut more
than a year ago to stop factional fighting have not gone into the
Shiite slums. Syria keeps about 25,000 soldiers in northern and
eastern Lebanon and is the main power broker after 13 years of
civil war.
   Maronite bishops held a special meeting Monday and declared the
slaying of Monsignor Albert Khreish a ``monstrous crime.''
   A hunter found his body, which had at least 30 bullet wounds, in
a pine forest Sunday near Ghazir, a mountain resort in the
Christian hearland north of Beirut, police said.
   Khreish, 53, head of the sect's religious affairs court and
nephew of former Patriarch Antonios Butros Khreish, was kidnapped
April 26.
   His body was clad in pajamas and his face bore marks of physical
torture, police said.
   ``The culprits deserve the excommunication punishment,'' said
the statement issued after the bishops met at Bkirki, the home of
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir about 12 miles north of Beirut.
   Their reference to excommunication suggests the bishops believe
Christians killed Khreish in a factional dispute. Police said they
had no information about a possible motive.
   Jounieh and Ghazir are controlled by the Lebanese Forces, the
main Christian militia.
   No mention of the militia was made in the bishops's statement.
It urged Lebanon's president and army commander, both Maronites, to
``exert utmost efforts to find the murderers and bring them to
justice.''
   The bishops expressed ``profound concern over worsening security
conditions'' and said Khreish's murder was ``aimed at discrediting
the church and its role in Lebanon.''
   Funeral services were scheduled for Tuesday in Bkirki and burial
will be at Ein Ibil, the priest's hometown in the ``security zone''
Israel maintains just north of its burder with Lebanon.

   Tank-led Israeli troops on Monday punched
into southeast Lebanon in ``hot pursuit'' of Palestinian
guerrillas, police reported.
   They said initial reports from the area in the western sector of
Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley indicated at least three
guerrillas were taken prisoner in the late-evening thrust.
   ``We have no information yet about the size of the attacking
force or the distance it covered in the penetration,'' said a
spokesman at Lebanon's police headquarters in Beirut. He cannot be
identified under standing regulations.
   The spokesman said he could not comment on a report by the NBC
television network that about 2,000 Israeli troops had crossed into
Lebanon in search of Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas
and their strongholds.
   He said the attacking force was supported by militiamen of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian
contingent in control of Israel's self-designated security zone in
south Lebanon.
   The soldiers moving into the Arkoub region in the foothills of
Mount Hermon were also backed by helicopter gunships, police said.
   Squadrons of Israeli air force jet fighters soared over south
Lebanon's two major cities of Sidon and Tyre, dropping flares and
staging mock divebombing runs on Palestinian refugee camps, the
spokesman added.
   The drone of warplane engines also was clearly heard over
Beirut, the Lebanese capital. But there have been no reports of
bombing sorties.
   The reported Israeli thrust came after a series of cross-border
guerrilla attacks into northern Israel from southeast Lebanon.
   Israeli officials said they were checking the reports its troops
moved into Lebanon.

   Police said Monday they destroyed a huge
cocaine refining complex, confiscated 5,830 pounds of cocaine and
arrested 30 people during a search for an alleged drug trafficker
wanted in the United States.
   Authorities said they also found one thousand containers of
chemicals used in cocaine processing, an electric power plant
powerful enough to supply 3,000 homes and an airfield under
construction.
   The drugs and chemicals were destroyed on the spot.
   The finds were made during a search for Pablo Escovar Gaviria,
the alleged head of the Medellin Cartel, the biggest ring of
Colombian drug traffickers. U.S. officials have said the ring is
responsible for moving about 80 percent of the cocaine used
annually in the United States.
   Police estimated the value of the drugs and other equipment
seized at the laboratories at about $14 million.
   The laboratories were in Doradal, about 120 miles north of
Bogota.
   Those arrested said they had been unemployed and had to work at
the drug factory to support their families. Another 30 reportedly
fled during the raid.
   Police said the clandestine drug factory was uncovered at the
Jamaica ranch, which used stockraising as a cover for its
operations.
   Police said they were unable to establish ownership immediately,
but the factory appeared to be part of extensive landholdings of
Medellin Cartel members in the area.
   Police and army troops have been combing the area for three days
in search of Escobar Gaviria. He and three other men are wanted for
extradition to the United States on drug-smuggling charges.

   Scientists have found specialized nerve sites
where a natural pain-causing substance attaches itself, adding
evidence that the substance plays a key role in the body's
perception of pain.
   Molecules of the substance, bradykinin, bound to the nerve sites
in experiments with dog and guinea pig nerve tissue, scientists
said in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
   Bradykinin is released from bodily tissues when they are
injured. Researchers reported last year that drugs designed to
block the binding of bradykinin to nerve sites could relieve pain
in rats.
   Scientists in the new study included Solomon Snyder and Donald
Manning of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore,
Larry Steranka of Nova Pharmaceutical Corp., and Raymond Vavrek and
John Stewart of the University of Colorado.
   Researchers incubated slices of animal spinal cord and other
nerve tissues with bradykinin that had been labeled with a
radioactive isotope for easy tracking. Tests showed the bradykinin
bound to particular sites, called receptors, on sensory nerves that
carry pain messages.

<HEAD>Concern Over British Sericemen's License Plates Prompts Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain will reconsider the use of special British
Forces license plates on its military vehicles because of fears
they mark servicemen as IRA targets, a government minister promised
Monday.
   The Irish Republican Army, which killed three British servicemen
and injured three in the Netherlands on Sunday, has threatened to
kill more British Forces members abroad.
   Armed Forces Minister Ian Stewart was asked in a British
Broadcasting Corp. radio interview whether use of the plates would
be looked at as part of the security review promised Sunday by
Defense Secretary George Younger.
   ``Yes, it certainly will,'' he said. ``There are a number of
aspects we want to look into and that is certainly one of them.''
   The Ministry of Defense said the use of a special block of
registration numbers was an ``administrative convenience'' for a
group of temporary residents abroad, but several British lawmakers
have criticized the plates as a ``giveaway'' to terrorists.
   The Daily Telegraph on Monday quoted an unidentified Ministry of
Defense spokeman as saying that all cars owned by military
personnel and their dependents in West Germany are registered as
British Forces vehicles bearing license plates that are not the
normal German civilian ones.
   ``It would be a very small but effective change to put all
number plates on the civilian register,'' said terrorism expert Dr.
Richard Clutterbuck of Exeter University, as quoted by the Daily
Telegraph on Monday.
   Sunday's victims of a shooting and a bomb attack were senior
aircraftsmen in the Royal Air Force Regiment, which guards air
bases. Based in West Germany, they were visiting Dutch discotheques
and bars just across the border.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for Sunday's attacks with a
statement through the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau in Dublin.
   Since launching its violent campaign to end British rule in
Northern Ireland in 1969, the IRA has killed 392 British soldiers
there and 24 in mainland Britain. The organization has a network of
support in the Netherlands, Belgium and West Germany.
   The British armed forces have nearly 70,000 personnel and 80,000
dependents stationed in West Germany at four Royal Air Force and
five army bases.
   On Sunday and Monday, the British Forces Broadcasting Service
transmitted warnings to soldiers and airmen based in West Germany:
``Terrorists only look at you for one reason. Be alert. Stay
alive.''

<HEAD>Artificial Nesting Beach Being Built for Kemp's Ridleys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nursery with an artificial nesting
beach is being built at the Clearwater Marine Science Center with
the goal of boosting the population of the imperiled Kemp's Ridley
sea turtle.
   The $10,000 project will experiment with a first-of-its-kind
beach that includes a gently sloping sand ramp and sea oats, said
Dennis Kellenberger, the center's executive director.
   The purpose: to encourage female Kemp's Ridley sea turtles to
crawl ashore and lay their eggs. Only about 400 to 600 reproducing
females of the species remain.
   Eight Kemp's Ridley turtles, including both sexes, live at the
marine center. These 6-year-old turtles are ready to reproduce, and
center officials hope they will breed and nest in captivity.
   Kellenberger said an attempt at using an artificial beach is a
new approach. ``We're hoping that if they're confined to an area
where they really have no choice but to nest here, then they
will,'' he said.
   The tank will be partially filled with water and the turtles
will be placed there together. At one end of the tank will be a
beach area created by putting sand on a fiberglass liner atop a
wood platform. A gently sloping sand-covered ramp will enable the
turtles to crawl ashore and nest there when they are ready.
   The Kemp's Ridley species was decimated by poachers who waited
for the arrival each summer of the egg-laden females at their only
natural nesting area on a Gulf of Mexico beach at Rancho Nuevo,
Mexico. Poachers sought turtle meat, widely considered a delicacy,
and eggs.
   The nesting beach has been protected since 1966, but the turtles
have not yet recovered to their former numbers partly because they
are frequent victims of shrimpers who unwittingly drown them in
their nets.
   The cream-colored Kemp's Ridleys are the smallest of the sea
turtles, weighing about 100 pounds. They are found throughout the
coastal waters of the United States and Central America, and often
forage in the Tampa Bay area.
   Scientists don't know exactly why the Kemp's Ridleys females lay
their eggs on only one beach or whether enough of them can be
persuaded to nest elsewhere.

   A South African court Monday
sentenced a member of the African National Congress to 25 years in
prison for murder and terrorism.
   Gordon Webster, 24, was convicted by the Pietermaritzburg
Supreme Court of bombing several electrical transformers. One
bombing killed a police colonel.
   Webster's case drew widespread attention when armed colleagues
freed him from a guarded hospital room in May 1986. Webster was
recaptured last September after he planned to take hostages in a
bid to free one of his rescuers, who by that time was awaiting
execution.
   In the highly publicized trial, which ended on Monday, defense
witnesses described Webster as a gentle young man who joined the
guerrilla group in a state of despair over racial discrimination in
South Africa.
   ``Sometimes I wished I could be white,'' Webster said.
``Sometimes I was angry for having color, for what I was _ black.''
   The prosecution said Webster joined the ANC willingly and was
aware that the organization waged a bombing and sabotage campaign.
   The congress, based in Lusaka, Zambia, is the main black group
fighting to overthrow the government of South Africa and end
apartheid.
   The judge and two assessors handling the case said they agreed
on the 25-year sentence after considering the extenuating
circumstances in the case. They said Webster's impoverished
upbringing and skin color caused him difficulties as a youth. They
also said Webster had not intended to kill people when he planted
bombs.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Eaves Convicted On Three Of Four Counts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A. Reginald Eaves, who rebounded from a
scandal-shortened reign as Atlanta's public safety commissioner to
win a seat on the Fulton County Commission, was found guilty of
extortion Monday in connection with payoffs for zoning votes.
   Eaves, convicted on three of four counts, will be sentenced June
27. He faces up to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine on each
count.
   Eaves was accused of taking payments of $20,000 and $10,000 from
an undercover FBI agent posing as a developer in exchange for his
vote on a north Fulton County rezoning. The commissioner said those
payments were for consulting work.
   He also was accused of taking $5,000 from a Duluth developer,
which he denied.
   He was acquitted on a fourth count, accusing him of taking an
additional $8,000 from the undercover agent. Eaves testified that
money was a loan.
   Eaves left the courthouse without comment after the verdict was
announced. He had been suspended from office by Gov. Joe Frank
Harris, pending the outcome of the case.
   Another member of the commission, Chuck Williams, was indicted
along with Eaves. In March, Williams pleaded guilty to one of five
counts in exchange for a two-year prison sentence.
   Some black leaders in Atlanta have contended that Eaves and
Williams, who are black, were the victims of racist prosecution.
But Fulton County Commission Chairman Michael Lomax, who also is
black, said Monday he did not believe that was the case.
   ``We've had prosecutions in south Georgia recently for drugs
among county commissioners who happen to be white,'' Lomax noted.
   ``I was stunned by the evidence (in the Eaves case),'' he said.
``The evidence suggested to me ... that Mr. Eaves had behaved
inappropriately.''
   Included in the evidence presented to the jury were 20 audio
tapes and four videotapes secretly recorded during the FBI
investigation.
   On one videotape, Duluth developer Charles ``Eddie'' Wood Sr.,
who was cooperating with the FBI, asked Eaves, ``Will the five
(thousand dollars) be enough to hold the votes in place, or do we
need to do something else with somebody else?''
   ``Ummm, I think we're going to be all right,'' Eaves replied.
   Wood testified that he had paid Eaves thousands over several
years, including the $5,000 of FBI cash.
   Eaves first made his mark in Atlanta politics in 1974 as public
safety commissioner under his old college fraternity brother and
friend, then-Mayor Maynard Jackson. He resigned in 1978 in the wake
of a city report accusing him of helping selected police officers
cheat on promotion exams.
   Eaves failed in a quest to be elected mayor of Atlanta, but won
election to the Fulton County Commission.
   The jury _ nine white women, two white men and a black man _ had
begun its deliberations Friday.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for reputed Colombian drug
lord Carlos Lehder Rivas rested their case Monday without calling
any witnesses to counter 22 weeks of testimony that their client
ran a vast cocaine-smuggling empire.
   Defense attorney Edward R. Shohat rested on the defense's first
day after filing documents on deals the government made to get
testimony from some of the 115 prosecution witnesses, many of them
admitted smugglers.
   ``The government has literally given away the courthouse to get
our client,'' Shohat said. He declined to discuss the move with
reporters outside the courtroom.
   Stephen J. Weinbaum, an attorney for co-defendant Jack Reed,
also rested his case without calling any witnesses.
   Defense attorneys often use that tactic ``to keep the
sufficiency of the government's case at issue,'' said Weinbaum.
   Defense attorneys have questioned the credibility of witnesses
throughout the case, contending that the government reduced
sentences, gave grants of immunity and even decided not to seek
charges against witnesses.
   Last week, Shohat had said the defense would take two weeks, and
prosecutors acknowledged they were caught off-guard by the sudden
change.
   ``You could honestly say I looked surprised and stunned,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller said after the announcement
was made. The jury did not show any reaction.
   U.S. District Judge Howell Melton set closing arguments for next
week.
   Lehder, 38, allegedly one of the leaders of the violent Medellin
cartel, is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise. He is accused of smuggling 3.3 tons
of cocaine into the United States from his private island of
Norman's Cay in the Bahamas from 1978 to 1980.
   If convicted of all 11 counts against him, Lehder faces a
maximum sentence of life, plus 165 years.
   Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged with conspiracy and
faces a maximum sentence of 15 years.
   Melton denied a defense motion Monday to sequester the jury
during closing arguments, which defense attorneys complained will
come during ``Just Say No To Drugs Week.''
   The judge also denied a motion from Shohat for a 60-day
continuance to give attorneys time to go over thousands of
documents and visit foreign countries to prepare their defense.
   ``The defense in this case depended in large amount on evidence
from outside the Unites States _ that includes principally the
Bahamas, Germany, Haiti, Colombia,'' said Shohat.
   Lehder also is also charged in separate indictments in Los
Angeles and Miami.
   The Miami indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of
the so-called Medellin cartel, believed to be responsible for 80
percent of the cocaine smuggled into United States _ a bonanza
worth $8 billion each year.
   According to law enforcement officials who have requested
anonymity, U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle has been presenting
evidence from the Lehder trial to a federal grand jury in Tampa
investigating possible drug links to Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden
O. Pindling.

<HEAD>With AM-State Primary Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOONE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The GOP primary Tuesday for Watauga County's
register of deeds pits two people who have squared off against each
other at least once before _ in the divorce courts.
   Orville Foster is challenging incumbent Phyllis Foster, his
ex-wife.
   A little less than three years ago, three days after their
divorce, Foster was arrested on charges of assault with a deadly
weapon, his car, for ``swerving in an attempt to strike'' a female
companion walking with Mrs. Foster in a shopping mall parking lot.
   Of the election contest, Mrs. Foster says: ``It's excruciatingly
painful. But situations like this build character.'' The Fosters
were married for 35 years.
   Foster, the county Republican chairman, says: ``I would be
running for register of deeds if (Gov.) Jim Martin were running for
register of deeds in Watauga County. The fact that Phyllis and I
used to be married has nothing to do with it.''
   Foster has attacked Mrs. Foster's budget practices as register
of deeds.
   ``The register of deeds office does pay its way, but it should
be making money _ a great deal of money _ rather than just breaking
even,'' he said.
   ``I'm running on my record,'' Mrs. Foster said.
   The Fosters had been married for six years when Foster was
appointed county tax collector and named his wife his part-time
assistant in 1956.
   In 1962, Foster won his first elected office, clerk of Superior
Court, a post he held for 12 years. He appointed his wife a deputy.
   On Oct. 2, 1985, their divorce was finalized. All records of the
divorce are inaccessible. A handwritten note on one file says
``Closed to the public,'' while another file is ordered closed on
request of Foster, the plaintiff.
   A deferred prosecution deal ordering Foster to keep a clean
record allowed the 1985 assault charges to be dropped a year later.
   More than a week after his arrest, Foster wrote to the state
treasurer, telling him retirement credits Mrs. Foster was claiming
as assistant tax collector should not be allowed because she did
not work full time.
   A two-year probe led to a state ruling against Mrs. Foster.

   Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci has
decided against sending U.S. Coast Guard ships to the Persian Gulf
to augment the Navy patrol, the Pentagon said today.
   ``The Department of Defense is no longer considering sending
Coast Guard vessels to the Persian Gulf at this time,'' the
Pentagon said in a statement.
   ``After a thorough assessment during the past week, it has been
decided that the current strength and force mix of our task force
in the gulf is sufficient to protect U.S. interests in the region
and to defend against threats to the rights of U.S.-flagged ships,
as well as neutral ships in distress requesting assistance in
international waters of the gulf,'' the statement said.
   The statement was issued after Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the
ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told
reporters earlier today that he had talked to Carlucci last week
and urged that the proposal be dropped.
   ``He (Carlucci) said it was his current thinking that the guard
is not going,'' Warner said. ``... The secretary of defense reached
his decision on his own initiative, but he did listen carefully to
those of us in Congress, including myself, and the leadership, who
suggested that this would not be the right time to take Coast Guard
vessels from the United States.''
   A proposal to send Coast Guard ships to the gulf met strong
opposition from members of Congress who believe the vessels are
needed elsewhere to stop drug runners.
   The idea of sending Coast Guard boats had been raised by
Pentagon officials in the past week as part of a review of U.S.
policy in the gulf. That review came in the wake of the April 18
clash between the Navy and Iran, when Navy ships and planes sank or
damaged six Iranian ships.
   Administration officials announced Friday that U.S. policy in
the war-torn waterway was changing from the previous 10-month-old
plan of having the Navy protect only 11 Kuwaiti-owned tankers which
have been carrying the U.S. flag.
   Navy warships will now have authority to respond to calls for
aid from any neutral merchant ships which come under attack,
assuming the American vessels is close enough to help.
   Pentagon officials said a week ago that consideration was being
given to sending up to a half-dozen of the Coast Guard's 110-foot
``Island'' class boats to the gulf. The ships were designed for
shallow waters and could help patrol the area, according to
Carlucci and other officials.

   Jesse Jackson is the overwhelming favorite to
win Tuesday's District of Columbia primary and repeat one of his
two 1984 primary victories.
   Even front-runner Michael Dukakis' campaign concedes Jackson
will likely win most of the district's 16 delegates.
   ``There is no question that Jackson will take the majority,''
said Jim Nathanson, a city councilman who has been chief spokesman
of the Dukakis campaign in the district.
   Nathanson predicted Dukakis would win three of the 11 delegates
directly chosen Tuesday night, adding ``If the Dukakis support
really turns out we could get five.''
   ``We should win the majority of the delegates,'' said Yolanda
Caraway, spokeswoman for the Jackson campaign. ``The way things
have been looking we expect a big turnout.''
   Election officials say 113,000 of the 235,000 registered voters
went to the polls in 1984 when Jackson took all but three of the
Democratic delegates, and a similar turnout is expected Tuesday.
   In the district, less than 22,000 people are registered
Republicans. In the GOP primary, voters are expected to give George
Bush 14 delegates in a winner-take-all primary.
   District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry Jr. and the district's
delegate to Congress, Walter Fauntroy, have been active Jackson
supporters and participants in his national campaign.
   Barry has predicted that Jackson will take 70 percent of the
Democratic primary vote in the district, which is 67 percent black.
   The district and Louisiana were Jackson's only primary victories
in 1984.

<HEAD>House Refuses To Ban US Manuevers Along Honduras-Nicaragua Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted easily Monday to again ban any
U.S. combat troops from Nicaragua, but refused to prohibit American
servicmen from conducting maneuvers along the border of the
leftist-ruled Central American nation.
   The decisions came as the chamber began a second week of work on
a bill authorizing the Pentagon budget for the next fiscal year.
   First, the Democratic-controlled House voted 276-92 to block the
sending of any combat troops into, or over, Nicaragua.
   A similar ban had been approved by the House in each of the past
two years. But it had been changed by a House-Senate conference
committee to simply make it a ``sense of the Congress'' resolution
and say the ban didn't affect a president's constitutional power as
commander-in-chief.
   Rep. Thomas Foley, D-Wash., the House majority leader, sponsored
the proposal.
   He noted that President Reagan has repeatedly stated the United
States has no intention of invading Nicaragua, where U.S.-backed
Contra guerrillas are now conducting peace talks with the leftist
leaders of Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   ``It may seem to some wise to reaffirm this intention on the
part of the administration and Congress not to maintain any threat
of intervention,'' said Foley.
   But Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said, ``this perennial amendment is
still unconstitutional, in my judgement. I don't think we can
repeal the power of the president to be commander-in-chief.''
   Before passing the Foley proposal, the House voted 336-21
approval of an amendment by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., which
said U.S. forces could be sent into Nicaragua to respond to a
hijacking, a kidnapping, or other acts of terrorism against U.S.
citizens or citizens of a U.S. ally.
   Then, the House rejected, 238-147, an amendment by Rep. Edward
Markey, D-Mass., that would block U.S. personnel who are assisting
the Contras from being within 20 miles of the Nicaraguan border.
The prohibition would specifically apply to U.S. military exercises.
   The Pentagon has conducted a series of exercises in Honduras,
which shares a border with Nicaragua. But U.S. personnel have
generally stayed away from the border.
   The House also rejected, 267-111, an attempt to delete the $3
million in the bill which would go for Army construction plans in
Honduras.
   The Senate is expected next week to begin considering its
version of a Pentagon budget bill, and the provisions that
separately pass the two chambers will eventually have to be
reconciled by a House-Senate conference committee.
   Both the House and Senate measures authorize $299.5 billion in
defense spending for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. But the House
has already added three nuclear arms control restrictions strongly
opposed by Reagan, in addition to the Foley proposal.
   More restrictions are likely as the House continues to work
through the bill, including a deep reduction from Reagan's request
for spending on his Star Wars anti-missile research plan.
   Reagan sought $4.8 billion for the plan, but the House bill
would permit $4.0 billion, while the Senate measure allows $4.6
billion. The current budget is $3.9 billion for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known.

<HEAD>Family Says Police Bungled After Son's Body Lay In Morgue For
Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The body of Allan Ruffin lay unidentified in the
Cook County morgue for a month while his family searched
frantically for him, badgering police, calling hospitals, even
asking the morgue if his body was there.
   Ruffin's family accused the Chicago police on Monday of bungling
the investigation of his disappearance, launched nearly two months
ago when the family first filed a missing person's report.
   ``How is it that they did not discover my brother at the morgue
when they told us they assigned an officer to us and he was
investigating?'' said Ruffin's older sister, Thelma, 38. ``They
just didn't do their jobs.
   ``We're still in a state of shock. I can't believe that this has
happened,'' Ms. Ruffin said Monday in a telephone interview.
   The Ruffin's complaint is under investigation and ``there's no
comment on it until the investigation is cleared,'' said Officer
Ernestine Dowell, a Chicago Police Department spokeswoman.
   Ms. Ruffin said the family last saw Allan, 35, a disabled
Vietnam War veteran, on March 3, but didn't worry until three days
later when he still hadn't shown up for his medication, which he
kept at his mother's apartment.
   He had suffered a head wound in Vietnam and took medication to
prevent seizures, Ms. Ruffin said.
   On March 7, another sister, Laverne Walker, went to Ruffin's
room at the Mark Twain Hotel on the city's West Side to look for
him. She found his room in bloody disarray, Ms. Ruffin said.
   ``We thought that he might have had a seizure and hit his head
and that would have caused the blood,'' she said. ``So we started
calling the hospitals and calling around the neighborhood.''
   The family filed a missing persons report on March 9, but Ms.
Ruffin contends the initial officer assigned to the case never came
to pick up a photograph of her brother.
   Police pulled Ruffin's body from the Chicago River on March 28.
   It remained at the county medical examiner's office until last
Wednesday when a second police investigator assigned to the case
discovered the clothes found on the body matched the description
provided by the family in its original missing persons report, Ms.
Ruffin said.
   ``Everything we said that he was wearing when we last saw him
was at the morgue,'' she said. ``Why did he lay in the morgue since
the 28th (of March)? He had loved ones.''
   While her brother was missing, Ms. Ruffin said she and other
family members regularly called local hospitals and distributed
fliers with Ruffin's photograph.
   ``We were hoping he had a seizure and bumped his head and maybe
was wandering around still alive, but just didn't remember who he
was,'' Ms. Ruffin said.
   She said they also called the morgue regularly and even went
there on April 11 _ while her brother's body was there _ and
inspected another unidentified body found under a viaduct to see if
it was Allan.
   Ms. Ruffin said the medical examiner's office told the family
her brother had drowned, but Roy Dames of the medical examiner's
office said the cause of death listed on his death certificate was
left blank _ ``pending police investigation.''
   Ruffin's will be buried Tuesday.

<HEAD>Investigators Find Apparent Metal Fatigue But Say Accident Cause
Pending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAHULUI, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators have found evidence
of cracks apparently caused by metal fatigue on the remaining
fuselage of an Aloha Airlines jet which lost about a third of its
roof in midflight.
   However, they say the investigation is continuing and it is too
early to determine a definite cause of the accident last Thursday
in which a flight attendant died and 61 of 89 passengers were
injured.
   Evidence of fatigue cracking was found at six rivet holes on a
metal strip running the length of the Boeing 737, said Joseph Nall
of the National Transportation Safety Board.
   All of the plane's rivets, as well as those of Aloha's other
737s, were being tested electronically in an effort to find any
other cracks, Nall said at a Sunday night news conference.
   However, in an interview on the NBC ``Today'' show Monday, Nall
said it was not known yet whether the cracks occurred before or
after 20 feet of the upper fuselage was blown away at 24,000 feet.
   The part of the remaining fuselage where the cracks were found
were being taken to Washington for ``a very careful analysis to see
just what relationship it may have had,'' he said.
   Investigators are always concerned about fatigue and cracking in
older aircraft, and the Aloha plane involved in the accident was an
older one, Nall said.
   An inspection of the aircraft showed that repairs made to two
cracks found last November appeared to have held.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered the oldest
versions of the Boeing 737, those with more than 55,000 landings,
not to fly above 23,000 feet.
   The cargo door on the lower right side of the plane remained
closed until the pilot made an emergency landing on Maui 13 minutes
after the incident, Nall said.
   This added rigidity to the fuselage and helped hold the aircraft
together until it landed, he said.
   Seven people remained hospitalized Monday, all reported in
stable condition with fractures, burns and lacerations.
   Clarabelle ``C.B.'' Lansing, one of three flight atteedants
aboard the plane, is believed to have been blown out of the plane.
   A renewed search Sunday of waters south and southwest of Maui
failed to turn up any trace of her or of the missing section of
fuselage.

President Reagan as assistant secretary of defense for special
operations and low-intensity conflict, it was announced Monday.
   Whitehouse was regional director of the U.S. Agency for
International Development in South Vietnam from 1969 until 1970,
when he became acting deputy assistant secretary of state for East
Asian-Pacific affairs.
   He returned to Saigon as a deputy chief of mission in 1972.
Later he was ambassador in Laos, and then ambassador in Thailand.
Whitehouse retired in 1978.
   If confirmed, Whitehouse, 66, will succeed Chapman B. Cox.

<HEAD>Tobacco Institute Spokesman Blasts Coming Report That Nicotine is
Addictive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The vice president of the Tobacco Institute
reacted sharply Monday to the surgeon general's coming declaration
that nicotine is addictive, saying ``it is apparent that
anti-tobacco zeal has overtaken common sense and good judgment.''
   ``To imply that the 55 million American tobacco smokers are drug
abusers is to subvert and divert attention from the nation's war on
illicit drugs,'' said Walker Merryman, spokesman for the industry
organization. ``It is a trivialization of the country's urgent
concerns with hard drugs and verges on irresponsibility.''
   Ronald M. Davis, director of the federal Office of Smoking and
Health, said Sunday that a report calling tobacco an addictive drug
will be issued by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in the next few
weeks. Davis said such a declaration means tobacco should receive
the serious attention given to heroin and cocaine.
   ``If Ronald Davis yesterday was really speaking accurately for
and with the authorization from the surgeon general in describing
his forthcoming report, it is apparent that anti-tobacco zeal has
overtaken common sense and good judgment,'' Merryman said.
   ``It may well be that utter frustration on the part of the
surgeon general, because of lack of progress toward his goal of
tobacco prohibition, is responsible for this incredible comparison
of tobacco use with heroin and cocaine addiction,'' said Merryman.
   The Office of Smoking and Health, although not directly under
Koop in the Department of Health and Human Services organizational
structure, is among several federal agencies working at Koop's
direction in developing material for the annual smoking report.
   There was no question Davis is familiar with the contents of the
report, but department officials expressed surprise Monday that he
discussed them in advance of the formal release, tentatively
scheduled May 16.
   Public Health Service spokesman Jim Brown said Koop will not
discuss the report in advance of its release.
   Davis made his remarks Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation''
program.

<HEAD>N.C. Convention Scuffle Could Mean Trouble, GOP Chairman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISBURG, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fistfights that erupted at the 4th
District Republican convention over the weekend could point to a
future showdown between supporters of presidential candidate Pat
Robertson and other delegates, North Carolina's GOP chairman says.
   ``Who was right, I can't say, but certainly there needs to be
more maturity and evenhandedness in handling the whole situation,''
Jack Hawke told The News and Observer of Raleigh.
   The confrontation involved the selection of three delegates to
the Republican National Convention in August. Competing for the
delegate slots were Robertson supporters and GOP party leaders
backing Vice President George Bush.
   After the confrontation, Robertson supporters walked out to hold
their own convention, while Bush supporters elected their three
delegates inside.
   A group of Robertson supporters then returned to the podium, and
screaming and fist-throwing followed as Bush and Robertson forces
battled for control.
   No one was seriously injured, officials said.
   Hawke said he fears possible reprisals from conservative GOP
members if differences aren't resolved at the state convention.
   ``When you are a minority party and you are used to being
behind, you need all the help and support you can possibly
receive,'' he said. ``But it's a very unfortunate threat for
anybody to oppose somebody just to get even.''

<HEAD>States With Bush Ties to Lodge With Veep at Convention</HEAD>

   Delegates to the Republican National
Convention from New Hampshire and three of the states George Bush
calls home will be lodging with the vice president in New Orleans.
   State GOP Chairwoman Elsie Vartanian said Monday that delegates
from Texas, Maine and Connecticut will join New Hampshire delegates
at the same hotel as Bush. The vice president's official residence
is in Texas and his summer home is in Maine. He has old family ties
with Connecticut.
   Vartanian said she assumes New Hampshire was chosen because of
Bush's friendship with Gov. John Sununu. New Hampshire voters also
gave Bush a boost when Kansas Sen. Bob Dole was making a strong run
at Bush's status as Republican front-runner.
   The convention is August 15-18.

<HEAD>Koch Considers Skipping Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, the target of sharp
criticism for his attacks on presidential candidate Jesse Jackson,
may go to Ireland rather than attend the Democratic National
Convention, according to a spokesman.
   Koch may opt for Cardinal John J. O'Connor's peace pilgrimage to
Ireland, set for July 21-27, over the convention, which runs July
18-21, said mayoral press secretary George Arzt.
   Arzt, quoted in Sunday's New York Times, denied the flap created
by the attacks on Jackson was behind the mayor's decision ``to
rethink whether or not he would be a delegate.'' Koch was
excoriated in the news media after repeatedly criticizing Jackson
and saying Jewish voters would be crazy to support the candidate in
New York's primary.
   Koch, who endorsed Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. before the New
York primary, would have to commit himself to either Jackson or
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis to attend the convention as an
at-large delegate. Dukakis captured the New York primary; Gore
finished a poor third and discontinued his bid for the White House.
   Prospective at-large delegates must make their choices known by
May 27.

   U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller and his wife,

   ``Mike Dukakis has the experience and vision needed to move
America from the status quo,'' Sen. Rockefeller said in a prepared
statement.
   ``He knows how to make government work for the working man and
woman; he understands the problems of Appalachia, and he will be
the best president of the United States,'' he added.
   Rockefeller is one of 43 senators who will attend the national
convention as super delegates. Mrs. Rockefeller will attend as a

   Jesse Jackson said Monday that he and
Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis are not being held to the
same standards, with the news media allowing Dukakis ``to have
Teflon'' while Jackson is required to back up his proposals and
statements.
   Jackson, spelling out proposals of his own, also called for a
substantial increase in the minimum wage and for a corporate code
of conduct to press companies benefiting from federal help to
invest in America and not take jobs outside the country.
   In a luncheon speech to The City Club, a Cleveland civic
organization, Jackson said he would raise the minimum wage of $3.35
an hour to half the average hourly wage of production workers,
which is $9.19.
   Jackson's staff said he gradually would increase the wage
standard to $5.50 an hour by 1993.
   He said a conduct code should establish ``a set of
responsibilities to accompany the right to do business, the receipt
of government incentives, tax credits and grants. It encourages
participation of workers in their companies and a greater
productivity.''
   Earlier, after a speech to high school students in nearby Parma,
Jackson said Dukakis has not been forced to give specifics to back
up his campaign generalities.
   ``So far the media is allowing him to have Teflon,'' Jackson
said, a reference to a situation in which opponents' criticism
slides right off.
   ``In time, that will change,'' Jackson said. ``The media
challenged me to show how I would pay for my dreams. I have done
just that.''
   For now, however, Jackson said Dukakis has not come under the
same kind of scrutiny concerning the priorities he would set and
how he would pay.
   ``So far Dukakis has operated with caution when we must operate
with courage, clarity and candor,'' Jackson said.
   In a wide-ranging economic speech on the eve of Ohio's
presidential primary, Jackson sought to give specifics of his own
economic proposals in what aides said was an effort to draw
comparisons with Dukakis.
   Jackson said his corporate code of conduct would be ``based on
democratic values and a common definition of the national
interest.'' He said it would make corporations accountable ``not
only to shareholders but to all stakeholders, including the
community and workers.''
   He said he wants to change corporate behavior as part of his
plans for reversing President Reagan's economic policies.
   Jackson also renewed his call for investment of a portion of
public pension funds into domestic development projects. He said
the program would use federal guarantees to issue bonds backed by
development projects and would sell the bonds to the pension funds.
   He said the program should include cooperation between federal
and local governments as well as business interests.
   Jackson spent Sunday night at the modest Berea home of
steelworker union organizer Valentino Fulimeni to symbolize concern
for laborers who he said had been hurt by Reagan administration
economic policies.
   ``There simply are two dimensions to this campaign,'' Jackson
said. Besides the race for the presidency, there is also ``a
historical dimension. It is part of the thrust to open up the
American political system ... the thrust to empower locked-out
people.''

<TEXT>
   A man charged with killing a Baltimore
tavern owner 13 years ago was freed Monday on $10,000 bail pending
extradition proceedings.
   Despite Deputy Salt Lake County Attorney Bud Ellett's
objections, 3rd Circuit Judge Eleanor VanSciver told Daniel Eugene
Binick he would be free pending arrival of a Maryland arrest
warrant later in May.
   Ellett argued that Binick's surrender to the FBI last month was
not as voluntary as it appeared.
   Defense attorney Kendall Hatch countered that Binick's surrender
stemmed from his desire to clear up the Maryland charge. He
emphasized that Binick, 40, maintains his innocence.
   A friend of Binick's, Nancy Lombard, said she was posting the
$10,000.
   ``I have absolute faith in this man. I have no worry about him
going anywhere,'' said Lombard, an acquaintance of nine years. ``He
and his wife have helped an enormous number of people. I simply
believe this is the time when someone should help him.''
   Binick turned himself in to the FBI March 14, 12 years after he
assumed the name of Jerry LeBaue.
   ``I've looked over my shoulder for 13 years on this charge and I
was tired,'' he told VanSciver at a hearing last week.
   Binick said his attorney had talked to the FBI 72 hours before
he surrendered and if he had wanted to run he had plenty of chances
to do so at that time.
   A Maryland grand jury indicted Binick for murder in the March 5,
1975, slaying of Walter Seborowski, shot during a robbery of his
tavern. The crime was widely publicized because Seborowski was a
World War II hero who had escaped a prisoner-of-war camp.
   Binick is married with two stepchildren. He has been active in
Alcoholics Anonymous and other community work for a decade and
friends have petitioned Gov. Norm Bangerter to intervene in his
behalf.

   First lady Nancy Reagan will forge
ahead with her anti-drug crusade in her post-White House years, but
she told Hollywood's money barons Monday that she needs help to
realize her dreams.
   On the lavish grounds of the four-acre Merv Griffin estate, Mrs.
Reagan told the 42 guests gathered at a ``power breakfast'' that
her proposed Nancy Reagan Center for drug abuse is the next stage
in her drug fight.
   Several locations in Los Angeles County are being considered for
the $10 million facility and no decision has been made on a site,
said Dan Langdon the the New York-based Phoenix House.
   ``She was received very well,'' said Griffin publicist Warren
Cowan. ``She is going to be very active and work at this when she
leaves. She talked about setting up this facility and she recounted
her history with the drug program.''
   The Phoenix House, the nation's largest private, non-profit drug
abuse service agency, will operate the center described by Mrs.
Reagan as ``a central institution in the battle against youthful
drug abuse.''
   Breakfast guests began arriving just before 8 a.m. with a
procession of Rolls-Royce luxury cars led by actress Eva Gabor's
gray Rolls. She emerged in a canary yellow suit and was greeted by
boyfriend Griffin on the steps of the massive stone mansion.
   Among those dining with the first lady at the estate's tennis
pavilion were wealthy businessmen Marvin Davis, Fred Hartley, Fred
Hayman, Rupert Murdoch and David Murdock and entertainment
executives Grant Tinker and Jerry Weintraub.
   ``This was a power breakfast for power people,'' said Cowan.
Griffin described the group earlier as ``every mover and shaker in
this part of the world.''
   Mrs. Reagan spent two hours with the group, dining with them on
smoked salmon and sturgeon, fried apples and scrambled eggs, before
her motorcade sped off for Los Angeles International Airport and a
flight back to Washington.
   Guests then heard from Griffin in a 30-minute discussion about
the proposed Nancy Reagan Center and he announced formation of a
fund-raising effort. Cowan said, however, that guests weren't
directly asked for money.
   The center will be a residential high school for youngsters with
drug abuse problems, said Langdon, adding that a research unit and
training institute were also part of the master plan.

   George Bush charged Monday that Michael Dukakis advocates
policies that would return America ``to the misery'' inherited by
the Reagan administration in 1981, while Jesse Jackson accused the
Democratic front-runner of caution ``where we must operate with
courage, clarity and candor.''
   Dukakis, anticipating landslide presidential primary victories
Tuesday in Ohio and Indiana, turned Jackson's comments aside by
saying, ``I'm not just a talker. I'm a doer.''
   The Massachusetts governor, returning Republican fire, also took
aim at embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III. ``We want an
attorney general that you and I can be proud of, not ashamed of,''
he said.
   Dukakis added that the Reagan administration has failed to
provide sufficient funding for day care programs for children.
   Jackson addressed economics as well during the day, calling for
a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage from the current
$3.35 an hour to $5.50 an hour by 1993. The last increase occurred
Jan. 1, 1981.
   Ohio, Indiana and the District of Columbia offer a total of 254
Democratic National Convention delegates in Tuesday's primaries.
Dukakis is heavily favored to defeat Jackson in Ohio and Indiana
and may capture 200 or more delegates in the three races combined,
thus padding his substantial lead over his sole remaining opponent.
   The Massachusetts governor has nearly 1,300 of the 2,081
delegates needed to claim the nomination, according to The
Associated Press count. The slow, steady trickle of party leaders
to Dukakis' side continued during the day, as Sen. John D.
Rockefeller IV of West Virginia announced his support.
   Jackson is favored to win the District of Columbia primary.
   Bush already has enough delegates to assure his nomination at
the GOP convention in August, and has no active Republican
opposition in Tuesday's primaries.
   The day's campaign comments fit a pattern that has emerged in
recent days, with the vice president criticizing Dukakis for being
inexperienced and advocating policies that are too liberal and
Jackson seeking to prod his Democratic rival into moving to the
left.
   In a day of campaigning in Indiana, Bush said the issues in the
fall would be peace and jobs, and added, ``The country wants to
move ahead, not go back to the misery we inherited through the very
policies Jackson and Dukakis are talking about.''
   ``Inexperience in foreign policy could hurt not only our
national security, but also our economic strength,'' Bush added.
   The vice president visited a factory where Hummer defense
vehicles are made and promised to try and keep the production line
open.
   ``We took a $31 billion cut in defense because of the opposition
in the Congress, a lot of it affecting what happens on this very
production line in the future,'' he said.
   The vice president later accused Dukakis of unfounded criticism
of the administration's handling of the regime in Panama, and said
U.S. efforts in Central America could be set back by ``some kind of
macho statement out of Harvard.''
   ``I can't wait for Mr. Dukakis to discuss the Noriega matter,''
Bush said, referring to allegations that the CIA made payments to
Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, now under indictment for drug
running.
   ``One of the beautiful things about being a new candidate is you
can make dramatic statements without necessarily having the
proof.'' Bush said he was ``somewhat inhibited'' from discussing
the situation because of his past tenure as CIA director, but said,
``When it became demonstrably clear that Noriega was involved in
drugs, we moved against him.''
   Jackson campaigned through Ohio, jabbing at Dukakis while
calling for an increase in the federal minimum wage as well as a
``corporate code of conduct'' to prevent American jobs from being
exported overseas.
   In a luncheon speech to the City Club in Cleveland, he said the
minimum wage should be raised to an amount equal to half the
average wage in America.
   The most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report pegged the
average non-agricultural wage as of March at $9.19 an hour. Half of
that would be nearly $4.60 an hour, an increase of $1.25 over the
current minimum wage of $3.35. Aides said Jackson's proposal called
for a gradual hike to $5.50 an hour over the next five years.
   As for Dukakis, Jackson said the news media had created a
``Teflon candidate'' by allowing the governor to escape providing
details of his campaign commitments. ``So far, Dukakis has operated
with caution when we must operate with courage, clarity and
candor,'' he said.
   Dukakis spent part of his day visiting a day care center at a
predominantly black Cincinnati high school as part of an attempt to
court more black support. He also told reporters he had no
intention of criticizing Jackson, whose supporters will be
essential to any Democrat's chance of success in the fall.
   ``I'm not just a talker. I'm a doer. There's no question about
my record,'' he said when asked about Jackson's statements.
   But he had no reluctance about Bush and the Republicans,
mentioning Meese and saying that in his administration, ``There
won't be any Robert Borks nominated to the Supreme Court.''
   He added, ``We can't have two and a half million people without
a home in this country and young families who can't afford a
home,'' he said. ``That's not the American dream.''

   While criticizing what it deemed bureaucratic
bungling, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Monday it was
powerless to help a Texas woman who lost $1,100 because of bad
advice from Social Security Administration employees.
   ``This case is an example of how the government's brain often
fails to control the movement of its fingers,'' the court said in
an opinion written by Judge E. Grady Jolly.
   In May 1983, Marie B. Jones of Dallas called the Social Security
Administration to see whether she could receive early retirement
benefits and later use her former husband's work records as a basis
for higher benefits, the court said. Mrs. Jones, who was 62 at the
time she called for advice, was told that if she accepted benefits
based on her own work record, she would be barred from receiving
the larger, divorced-spouse benefits when she reached 65.
   ``This information was incorrect,'' the court said Monday.
   Mrs. Jones' sister, Clarice Soven, made a similar telephone call
and got the same erroneous advice, the court said.
   In October 1984, after she filed for benefits based on her
husband's work record, Mrs. Jones was told that she could have
received $1,100 of early retirement benefits, had she filed in 1983.
   The sisters began attempting to collect the $1,100 lost by Mrs.
Jones, appealing through the Social Security system, the courts,
and writing to their senator and to the secretary of Health and
Human Services.
   But their efforts went virtually for naught, as Mrs. Jones lost
in a district court in Texas. She appealed, but was told Monday the
5th Circuit's three-judge panel couldn't help her.
   ``Although it is clear that under relevant case law Mrs. Jones'
claim must be dismissed, we are very sympathetic with her plight,''
Jolly wrote. ``She has been misled and unjustifiably denied her
rightful benefits at a time when she seriously needed funds ...
   ``Such is life in the post-1984 Orwellian bureaucracy.''

   Thousands of undocumented aliens armed with lawn
chairs, ice chests and toys queued outside the nation's busiest
immigration office Monday to apply for amnesty just two days before
the unprecedented program's deadline.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials hired police
officers to controls crowds and traffic, and brought in portable
toilets to ease the wait.
   ``This is an incredible amount of activity,'' regional INS
commissioner Mario Ortiz said. ``The pace is really phenomenal,
particularly in Dallas and Houston.''
   By midmorning Monday, a line containing several hundred people
circled the shopping center that houses the Houston office and
stretched into an alley.
   Many of the 2,000 applicants processed by noon had camped out
since Sunday evening to be at the head of the line, said Richard S.
Rios, director of the center.
   ``I really didn't know what to do,'' Zeerak Khan, 20, of
Pakistan, said as she waited in the line. ``That's why I waited
until the last minute.''
   One woman stood holding her baby in one arm and clutched amnesty
documents in the other that were longer than the infant. Others
camped out with lawn chairs and ice chests and brought toys for
their children.
   Officials planned to deal with the last-minute rush by keeping
offices in the 13-state Southern region open from Tuesday morning
straight through to the midnight Wednesday deadline, Ortiz said.
They also were waiving interviews with applicants until after the
deadline.
   The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act allows aliens who
can prove continuous residency in the United States since Jan. 1,
1982, to apply for legal status by midnight Wednesday. The filing
fee is $185 for adults and $50 for children, with a family limit of
$420.
   People turning in applications Monday received a receipt,
temporary work authorization number and an interview date, in many
cases not until November.
   The INS' latest figures show that as of Saturday, more than 1.3
million aliens had applied for amnesty at 107 INS offices
nationwide, Ortiz said. The total is near the agency's planning
estimate, he added.
   In Houston, Marcelino Crespo Vargas said he finally got the
documentation to prove he's been living and working in nearby
Dayton for 16 years.
   ``I've been living here so long. I've got nothing to go back to
in Mexico,'' said the 34-year-old gardener from Salamanca, Mexico.
   Sam Urueme, 28, a chef from Nigeria, said he wants to become an
American citizen ``mainly to come and go as I please. To take
advantage of making a good living and starting a business,
hopefully a restaurant.''
   Urueme said he and his friend, Christy Lawrence, 33, of Lagos,
arrived at 6:30 a.m. to find line circling the building.
   Of the 93,000 applicants received in Houston so far, 73 percent
are from Mexico and 92 percent are of Latin American descent, Rios
said. About 50,000 applicants were predicted to be processed when
the Houston center opened last year, but now Rios says his office
will exceed 100,000.
   The Houston office's crush was mirrored at other Texas
locations, such as in Harlingen, where Francisco Gallegos, 45, said
he and his wife arrived late Sunday afternoon and spent the night.
   ``It was so we wouldn't have to be waiting back there,'' he
said, pointing to a ong line that stretched into the parking lot of
a night club next door.

<HEAD>Christian Science Couple Face Manslaughter Charges in Death of Son</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Christian Science couple pleaded innocent Monday
to charges that they caused their son's death by failing to seek
medical treatment because of their religious beliefs.
   David and Ginger Twitchell, formerly of Boston's Hyde Park
section, appeared in Suffolk Superior Court on manslaughter charges
stemming from the April 8, 1986, death of their 2{-year-old son,
Robyn.
   Twitchell, dressed in a dark blue leisure suit, and his wife,
who wore a lavender pantsuit with lavender-colored plastic flowers
in her hair, stood close to each other and held hands as they both
entered not guilty pleas before Trial Magistrate Gary Wilson.
   A pretrial conference was set for June 1. The Twitchells, who
have two other sons, Jeremy, 6, and Brian, 7 months, were released
on their own recognizance.
   In response to a motion filed by the prosecution, Superior Court
Judge Sandra Hamlin imposed a gag order on all parties in the case
pending a hearing Thursday on the matter.
   Assistant District Attorney Thomas J. Mundy requested the order
for attorneys in the case, complaining about the published remarks
made last week by one of the two defense attorneys, Rikki Klieman.
Mundy said Klieman's statements violated the canon of ethics and
``could poison the pool of prospective jurors.''
   Klieman's remarks, published in The Boston Globe, included the
statement that the death of the Twitchell child ``was not a crime.''
   Klieman argued in court Monday that she was not suggesting that
the Twitchells were either innocent or guilty but was merely
referring to the fact that the child's death did not constitute a
crime under state law.
   ``It's our reading of the law that there has been no crime
here,'' she said.
   The Twitchells are the second set of Christian Science parents
to be prosecuted in the state and the first since 1971, when the
state amended the child abuse and neglect law to recognize
spiritual healing as an alternative to modern medicine.
   Followers of Christian Science refuse medicine or other health
care on the belief that true understanding of God acts as a cure.
   According to police reports, Robyn Twitchell became feverish and
lethargic in early April 1986. The Twitchells contacted a church
practitioner, who came to their home to pray for the boy's recovery.
   On the evening of his death, the boy developed convulsions and
lost consciousness and vital signs. The boy's father first called a
funeral director, who told him to contact the police. The boy was
pronounced dead at Carney Hospital in Boston.
   Klieman said the official cause of death was complications from
a bowel obstruction. She said it stemmed from a congenital birth
defect.
   Officials will not reveal the Twitchells' current town of
residence. Klieman said David Twitchell works in a retirement home
and Mrs. Twitchell is a ``homemaker.''
   In 1967, Dorothy Sheriden of Harwich was convicted of
manslaughter for the death of her 5-year-old daughter from a lung
infection.
   The Church of Christ, Scientist is located in Boston and the
denomination has about 3,200 branches worldwide.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has
decided against having U.S. Coast Guard ships help the Navy patrol
the Persian Gulf ``at this time,'' the Pentagon said Monday.
   The announcement came amid strong congressional opposition to
the idea on grounds the Coast Guard is needed at home to fight drug
smuggling and confirmed a disclosure hours earlier by Sen. John
Warner, R-Va.
   Warner, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee and a former Navy secretary, said he spoke with Carlucci
last week and urged that the proposal be dropped.
   ``He (Carlucci) said it was his current thinking that the guard
is not going,'' Warner said in a telephone interview from Norfolk,
Va.
   ``... The secretary of defense reached his decision on his own
initiative, but he did listen carefully to those of us in Congress,
including myself, and the leadership, who suggested that this would
not be the right time to take Coast Guard vessels from the United
States.''
   He said Carlucci ``is now of a mind to pull back from that
proposal because these vessels are needed to interdict the drug
trade. I don't believe the idea is going ahead.''
   Late Monday, the Pentagon issued a statement agreeing the idea
of deploying Coast Guard vessels was no longer under consideration
``at this time.''
   The statement said: ``After a thorough assessment during the
past week, it has been decided that the current strength and force
mix of our task force in the gulf is sufficient to protect U.S.
interests in the region and to defend against threats to the rights
of U.S.-flagged ships, as well as neutral ships in distress
requesting assistance in international waters of the gulf.''
   The idea of sending Coast Guard boats had been raised by
Pentagon officials in the past two weeks as part of a review of
U.S. policy in the gulf. That review came in the wake of the April
18 clash between the Navy and Iran, when Navy ships and planes sank
or damaged six Iranian ships.
   Administration officials announced Friday that U.S. policy in
the war-torn waterway was changing from the previous 10-month-old
plan of only having the Navy protect 11 Kuwaiti-owned tankers which
have been carrying the U.S. flag.
   Navy warships will now have authority to respond to calls for
aid from any neutral merchant ships which come under attack,
assuming the American vessels is close enough to help.
   Officially, the United States is neutral in the Iran-Iraq war,
but Kuwait has aided Iraq and critics of the U.S. policy say the
Reagan administration is tilting too far toward Iraq.
   Warner praised the policy change. ``I believe this new policy
may discourage Iranian attacks on neutral shipping because it will
inject an element of uncertainty as to their attacks on neutral
shipping,'' he explained.
   ``Iran only has two frigates left,'' along with a number of
smaller vessels, Warner said. ``They may be discouraged from using
their vessels in situations where they may lose those craft.''
   Pentagon officials said last month that consideration was being
given to sending up to a half-dozen of the Coast Guard's 110-foot
``Island'' class boats to the gulf. The ships were designed for
shallow waters and could help patrol the area, according to
Carlucci and other officials.
   But the proposal ran into heavy criticism on Capitol Hill, and
Carlucci's reversal prompted Reps. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., and Claude
Pepper, D-Fla., to scrap plans to push legislation barring use of
the Coast Guard ships.
   ``We would have won, we had the votes, but there's no need to go
through with it now,'' Lowry said. Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman
of the House Armed Services Committee, said, ``It was a non-starter
from the beginning and I'm glad Carlucci could understand that.
That idea was going nowhere.''
   Warner said he told Carlucci ``the Coast Guard is stretched thin
in this difficult mission of protecting against drugs and I don't
think anything should be done to hinder that mission. Interdiction
of drugs is a critical issue and the Coast Guard needs all its
resources.''
   The Navy now has 27 ships in the Persian Gulf and the nearby
Arabian Sea and ``there may be a few more smaller ships sent to the
area because the Coast Guard isn't going,'' said Warner.
   While Warner supported the new protection policy, Sen. Brock
Adams, D-Wash., was critical.
   ``I think this a further escalation in the gulf without
congressional authority,'' he said. ``I don't think we should do
it. This is a continuing ad hoc, step-by-step change in foreign
policy that's being done without congressional approval.''
   Adams wants the Senate to invoke the War Powers Act, the 1973
law that limits a president's right to send U.S. military personnel
to situations of ``imminent danger.'' Reagan has refused to invoke
the law, arguing that it is unconstitutional.
   ``I think we're getting in deeper in the gulf and the Congress
should assume its oversight role, something which we haven't
done,'' Adams said. ``We've sidestepped the issue.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said Pentagon officials had
explained the new U.S. policy to him, including the ``rules of
engagement'' under which American weapons will be fired.
   ``I just think they ought to be clarified (the rules of
engagement) and there ought to be a clear understanding among our
own people there as to what is expected,'' said Wright.

   Two bomb explosions wounded 16 people in
Barcelona early Monday and a separatist group claimed
responsibility.
   The first bomb went off outside a branch of the Banco Central in
this northeastern port city, shattering the bank's windows, at 2:05
a.m. (8:05 p.m. EDT Sunday), police said.
   They said that soon after authorities arrived, a second bomb
containing more than four pounds of shrapnel exploded in a garbage
can, hurting 16 people.
   A national policeman and a paramilitary civil guard were
hospitalized with serious leg injuries. The other 14 injured _ four
firemen and 10 civilians _ were treated for cuts.
   The organization Free Land, which wants independence for the
four-province region of Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the
capital, claimed responsibility for the explosions in a telephone
call to the local Avui newspaper.

<HEAD>Rebel Group Leader Would Establish Democracy in Namibia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a guerrilla group seeking to end
South Africa's rule in Namibia said Monday he intends to create a
democratic state with a non-aligned foreign policy.
   Sam Nujoma of the South-West Africa People's Organization, or
SWAPO, also said that if he attains power in Namibia he would
``destroy colonial institutions'' and replace them with programs to
provide health services and education to the African majority.
   ``The national policy would be geared to developing Namibia's
economy,'' Nujoma said at a Capitol Hill conference sponsored by
the World Council of Churches.
   Nujoma's vision of the kind of government SWAPO would run came
in response to questions about his supposed links to communist
groups.
   Nujoma, who has been fighting the war for Namibia's independence
for 22 years, acknowledged that his organization accepts assistance
from any group if ``the assistance is genuine.'' SWAPO has observer
status at the United Nations.
   Nujoma has his headquarters in Luanda, the capital of Angola,
which is backed by the Soviet and Cuban governments. An estimated
70,000 Namibian refugees live in Angola and neighboring Zambia.
   Nujoma described SWAPO as a ``national liberation movement,''
with many Christian members as well as a sprinkling of whites.
   If he is ever elected, he said he would ``create a democratic
state,'' recognizing the freedoms of speech and assembly. Turning
to those Namibians who have collaborated with the white South
African regime, Nujoma said, ``We will find a way of accommodating
them.''
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since after World War 1. In 1978,
the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution which
calls for the immediate withdrawal of South African troops from
Namibia and the holding of U.N.-sponsored elections. The South
Africans have refused to leave.
   Reagan administration officials have tried to broker a deal
whereby the Cuban troops leave Angola in exchange for South
Africa's withdrawal from Namibia, but that effort has not been
successful.

   President Reagan signed a Senate resolution
Monday deploring persecution by the Soviet government of religious
believers in the Ukraine.
   The resolution, approved by a voice vote, urges the United
States to refrain from participating in ceremonies in June marking
the millennium of Christianity in the Soviet Union if religious
persecution persists.
   The ceremonies mark the founding of Christianity in Kievan Rus',
an area now within the Ukraine, 1,000 years ago.
   The document also expresses congressional concern for Ukrainian
religious believers who are persecuted for attempting to worship.
   Last Friday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev condemned past
anti-religious repression and called for a more tolerate attitude
toward religion.

   Dutch police were reported stymied
on Monday in efforts to track down IRA attackers who killed three
British airmen, and a British anti-terrorist unit arrived to help
in the search.
   The Irish Republican Army raiders struck in closely coordinated
attacks on Sunday in the midst of a festive Dutch holiday.
   ``We have no indication as to the description (of the
attackers), nor indications of their escape route or their means of
escape,'' police spokesman Harry Clabbers told reporters at a
briefing in this southeastern Dutch city.
   Scotland Yard announced Monday night that an anti-terrorist
squad officer and an officer from the Special Branch, which deals
with national security matters, had come to the Netherlands at the
request of Dutch authorities.
   Earlier Monday, another Dutch police spokesman noted it was easy
to escape through porous Dutch borders, with little time needed to
get away to West Germany or Belgium.
   Three British air force men stationed in West Germany were
killed and three others injured in an early Sunday ambush at
Roermond and a car bomb attack in Nieuwbergen, 30 miles to the
north.
   The British Defense Ministry said the victims were unarmed and
off duty and were in the Netherlands over the weekend for
celebrations of the official 50th birthday of Dutch Queen Beatrix.
   On Sunday, the IRA claimed responsibility for both attacks in a
coded message to Belfast news media.
   In The Hague, police presence around the British Embassy was
reinforced but Dutch law enforcement officials refused to discuss
increased security measures.
   The feeling expressed in official British circles in the
Netherlands was that the IRA mounted the attacks in reprisal for
the March 6 killing by British soldiers of three IRA activists in
Gibraltar.
   Clabbers told reporters dozens of residents and bystanders were
questioned in Nieuwbergen and Roermond, ``but the information
yielded by those interviews is very meager.''
   He said forensic experts closely studied the attack sites on
Monday.
   Road signs and military radio stations meanwhile discouraged
British forces in West Germany from travel in or through the
Netherlands.
   About 70,000 British military are stationed in West Germany,
along with 80,000 dependents.

   A 16-year-old Arab was electrocuted while
climbing a power pole with a Palestinian flag in the West Bank and
the government on Monday closed an Arab weekly that it called a
tool for terrorists.
   In Lebanon, police said Israeli troops led by tanks and backed

of Palestinian guerrillas.
   An Israeli military communique said, ``The army is combing the
security zone because of increasing attempts to infiltrate into
Israel for purposes of murder and hostage-taking.
   The army censored all other details about the operation.
Israel's self-designated security zone is a six-to-10 mile wide
strip north of its border with Lebanon.
   Police in Beirut said initial reports from the area in the
western sector of Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley
indicated that at least three guerrillas were taken prisoner.
   The Israeli thrust came in the wake of increasing cross-border
guerrilla raids into northern Israel from southeast Lebanon in
recent weeks.
   In Israel, Lt. Col. Ranaan Gissin, a military spokesman, said
the army had opened a new detention center in Jerusalem for
Palestinians under age 16.
   Israeli military law in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
permits arrest and imprisonment of children aged 12-16. Gissin said
the youngest detainees in the new center were 14.
   ``We've concentrated the youngsters in one prison ... so they
won't be incited by older inmates,'' Gissin said.
   In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, 16-year-old Nidal Abdulhak of
Beit Wazan died Sunday night in Al Ittihad Hospital, the army said.
   Hospital officials quoted family members as saying he was
electrocuted while following orders from soldiers to remove a
Palestinian flag from the pole, but the army said Abdulhak
apparently was trying to hang the red, green, black and white
banner. Israel has outlawed the Palestinian flag.
   Abdulhak's death brought to at least 177 the number of
Palestinians killed since the rebellion began Dec. 8 in the West
Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle East
war. An Israeli soldier and Jewish settler also have been slain.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Monday he supports giving up
parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to form a Palestinian state
under Jordanian sovereignty in return for peace.
   ``I'm in favor of ... the establishment of two states, the state
of Israel as a Jewish state ... and east of it, a sovereign state
which has substantial portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
includes at least 1 million residents of the occupied territories
as a Jordanian-Palestinian state,'' Rabin said on Israel radio.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his conservative Likud bloc
opposes giving up the occupied lands.
   An Interior Ministry order shut down Al Awdah, a weekly based in
Arab east Jerusalem and published in English and Arabic.
   The order was delivered Monday to owner Ibrahim Kareen. He also
is publisher of the English-language Palestine Press Service, an
important source of information on the occupied territories. The
agency was closed March 30 for six months.
   Israel has closed two pro-Palestinian newspapers and the press
service during the five-month uprising and arrested at least 22
Israeli and Arab reporters. The army also has periodically barred
journalists from the occupied lands, contending that their presence
incites Arab protest.
   According to the shutdown order signed by Interior Ministry
official Eli Suissa, Al Awdah was ``funded by terror organizations,
serves as their tool and is directed by them.''
   Kareen said Al Awdah's funds came from subscribers. ``This was a
political decision,'' he said. ``Maltreatment of journalists has
become government policy.''
   He said the weekly, which was founded six years ago and has a
combined circulation of about 10,000 in English and Arabic, was the
first Palestinian publication to interview Israelis in an effort to
promote dialogue.
   ``Now the only relationship left is of occupied and occupier,''
Kareen said.
   The Supreme Court heard an appeal from Michal Schwartz, editor
of the left-wing newspaper Derech Hanitzotz. She was arrested last
week and has been denied the right to see her lawyer.
   Ms. Schwartz was one of three Israeli editors at the newspaper
arrested for alleged security offenses. The paper was closed in
February and accused of links to the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a Syrian-backed guerrilla faction led by
Naif Hawatmeh.
   Prosecutor Malhiel Ballas said Ms. Schwartz should not be
allowed to meet with her lawyer, Felicia Langer, because Ms. Langer
probably would leak details of the secret investigation.
   Israel radio quoted Ms. Langer, who often represents Palestinian
security prisoners, as saying she never has broken a commitment to
maintain secrecy.

   The U.N. secretary-general's mission to
North Africa failed at the outset Monday and he will end the trip
after visiting only one of three parties to a dispute over the
Western Sahara, a U.N. source reported.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar said he would return to New York from
Morocco without visiting Mauritania or Algeria.
   Algeria supports the Polisario independence movement, which has
fought Morocco for control of the the Western Sahara since Spain
withdrew from the phosphate-rich territory in November 1975.
   The secretary-general said he had to cut short the trip because
of ``quite a lot of problems in New York,'' but the U.N. source
said the mission foundered because of difficulties with the
Polisario. He would not provide details, and spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Perez de Cuellar had been scheduled to visit a major Polisario
base at Tindouf, Algeria, and meet with Chadli Bendjedid, Algeria's
president. He was also was scheduled to meet with officials in
Mauritania.
   He arrived in Rabat, Morocco on Monday for a meeting with King
Hassan II.
   There, he said he had changed his schedule and planned to see
the leaders of Algeria and Mauritania and the secretary-general of
the Polisario later this month during the Organization of African
Unity summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   His remarks in Rabat were made available to reporters at the
United Nations late Monday.
   Neither Morocco nor Algeria had indicated willingness to make
concessions in the 13-year dispute over the Western Sahara.
   After Spain left the territory, it was divided between Morocco
and Mauritania, which ceded its interest to Morocco in 1979.
   Official media in Morocco and Algeria had reiterated the
irreconcilable positions of their governments on the eve of Perez
de Cuellar's mission.
   Algiers radio repeated demands for Moroccan withdrawal from the
territory and direct negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario
as a preliminary to any referendum.
   Moroccan media restated Morocco's refusal either to withdraw or
negotiate with the Polisario, which it calls ``Algerian
mercenaries.''
   Since November 1975, Morocco has spent an estimated $1.5 million
a day defending the territory against Polisario attacks from
sanctuaries on the Algerian side of the unmarked border.
   Thousands of combatants have died on both sides of the
undeclared war. The 80,000 nomads who lived in the territory in
1975 have fled to Algeria or safe parts of the desert region.
   King Hassan has offered to conduct a U.N.-supervised referendum
among the inhabitants, on condition that his 120,000-man army is
not required to withdraw before the vote.

   A supporter of political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche took over as chairman of the nation's second-largest local
chapter of the Democratic Party Monday, but wary party officials
have made sure his power is limited.
   Harris County Democratic Chairman Claude Jones and the local
party agree on one thing: their top priority is electing a
Democratic president this fall. It remains to be seen if they can
find common ground elsewhere.
   ``My main goal over the next six months is to ensure Harris
County does not go to George Bush,'' Jones said. ``The Democratic
Party needs to pull together a very clear platform as an
alternative to the Reagan and Bush austerity.''
   But Jack Carter, who under new rules will run the party's
political operations as its secretary, emphasized that the party
won't deviate from Democratic orthodoxy.
   ``The 1988 Democratic platform will set the message we will be
electing candidates upon,'' Carter said. ``We will not not change
our platform to (Jones') goals _ he's going to have to move to us.''
   Jones stunned the party leadership by defeating Chairman Larry
Veselka by a margin of 51 percent to 49 percent in the March 8
election. Pundits said his victory stemmed in part from a game of
names: ``Jones'' was a more palatable choice for many voters than
``Veselka.''
   Jones works full time for LaRouche, a perennial,
ultra-conservative presidential candidate who has claimed that
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II is involved in drug trafficking and
has urged a quarantine of all AIDS patients.
   Three days after the election, the party's 34-member steering
committee changed the party bylaws to dilute the incoming
chairman's powers.
   The 664-member executive committee, comprised of precinct
chairmen, unanimously approved the changes April 15. A state judge
denied a request by Jones for a temporary restraining order to
thwart that vote.
   Harris County, which includes Houston, is the nation's
second-biggest election district after Illinois' Cook County, which
includes Chicago. Harris County will send more delegates to the
Democratic National Convention this summer than 17 entire states.
   Party officials say Jones' main duties will be accepting
applications and certifying candidates for the party's primaries.
Texas held its Democratic primary for the presidency and state and
local offices on March 8, Super Tuesday. The party does not have
another primary scheduled this year.
   Jones said he will work to broaden the party's voter base.
   ``I've already initiated a voter-registration drive _ we had
several set up around the city (over the weekend),'' Jones said.
``I personally signed up 40 new voters, and we have a goal of
100,000 new voters by the fall election.''
   Jones is to be formally sworn in Tuesday night.

   The virus that causes AIDS can invade the bone
marrow and infect cells there even when the virus cannot be
detected in blood samples, a National Institutes of Health
scientist said Monday.
   Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, a part of the NIH, said he and other
researchers found that the bone marrow, which is the body's
blood-making organ, can become a quiet haven for the deadly AIDS
virus.
   ``Our study shows that it (the bone marrow) can be a
reservoir,'' he said. ``It (the AIDS virus) can reside in the
marrow, but not be detected in the peripheral blood.''
   The finding adds to the types of cells in the body known to be
attacked by the virus that causes AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   In addition, the finding demonstrates just how challenging it
will be to develop an antiviral drug or vaccine to defeat the AIDS
virus, said Fauci. In order to effect a cure, some way will have to
be found to seek out and destroy the virus wherever it hides.
   ``It is going to be very difficult to eliminate each and every
viral particle in the body,'' said Fauci, because the virus takes
refuge in cell groups and apparently can live there in a latent
state for years without causing any clinical signs of infection.
   The virus, called the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, was
first thought to infect only T-lymphocyte cells that have a protein
on the cell surface called CD4. Researchers later learned that the
virus also could invade some brain cells and another type of blood
cell, the monocyte.
   Now, said Fauci, researchers have confirmed that the virus also
can reside in the cells of the bone marrow. This is important
because the bone marrow is the factory that makes the various types
of blood cells.
   In routine blood examinations, the test for AIDS involves a
search for antibodies to the virus since the virus itself often is
not found in the blood.
   Fauci said it is yet to be absolutely confirmed, but there is a
suggestion that the HIV lives in a type of bone marrow cell that is
the immature form of the monocyte. And unlike the T-lymphocyte, the
virus does not kill the bone marrow cell, but reproduces within the
cell.
   Researchers are still trying to understand what causes the
latent virus to suddenly start reproducing and become an active
infection after living in the body quietly for years. Fauci said
there is some suggestion that the triggering mechanism may be the
response of the immune system to other infections. This may start a
process that, in effect, turns on the virus.
   Fauci reported on the research during a lecture at a joint
meeting of three organizations of physicians and clinical
researchers.
   AIDS is a contagious, fatal disease that kills by attacking the
T-cell lymphocytes, a key part in the body's immune system. When
the T-cells are killed, the body is unable to protect itself
against disease and death usually results from opportunistic
infections.
   The AIDS virus most often is spread through close contact with
blood, blood products or semen from infected persons.
   As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500
Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000 have died since
June 1981, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. No
one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<TEXT>
   A long battle for custody of a 9-year-old girl
whose mother went to jail rather than disclose her whereabouts went
before a probate judge Monday in a private proceeding that court
officials said could take weeks.
   The highly publicized fight over Nicole LaLonde began three
years ago when 41-year-old Virginia LaLonde accused her ex-husband,
Stephen LaLonde, 37, of sexually abusing the child while he had
custody of her.
   A probate judge determined the charges were unfounded. Then, in
June 1986, Mrs. LaLonde went into hiding with Nicole rather than
obey a court order allowing unsupervised visits with the father.
   Mother and daughter eventually settled in Florida. But in March
1987, Mrs. LaLonde decided to return to Massachusetts to settle the
matter. When she did, she was thrown in jail and thrust into the
public spotlight.
   Mrs. LaLonde returned alone and refused to disclose her
daughter's whereabouts. Her silence drew a contempt-of-court
citation and an open-ended term in jail, where she remained until
October.
   Mrs. LaLonde was released after Nicole was discovered in Durham,
N.C. A babysitter there tipped police that the child was being
sheltered by an underground railroad of women who claim the courts
ignore claims that their husbands abused their children.
   The LaLonde fight persisted and made headlines until it headed
for the showdown in court.
   Suffolk County Probate Judge Mary C. Fitzpatrick has barred the
public from the proceedings, which are expected to last six weeks.
In addition, participants in the case and their lawyers are
forbidden to speak to reporters.
   An array of lawyers and medical experts are expected to testify,
but central to the case will be a medical and psychological
evaluation performed on Nicole last fall.
   As soon as the girl was brought back from North Carolina, the
state Department of Social Services took her into custody and
admitted her to Cambridge Hospital, where she stayed more than a
month as investigators tried to find out whether her mother's
charges were true.
   Although the resulting report was sealed by the court, excerpts
were leaked to the media alleging that doctors had found signs the
girl had been sexually abused. It also was disclosed that the
evaluators had recommended that Stephen LaLonde seek counseling.
   LaLonde had remained mute for six months while proclaiming his
innocence through his lawyer. When he briefly broke his silence, he
said said he was receiving psychotherapy. He has remarried.
   Meantime, Nicole has lived with a foster family since leaving
the hospital.

   A time bomb exploded Monday in the
eastern town of Batticaloa, wounding at least 10 people and
destroying a building, police reported.
   Police blamed the bombing on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, the most powerful Tamil group fighting the
Sinhalese-dominated government and military.
   The blast, 140 miles east of Colombo, wrecked a two-story
building that housed a Moslem-owned textile shop, said police chief
Gamini Seneviratne.
   Seven of the injured were hospitalized, he said.
   Sri Lankan military officials also blamed the Tigers for an
attack Sunday near Trincomalee. Twenty-six people, including two
little boys, were killed when buried explosives were detonated
under a bus in the port town 150 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Thirty others were injured, and 15 of them were reported in
critical condition.
   Most of the victims were Sinhalese, the majority ethnic group on
the island, said the officials.
   In a separate incident on Sunday, a member of Parliament, G.V.S.
De Silva, was shot to death when Sinhalese extremists ambushed his
car as he left a Buddhist sanctuary in the town of Galle, 70 miles
south of Colombo, police said.
   A police inspector, a driver and another civilian in de Silva's
car suffered gunshot wounds.
   The government blamed that attack on the People's Liberation
Front, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group accused of killing more
than 200 government officials and supporters.
   De Silva, who was wounded last August in a grenade attack on
Parliament, belonged to the governing United National Party.
   The People's Liberation Front has vowed to kill anyone who
supports a peace pact signed by the government and India last July.
The agreement grants some autonomy to minority Tamils.
   Sinhalese extremists say the treaty makes too many concessions
to the group.
   Tamil extremists have been fighting for a separate homeland for
four years in northern and eastern Sri Lanka and have refused to
surrender their arms under the terms of the peace accord.
   More than 50,000 Indians have been deployed to disarm the
rebels, who say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
while 75 percent of the population is Sinhalese.

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis,
responding to Jesse Jackson's assertion that he is a manager but
not a leader, said Monday he was ``not just a talker'' and had a
proven leadership record.
   He also fired anew at the apparent Republican nominee, George
Bush, saying he would continue to press the vice president to fully
explain his role in the Iran-Contra affair and the Reagan
administration's dealings with Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   ``This administration ... has broken the law,'' Dukakis said in
an interview with The Associated Press. ``I think the vice
president has to address the issue.''
   As Dukakis took the offensive against Bush, he was fending off
barbs by Jackson.
   On Sunday, Jackson repeated his contention that Dukakis would
``manage Reaganomics'' and said of his Democratic rival: ``Don't be
bragging about how clean the kitchen is, and cool. If the kitchen
is clean and cool, ain't nothing cooking.''
   Asked to respond Monday, Dukakis referred to his state's 2.9
percent unemployment rate, its anti-drug programs and the recent
passage of legislation guaranteeing all workers health care.
   ``That's a lot of fire and a lot of productivity,'' said
Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee. ``I'm not just a talker.
I'm a doer. There's no question about my record.''
   The Massachusetts governor, winding down his campaign for
Tuesday's presidential primary in Ohio, also courted black voters
and chided the Reagan admimistration for what he said was a failure
to provide adequate support for day care programs.
   Surrounded by a dozen black children at a nursery in a
Cincinnati high school, Dukakis called on President Reagan to
endorse a House-passed bill that would increase day care funding.
   ``This is the kind of thing we need,'' Dukakis said of the
in-school day care program. ``We need it as a matter of national
policy.''
   After singing a song with the children and reading them a story,
Dukakis walked across the street and visited a Greek restaurant. He
urged supporters to ignore polls showing him well ahead of Jackson
in Ohio, but he appeared relaxed and confident, taking time at the
Cincinnati airport to toss a football with aides.
   Dukakis headed from Cincinnati to Columbus, where he spoke to a
lunchtime crowd of several thousand people at an outdoor rally, and
was to stop in Cleveland and Parma before heading back to Boston.
   He said he was not criticizing Jackson.
   ``I'm just saying that I think the American people are looking
for somebody who not only has a very strong commitment to schools
and economic opportunity and decent housing and health care, but
also someone who has done these things,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis said the appearance at the predominantly black Hughes
High School was not designed to lure voters away from Jackson. But
campaign aides said the stop was part of an effort to broaden
Dukakis' support among blacks heading into the general election.
   Greeting Dukakis at school was Loretta Carter of Cincinnati, who
worked for one of Dukakis' gubernatorial campaigns when she was
living in Boston in the 1970s.
   Ms. Carter, who is black, predicted Dukakis would win
overwhelming support among blacks if he promised Jackson a key
campaign or administration post.
   ``I think he has to have an important role,'' Ms. Carter said of
Jackson. ``But I don't think as vice president. I think if he was
on the ticket we would lose.''
   Dukakis stuck to what has been the thrust of his campaign in
recent weeks, carefully avoiding sharp criticism of Jackson while
denouncing the Reagan administration.
   He said the federal trade and budget deficits had put the
nation's economy at risk.
   ``If you're serious about good jobs, about economic development,
then you've got to balance your books,'' Dukakis said.
   He continued to denounce Reagan's plans to veto the trade bill
passed by Congress and also renewed his criticism of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III.

   A federal court jury ended a week of

trial of mob boss Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno and 10 others.
   The jury requested more surveillance tapes presented as
prosecution evidence during the trial.
   Salerno, the previously convicted head of the Genovese organized
crime family, and the others are accused of a wide range of illegal
activities including extortion, rigging bids on multimillion dollar
construction contracts and a murder conspiracy.
   Salerno, 77, and various co-defendants are also accused of

   Pakistan summoned the Afghan charge
d'affaires Monday to protest cross-border air raids and shelling
last week that officials said killed 13 people and wounded 17.
   The government news agency APP said three Afghan fighter planes
bombed the Kurram area of northwest Pakistan last Tuesday, killing
four Afghan refugees and wounding three.
   It said Afghan artillery shelled the Khyber region farther north
two days later, killing eight refugees and a Pakistani child. It
said 11 Afghans and three Pakistanis were wounded.
   At least 3 million Afghan refugees live in border cities and
camps that serve as bases and supply points for Moslem rebels
fighting Afghanistan's Communist government and the 115,000 Soviet
soldiers aiding it.
   Under an agreement signed April 14 in Geneva, the Red Army is to
begin withdrawing May 15 and be out in nine months. Guerrillas
began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978 and say they
will continue the war.
   Official Kabul radio reported Monday night from Afghanistan that
guerrillas attacked a textile factory in the western city of Herat
``recently.'' It also reported ``a number of rockets'' seized in
the Bagrami section of Kabul.
   It gave neither dates nor details but referred to a ``satanic
plot of extremist opposition elements,'' a standard way of
describing the insurgents.

   President P.W. Botha repeated
the South African position Monday that Cuban troops must withdraw
from Angola before there can be peace in southern Africa.
   His comments in Parliament dampened prospects for a diplomatic
breakthrough on the Angolan civil war at a meeting set for Tuesday
and Wednesday in Britain. It involves Angola, Cuba, the United
States and South Africa.
   Cuba has more than 40,000 troops in Angola supporting the
Marxist government. South Africa and the United States back the
pro-Western rebels of UNITA, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
   ``I want to warn against being too over-optimistic because there
are ... major mischief makers all over the world who want to
destroy every positive effort to bring about better conditions in
southern Africa,'' Botha said. ``The moment the Cubans leave that
part of southern Africa and it is safe, then South Africa's forces
will leave too.''
   Angola claims South Africa has 9,000 soldiers with heavy
artillery in southern Angola. South Africa acknowledges having
forces there but says the number has not exceeded 3,000 at any time
in the past year.
   South Africa is fighting a bush war in South-West Africa, which
it controls against the wishes of the United Nations, with the
South-West Africa People's Organization. The guerrilla group, known
as SWAPO, operates from bases in southern Angola.
   When the London talks begin, it will be the first time
delegations from the United States, South Africa, Cuba and Angola
have met at the same table to discuss plans for peace in the
region. The future of South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, is
expected to be included in the negotiations.
   The United States and South Africa want a timetable for
withdrawal of Cuban troops. Angola and the Soviet Union, its other
main ally, insist that South Africa withdraw from Namibia as
demanded in a 1966 U.N. resolution so the territory can become
independent.
   Previous efforts at a settlement have stalled, in part because
of U.S. support for South Africa's demand that Cuban troops leave
Angola before the South Africans leave Namibia.
   Botha said Monday that South Africa would like to see Namibia
``progress toward independence, but we cannot afford to allow
foreign troops in the region dictate how'' it is achieved.

   Three cases of Legionnaires' disease have been
confirmed among people who worked in or near British Broadcasting
Corp. buildings, and 13 more cases are suspected, the BBC said
Monday.
   Two of the confirmed cases involve a BBC doorman and a BBC
workman. A total of nine BBC employees have the disease or are
suspected of having it.
   No information was available about the other victims.
   Health officials checked and disinfected air conditioning
systems in the main Broadcasting House in central London. They also
were checking a BBC building on nearby Duchess Street and any other
possible sources of infection.
   Legionnaires' disease produces symptoms similar to pneumonia and
is often caused by bacteria from water-cooled air conditioning
units.
   The disease takes its name from the July 1976 outbreak at the
Pennsylvania American Legion convention in Philadelphia, where 221
people contracted it and 34 died.
   American doctors say Legionnaires' disease has proved fatal in
about 15 percent of cases.
   The disease has killed almost 200 people in Britain since 1979,
Independent Television News reported.

   Authorities clamped an indefinite
curfew on western Karachi Monday after the army moved in to quell
three days of ethnic violence that left at least five people dead
and 50 injured, police said.
   Local newspapers put the death toll at seven.
   Fighting between Mohajirs and rival Pathans began late Friday
after a traffic accident.
   Mohajirs are Moslems who emigrated from India after its
partition in 1947. The Pathans, who trace their roots to northern
Pakistan, consider themselves natives although they now live in
Pakistan's southernmost city.
   Police restored calm on Saturday but violence broke out again on
Sunday as residents celebrated May Day.
   Troops moved in to help police, and the district was reported
calm Monday.
   The violence centered in Orangi Township, where Mohajirs are
surrounded by Pathan neighborhoods.
   Battles between the two groups in 1986 killed hundreds of people.

<DATELINE>PERTH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inmates freed a guard they held for 17
hours and gave up control of the largest cell block Monday, ending
the eighth serious disturbance at Perth prison in less than two
years.
   The government's Scottish Office said guard Tom Mortimer, 25,
appeared to be well. He was held in C hall, the largest cellblock,
where about 100 inmates barricaded themselves inside.
   Soon after his release, a fire engine went into the prison to
put out a small fire, the office said. It announced two hours after
Mortimer's release that the 100 inmates had surrendered a few at a
time.
   ``There has been some damage to C hall, how much remains to be
quantified,'' said a spokesman, who in keeping with British
practice was not identified by name.
   How many of the 100 inmates were directly involved in the
hostage-taking was not known, the spokesman said.
   During the siege, convicts had waved a guard's cap from a window
and set fire to pieces of what looked like a guard's clothing.
   Mortimer was seized Sunday. Soon afterward banners were hung
from a window protesting about the legal system. Guards said
prisoners also wanted an investigation of conditions, a better
chance at parole and segregation of young prisoners and those
awaiting trial.
   Perth prison now holds 449 men, 11 over capacity, but the
population has gone as high as 600 in recent months.
   Protests at Perth since August 1986 include the burning of an
entire cellblock; holding of a rooftop by three inmates for 41
hours, ended by an assault squad of six guards; a hunger strike,
and destruction of cell furniture.
   Other protests at Scottish prisons have occurred in Edinburgh,
Peterhead and Glasgow.
   Most British prisons were built in Victorian times and are
notoriously overcrowded and unsanitary.
   About 51,000 people are imprisoned in Britain, almost 20 percent
above capacity and the highest proportion of population in the
12-nation European Economic Community. About 19,000 prisoners are
held two and three to cells designed for one.

<HEAD>U.S. Military Team Heading To Laos For MIA Search</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. military team is to fly to Laos
on Tuesday to search for the remains of missing Americans at the
site where an aircraft was shot down more than 22 years ago,
officials said.
   It is the third Laos-U.S. excavation of an American warplane
crash site.
   Ross Petzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said
Monday that 15 military specialists are to fly from Bangkok to
Savannakhet city in the southern panhandle area of Laos. The crash
site is 95 miles east of Savannkhet.
   Excavation is expected to take about a week, he said.
   The experts are from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center
and the Army Central Identification Laboratory, both Honolulu-based
agencies entrusted with resolving the fates of Americans missing in
action from the Vietnam War.
   They will be working with officials of Laos' Defense and Foreign
ministries, Petzing said.
   A total of 555 Americans are missing in Laos. The remains of 19
missing Americans were recovered during joint excavations in that
communist country in 1985 and 1986, said Maj. Tim Pfister, a
spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command.
   The U.S. team is looking for the remains of two American airmen
whose OV-1A Mohawk aircraft was downed by heavy ground fire while
on a reconnaissance mission on March 15, 1966, Pfister said.
   Pfister said another U.S. aircraft on the mission reported that
one of the crewmen of the stricken Mohawk parachuted out before the
plane crashed.
   U.S. military experts said they saw no trace of remains during a
preliminary inspection of the wreckage last week. The aircraft
manufacturer confirmed the wreckage was an OV-1A Mohawk, Petzing
said.
   A number of U.S. planes were shot down in eastern Laos while on
missions aimed at blocking the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which the North
Vietnamese communists used to infiltrate men and supplies into
U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
   Laos agreed in August last year to accelerate progress on the
MIA issue while the United States pledged to respond to its calls
for humanitarian assistance.

   Nearly one-quarter of the boys and
one-sixth of the girls responding to a survey on rape said it was
acceptable for a man to force a woman to have sex with him if he
has spent money on her.
   The survey was taken by 1,700 sixth- to ninth-graders who
attended the Rhode Island Rape Crisis Center's assault awareness
program at schools across the state.
   ``I didn't believe it,'' Jacqueline Jackson Kikuchi, the center
staff member who conducted the poll, said of the results. She
presented the findings Friday at the National Symposium on Child
Victimization in Anaheim, Calif.
   Kukuchi said she was most surprised by the students' answers on
whether it would be acceptable for a man to rape a woman if he had
dated her for a long time or spent money on her.
   ``Basically, the kids were very much into blaming the victim of
the sexual assault,'' she said.
   Among the findings:
   _ 50 percent of the students said a woman who walks alone at
night and dresses seductively is asking to be raped.
   _ 51 percent of the boys and 41 percent of the girls said a man
has the right to force a woman to kiss him if he has spent ``a lot
of money'' on her. The quantity of money was defined by
12-year-olds as $10 to $15.
   _ Among students in grades 7 through nine, 24 percent of the
boys and 16 percent of the girls said it was acceptable for a man
to force a woman to have sex with him if he has spent money on her.
   _ 65 percent of the boys and 47 percent of the girls in seventh
through ninth grades said it is acceptable for a man to force a
woman to have sex if they have been dating for more than six months.
   _ 87 percent of the boys and 79 percent of the girls said rape
is OK if a couple were married.
   ``So many of our kids have attitudes that sexual abuse is OK,''
Kikuchi said.
   The types of attitudes evidenced in the survey probably lead to
date rape and other forms of sexual assault, she said.
   Twenty percent of the girls and 6 percent of the boys taking the
survey said they had been sexually abused.
   Thirty-one percent of the boys and 32 percent of the girls said
it would not be improper for a man to rape a woman who has had
previous sexual experiences.
   Kikuchi conducted the survey from February to December 1987,
when she gave workshops to students at public and private schools
as coordinator of the center's assault awareness program.
   The workshops have been successful in changing some attitudes,
Kikuchi said. After the seminars, she said, less than 25 percent of
the participants think rape or forced kissing is appropriate in any
situation.

<HEAD>Storm Brings Snow to Colorado, Wyoming; High Winds over Plains,
Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful storm covered parts of Colorado and Wyoming Monday
with up to a foot of snow and sent strong winds gusting through
much of the Rockies and Great Plains.
   The storm, centered over southwestern Kansas, brought rain to
much of the Plains region, with thunderstorms hitting central and
western Kansas and central Nebraska.
   Six to 12 inches fell in the Palmer Lake area north of Colorado
Springs, Colo., and up to 11 inches was reported at Jelm, Wyo.
Denver reported 2 inches of snow.
   Parts of the Black Hills on the western edge of South Dakota
also received up to 8 inches of snow.
   A snow advisory was in effect for southeast Wyoming, with up to
three inches expected, and a warning for high winds and blowing
snow was in effect for southeast Colorado.
   Winds gusted to 83 mph at La Junta, Colo. and to 64 mph at
Colorado Springs. A tornado touched down in extreme southeastern
Colorado but did no damage.
   High winds prevailed from Texas to the Dakotas. Amarillo and
Lubbock, Texas, both reported wind gusts of around 45 mph. A high
wind advisory was issued for mountain passes in western Texas and
southern New Mexico.
   Winds gusted to 49 mph at Williston, N.D. and at Rapid City, S.D.
   Rain fell throughout the Great Plains, with about three-quarters
of an inch recorded in Broken Bow and North Platte in central
Nebraska in the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Rain also fell in western Washington and Oregon, with snow in
mountain regions. A snow advisory was in effect for the Cascades in
Oregon, with 4 to 8 inches of new snow expected.
   Patchy, light rain hit the North Atlantic coast, with some heavy
showers and hail in eastern New York State.
   Sunshine prevailed over a wide region stretching from the Gulf
Coast to the Great Lakes. Temperatures rose to the 70s over the
Great Lakes and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, and into the
mid-80s in Gulf Coast states.
   Boise, Idaho, had a record low for the date of 23 degrees and
Winnemucca, Nev., tied a record with 19. The nation's low was 10
degrees at Yellowstone and Jackson, Wyo.
   Freeze warnings were issued for the central and northwest
valleys of New Mexico, and for southeast Arizona above 4,000 feet.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 29 degrees at
Yellowstone, Wyo. to 85 degrees at Sarasota, Fla.; Meridian Naval
Air Station, Miss.; and Laredo, Texas.
   On Tuesday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast to extend
from Arkansas across the central Plains to portions of North Dakota
and western Minnesota. Rain and snow showers were forecast to
linger over the northern and central Rockies and the extreme
western parts of Nebraska and South Dakota. Showers were predicted
from western Idaho to the northern Pacific Coast.
   Highs in the 40s and 50s were forecast for western portions of
the northern and central Plains, the northern and central Rockies,
the northern Plateau and the Pacific Northwest. Highs were
predicted to be in the 50s in New York State and New England, 80s
from Florida and the Gulf Coast to most of Texas and the Southwest
deserts. The rest of the nation was forecast to have highs in the
60s and 70s.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa proclaimed a strike Monday at
the huge Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, where Solidarity was born in
1980, in a major escalation of the weeklong labor turmoil in
communist Poland.
   It was the fourth strike in Poland in a week, the worst wave of
labor unrest since the government's December 1981 military
crackdown on Solidarity.
   The news heartened steelworkers in southern Poland, who no
longer were the country's only workers still on strike.
   ``We feel better now,'' said Jan Ciesielski, a member of the
steel strike committee.
   Authorities were reported mounting a nationwide roundup of
regional leaders of Solidarity.
   A Solidarity communique signed by Walesa and issued late Monday
said, ``A strike wave is covering the country. They are not just
local conflicts. They are across Poland because the cause is the
economic crisis and the lack of convincing reform policies that
would offer prospects for the future.''
   Workers want pay raises of 50-60 percent to balance prices,
which have risen 42 percent this year because of reductions in
subsidies by the Communist government.
   Walesa, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, still works as an
electrician at the Baltic coast Lenin yard employing 12,000
workers. He did not launch the strike but addressed strikers later
and announced his support, according to various activists.
   Walesa led the 1980 work stoppage at Gdansk which shook the
communist government to its roots and gave rise to Solidarity, the
first independent trade union federation in the Soviet bloc.
Solidarity was suppressed and outlawed under martial law.
   Monday evening, Solidarity's chaplain, the Rev. Henryk
Jankowski, presided in the shipyard at a prayer service attended by
Walesa, a newly formed strike committee and hundreds of workers.
   About 3,000 workers were occupying the yard late Monday, enough
to shut down operations, said Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron. The
shipyard has a payroll of 12,000 workers.
   The government press office in Warsaw at first confirmed the
strike. But on Monday evening government spokesman Jerzy Urban
called The Associated Press and said there was only a rally by
several hundred people at the shipyard.
   ``It would be rather difficult for me to say the entire shipyard
is working in that atmosphere but, generally speaking, the shipyard
is working,'' he said. Kuron said police arrested nine regional
representatives on the 13-member Solidarity National Executive
Commission. Two commission members, including Walesa, were free and
whereabouts of two more were a mystery, he said.
   Union activists said the Gdansk strike began with a march around
the shipyard by dozens of workers after a breakfast break. The
march grew to 200 people and ended at the main gate.
   There, while shifts were changing at 2 p.m., the Solidarity
activists encouraged workers to strike, union supporters said.
   ``The strike action ... undoubtedly is in response to Lech
Walesa's call (on Sunday) for protest actions in support of the
striking Nowa Huta steelworkers,'' said Joanna Wojciechowicz, a
Solidarity activist in Gdansk.
   The workers formed a strike committee led by Alojzy Szablewski,
said a spokesman at St. Brygida's Church, a Solidarity stronghold
near the shipyard.
   Management agreed to talk to the strike committee Tuesday, Kuron
said.
   Walesa, chairman of the outlawed but still active labor
federation, said through spokesmen he stayed off the strike
committee to coordinate Solidarity activities nationwide.
   The strike by thousands of steelworkers at the Lenin steel works
in Nowa Huta outside Krakow entered its eighth day Tuesday.
   Poland's latest labor trouble began April 25 with a wildcat
action by transit workers in Bydgoszcz. It was settled the same day
with pay raises of at least 50 percent.
   Thousands of workers at the Stalowa Wola heavy machinery plant
in southeast Poland struck on Friday and ended the action Saturday
after promises of higher pay.
   About half the 3,500 workers at the Dolmel electronics plant in
Wroclaw, southwestern Poland, stopped work from about 10 a.m.
Monday to the end of the shift at 2 p.m., government and opposition
spokesmen reported. Jozef Pinior, a Solidarity leader, said it
ended when management promised a raise.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman urged
the Polish government to negotiate with workers and declared, ``The
use of force ... cannot contribute to national reconciliation.''
   Police surrounded the Gdansk shipyard and checked the papers of
people approaching the gates, a witness said.
   Banners declaring ``Sit-In Strike'' and ``Gdansk Shipyard on
Strike'' were draped on the main gate.
   Police detained Bogdan Lis, a Gdansk Solidarity leader, in
nearby Sopot, said Jankowski, the Solidarity chaplain.
   According to Andrzej Gwiazda, a Solidarity leader, the shipyard
strikers demand minimum pay of 60,000 zlotys a month ($150),
reinstatement of fired union activists, amnesty for strikers and
recognition of a local Solidarity chapter.
   Average monthly pay now is about 45,000 zlotys ($112).
   In August 1980, employees of one department of the Lenin
shipyard stopped work to protest the dismissal of Anna
Walentynowicz, a crane operator and activist in the free-union
movement.
   Walesa, a little-known union organizer who also had been
dismissed, vaulted the shipyard fence and took charge of the strike.
   In two dramatic weeks, the workers won guarantees for the first
independent union in the Soviet bloc and broad social political
concessions.
   Solidarity claimed 10 million members at its height.

   A storm dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the Rockies,
closing schools and highways Monday, and its powerful wind blew up
dust storms that cut down young crops and contributed to two
traffic deaths.
   ``Dust was blowing so it covered everything like a film of oil.
You couldn't see in front of your face,'' said Colorado State
Patrol Trooper James E. Price.
   The storm also contributed to weekend wind in Southern
California that left one boater dead and another missing and
believed drowned.
   The weather system rolled onto the Plains on Monday, spreading
locally heavy rain and thunderstorms ahead of itself, and it also
kicked out a funnel cloud over southeastern Colorado that
dissipated without causing damage.
   Interstate 80 in Wyoming was closed Monday morning from Laramie
west to Walcott Junction, then was reopened about five hours later.
But police later closed U.S. 287 south out of Laramie because of
poor conditions and a series of minor accidents that clogged the
highway.
   Wind gusting to 40 mph created blizzard conditions around
Cheyenne, parts of which had no power during the morning. The wind
combined with temperatures in the 20s across most of Wyoming to
drive the wind chill factor to 2 degrees below zero, the weather
service said.
   Schools in Cheyenne were closed and workers in federal offices
there were told to follow their department's bad weather plan.
State government workers living in rural areas were told their pay
would not be docked if they chose not to drive into Cheyenne, said
Dennis Curran, spokesman for Gov. Mike Sullivan.
   The Colorado State Patrol closed a 70-mile section of Interstate
70 from just east of Aurora to Limon in both directions Monday
morning because of numerous accidents, heavy snow and poor
visibility.
   That section of I-70 was closed for more than two hours Sunday
because of zero visibility when 50 mph wind caused a dust storm.
Two major pileups on the highway killed two people and injured 17,
officials said.
   A 17-mile stretch of I-70 from Goodland, Kan., to Colorado also
was closed Monday afternoon at the request of the Kansas State
Patrol, which said stranded motorists had filled every hotel along
that portion of the highway.
   The storm also caused some school closures Monday in eastern
Colorado. At Denver's Stapleton International Airport, flights were
delayed up to 1{ hours because of poor visibility, said airport
spokesman Richard Boulware. He said only 33 planes were able to
land every hour, down from the usual 75.
   Strong northerly wind blew across eastern Colorado with gusts
Monday of up to 83 mph at La Junta and 64 mph at Colorado Springs.
   The storm left up to 14 inches of snow in the mountains and
foothills of south-central Montana, with up to a foot of snow in
the mountains of northern Colorado. Snow also fell in western South
Dakota, with 4 inches on the ground in the Black Hills.
   Eight inches of snow fell in northwestern Wyoming, closing
Yellowstone's eastern and southern entrances Sunday. South of the
park, 5 inches of snow was reported in Moose and Jackson, where
downed power lines caused blackouts.
   Heavy rain fell in advance of the snow, with 2.25 inches in 24
hours at Alliance, Neb., and 1.86 inches at Rapid City, S.D., the
weather service reported. Half-inch hail stones fell at Sidney and
Alliance, Neb.
   Rain also fell over most of western Kansas and wind gusted above
30 mph at Dodge City and Russell.
   High wind blew across the northern Plains, with gusts exceeding
50 mph reported throughout the Dakotas.
   The wind whipped loose topsoil into a dust storm around
Aberdeen, S.D., forcing some drivers to turn on their headlights in
the middle of the day Sunday. Farmer Harry Pharis Jr. of rural
Groton said about 30 acres of newly sprouted barley was cut down by
the wind and blowing grit.
   Winds gusting to nearly 40 mph in Tulsa about noon Monday tore
down at least five power lines and interrupted electrical service
to about 1,700 customers, said Public Service Co. of Oklahoma
spokeswoman Nancy Harlow.
   The difference in pressure between the storm and a high-pressure
front off the West Coast generated 65 mph wind Saturday in southern
California, whipping up waves that destroyed a municipal pier in
Redondo Beach and stranded 1,400 tourists overnight on Santa
Catalina Island.
   The body of a man believed to have jumped from a disabled boat
washed ashore Sunday, said Los Angeles County Lifeguard Sgt. Tom
Hargett. Another man knocked off a boat Saturday near Catalina was
missing and believed drowned, said Coast Guard Petty Officer
Charles Embleton.

   A two-week sit-in at a Wesleyan
University administration building ended Monday after 110 students
were arrested for blocking entrances to protest the school's
investments in companies doing business in South Africa.
   Middletown police put students on three buses to take them away
from the building that houses the office of university President
Colin Campbell about six hours after the blockade began. None
resisted arrest.
   ``The blockade was obviously an escalation,'' said Bobby Wayne
Clark, a university spokesman.
   The students were charged with creating a public disturbance and
were all released on their own recognizance, police said.
   Police intervention was sought only after the administration
tried but failed to resolve the conflict internally, putting the
issue before the Student Judiciary Board, Clark said.
   The student board concluded that the protesters' actions had
``crossed the line of tolerability'' and had become ``an invasion
of the rights of other individuals to free access to a university
facility.''
   Clark said, however, that it was likely the cases against the
students would be resolved within the university and that the
charges would not be prosecuted.
   The protest Monday marked the second time in the last four years
that there has been a mass arrest of students at Wesleyan over the
school's investment policies.
   A spokesman for the protesters said they were dissatisfied with
Campbell's response to their demands. ``In all of his statements he
has barely even begun to acknowledge that we are here,'' said John
Stamm, a senior from Boston.
   The anti-apartheid protesters had been peacefully conducting a
sit-in to protest the private liberal arts college's investment
policies. The school has about $10.3 million of its $240 million
endowment invested in companies that conduct some form of business
in South Africa.
   The students, members of the Divest Now coalition of groups
opposed to South Africa's racist policies, decided to take a more
militant approach Sunday after the school failed to meet their
divestment demands.
   The coalition demanded that the university trustees' Social
Implications Subcommittee open its process to include student
representatives; that the subcommittee recommend total divestment
in a final report by May 8; and that the trustees hold a special
meeting to vote for total divestment before the end of the school
term. Classes end Wednesday and exams end May 17.
   But Campbell told the students Sunday that the subcommittee
would continue to meet privately. He promised that it would open
its meeting on campus Tuesday for about an hour to student
representatives.

<HEAD>Dalkon Shield Claimants Representatives Differ on Robins
Reorganization Plan</HEAD>

   Some representatives of former Dalkon Shield
users urged rejection Monday of the latest reorganization plan
involving A.H. Robins, manufacturer of the defective contraceptive
device that injured thousands of women.
   ``After an agonizing decision-making and education process, we
have found that the plan is unfair, inadequate and contrary to the
law,'' Karen Hicks, founder of the Dalkon Shield Information
Network, told a news conference.
   However, another representative of the victims, Atlanta-based
attorney Guerry R. Thornton Jr., said the plan offered the best
deal yet for the more than 196,000 women harmed by the intrauterine
device.
   The $3.2 billion reorganization plan _ the sixth plan developed
since Robins filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1985 _ is part of
the Manhattan-based American Home Products Corp.'s agreement to
take over the beleaguered company. The $3.2 billion plan includes
$2.3 billion to be put in a trust fund for the victims.
   The plan was presented in a mailing last week to all claimants
against Robins, including the 196,000 former Dalkon Shield users
who have injury claims pending against Robins as well as banks and
stockholders.
   All claimants are to mail in ballots by July 11, with the final
resolution of the case scheduled for July 18.
   In order for the plan to be approved under an arrangement set up
in March by U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr., at least
two-thirds of the voters in each class of creditors must vote
``yes.''
   Hicks said the court-designated Dalkon Shield committee assigned
to represent the women who had used the device estimated that
claims against the manufacturer would range from $4.2 billion to $7
billion.
   She contended that under the reorganization plan, stockholders
and other creditors would immediately be paid 100 cents on the
dollar but that women filing claims against the company may receive
only 35 cents to 50 cents on the dollar after administrative costs
have been deducted. The plan also gives the fund until the year
2008 to pay the women.
   ``The claimants are carrying the entire burden of all the
unknowns in this case. We're being treated unfairly relative to
other people,'' Hicks said.
   A.H. Robins spokesman Rosco Puckett said the company was
satisfied with the plan which ``provides full funding for the
amount of money the court has announced as needed for compensation
and related administrative costs. This is a plan of consensus which
was endorsed by all executive committees.''
   ``The (Dalkon Shield) committee fought us tooth and nail for all
32 months, and they believe this is adequate ... it provides the
full amount of money to satisfy the court,'' he said.
   Hicks said that if the funds prove to be inadequate, the former
users have no legal recourse to sue the manufacturer or Aetna
Casualty & Surety Co., the company that insured Robins.
   She contended that the plan violates bankruptcy law requiring
that priority be given to settling claims, like those of the former
Dalkon Shield users, before any stockholders are paid.
   Thornton, who has been campaigning actively for adoption of the
settlement, said Hicks was right about the law, but he said the
courts would uphold the arrangement because the judge found that it
was fair.
   If approved, the award, plus interest and approximately $300
million from Aetna brings the total to $2.7 billion _ a figure
Thornton said the victims couldn't get if they sold all of Robins'
property on the open market.
   The Aetna funds come from cash payment in the bankruptcy suit
and another $75 million settlement from a separate class action
suit alleging the company had conspired with Robins to withhold
information about the Dalkon Shield, Thornton said.
   ``For some people, understandably, you could get the U.S. gross
national product, have A.H. Robins behind bars and that would not
be enough,'' Thornton said.
   Thornton said it would take another three or four years to match
the offer from American Home and said many of his clients were
``nearing the end of their childbearing years and desperately
needed the money to finance infertility treatments. They just don't
have the time it would take to get this again.''

<HEAD>Says His Brother Would Have Backed McNamara for President</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President John F. Kennedy would have supported
his defense secretary, Robert McNamara, to succeed him in order to
keep Lyndon Johnson out of the White House, Robert Kennedy told
interviewers.
   The disclosure is contained in ``Robert Kennedy: In His Own
Words,'' a book based on heretofore unpublished interviews Kennedy
gave between 1964 and 1967. Excerpts appear in the current Newsweek
magazine. The book is scheduled for release in June, marking the
20th anniversary of Robert Kennedy's assassination.
   In the excerpts, Robert Kennedy is quoted as saying that his
brother ``thought of trying to move in the direction that would get
the nomination for McNamara.'' He said the president thought the
country ``should be placed in the best possible hands. And we
thought that McNamara was that individual.''
   Speaking of Johnson, Robert Kennedy said: ``In every
conversation I have with him he lies. ... He lies even when he
doesn't have to.''
   Kennedy, who remained as attorney general a short while after
his brother was assassinated in 1963, described Johnson as ``mean,
bitter, vicious _ an animal in many ways.''
   ``I think his reaction on a lot of things is correct, but I
think he's got this other side of him in his relationship with
human beings which makes it very difficult, unless you want to kiss
his behind all the time. That's what Bob McNamara suggested to me a
couple of weeks ago, if I wanted to get along. No, I can't do
that.''
   Kennedy also said Johnson remarked to Pierre Salinger, then the
presidential press secretary, that the slaying of the president
``was retribution for his participation in the assassinations'' of
the one-time leaders of the Dominican Republic and South Vietnam.
Elsewhere in the interviews, Kennedy asserts that his brother
opposed those assassinations.
   After quitting the Cabinet, Kennedy won election to the Senate
from New York and in 1968 was pursuing the presidential nomination
after Johnson decided not to seek re-election.
   Salinger told Newsweek that Sen. Eugene McCarthy tried to come
to Robert Kennedy's bedside just after he was fatally shot, but
Salinger headed him off. He said McCarthy, around whom dump-Johnson
sentiment had first coalesced, told him: ``What we should do now is
create a coalition and go back to Lyndon Johnson, tell him to run _
and we'll all support him.''
   The interviews were given as part of an oral history program for
the John F. Kennedy Library.

<HEAD>Salvador's Legislature Paralyzed By Vote Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party's
presidential candidate on Monday appealed to the rightist
opposition to help resolve a crisis that has split the legislature.
   ``There is either going to be consensus or permanent impasse for
three years. And the country cannot withstand impasse,'' Adolfo Rey
Prendes, nominated at the Christian Democrats' convention on
Friday, told a news conference.
   The crisis stems from a dispute over which party controls one
seat in the 60-seat National Assembly, the unicameral legislature
that was elected March 20.
   The right-wing Republican National Alliance, or Arena, claims it
won 31 seats during the election and that the Christian Democrats,
who had previously held a majority, stole a seat through electoral
fraud. The Christian Democrats deny the charge.
   Arena has appealed the final vote count for the disputed seat to
the Supreme Court, but it was uncertain when the court would rule.
The rightists maintain that, for the moment, the Assembly has 59
members.
   The legislature was to have been inaugurated Sunday for a
three-year term. The 30 Arena deputies showed up and declared
congress in session.
   But the 30 other deputies _ 23 for the Christian Democrats and
seven for the National Conciliation Party _ gathered in another
room and held their own session.
   The Christian Democrats claimed the legislature no longer exists
because the constitution says that ``half plus one'' of the
Assembly's 60 members must be on hand for it to be installed or to
act.
   ``As of today, there is no national legislature,'' Rey Prendes
said.
   But Alfredo Cristiani, president of Arena, said only a majority
of the elected deputies is needed to install the congress. He said
his party has that majority in a 59-member Assembly.
   Rey Prendes said he believes the politicians can work things out.
   ``This kind of confrontation serves no one's purposes except
those of the guerrillas, who sit calmly in the mountains watching
us destroy each other,'' he said.
   Leftist rebels have been fighting the U.S.-supported government
since 1980.
   Arena exhibited its growing power with the upset in the
legislative elections. The Christian Democrats had 33 seats in the
previous National Assembly.
   Leftist guerrillas ordered vehicles to stay off El Salvador's
roads for an indefinite period beginning Tuesday. The transport
ban, the third called this year, was announced Monday on the
rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos.
   Previous transport bans were enforced by rebels who burned the
vehicles of violators.
   The rebels said the measure was in response to an increase in
repression by the armed forces and police.

<HEAD>Strikes End Following Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A two-week national strike over gasoline
price increases ended Monday after negotiations between government
and unions, the Labor Ministry said. The strikes had paralyzed
medical and banking services.
   After talks with eight union leaders, the government agreed to
labor's main demand that four detained union leaders be freed,
Labor Minister Aboubacar Umar said in a statement. He made no
mention of a second union demand that there be no further gasoline
price increases.
   There was no immediate comment from union leaders, nor were the
names of those being released immediately made available.
   Umar acknowledged that the rising cost of living in Nigeria,
Africa's most populous nation with an estimated 100 million people,
was a sensitive issue among workers.
   Student protests began in the north-central city of Jos on April
11, the day after the government increased gasoline prices by 3
percent. Demonstrations turned violent April 13 when thousands of
university students and Jos residents clashed with police, with six
people killed.
   The unrest quickly spread to other campuses around Nigeria and
labor unions joined the protest in defiance of government threats.
   The government raised the price of gasoline and diesel fuel in
what was expected to be the first of a series of increases. The
action followed World Bank and International Monetary Fund
recommendations to make gasoline prices higher to help reduce
Nigeria's $1.5 billion budget deficit.
   Many Nigerians have considered low gasoline prices as their
right since the boom days for oil-exporter Nigeria in the
mid-1970s. Even with the increases gas sells for about 40 cents a
gallon.
   The News Agency of Nigeria has reported the government was
holding many union officials, including the chairman of the Joint
Committee for Industrial Unions and the assistant secretary of the
National Association of Nurses and Midwives.
   Last week the news agency reported the president and
secretary-general of the National Railwaymen's Union were arrested,
though rail workers did not join the strike.
   The news agency said 11 union leaders in Kano were released on
bail Friday. A judge said they could get three years in prison if
convicted of taking part in walkouts. The government dismissed
thousands of civil servants in the strikes called April 19
involving banks, government and medical services.

   The network quoted unidentified sources as saying the scheduling

the astrologer had indicated another time would be better.
   Newsweek magazine reported Monday that former White House chief
of staff Donald Regan's memoirs would relate that the Reagans

<TEXT>
   A Jamaican citizen employed at the
Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba was charged with manslaughter after
the car he was driving smashed into a Navy van, killing six people
and injuring four others, authorities said Monday.
   The Navy filed six charges of vehicular manslaughter against
Carlton Bonner, who is under guard at the base hospital in
Guantanamo, said Lt. Russ Greer, a spokesman at Atlantic Fleet
headquarters in Norfolk, Va.
   Six people were killed in the fiery wreck Saturday night,
including the driver of the van and five sailors from the
Norfolk-based USS Inchon, a helicopter and troop carrier that is
undergoing refresher training in the Caribbean. Three other sailors
from the Inchon were seriously injured.
   Greer identified the five sailors killed as Seaman Recruit
Michael W. Bauman of Clovis, N.M.; Storekeeper-Seaman Brent D.
Jervey of Gainesville, Fla.; Boatswain's Mate 1st Class John F.
Piper of Monongahela, Pa.; Seaman Jeffrey M. Rais, of Cincinnati;
and Petty Officer 1st Class Frederick W. Vilmar of Saginaw, Mich.
   The van driver was identified as Michael Chambers, also a
Jamaican national, who worked at the base supply department as an
accounting clerk and had been a civilian employee of the Navy since
1983, Greer said.
   Three injured sailors were evacuated Sunday to the Brooke Army
Burn Center in San Antonio, Texas. A spokeswoman for the center who
would not give her name said they were in critical condition.
   They were identified as Aircraft Storekeeper Recruit Demetric L.
Cofield, 30, of Harrisburg, Pa.; Ship's Serviceman Prentice D.
Johnson, 21, of Indianapolis; and Fireman Darren Stevenson, 30, of
Chester, Pa.
   Earlier Navy reports said the sailors were in serious condition,
but Greer said that the initial assessment was not from doctors at
the burn center.
   Bonner was listed in stable condition at the base hospital, said
Lt. Cmdr. Aaron Long, another Atlantic Fleet spokesman in Norfolk.
   The car was speeding on the base's main road when the wreck
occurred, base spokesman Lt. Bob Hines said Sunday. All those
killed were in the van as it was heavily damaged by fire, Hines
said.
   About 7,000 people, including military personnel and civilian
workers, live on the base at the southeastern tip of Cuba. The
facility, which is enclosed and surrounded by a minefield, is the
only American base in a communist country and serves as the main
training site for the Atlantic Fleet.

   Leaders of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels met Monday
amid signs that their troops are running short of supplies and some
field commanders are demanding removal of their military chief.
   Contra directors polled their top military officers Monday over
the fate of Col. Enrique Bermudez, confirmed rebel spokesman Jorge
Rosales.
   ``We are working on obtaining signatures of all the field
commanders,'' said Rosales.
   Sources close to the Contras said some of the five directors
were expected to demand Bermudez's firing at the meeting in Miami.
   In Honduras, Walter Calderon Lopez, known as Cmdr. Tono, gave
interviews over the weekend saying as many as 30 senior Contra
commanders had signed a petition demanding Bermudez's ouster.
   ``Bermudez has to go,'' Tono said. ``The movement cannot
continue with him in charge.''
   He said Bermudez, a former colonel in the hated National Guard
of deposed dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle, has recently been
surrounding himself with other former guardsmen.
   And Tono accused Bermudez of condoning, and possibly
participating in, skimming profits from U.S. military aid.
   The controversy over Bermudez follows a week of reports that
Contra director Adolfo Calero had led an unsuccessful move to fire
the military chief, running up against the opposition of fellow
director Aristides Sanchez.
   Sources said Sanchez has indicated privately that if Bermudez is
fired, he may quit the directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance, as
the Contras are formally known. Sanchez is considered the most
hard-line of the five directors, and has the closest ties to the
field troops.
   The battle over Bermudez was not the Contras' only worry,
however.
   Their soldiers' situation has worsened as the ruling Sandinistas
have refused to allow food and non-lethal supplies to reach rebels.
   The Contras accuse the Sandinistas of reneging on the agreement
signed in Sapoa, Nicaragua, in March that said the aid would be
allowed in during negotiations. The Contras issued minutes of that
meeting Monday aimed at showing the Sandinistas had agreed to the
aid.
   Rosales said the Sandinistas are now demanding concessions in
return for the food and supplies.
   ``They are trying to blackmail us with hunger,'' said Rosales.
``It is a difficult situation. The aid must begin immediately.''
   The Sandinistas offered to have the International Committee of
the Red Cross deliver the humanitarian aid. But the Contras
insisted they have the right to say who delivers it, and they see
Red Cross as sympathetic to Sandinistas.
   The agreement says the rebels may receive aid through a neutral
organization once they are in the cease-fire zones.
   When the rebel leaders returned from Nicaragua on Sunday after
the latest round of unsuccessful peace talks with the Sandinistas,
Contra director Pedro Joaquin Chamorro bitterly criticized the
handling of the aid issue.
   ``They are hinging the entire cease-fire agreement on how goods
will be delivered instead of on the democratization of Nicaragua,''
Chamorro said. ``We had already agreed on how the goods will be
delivered, and now they bring it up again.''
   The rebel leaders expressed outrage during the talks, saying the
government had reneged on promises and created an oppressive
atmosphere that jeopardizes future talks in Nicaragua.
   The next round of talks have been tentativley set for May 12-24,
and Calero said he hopes they will be held outside Nicaragua.

<HEAD>World Bank Lowers Status of Its Loans to Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama has paid nothing to the World Bank for
six months on the $502 million owed to it, the bank announced
Monday.
   As a consequence, the bank's loans to Panama have been placed in
a ``non-accrual status,'' which means the bank will no longer
include on its own statements the interest and other charges due
from Panama until money is actually received.
   The bank, owned by 151 countries, is the biggest single source
of aid money for the Third World. The United States is the largest
shareholder.
   ``Placing loans in a non-accrual status is an accounting action
which does not reduce in any way the country's obligation to the
bank or the bank's ability to assist the country in formulating
policies to help redress its economic difficulties,'' the
announcement said.
   Last Nov. 30, the bank stopped disbursing loans to Panama, as it
does to any borrowing country whenever payments on earlier loans
are more than 75 days overdue.
   Panama's financial situation has been deteriorating for almost a
year because of the political crisis there, and it's been
aggravated by U.S. actions taken to try to oust strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was indicted earlier this year in
Florida on drug-trafficking charges.
   The situation became critical Feb. 26, the day Noriega
engineered the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle for issuing
an order firing the general.
   Panama has 118 banks, and has been a major Latin American
financial center, but the banks have been closed to the public by
government order since March 4 because of cash shortages following
months-long runs on accounts and a U.S. freeze on Panamanian
assets. Some Panamanian and foreign banks reopened April 18 but
only to accept deposits.

   Opposition party leaders met Monday
to study reports that strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega made a
deal with the U.S. government to resign.
   It was the first known meeting between the party leaders in the
nearly yearlong crisis.
   ``We met to discuss jointly the grave situation of our country
and what we may do together to find a democratic solution for our
country,'' Ricardo Arias Calderon of the Christian Democrat Party
told The Associated Press. The meeting was at his home.
   Other sources at the session said representatives of six
political parties met for more than two hours.
   One source, speaking with the condition he not be identified,
said the leaders discussed ``everything that has to do with the
serious crisis,'' including the reported arrangement between
Washington and Noriega, commander of the 15,000-member Defense
Forces.
   He did not elaborate on the talks.
   U.S. officials in Washington said Friday that Noriega had agreed
to step down as the military chief but refused to leave Panama, as
the United States and the Panamanian opposition had wanted.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker said Sunday that talks
with Noriega continued during the weekend and that ``progress is
being made.''
   Noriega on Saturday denied he had made any commitments to U.S.
envoys.
   Opposition leaders were alarmed at the report that Noriega might
be allowed to remain in the country even if he did resign. They
said such a change in the U.S. stand would be a ``serious mistake
that would not solve Panama's problems or bring democratization to
the country.''
   The Christian Democrats called the meeting and representatives
were sent by the Authentic Panamanian Party, the Republican Party
of ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, the Liberal Republican
Nationalist Movement and factions of the Liberal and Labor parties.
The Authentic Panamanian Party is the largest opposition party
followed by the Christian Democrats.
   Delvalle was removed by the Noriega-controlled legislature on
Feb. 26, the day after he tried to fire the general.
   Noriega was indicted by a federal grand jury in Florida last
February on drug-trafficking charges, which he denies.
   Sources in the opposition said earlier that their leaders were
afraid the United States was bypassing them and ignoring promises
to them.
   They said if Noriega quits but remains in Panama he would
continue to wield power through the Defense Forces.
   ``He would continue to be a focus of controversy,'' Arias
Calderon said.
   The opposition also insists that chief executive Manuel Solis
Palma, named to replace Delvalle, not be allowed to remain in
office until the May 1989 elections.
   Demonstrations demanding Noriega's ouster began last summer
after Noriega's former second-in-command publicly accused the
general of involvement in political assassinations, electoral fraud
and corruption.
   The United States imposed economic sanctions on Panama after
Noriega was indicted on drug charges.

   The 95-year-old mother of deposed
President Ferdinand Marcos is suffering from pneumonia and diabetes
and her condition is deteriorating, her doctor said Tuesday.
   Josefa Edralin-Marcos was admitted on Sunday to the Veterans
Medical Center in suburban Quezon City after she refused to eat for
three days.
   ``She is not responding to medication ... probably due to her
weakened resistance,'' Dr. Sergio Brillantes, director of the
government-run hospital, said in a radio interview.
   Brillantes said a son, Pacifico Marcos, and daughter, Mrs.
Fortuna Barba, were at their mother's bedside.
   Mrs. Marcos stayed behind in February 1986 when a
military-civilian uprising ousted her son Ferdinand, who went into
him into exile in Hawaii.
   The uprising brought President Corazon Aquino to power. She has
refused to allow Marcos to come back.
   In Honolulu, Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said the former
president was aware of his mother's condition.

<TEXT>
   Campaigning for the December
presidential election began Monday with 72 parties entering the
race but only two considered to have a good chance of winning.
   They are the governing Social Democrats and the Social
Christians.
   The third-ranked Movement Towards Socialism and smaller parties
will seek to assure their survival by picking up congressional
seats.
   In the last presidential election in 1983, the two main parties
received 90 percent of the vote.
   Former President Carlos Andres Perez, 67, is the Social
Democrats candidate. He served as chief executive from 1974-79. The
constitution bars a president from seeking re-election to a second
consecutive term.
   The Social Christian candidate is 47-year-old Eduardo Fernandez,
an energetic campaigner known as The Tiger.
   In his opening rally in Caracas he called on the voters to ``say
no to the past.''
   Perez, vice-president of the Socialist International, began his
campaign with rallies in three cities _ Valencia, Cabimas and
Ciudad Guayana.
   During his previous administration the government nationalized
the vital oil industry and began to strengthen and expand the iron,
aluminum and hydroelectric industries in the Guayana region.
   But it also was under Perez that the country contracted a big
portion of its $33 billion debt.
   President Jaime Lusinchi has struggled through much of his
five-year term with severe economic problems caused mainly by
falling oil prices.
   Government officials say unemployment is running at 10 percent,
double the rate of a decade ago. Last year inflation was a record
40.3 percent.
   Venezuela has had elected governments since the fall of dictator
Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez in January 1958.

<HEAD>Tass Reports May Day Demonstrations in Poland</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tass reported Monday that opposition forces in
Poland boycotted the official May Day celebrations and said
anti-government demonstrators were ``particularly aggressive'' in
Warsaw and Gdansk.
   The official Soviet news agency did not mention the Polish labor
strife, referring only to ``the current situation in Poland.''
   The brief article said official celebrations of May Day had been
targeted by anti-government groups. It quoted Polish government
spokesman Jerzy Urban as saying: ``The calls for boycotts by the
opposition forces have been disregarded.''
   Tass made no mention of clashes between police and opposition
groups, but said 12,000 people took part nationwide in
anti-government demonstrations.
   Opposition spokesman in Warsaw claimed at least 30,000 people
joined in the demonstrations.
   The Soviet news media has been silent about the strikes, the
most serious labor problem for Poland's communist authorities since
the independent Solidarity union was chartered in the fall of 1980.
   Solidarity, the only free union federation in the Soviet bloc,
was suspended in December 1981 and subsequently outlawed by
Parliament.
   The Solidarity underground supports the current strikes and also
backed the boycott of government May Day observances.
   Although the Soviet media has not mentioned the labor unrest,
many Soviets have heard about it through foreign radio broadcasts.
   Tass quoted Urban as accusing Western broadcasters of ``total
falsification'' of events in Poland.

   A reporter for a West German
newspaper was sentenced to 12 days in jail for failing to report
his stay in the country to police, a Swiss diplomat said Monday.
   Roland Hofwiller, a Swiss citizen who reports for West Berlin's
independent Tageszeitung, was arrested April 28 and convicted by a
court in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia.
   Hofwiller, a roving East European correspondent, was making a
private visit to Yugoslavia when he was arrested, said Monika
Stinner, charge d'affaires of the Swiss Consulate.
   ``He came to Zagreb and stayed with a girlfriend in her
apartment. They have a child he acknowledged as his own,'' she said.
   Foreigners are expected to report their stay to the Yugoslav
police within a day unless they stay at state-run hotels.
   Nikola Barovic, a Belgrade lawyer who said Hofwiller appointed
him as his counsel, told the AP the rule has been seldom
implemented, ``only when somebody's ears need to be punched.''
   Hofwiller's articles about ethnic problems in Yugoslavia were
reprinted in two Yugoslav youth weeklies, Mladost of Ljubljana and
Studentski List of Zagreb.
   Both newspapers have come under frequent official attacks for
publishing non-conformist views.

   The United Auto Workers and Chrysler
Corp. moved closer to a national contract settlement Monday after
wrapping up all but final details of related agreements covering
former American Motors Corp. workers in Wisconsin, a union official
said.
   ``It means now we can turn our full attention to the national
talks. They're going very well,'' UAW Vice President Marc Stepp
said, adding that since last week, Chrysler management's ``attitude
has changed for the positive.''
   UAW President Owen Bieber, who on Monday joined national
contract talks covering 66,000 Chrysler workers in 15 states, said
Chrysler and the UAW reached tentative settlements on a master pact
covering all former AMC workers in Wisconsin and a local contract
covering 6,500 workers in Kenosha, Wis.
   ``We had to get this piece settled before we could settle the
rest. There was no way that we were going to put together the
national agreement and let these people hang out there by
themselves,'' Bieber said.
   ``Now we can get down to the bigger things,'' he said, adding
the only deadline set for finishing national contract talks is ``as
soon as we possibly can.''
   The four-year Kenosha pact covers 5,500 workers who will be laid
off in the closing of an assembly plant at year's end and 1,000
workers at an engine plant that will remain open.
   The master Wisconsin pact, which covers all UAW workers who were
employed by AMC in the state when Chrysler bought the ailing
automaker in August, will give Kenosha workers about 88 percent, or
$57 million, of nearly $65 million AMC owed them, said Chrysler
spokesman Lloyd Northard. He said $2.2 million of the $57 million
already was paid in 1985.
   The Kenosha payments, which will average between $6,000 and
$8,000 per worker, will be 100 percent of the money AMC borrowed
from workers early in the decade but will not include interest AMC
had promised, Northard said. About 9,000 workers, including those
employed by 1982 at one time or another between 1982 and 1987, will
be eligible for the payments, Northard said.
   Under the same pact, about 200 Milwaukee workers at a parts
depot and 425 laid off from a stamping plant there will receive the
same percentage of more than $5 million AMC owed them under the
master pact.
   Bieber said the master pact would guarantee laid-off workers six
months of supplemental unemployment benefits, which are paid in
addition to regular unemployment compensation to provide 95 percent
of regular pay. In addition, it makes it easier for workers to
retire early and matches pension benefits to those at General
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., he said.
   Chrysler and the union are negotiating their national contract
along the lines of an industry-pattern contract established last
fall at GM and Ford, but have adapted some elements, including a
crucial job-security provision.
   Talks on Chrysler's contract, which expires Sept. 14, opened
April 18. Last week, the Wisconsin talks were moved to Detroit so
bargainers for both sides could negotiate all contracts
simultaneously.
   The tentative Kenosha local pact appears similar to a five-year
agreement reached in October covering Jeep plant workers in Toledo,
Ohio. Both pacts give the company more flexibility in using workers.
   Ed Steagall, president of UAW Local 72 at Kenosha, said about 20
percent of the Kenosha workers will be able to retire early and
laid-off Kenosha workers will have first crack at any new jobs at
the engine plant there.
   Nick Romano, president of Local 75 in Milwaukee, said he also
was pleased with the settlements, which will be voted on by next
week.
   ``I feel good about what's happening. I don't feel good about
our plant being terminated in Milwaukee,'' he said.

   A door fell Monday from a Boeing 727, landed in
the back yard of a suburban home and demolished a fence, officials
said. No injuries were reported.
   Authorities were investigating the incident, which occurred when
the Icelandair jet approached a runway at Heathrow Airport. The
Boeing was carying 76 passengers and six crew members from
Reykjavik to London.
   The 66-pound metal door, measuring about 6 square feet, had
covered the wheel wells, said Oliver Smith, Icelandair's station
manager at Heathrow. It fell from the starboard wing of the jet and
landed behind a house in Pinner, 12 miles northwest of central
London.
   The aircraft landed without problem. Smith said the door would
be examined.
   ``Some of the fittings that hold it on appear to have sheared
off but we have no idea how it happened,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pope Completes Last Step For July 3 Canonization Of US Nun</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II completed the formalities
Monday for the naming of seven new saints, including Rose
Philippine Duschesne, a French-born American nun.
   John Paul asked the College of Cardinals at a consistory Monday
to approve the decrees and it did so. The step is the last before
canonization.
   Hundreds of people from France and the United States are
expected to attend the July 3 canonization of Mother Duschesne, the
founder of the U.S. branch of the Society of The Sacred Heart.
   Mother Duchesne was born Aug. 29, 1769, in Grenoble, France. For
10 years during the French revolution, she devoted herself to
charity, often sheltering priests persecuted by the revolutionary
government.
   She emigrated in 1818 to the United States, where she founded
the Sacred Heart teaching order and a mission school for Potawatomi
Indian girls in Sugar Creek, Kan. Pope Pius XII beatified her in
1940.
   Also on July 3, John Paul will canonize Simone de Roxas, a
Spanish priest who founded the secular Congregation of Ave Maria.
   In a ceremony May 16, the pope will make saints of three Jesuit
priests who dedicated their lives to evangelizing Indians and were
martyred in South America in 1628. They are Roque Gonzales, born in
what is now Asuncion, Paraguay; Alfonso Rodriquez of Zamora, Spain,
and Juan del Castillo of Belmonte, Spain.
   On Oct. 3, the pope will canonize Maddalena Marchesa di Canossa
of Verona, Italy, founder of the Sons and Daughters of Charity, and
on Dec. 11, Maria Rosa Molas y Vallve, a Spanish nun who founded
the Sisters of Consolation.

<HEAD>AIDS and Anti-Smoking Programs Among Top Items at WHO conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1988 assembly of the World Health Organization
opened Monday and high on the agenda were programs to check the
spread of AIDS and an anti-smoking campaign.
   About 1,200 delegates from WHO's 166 member countries will elect
a successor to Dr. Halfdan Mahler of Denmark as director general of
the U.N. agency.
   Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, 59, a Japanese specialist in
pyschopharmacology, was designated for the post last January by the
31-member Executive Board. Confirmation by the assembly, scheduled
for Wednesday, is a virtual certainty.
   Mahler, head of the agency since 1973, did not seek a fourth
five-year term.
   Delegates at the two-week assembly will consider a proposed
zero-growth, two-year budget of $639.9 million. Not included in the
budget is funding for WHO's Special Program on AIDS, which
officials have said would require $66 million this year.
   The number of AIDS cases was officially reported last week as
exceeding 88,000, but the actual number is known to be much higher.
   WHO officials have urged further implemtation of the agency's
campaign against smoking as ``the major avoidable cause of
ill-health.''
   AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a fatal disease in
which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   It can be transmitted through sexual contact; transfusions of
tainted blood or blood products, or sharing contaminated hypodermic
needles or syringes. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child
at or before birth.

   Buddhist rebels attacked Moslem
settlements in southeastern Bangladesh and killed 13 people,
military officials said Monday.
   The slayings raised to 36 the number of deaths blamed on the
insurgents in the past week, officials said.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said two
villages in the Chittagong Hill Tracts area were raided Sunday
night, apparently by the same band of armed rebels. The victims
included six women and four children, they said.
   At least nine people were injured in the attacks.
   Members of the Buddhist Chakma tribes, descendants of the
Mongols, have been seeking an independent homeland since 1974. They
say their tribal culture is being overwhelmed by the influx of
Moslem settlers from other parts of Bangladesh.
   An estimated 4,000 people have died in rebel attacks and
Bangladesh army actions against the insurgents. An estimated 50,000
tribal members have fled to India to escape the violence.
   Military officials said rebels on Sunday attacked Karmangipuri
village, 2 miles from the Indian border, and killed three women and
two children. The rebels fled after soldiers from a nearby camp
opened fire, they said. There was no word of injuries to the
insurgents.
   In the second attack, the rebels stormed Malangipara village,
about 10 miles from the frontier. Eight people, including three
women and two children, were killed, the officials said.

   A police sharpshooter killed a
gunman holding six people inside a bank on Monday after the man
threatened to inject his hostages with blood he said contained the
AIDS virus, police said.
   Police said they got the man drunk so they could get the
hostages out safely.
   The man seized six bank workers during an attempt to rob the
branch of Banorte Bank in Massoro, about 1,875 miles northeast of
Rio. Police surrounded the bank after security guards saw a man
threatening a teller with a revolver.
   Police and a journalist negotiated for eight hours with the
robber, who said he escaped from Sao Paulo prison and was a carrier
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the fatal disease that
destroys the body's immune system.
   The man, who identified himself only as ``Falcone,'' was shot
after he drank several bottles of beer provided by police, said
Officer Jose Nazareno.
   ``We gave him lots of beer to get him drunk. We hoped that way
we'd be able to get the hostages out safely,'' Nazareno told The
Associated Press by telephone. ``We had no choice but to kill him.
He was threatening the hostages with a syringe full of blood and a
revolver.''
   The robber had demanded a getaway car, a second revolver and a
rifle before he would free the hostages. He also wanted to be
allowed to escape with $75,000.

   Israeli troops supported by helicopter
gunships and tanks thrust into southeastern Lebanon Monday in
search of Palestinian guerrillas, police reported.
   Israel said its troops had moved into Israel's self-declared
security zone in southern Lebanon.
   ``The army is combing the security zone because of increasing
attempts to infiltrate into Israel for purposes of murder and
hostage-taking,'' an Israeli military communique said.
   It did not say how long the operation would last or how many
troops were involved. The communique was issued by the military in
the northern Israeli town of Metulla.
   The army censored other details about the operation.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 500 to 1,500
Israeli soldiers were dispatched to the border region before the
operation began.
   Lebanese police said reports from the Arkoub region in the
foothills of Mount Hermon indicated at least three suspected
guerrillas had been seized by the Israelis in the late evening
operation.
   The area is in the western sector of the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
Valley.
   ``We have no information yet about the size of the attacking
force or the distance it covered in the penetration,'' said a
spokesman at Lebanon's police headquarters in Beirut. He was not
identified in line with police regulations.
   He declined comment on a report by NBC News that said about
2,000 Israeli troops had crossed into Lebanon in search of
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas and their strongholds.
   Last week, Palestinian guerrillas entered northern Israel from
southeastern Lebanon in two different incursions. Five guerrillas
and two soldiers were killed in fights with Israeli army patrols.
   There have been 12 infiltrations or attempted infiltrations
since Nov. 25, when a Palestinian guerrilla landed a hang glider
near a military base and killed six soldiers before being shot to
death.
   Israeli officials said recent cross-border raids probably were
linked to the five months of anti-Israeli demonstrations in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   An Arab youth died Sunday when he was electrocuted while
climbing a utility pole at the West Bank village of Beit Wazan.
Hospital officials reported relatives of the victim, Nidal
Abdulhak, 16, said he was killed when Israeli troops ordered him to
climb the pole to remove a Palestinian flag.
   The army said Abdulhak apparently was trying to hang the flag,
which is outlawed by Israel.
   His death brought the number of Arabs killed since the uprising
began Dec. 8 to at least 177. An Israeli soldier and Jewish settler
also have been slain in the violence.
   There have been reports of an Israeli military buildup since
guerrilla incursions last week. The Israeli military censor on
Monday prevented journalists in Israel from reporting details about
the buildup.
   Israeli officials have blamed Syria for the cross-border
guerrilla attacks on grounds the guerrillas were from the Bekaa
Valley that is controlled by Syrian forces.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,
was asked about the report of 2,000 Israeli soldiers crossing into
Lebanon.
   ``An operation of that magnitude would have to through the
UNIFIL area and we see nothing,'' he told The Associated Press in
Jerusalem by telephone from his headquarters in the the Lebanese
border town of Naqoura.
   ``In the area we see and control we don't see anything,'' Goksel
said. UNIFIL has peacekeeping units in southern Lebanon.
   The police spokesman said the attacking force was supported by
militiamen of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army, a
predominantly Christian paramilitary contingent in control of
Israel's self-designated security zone in south Lebanon.
   Squadrons of Israeli air force jet fighters soared over south
Lebanon's two major cities of Sidon and Tyre, dropping parachute
flares and staging mock divebombing runs on Palestinian refugee
camps, the spokesman said.
   The drone of warplane engines also was heard over Beirut, the
Lebanese capital. But there have been no reports of bombing sorties.
   The Israeli military said that last Wednesday, two Palestinian
guerrillas from Lebanon crossed Israel's border and wounded a truck
driver before they were trapped in a ravine and slain by an army
patrol. No army casualties were reported.
   An army statement said documents found on the dead guerrillas
showed they planned to take hostages to exchange for Arab prisoners
in Israeli jails.
   The day before, three guerrillas crossed the border at the same
point and were spotted by an army patrol. The army said the three
guerrillas and two soldiers were killed in a gunfight.

<HEAD>Sir Hugh Rankin, British Eccentric, Dies at 88</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Hugh Rankin, who has died at the age of 88,
was an aristocrat turned communist and a man who claimed records in
pastimes ranging from playing golf to crawling under trees.
   His death on April 25 deprived Britain of what The Daily
Telegraph on Monday called ``an extraordinary character whose
eccentricity was remarkable even by the rarefied standards of the
baronetage.''
   Rankin's self-composed entry in Who's Who takes up four times as
much space in that 1,972-page tome as Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's.
   It is strewn with superlatives, ranging from oldest surviving
member of the 1st Royal Dragoon Guards that fought in Ireland in
1920-22 to holding ``an amateur record amongst golfers of Great
Britain in having played on 382 separate courses of UK and Eire.''
   Rankin's pursuits ran from sheep-shearing in Australia between
1928 and 1931 to riding bicycles to the top of mountains to
exploring old Roman roads.
   ``Wife and himself are only persons who have crawled under dwarf
fir forest for last { mile of most northerly known section of any
Roman road in Europe, terminating opposite end of Kirriemuir Golf
Course,'' his Who's Who entry revealed.
   Rankin was born in the Tunisian desert on Aug. 8, 1899, the son
of big-game hunter Sir Reginald Rankin.
   Christened Hubert Charles Rhys Rankin, he was educated at
upper-crust Harrow high school but ran away to work in a Belfast
shipyard, joined the dragoons and became a champion cavalry
swordsman. He received a disability discharge after he was shot by
a Irish sniper.
   At 46, he changed his name from Hubert to Hugh, one of several
such alterations he would make, including the addition of Omar
during his Moslem period. He went from Christian to Moslem to
Buddhist.
   In 1935, he became president of the British Moslem Society but
resigned weeks later after a rowdy society meeting. ``They were
very rude ... and knew nothing of law and order or methods of
procedure,'' he was quoted as saying.
   From 1944, according to Who's Who, he was ``a practicing
Non-Theistic Theravada Buddhist'' who ``performed Holy Buddhist
Pilgrimage Nov. 1944, the second Britisher to do so.''
   Rankin served as an army captain in World War II, but according
to the Telegraph regretted fighting for Britain, saying: ``If a
revolution comes _ and come it must after the next world war _ I'll
do my damnedest to see it succeeds.''
   In 1950 he was elected to Perth County Council declaring himself
``a blood-red militant communist in every possible way.''
   Fifteen years later he claimed to be the only baronet living on
social welfare. He said he would take any job ``except being a
butler. I hate snobbishness.''
   His first wife, Helen, died in 1945. He is survived by Robina,
his second wife.
   A death notice in The Times of London said Rankin died in a
hospital and was cremated in a private service. Cause of death was
not disclosed.

   Maryland Democrats Monday rallied around
U.S. Rep. Roy P. Dyson following the weekend suicide of his top
aide, and Republicans began talking about mounting a stronger
challenge for the congressman's seat.
   Dyson remained in seclusion Monday following the death of his
administrative assistant, Tom Pappas, who plunged 16 stories to his
death Sunday from the window of his Manhattan hotel room.
   The Washington Post carried a front-page story the same day
quoting former Dyson aides as saying the congressman had ceded
control of his office to Pappas, who recruited single, young men as
employees and pressured them to socialize with him.
   Before his death, Pappas, 46, talked with friends about the
article, which quoted staff members as complaining of his unusual
demands, including that one unidentified employee perform a
striptease at a staff retreat, the Post reported Monday.
   Police said Pappas left a poem on hotel stationery. An officer
who saw it said the unsigned eight-line verse spoke of the ``dark
and ugly world'' and ended with a reference to ``crashing,'' The
New York Times reported in Tuesday's editions.
   ``Goodbye'' was neatly printed on the sheet, which was lined
notebook paper rather than stationery and bore no addressee, the
Times said.
   Dyson, Pappas and Todd Skipper, another aide, were in New York
to meet with a lawyer and attend the Broadway musical ``Phantom of
the Opera,'' police there said.
   Dyson and Skipper were interviewed by police Sunday. Dyson's
office, which said it did not know the lawmaker's whereabouts,
issued a brief statement Monday from Dyson expressing sympathy to
Pappas' friends and family.
   ``Tom was my friend and political ally for almost two decades,''
Dyson said. ``All of us who had the privilege of working with him
will miss him more than we can say.''
   Democratic officials predicted Dyson, 39, would win re-election
in November, although they said his reaction to Pappas' death would
be crucial.
   ``I don't think Roy has any trouble. I think Roy is popular'' in
his 1st Congressional District, Maryland's Democratic Gov. William
Donald Schaefer said.
   John Willis, vice chairman of the state Democratic party, said
Dyson's standing with the voters ``is good enough that he'll be
able to weather this.'' But he cautioned that Dyson's ``reaction to
this is going to be the key.''
   Republican leaders said they are thinking of asking Wayne
Gilchrest, a political novice who won the party's nomination in the
March primary, to consider stepping aside so a better-known
candidate can challenge Dyson. But they said they won't try to
force out Gilchrest.
   ``The nomination was won fair and square by Wayne Gilchrest, and
I think we have to take our lead from him,'' Nelson Warfield,
executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, said.
   ``Our role is to explain to him exactly what is involved in
being a challenger.''
   The (Baltimore) Evening Sun quoted Gilchrest as saying he
expects to be asked to quit, but that he does not plan to step
aside.
   Former Rep. Robert Bauman, a Republican who lost the seat to
Dyson in 1980, said Pappas' death ``could hurt him (Dyson), it
could defeat him. But I think it depends on the further revelations
about what drove Mr. Pappas to his suicide.''
   ``I would warn the Republican party, my own party, not to make
an issue of this,'' Bauman added.
   Bauman lost the seat to Dyson in 1980 after Bauman was charged
with soliciting sex from a 16-year-old male prostitute in
Washington. The charge was later dropped although Bauman
acknowledged he was homosexual and an alcoholic.
   The New York medical examiner's office said an autopsy showed
Pappas' death was caused by multiple internal and external
injuries. Pappas fell from his 24th-floor room to an eighth-floor
ledge.
   Spokeswoman Ellen Borakove said toxicology tests performed over
the next week to 10 days would determine whether drugs or alcohol
were present in his system. An official classification of his
death, which police have called a suicide, will await the test
results, she said.
   The Post article came as the Federal Election Commission
investigated allegations Dyson's campaign disclosure reports
concealed $6,650 in payments to Pappas.
   Political consultant Michael Ford said he talked by phone with
Pappas about the Post article for 25 minutes Sunday morning. Pappas
told Ford he was worried that the article had irreparably damaged
his career and had hurt Dyson's re-election chances, the Post
reported Monday.
   ``I told him, `You've done nothing illegal, you've done nothing
immoral and therefore I think you can deal with this,''' Ford said,
adding he didn't think Pappas was particularly depressed.

   WASHINGTON (AP)_ The Supreme Court, in an antitrust ruling that
could make bargain-hunting more difficult, said Monday that
manufacturers do not always act illegally when they agree with
retailers to stop supplying discount stores.
   By a 6-2 vote, the court said such action by a manufacturer
becomes illegal only when ``it includes some agreement on price or
price levels.''
   The ruling makes it easier for manufacturers to avoid antitrust
liability when, acting on requests from competing retailers, they
stop doing business with stores that cut prices.

<HEAD>India Moves to Seal Frontier with Pakistan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As Soviet troops prepare to withdraw from
Afghanistgan, the Indian government has ordered a strengthening of
its guard along the border with Pakistan here in Punjab state.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi took the step out of concern that
arms that might no longer be needed in Afghanistan would find their
way to Sikh militants fighting to secede from India and form a
nation of their own.
   Afghanistan is on the other side of Pakistan from here.
   India has accused Pakistan of facilitating what it calls
``narco-terrorism,'' by which the Sikh militants buy arms with
money from heroin smuggling. Pakistan denies the allegation.
   Gandhi ordered 3,000 more men to police the border in Punjab,
raising the frontier force to 18,000. He also directed the Punjab
state government to begin building a barbed-wire fence along the
frontier.
   But some border-guard officials doubt this can stop all illegal
traffic.
   ``Sealing the border is not like licking and sealing an
envelope,'' said Jasmer Singh, a senior officer in India's Border
Security Force. ``It is impossible to completely stop trans-border
movement.''
   The Punjab-Pakistan border is 340 miles long.
   Smuggling has long been prevalent in the region. Pakistan's
lower-priced gold and textiles, for example, find eager markets in
India.
   In recent years, the smugglers have added narcotics and
automatic rifles.
   Sikh militants, allegedly involved as both smugglers and buyers,
need the arms to sustain their six-year guerrilla campaign for a
Sikh homeland. So far this year, they have killed more than 800
people.
   Punjab police say most of the killings have been carried out
with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles diverted from the Afghan rebels.
Since last early this year, the Sikh extremists have added
rocket-propelled grenades and shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft
missiles to their arsenal.
   President Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan has denied giving aid or
support to the Sikh militants. Gandhi nonetheless still maintains
that Pakistan both harbors the extremists and even provides cover
fire when they make border crossings.
   The area's rugged terrain makes the frontier difficult to seal.
   In some places, as here in Dhinda on the northern-most tip of
Punjab, farmers on both sides cultivate land right up to the
border, which often is marked only by a short white pillar.
   Singh, the border security officer, said: ``How can we stop two
farmers sharing a hookah (pipe) and exchanging packets?''
   In other border areas, six-foot elephant grass makes clandestine
movement easy. At some places, river valleys and shifting
tributaries make it difficult to even determine where the border is.
   India's policing efforts include observation towers a little
over a mile apart. Patrols stay within 500 yards of each other and
after dark, border troops use night-vision binoculars and
searchlights.
   But the searchlights sometimes lose electric power, said Chaman
Lal, a deputy-inspector general in the border force.
   ``We suspect it is arranged,'' he added. He said the government
should provide separate power lines for the searchlights instead of
relying on connections from border villages.
   D. S. Kalha, the district commissioner at Gurdaspur, one of
three Punjab districts bordering Pakistan, talked of even more
elaborate projects in store to seal the border.
   ``The government plans to ban cultivation up to 500 meters
(1,640 feet) from the border and create a no mans land,'' he said.
``Later, this area will be fenced off and mined.''
   Even if security measures succeed in Punjab, smugglers have
alternative routes to India.
   Jasmer Singh noted that the border in Gujarat state to the south
cuts through hard-to-patrol swamps, while in neighboring Rajasthan
state it passes through desert.
   ``They can bring arms through Rajasthan, where observation posts
are set at least eight kilometers (about five miles) apart,'' he
said. ``All they need is a fast camel. And they have faster camels
than we have.''

<HEAD>U.S. Navy Testing Some Modern Vessels in Persian Gulf</HEAD>

warships in the Persian Gulf as a member of the American press pool
arranged by the Pentagon in Washington.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy is assigning various types
of its more modern warships to the Persian Gulf to put them to the
test in a combat environment.
   While the Oliver Hazard Perry-class guided missile frigates,
small vessels known as ``figs,'' will continue to dominate the
Gulf-based Middle East Force, the Navy has assigned three of its
modern Spruance-class destroyers to the waterway, and for the first
time in at least a year will have no guided missile cruisers on
hand.
   The cruisers, none of them less than 20 years old, have shared
the brunt of Gulf escort and patrol duties with the frigates in the
past year.
   The emphasis now is to be on more modern ships, primarily the
destroyers, which one officer said ``will be the backbone of the
Navy in coming years.''
   Assigning these and other types of ships to the Gulf will give
some ``balance'' to the overall surface fleet, rather than having
the combat experience concentrated in mostly older vessels, said
the officer, speaking only on condition of anonymity.
   At the time the guided missile frigate Stark was hit and nearly
sunk by an Iraqi missile May 17, 1987, the U.S. Middle East Force
had four to six members. It more than doubled, then tripled, after
the United States began escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in
July to protect them from Iranian attack.
   More than 50 of the Navy's 230-plus surface combat ships have
made their appearance in the Gulf since then.
   Although it varies from week to week as ships arrive and depart,
the Gulf-based force recently stood officially at 16, including six
wooden-hulled ocean-going minesweepers, more than 30 years old, and
their mother ship, the Trenton.
   Several of the Navy's 31 Spruance-class destroyers, 7,810-ton
ships armed with a variety of long-range missiles, have served with
carrier battle groups supporting the Gulf convoy operations from
the Arabian Sea, but none have been in the Gulf until recently.
   One reason, officers say, is that their long-range missiles and
defensive weapons were not suitable for the confines of the Gulf,
where close-in missile attacks and armed speedboats are considered
the major threats.
   The same was true of the older Adams-class destroyers, which
were regulars in the Middle East Force for many years until the
Stark incident. Those ships, built in the 1950s and 1960s, are
among the last of the Navy's World War II-style vessels, although
with aluminum superstructures.
   None of these ships carry the computerized gatling gun, called
``sea whiz,'' designed to knock down incoming cruise missiles with
storms of spent-uranium shells. All other ships in the Gulf have
been equipped with the rapid-firing ``terminal defense'' and other
improvised defenses.
   Recent arrivals were the Spruance-class destroyers O`Brien and
Merrill and the 25-year-old guided missile destroyer Joseph
Strauss. They are being followed into the Gulf by at least one
other Spruance-class ship, the John Hancock.
   The recent arrivals saw action during the April 18 clashes with
Iranian naval forces. The Strauss fired a Harpoon missile that
scored a direct hit on one of Iran's frigates and itself came under
fire from Iranian missiles.
   Since the Stark, 22 of its sister Perry-class ships have been to
the Gulf and four more will soon do their 2{-month turns in the
waterway.
   In addition to the ``figs,'' the list includes 10 of the Navy's
17 1960s-vintage missile cruisers, two of its seven helicopter
assault carriers of the same era, and a variety of amphbious
landing ships. No large aircraft carriers, battleships,
state-of-the art ``aegis'' cruisers or nuclear-powered warships
have operated in the Gulf.
   When they entered service in the late 1970s, the boxy-looking,
3,700-ton Perry-class frigates were much criticized as inadequate
for their intended role, which was providing anti-submarine
protection for battle groups.
   But in the Gulf, the ``figs'' have carried the brunt of the
escort duty, and the punishment.
   One frigate, the Reuben James, set a tedium-endurance record
with more than a dozen ``transits'' during its two-month duty tour.
Another, the Samuel B. Roberts, hit a mine April 14 but survived
through the heroic efforts of its crew.
   Cmdr. Edward Mann, skipper of the frigate Jack Williams, says
the ships have proved in the Gulf that they can handle almost any
situation.
   ``As late as 1980, admirals were still saying the FFGs didn't
belong in the fleet,'' said Mann, 42, of Bucks County, Pa. ``Now we
know _ they can steam, they can deliver, they have sustainability.''
   Another officer, asking not to be named, said there was no doubt
that the frigates have been ideally suited for the Gulf assignment.
   ``But there's also a need to give other types of ships and their
crews the same chance for training under those conditions,'' he
said.
   The Pentagon announced the rotation of ships at an April 22 news
briefing, in an effort to forestall speculation that the United
States was enlarging its Gulf-based force following the one-day
series of armed clashes with Iran on April 18.

   Today is Sunday, May 8, the 129th day of 1988. There are 237
days left in the year. This is Mother's Day.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On May 8, 1945, President Harry S. Truman announced in a radio
address that World War II had ended in Europe.
   On this date:
   In 1541, the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto discovered the
Mississippi River.
   In 1846, the first major battle of the Mexican War was fought at
Palo Alto, Texas, resulting in victory for Gen. Zachary Taylor's
forces.
   In 1884, the 33rd president of the United States, Harry S.
Truman, was born near Lamar, Mo.
   In 1886, Atlanta pharmacist John Styth Pemberton invented the
syrup for a beverage that came to be known as Coca-Cola.
   In 1958, Vice President Richard M. Nixon was shoved, stoned,
booed and spat upon by anti-American protesters in Lima, Peru.
   In 1970, helmeted construction workers broke up an anti-war
protest on Wall Street in New York.
   In 1973, militant Indians who had held the South Dakota hamlet
of Wounded Knee for 10 weeks surrendered.
   In 1980, Philippine opposition leader Benigno Aquino was
released after 7{ years of detention and allowed to fly to the
United States for medical treatment.
   In 1984, the Soviet Union announced it would not participate in
the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, charging the United States did not
intend to ensure athletes' security.
   Ten years ago: David R. Berkowitz pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn,
N.Y., courtroom to the six murder charges against him in the ``Son
of Sam'' .44-caliber shootings that had terrified New Yorkers.
   Five years ago: Secretary of State George P. Shultz wrapped up a
two-week tour of the Middle East, during which he had discussed

<HEAD>Top 20 May Not Be Good Enough for `Molly'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Isn't it just like that Molly Dodd, TV's
perplexed and perplexing, quintessential struggling single woman,
to scramble NBC's neat little line of comedies that always rank 1,
2, 3, 4 in the Nielsens.
   Last week, the network's four Thursday comedies _ ``The Cosby
Show,'' ``A Different World,'' and ``Cheers,'' with ``The Days and
Nights of Molly Dodd'' bringing up the rear _ ranked 1, 2, 3, 13.
Yes, that's our Molly, throwing a monkey wrench into the
smooth-running NBC comedy machine.
   NBC put ``Molly Dodd'' into the ``Night Court'' slot in March.
``Night Court'' was Top 10. Molly drops to the top 20, not good
enough for No. 1 NBC.
   People who fall down laughing at the ta-ta-DUM one-liners of
``Cheers'' apparently don't adjust easily to the offbeat, jazzy
rhythms of tragi-comic half-hour that follows and they are tuning
out.
   Besides that, the show has run in odd 13-week spurts in the
spring when prime time becomes a hodge-podge of repeats and
short-run series. After the show completed its successful run last
season, there was no room for it in hit-heavy NBC's fall schedule.
Many fans presumed it had been canceled.
   Bob Brush, who writes the show with executive producer Jay
Tarses, complains that even after all the critical praise last
season, NBC gave the series little fanfare when it returned.
   ``I'm thrilled with the show. I'm happy it's on the air and
people are seeing it. I would just like to see people get a chance
to get used to it and know that it's not like the other shows
they're watching,'' Brush said.
   The show is dear the hearts of Brush and Tarses. It is the first
television experience for Brush, 40, formerly a Broadway composer
(``The First'').
   His wife, Sally Faison, who now plays Molly's sister, Mamie, had
gone to Hollywood for auditions, so Brush went along, packing a
script he'd written. It caught the attention of an agent who
introduced Brush to Tarses. The two, said Brush, had a ``psychic
sympathy.''
   It was Brush who wrote this season's episode in which Molly's
father died, and it was profound, touching, poetic television.
   Entertaining her boss, Moss Goodman, in her apartment, Molly
chatted happily as she went into the bathroom to get something.
There, for a split second, she saw the image of her father in a
mirror. When she turned, it was gone. Then the phone rang.
   Cut to Moss, droning on about whether or not his stew is
adequately jelling, when he finally realizes Molly isn't there. He
goes into the deserted living room where the phone is beeping, off
the hook.
   It is these poignant scenes that seem to confound audiences used
to solid yocks in half-hour television shows.
   To deal with the new concept of 30-minute dramas with comedy, TV
writers coined the term ``dramedy,'' which the writers and
producers of such shows detest as unnecessary pigeon-holing.
   If ``Molly'' isn't a ``dramedy,'' what does Brush say it is?
   ``I say that we're writing a character piece, that we're really
trying to write about a real person, we're trying to write a show
about the human comedy. which is not about jokes, not about
wordplay, but has to do with getting to know a person who is not
unlike almost everybody.''
   Acknowledging that's a mouthful, he adds, ``OK, so it's
`dramedy.'''
   But seriously.
   ``I think one of the confusions that has happened is viewers
tend to say, `How come I don't like Molly more?' I think that's
because we're not out to say, look, we want to present you someone
you'll like. We're saying we want to present you someone you may
recognize yourself in.''
   Brush is writer-producer on Tarses' other show for ABC, ``The
`Slap' Maxwell Story.'' It didn't do well in the ratings, and its
renewal is up for grabs, too.
   On top of that, star Dabney Coleman wants to quit shooting the
series one-camera like a movie and go to a three-camera sitcom
style.
   ``He has a vision of it which does not really square with my
vision of the show,'' said Brush, who opposes any moves to make the
complex Slap more likable.
   ``I think what worked in the show when it worked was the fact
that he could seem on one hand to be so callous and miserable, but
then what we could learn about was that there was a real
sympathetic machine working underneath,'' he said.

   Elsewhere in television:
   TANNER KEEPS RUNNING _ HBO's fictional presidential candidate
Jack Tanner will keep running after the primary season is over,
says director Robert Altman. ``After he loses the primary, he's
going to go fishing with Jimmy Carter or somebody like that and
come to conclude that if he feels as passionately as he does about
his cause, the Democratic Party has changed a great deal and he's
obligated to go out and run as an Independent,'' Altman said. The
monthly series is written by Garry Trudeau. HBO plans a Tanner
marathon screening of all the episodes in June.

<HEAD>Gilbert and Sullivan's Original Company Lives Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company has been revived
and is once again ready for the road with the rollicking songs of
Gilbert and Sullivan that made it famous a century ago.
   The company went out singing on Feb. 27, 1982, with a
performance of ``H.M.S. Pinafore'' at London's Adelphi Theater.
   Dame Bridget D'Oyly Carte, the founder's granddaughter, was in
that audience. She died in 1985 and her will left the bulk of her
$7.8 million estate to trustees who had run the company until its
demise.
   The new company in the northeast town of Sunderland opened a
10-day run of ``Iolanthe'' and ``The Yeomen of the Guard'' on April
28.
   The Gilbert and Sullivan operas, an art form as distinctly
English as bowler hats and tea and crumpets, remain hugely popular
throughout the world. Productions of such hits as ``The Mikado,''
``The Pirates of Penzance'' and ``H.M.S. Pinafore'' regularly
appear on stages from elementary schools to Broadway.
   ``We are riding the crest of a wave,'' said Richard Condon, the
company's general manager. ``If you look around the West End (of
London), audiences are going for entertaining musicals and we are
going for a lively style.''
   A three-month tour through seven other cities in England and
Scotland follows the Sunderland premiere, and the company also
hopes to book a run in London.
   ``We are already talking about taking the company to the United
States, Canada and Australia,'' Condon said. ``Inquiries began
coming in from agents as soon as we announced on March 1 that we
were back.''
   The D'Oyly Carte Company thrived for 107 years on the works of
librettist Sir William Schwenck Gilbert and composer Sir Arthur
Sullivan, who collaborated on 14 operettas over 25 years.
   The style was burlesque, poking satirical fun at politics, the
law and society with outrageous puns and far-fetched rhymes.
   Some Gilbertian phrases entered everyday speech, such as
``things are seldom what they seem,'' ``the upper crust,'' ``a
policeman's lot is not a happy one,'' ``language that would make
your hair curl'' and ``blow your own trumpet.''
   Richard D'Oyly Carte founded the company in 1875 to stage the
operettas and built the Savoy Hotel and the neighboring Savoy
Theater from the proceeds.
   Royalties flowed in from thousands more productions abroad, but
there was widespread pirating.
   In 1879 alone more than 150 unauthorized productions of ``H.M.S.
Pinafore'' played in 60 cities in the United States, according to
Brian Jones who edits The W.S. Gilbert Journal for Gilbert and
Sullivan fans worldwide.
   D'Oyly Carte hit back by staging his own ``H.M.S. Pinafore'' in
New York in 1879, and in 1880 he had five companies touring the
United States.
   Condon said the new 103-member company plans two operas a year
and has new costumes, new sets, a chorus of 32 and an orchestra of
33.
   Bramwell Tovey, the company's music director and formerly music
director of the Royal Ballet, has re-examined the surviving
operetta scores and revived long-forgotten notations and directions.
   ``For years, the old company clung to one directional format and
maybe that led to its running out of steam,'' said Condon. ``Also,
as copyright on each work expired after 100 years, the fall in
royalties coincided with rocketing costs.''
   The original company lost $446,500 in 1981 and had to cancel a
U.S. tour. The government-funded Arts Council refused an appeal for
help, pronouncing the D'Oyly Carte style ``wooden and tired.''
   Condon said $945,000 was budgeted for the new ``Iolanthe'' and
``Yeomen.''

<DATELINE>GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abdala Bucaram, a fiery populist
leader from this rough-and-tumble port, is given a chance of
winning Ecuador's presidency even though the Roman Catholic Church,
newspapers and others object to his raucous style and language.
   The prospect that Bucaram, leader of the populist Roldosista
Party, could win the presidential runoff election Sunday has
stirred rumors of a military coup and sent tremors through
Ecuador's financial circles.
   The military sent him fleeing into exile once before.
   His foes accuse him of appealing to class hatred in his
speeches. But Bucaram's response is that he is a champion of the
poor.
   Campaigning recently in Guayaquil's steamy heat with his shirt
tail hanging out, he called himself a ``good-hearted slob'' and
admits he may be a bit ``crazy.''
   But his opponent in the election, Rodrigo Borja, is taking
Bucaram's challenge seriously.
   Political analysts say Bucaram has a good chance of defeating
Borja, a Social Democrat and leader of the Democratic Left party,
in the runoff.
   In the first round Jan. 31, the 36-year-old Bucaram won second
place in a field of 10 candidates with 15.3 percent of the vote to
20.3 percent for the 52-year-old Borja, 52.
   The winner Sunday will replace Leon Febres Cordero, a staunchly
conservative, pro-U.S. political leader whose four-year term ends
in August.
   This nation of 10 million people, wedged between Colombia and
Peru, has suffered in recent years from severe economic problems
and political instability sparked in great part by bitter disputes
between Febres Cordero and left-leaning parties that control
Congress.
   Borja, who narrowly lost to Febres Cordero in a runoff in 1984,
has pledged to reverse the current government's free-market
economic policies and seek close ties with the Non-Aligned
Movement, also known as the Third World.
   Borja's party is Ecuador's largest, but his chances are
weakened, many analysts say, because he is viewed as a lackluster
speaker without strong leadership ability.
   Bucaram, who wears a Hitler-style mustache and says he is an
admirer of the Nazi leader's ``organizational genius,'' charged at
one point in the campaign that ``an international Jewish
conspiracy'' was against him.
   Catholic Church leaders and newspapers have assailed Bucaram for
his use of gutter-language in attacks on Borja. Bucaram has called
Borja a drunkard and drug addict in television interviews. He also
has used unprintable street language to question his foe's virility.
   ``Borja lacks strength, spirit,'' Bucaram said. ``He's a
lukewarm man. Abdala is different,'' he said of himself. ``He
awakens passions. There is no middle ground with him.''
   The attacks have prompted Borja, a calm, urbane lawyer, to
respond in kind, calling Bucaram an ``irresponsible clown'' and a
``fascist ignoramus.''
   ``I have been accused of everything in my political career from
narcotics trafficker to thief,'' Bucaram said in a midnight
interview outside his small third-floor walkup apartment on a
garbage-littered downtown street.
   Bucaram has pledged to ``punish the oligarchy'' and crack down
on wealthy tax evaders who, he charges, cheat the government of up
to $500 million a year.
   ``A vote for me is the same as scratching a Mercedes Benz with a
bottle cap,'' he told a cheering slum crowd, alluding to such an
act as defiance of the rich.
   He has promised a ``shoe bank'' to provide free shoes for all
poor children and has pledged to nearly double the monthly minimum
wage to $60.
   His foes call him a demagogue for making such promises but
acknowledge privately that Bucaram is following in Ecuador's
tradition of populist leaders.
   The late Jose Maria Velasco Ibarra won the presidency five
times, in good measure because of his inflammatory populist
rhetoric. He also was ousted four times in military coups.
   Bucaram was mayor of this city of 1.5 million people when he
fled into exile in late 1985 to escape prison on a charge of
slandering the armed forces, a criminal offense in Ecuador. He had
said all the military was good for was wasting money on parades.
   In Panama he was arrested on a charge of possessing five pounds
of cocaine. He claimed it was a frame-up arranged by Febres
Cordero, a political enemy.
   Ecuador's Congress granted him amnesty on the military offense
and pressured Panama into dropping the cocaine charge.
   He returned in August 1987 to a hero's welcome from his
followers in Guayaquil's shantytowns.
   Bucaram is heir to a political dynasty of Lebanese immigrants
who settled in Guayaquil, Ecuador's biggest city and its commercial
hub. His sister, Elsa, was elected mayor of Guayaquil in the
general elections this past January.
   Even political foes say Bucaram was successful in administering
Guayaquil, a tough port city that has proved unmanageable for many
mayors.
   He won over hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers by paving
streets, piping in drinking water and providing other essential
services.
   He cracked down on street crime and kept the city clean by
jailing anyone who let garbage pile up in front of his property.

<HEAD>China's Industrial Boom Threatens Rural Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Along with a new prosperity, China's industrial
boom of the past decade has filled rural skies with smog, poisoned
wells and blackened streams.
   The mushroom-like growth of small rural factories that burn coal
and lack money or know-how to clean up their wastes has made
environmental pollution a nationwide problem.
   The Communist Party leadership, which long claimed that only
profit-driven capitalist industries polluted the environment, has
begun to construct an environmental protection system. The first
environmental protection law was passed in 1979. Several others
setting standards for air and water purity have been approved since
then.
   A National Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1984,
replacing a lower-level committee on the environment.
   But the chemists, technicians and enforcers in the new system
are stretched thinly across the vast rural interior.
   The estimated 20,000 workers, most without college degrees and
with a minimum of special training, have the power, on paper at
least, to shut down factories, impose heavy fines, move industries
from harmful locations and deny permission for construction of new
ones.
   In reality, however, they often must compromise when strict
enforcement of standards could mean shutting down a town's main
taxpayer, or when the money to build treatment facilities is
lacking.
   The National Environmental Protection Agency in Beijing, with
100 staffers, mainly analyzes pollution data, leaving local
agencies to do the enforcing.
   ``We want to maintain the beauty of mountains and rivers,'' said
Tang Shidi, head of the environmental office in Panzhihua, a small
steel town surrounded by thickly forested mountains in central
China's Sichuan province.
   ``But on the other hand we have to support economic
development.'' He told a visitor to his office that he makes
recommendations to local authorities when a new factory or office
is built, but acknowledged they were not always followed.
   ``We have a principle to give active support (to development) .
.. and distribute industry rationally,'' said Liu Yuncheng, a
deputy department chief at the National Environmental Protection
Agency.
   But he acknowledged, ``Factories that provide most of the
finances for localities and cause serious pollution problems are
difficult to deal with.''
   Encouraging rural industry has been a key element of the
government's post-1978 development drive. Small local factories,
now numbering 15 million, have raised rural incomes and absorbed
the surplus rural labor force.
   These factories now account for more than a quarter of China's
industrial output, which has more than tripled in the past decade
to $372 billion.
   Liu said 40 percent of rural factories have pollution problems,
including 10 percent with ``serious'' problems. Most could be
resolved fairly easily if funds were available, he said.
   Government funds, however, fall far short of the need and are
unlikely to increase at a time when farmers, teachers and the army
all are clamoring for more money from a Treasury already in the red.
   According to the national agency, the state and industry spent
$1.35 billion last year to fight pollution. Officials estimated it
would take three times that just to clean up Shanghai, a major city.
   Most of the money was spent in cities, which are among the most
smog-ridden in the world.
   The official statistics on pollutants are daunting. Only one
fourth of the 36 billion tons of waste water discharged from
factories each year is treated. Few factory smokestacks have
scrubbers to keep pollutants from rising into the air.
   Tang said that until a few years ago the Golden Sands River that
supplies Panzhihua's drinking water ran black because a coking
plant dumped water laden with coal dust into the river. Now, he
said, the waste water is filtered, but the river still is
threatened by discharges from a paper mill.
   The official media have reported other examples.
   In April, two villagers in rural Shaanxi province in north China
drowned in industrial waste when the dam burst in a reservoir
holding toxic chemicals from a mineral processing facility. Wells
in the arid region were poisoned, destroying the local residents'
water supply for perhaps years to come.
   Ninety percent of a 14,825-acre pine forest in Sichuan was
destroyed by acid rain from nearby sulfur processing plants.
   Rural pollution also spills over from cities. The Environmental
Protection Agency said more than 200,000 acres of farmland are
buried under 7.5 billion tons of industrial waste from city plants.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Take a phone book, some census data, ZIP codes
and auto registration lists. Add a computer, credit cards and
800-prefix phone numbers and you have the main ingredients for an
enterprise that's one of the wonders of the Western world _
direct-mail marketing as refined, with amazing ingenuity, in the
United States. Here's an intriguing report on how the numbers
magicians do it.

   In the late 1940s, construction of an underpass in Washington,
D.C. effectively sealed off Spencer Howell's novelty shop from the
outside _ and buying _ world.
   To keep on eating, he broke the blockade by placing an ad in
House & Garden offering tubes of whiskey-flavored toothpaste. He
sold 100,000 before the year was out. A bottle opener in the shape
of dentures sold even better.
   Spencer Howell had rediscovered a sales tool as ancient as the
Babylonians: direct mail. Instead of waiting for the customers to
come to you, go to them.
   Some 6,000 to 10,000 catalog retailers _ the figure varies _ do
just that, 11.8 billion catalogs a year, according to trade groups.
They range from titans such as L.L. Bean in Maine to Lands' End in
Wisconsin to Sears, Roebuck and Co. anywhere to Larry Selman in
Santa Cruz, Calif. who sells glass paperweights from a $15 catalog
including a toadstool-shaped antique you can have for $27,000.
   The average American home gets 50 catalogs a year. A burdened
letter carrier delivered 324 catalogs to this writer between last
Labor Day and Thanksgiving.
   Last year 88 million Americans _ 51.2 percent of the adult
population _ bought something by phone or mail. Direct mail has had
a 15 percent annual growth (30 percent for upscale catalogs) since
1970, compared to 5-10 percent for store sales. This is 8.3 percent
of the nation's general merchandise sales. Direct mail is a
high-tech, almost scientific, business which undoubtedly has the
brains to overcome April's 30 percent third class postal hike by
becoming even more so.
   Little of this would have been possible without the computer,
the credit card and the 800-prefix telephone number. And above all,
the mailing list. The mailing list stems from four of the more
mundane items on this part of the planet: the phone book, census
reports, ZIP codes and your car registration.
   Mailing list compilers can get more info from these bare numbers
and names than a Biblical exegete could from the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Donnelley Marketing, one of the big compilers, says it has more
doctors of philosophy interpreting the data than the neighboring
Stamford, Conn. hospital has doctors of medicine.
   Babylonian catalogs came on cuneiformed clay tablets. After
Gutenberg invented movable type, Aldus Manutius of Venice had a
catalog of books he published of Greek and Latin authors. Ben
Franklin _ who else? _ put out a catalog of 600 books in 1744.
American colonials bought everything from lace cuffs to musket
balls by mail from the Mother Country.
   But Montgomery Ward is the direct father of today's direct mail.
His 1872 catalog promised farmers savings of up to 40 percent by
eliminating the middleman for items ranging from harnesses to
parasols. The first compiler was not far behind.
   He probably was Lester Martin, clerk of Story County, Iowa, who
discerned that the registrees of Henry Ford's new tin lizzies were
not only farmers but the wealthier of the breed. Such names might
mean money. Martin got rights to the names and opened the M and F
Mailing Co. with his brother-in-law. Reuben H. Donnelley, another
visionary, bought them out in 1917.
   This vision comes true daily at Donnelley's computer operation
in Lincoln, Neb. There the names and addresses from the nation's
2,700 telephone books are ``laboriously converted to computer
language,'' says Dick Vincent, Donnelley's director of marketing
services. An average directory takes six weeks to computerize.
   But what's in a name?
   Not a whole lot until those computers start comparing notes with
other computers. Census data, for instance, tell how many people
live at a phone address. It gives particulars on value of home,
income.
   The name begins to take on some flesh.
   Compare those results with motor vehicle registrations, compiled
by the R.L. Polk Co. of Taylor, Mich. Two cars at the same address?
Maybe mom works. An RV? Somebody goes camping. Station wagon? Kids.
Sports car? A carefree young in heart if not in fact, a spender.
   Add some input from ZIP. Admittedly these can be misleading,
says Larry Heely, a mailing list executive at Direct Media in Port
Chester, N.Y. The same ZIP code in Chicago contains the wealthy
living in high-rises along the lakefront and the decidedly
unwealthy only a few blocks inland.
   ``ZIPs are not homogeneous,'' says Bill Weisshahar at
Donnelley's computer facility in Nevada, Iowa. So some firms like
Claritas in Chicago dissect who lives where within a ZIP and
divides the United States into 250,000 neighborhoods.
   ``When I got out of college, I moved into an apartment with
orange-crate furniture and tacked posters on the wall for decor,''
says Dave Chambers of Claritas. ``I've moved up and away, but the
new tenant probably still has orange crates and tacked posters.
Birds of a feather flock together.'' All the easier, then, to
identify the flock.
   This computerized database from national sources _ about half
the states will sell vehicle registration lists _ is then
inspected, rejected and detected as closely as a 280-pound woman
discus thrower from behind the Iron Curtain.
   Almost everybody buys mailing lists from everybody else to try
to find out who John and Jane Doe are behind the door at 000 Main
Street, Centerville and just what it is they want to buy. Do they
subscribe to The New Yorker? Upscale. Money magazine? Strong
evidence of loose change. National Geographic? Travelers, armchair
or actual. Field & Stream? And live in rural Colorado? And own a
camper? John and Jane are going to hear from Eddie Bauer and Orvis.
If they buy a sleeping bag and a fly rod, L.L. Bean and Norm
Thompson won't be far behind.
   Word in direct mail, through list renting, moves fast.
   ``It's mind-boggling how many sources of data there are,''
Chambers says. Credit card applications. Mortgage loans. Alumni
directories. Charitable donations. Building permits. Voting lists.
Computers cross-reference all this to draw a profile.

   Many hospitals sell lists of new mothers. That's grist for the
baby catalogs. And, in time, grist for kitchen appliances, toys,
back-to-school wear, home computers, brides and eventually _
particularly if the addressee has had the same phone for 30 years _
empty nest catalogs.
   To keep all this straight, lists are continually subjected to
merge-purge, eliminating duplications, merging the newly born and
purging the newly departed, since even direct mail cannot reach
beyond the grave.
   Omaha Steaks International, say, will take a hint from this
list, one from another and make a very educated guess as to who's
entertaining a lot, having first, of course, cross-checked with the
vegetarian list. Maybe it will be a Jaguar owner in an upscale ZIP
code with a bouncing new mortgage on a showplace address who
subscribes to Gourmet and Gentleman's Quarterly and recently bought
a crystal table set from Bloomingdale's by mail.
   ``When a customer makes his first purchase, we generally don't
make money,'' says Omaha president Fred Simon. ``But if we give him
good service and a good product, he becomes a member of our family.
It's a process of time.''
   ``You test, test, test,'' says Dick Vincent. ``If you use a tool
list for golfers, you'll lose your shirt. You use a lot of little
sample mailings. You don't go for broke on one mailing or you will.
   ``The thing about direct mail is that it is measurable. You
spend X dollars for a mailing, and you get Y back. In face-to-face
retailing you can make a lot of mistakes before they catch up to
you.''
   To help avoid database generalities, Donnelley periodically
sends out questionnaires to the public with free coupons to entice
a return. More food for the computer.
   Success in direct mail is not assured. Reasons for failure are
emphatic. ``If you rent 20 lists and 19 bomb, you know you sent
your catalog at the wrong time, or it was lousy,'' Heely says. It
won't be because you rented duds. For reasons related to the Golden
Rule, list renters don't trade off lemons. A list of heavy buyers
means higher fees to the renters.
   The more people buy, the more their habits, desires and depth of
pocket becomes known and targeted by more catalogs. To the
ever-growing number of two-earner families, this means broader
chances for convenience shopping. No traffic jams on the way to the
mall or parking hassles once there. No tugs-of-war at bargain
counters. No sassy or dumb clerks.
   Instead, the catalog house has a friendly, knowledgeable voice
at the end of an 800 number to answer any problem and assure the
customer he or she isn't buying a blind pig in a blind poke. ``It's
a lot less expensive to keep the customer happy than to try to find
a new one,'' says Lisa Caugherty of the Direct Marketing
Association in New York, a trade group.
   This is no more than Ben Franklin guaranteed when he assured his
customers, ``who live remote, by sending their orders and money to
the said B. Franklin, may depend on the same justice as if
present.''
   A catalog buy is an act of faith based on a picture of something
seen but never touched. Buyer satisfaction is deferred. ``If you
don't receive the goods promptly, the perceived need for it goes
away, and the emotional reward goes away, too,'' says Jo-Von
Tucker, a New York catalog consultant. So one of the first
commandments of direct mail is thou shalt fill orders promptly if
not sooner.
   Years ago, entry into direct mail was almost as easy as licking
a stamp. Lillian Vernon Katz, a 24-year-old housewife, scraped up
$2,000 in the early 1920s, placed $495 worth of ads for matching
purses and belts and offered to monogram them free. Lillian Vernon
did $115 million in sales last year.
   Richard Thalheimer started up his Sharper Image catalog by
writing clever copy and offering oddball items such as a suit of
15th century armor for $2,450. Gary Comer, a former ad copywriter,
started Lands' End as a yacht supplier, then tacked downwind to
become one of the biggest clothing mailers.
   Omaha Steaks was a local food supplier until 1952 when Fred
Simon's father heeded friends' requests to mail meats to their
friends. The stampede was on.
   Mom and Pop still might, just conceivably, start a catalog today
over the kitchen table. ``But they better have $500,000 up front
and be able to sweat it out for two years,'' says Larry Heely.
   ``It's a very crowded mail box,'' says Jo-Von Tucker. She helped
J.R. Carroll, an Irish tobacco company, spend over $5 million with
the help of marketing psychologists and all the sci-fi of Madison
Avenue to prepare their recent debut into direct mail with an
up-up-scale catalog full of enticing photos of wares to equip your
own Buckingham Palace by.
   ``The day of the dinosaur catalogs like Montgomery Ward's
(recently abandoned) are over,'' she says. ``Catalogs today are
aimed at lifestyles.''
   ``Mass marketing is dead,'' pronounced Vincent. ``Now it's
databased. Magazines have a lot of wasted circulation. TV is too
broad.''
   This is both an opportunity and a challenge for the mailing
list. Fred Simon of Omaha Steaks aims at a broad market of buyers
of high quality (average catalog purchases are somewhere between
$35 and $50). A paperweight catalog has a far narrower focus.
   Claritas helps by breaking down ZIP codes into categories. It
tells you where to find such socio-economic groupies they identify
as: Money and Brains, Furs and Station Wagons, Pools and Patios,
Young Influentials, Towns and Gowns (academics in non-metropolitan
areas), God's Country (well-educated frontier types), Coalburg and
Corntown (``Terre Haute and Lima, Ohio surrounded by rich farmland
and peopled by solid, blue-collar citizens raising sturdy Tom
Sawyerish children in decent front porch houses''). They'll also
tell you, for a price, where to find Shotguns and Pickups, Norma
Rae-villes and Tobacco Roads.
   At the brush of a computer button Heely brings up data on
Woodworkers Supply of New Mexico: 62,833 catalog purchases in the
last six months, 173,930 for 1987. An average list, rented for one
time use with the owner's veto over content, goes for around $80
per thousand names. Throw in another $10 if you want a breakdown as
to gender a ``recency'' of purchase. Of that the broker, who
mediates between landlord and rentee, gets about 20 percent, the
manager who has been handling the list, gets 10, the renter pays
maybe $3.50 to run off his list. The rest is gravy in his pocket.

   Lists and listers pinpoint like a B-1 bombsight. They can tell
you that there is a correlation between someone with a propensity
for elective surgery and the amount of cash and spare time the
cutee has. Computer modeling, applying a myriad of demographic and
lifestyle overlays on the primary database, are producing what Ms.
Tucker calls ``a young science.''
   It has to be to marry the tastes of an endlessly varied buyer
and an endlessly fanciful seller. Where but in America could
American Express otherwise sell 6,000 busts of King Tut? How else
could you find buyers mailing and phoning for every kind of fitness
machine, stereo woofer, subliminal Weight Control tapes, two-ounce
bottles of quail scent to train Bowser to the hunt, a 24-room
purple martin house with guard rails for baby birds ($289),
videotaped tours of Highland games in Scotland or Civil War
battlefields, $29.95 music box dolls that play ``Thank Heaven for
Little Girls,'' a real steam launch for $61,500, 42-inch-high
stuffed leather rhinosceri ($495 plus $12.95 shipping), fur coats,
mutual funds?
   Who are these customers who hold 600 million credit cards and
once flooded L.L. Bean with 100,000 phone calls in a day? And what
are the catalogs that impel them to lick stamps and dial phones?
   ``It is the merchandiser's dream to identify the core group of
20 percent who buy 60 percent of the nation's goods,'' says
Vincent. The 20 percent is not always whom you might expect.
Catalog buyers are not sit-by-the-fire-thumbing-a-catalog couch
potatoes. More likely they are working couples with limited time to
shop. They are yuppies, but also over-50s, who have some
discretionary income now the kids have gone. The upscale could well
be semi-rurals who are 1,500 miles from Nieman Marcus. L.L. Bean's
primary constituency is suburban. Rural folk can buy lumber jackets
and gas lanterns down at the general store. The market is,
potentially, anyone who can dial a phone.
   In 1967, 653 businesses had 800 numbers and handled 7 million
phone calls. Today there are 535,000 toll-free numbers, 6.3 billion
calls to them and even an 800 number for information on 800 numbers.
   Today's catalog is only a distant relative to yesteryear's Sears
version that was a backhouse fixture. Banana Republic's is a safari
through suburban bush clothing together with a written one from
some exotic trek. Patagonia has rock climbers and sky divers
scrambling over the pages of its sportswear, implying that here is
the garb of real he-persons. Garrett Wade's handsome tool catalog
elevates photos of hammers, saws and wooden planes almost to fine
art.
   ``Catalogs are first and foremost a photographer's medium,''
says Jo-Von Tucker. ``But it has to be more than a pretty picture.
It has to have a tone and personality, not just ticky-tacky boxes.''
   ``The creative part gets more attention, but it's only 20
percent of success,'' says Chambers. ``The rule of thumb is that 40
percent is the right product and 40 percent is the targeting.''
   Bean's no-nonsense pictures, town-meeting typeface and laconic
cracker-barrel prose combine to say ``granite solid value.'' Some
tool wholesalers, on the other hand, intentionally print on poor
paper with indifferent illustrations so the home hobbyist thinks he
is getting bargains straight from the close-out sale.
   The fact that there are 51 million videocassette recorders in
the U.S. is not lost on the catalog industry. Country Curtains will
provide a cassette so you can see right on your own TV set what
their products will do for your windows. Selling by VCR is an idea
whose time has only just begun.
   Computerized shopping by TV has long been said to be right
around a corner that never seems to arrive. J.C. Penney, however,
has just launched an electronic catalog in the Chicago suburbs
which enables the viewer to scan, linger over and buy illustrated
items from some 50 suppliers, including a supermarket. All you have
to do is turn on the cable catalog channel and manipulate it with a
Touch Tone phone. The system will even play selections from records
you might want to buy.
   For the retailer who wants to know what is selling, which is the
name of the game in the game of names, Penney's system, called
Telaction, ``can tell if people looked at the blue shoes as well as
the black they bought or how long someone looked at a dress even if
she didn't buy it,'' says Mary Dale Walters of Telaction.
   The cost of finding a customer via catalog is rising with the
cost of technology, the cost of paper, the cost of mailing.
   DMA, whose more than 2,000 members have just been hit with the
postal hike, is looking into alternative delivery systems. The
industry is not happy with a joint survey by DMA and Doubleday, the
publisher, that the U.S. Postal Service failed to deliver four to
14.1 per cent of third class mail in 1983 and did no better when
resurveyed last year. The Post Office says it will tighten up
procedures. One man's junk mail is another's expensive mailing list.
   Another problem for direct mail is the matter of privacy. The
industry takes considerable pains to stay on the right side of a
sometimes fine line. If you don't want any catalogs, you can ask
DMA to get you off the lists. More people, however, tell DMA they
would like to get more catalogs than want none. A Consumer Reports
survey found almost nine people in 10 were ``mostly or completely''
satisfied with their shopping by mail or phone.
   And Spencer Howell? After 45 million catalogs offering
everything from ``Go Away'' doormats to records of three minutes of
silence, he has retired to the golf course where he may reminisce
about the year his Game Room offered a Christmas card bearing
greetings from The First Family. Inside were a fig-leafed Adam and
Eve posed in their Garden.
   ``It seemed a cute idea,'' he says, as have catalogers since the
days of the Babylonians. ``But it didn't sell worth a damn,'' which
undoubtedly some Babylonian also said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ More than 4,300 Roman Catholic schools have
closed since the mid-1960s and enrollment in parochial schools has
been cut in half. To see what can be done to reverse this decline,
the leaders of 22 Catholic organizations are gathering in Dayton,
Ohio, for a week-long summit. As one church leader says, ``The
issues on the agenda are gigantic.''

   It was once almost an article of faith for new
Roman Catholic parishes: They built the parochial school first and
held Sunday Mass in the auditorium. The church building could wait
until later.
   That's the way they did it at Most Precious Blood parish in
Northeast Baltimore. The altar and pews were placed right in the
middle of the two-story brick school building, which opened in
1960. The church, the parish figured, would rise later on the
vacant lot across the driveway.
   But the baby boom ended, the church was never built, the
parishioners aged and their children moved to the suburbs to start
their own families.
   Next month, Most Precious Blood school will join a casualty list
of 4,300 Catholic schools that have closed since the mid-1960s.
   Even with tuition starting at $1,100 a year, the school ran a
deficit last year of $86,000, made up from the dwindling resources
of a parish of 400 families.
   Mary Barlow, a nurse who sent her three children to the school,
was on the committee that recommended closing the school. There was
no fight.
   ``It's not that we gave up easily, but we had to take the
interests of the few and think of the whole parish,'' she said.
``How do you ask an older group of people to raise a $100,000
subsidy? It's impossible. It's un-Christian.''
   Schools like Most Precious Blood have been squeezed in the vise
of rising costs and declining enrollments that persist despite some
studies that show Catholic schools achieve better academic results,
especially for minority students, and send more students to college
than their public counterparts.
   Catholic schools have lost 3 million students since 1964,
including 103,000 last year alone, when 110 schools closed. This
year's enrollment of 2,623,000 is down 3.8 percent from a year ago,
and off 53 percent from the peak of 5.6 million in 1964.
   The Catholic population actually has grown over that same period
and become more prosperous. But as Catholics moved to the suburbs,
the schools did not follow them.
   Pastors ``no longer have the large armies of sisters and
brothers, especially the sisters, to staff the schools,'' says
Sister Catherine T. McNamee, president of the National Catholic
Educational Association (NCEA).
   Nuns and priests taught 75 percent of the classes in Catholic
schools in 1960. Today, nearly 83 percent of the 140,000 teachers
at 8,992 Catholic schools are lay women and men.
   ``Neither the parishes nor the dioceses nor the Catholic people
as a whole were really prepared to absorb the costs that came about
after Vatican II,'' as many nuns left their orders and some of
those who remained chose ministries other than teaching, McNamee
says.
   This Thursday, May 19, McNamee and the leaders of 21 other
Catholic organizations will gather in Dayton, Ohio, for a week-long
summit to try to forge a common vision for the future of Catholic
education in America.
   ``The issues on the agenda are gigantic,'' says McNamee, whose
organization began working with the U.S. Catholic Conference three
years ago to lay the groundwork for the symposium, called the
Catholic Education Futures Project.
   They will be exploring ways to spare other inner-city parochial
schools the fate of Most Precious Blood, perhaps through new
financial arrangements and organizing Catholic schools by region
and clusters of parishes, instead of as single parish entities.
   The symposium at the University of Dayton also will explore
religious education for the majority of Catholic children who do
not attend Catholic schools, and adult instruction.
   The Rev. Thomas G. Gallagher, the U.S. Catholic Conference's
secretary for education, and a prime mover behind the Dayton
meeting, says, ``It's probably the first time in 20 years that
these groups involved in one form or fashion of Catholic education
have ever had the opportunity to sit down. We are not only
preparing ourselves for the future, but preparing the future for
us. We can shape the future.''
   The Baltimore archdiocese already has started trying to revamp
its parochial schools. In a 1986 pastoral letter, Archbishop
William D. Borders spoke of the need to adopt an ``interparochial
school structure'' and to set tuition at full cost, with tuition
assistance for families unable to pay the full freight.
   The schools are to be run not by individual pastors or parish
councils, but independent Catholic school boards in each of 12
regions of the archdiocese, which stretches from the Chesapeake to
Cumberland, Md.
   ``We're being looked at by other dioceses all over the
country,'' says Lawrence Callahan, the archdiocese's superintendent
of schools. ``We really have taken a position that has been
somewhat unpopular among our people.''

   Baltimore, the first archdiocese in the United States, was the
site of three 19th century plenary councils that gave impetus to
creation of the world's largest system of Catholic schools.
   The American bishops, at their third plenary council here in
1884, proclaimed: ``Near every church, when it does not already
exist, a parochial school is to be erected within two years from
the promulgation of this Council, and to be kept up in the future,
unless in the judgment of the bishop the erection and maintenance
of the school is impossible.''
   Any priest ``gravely negligent in erecting the school'' or
running it ``can and must be removed from that church...'' the
bishops decreed. ``All Catholic parents are bound to send their
children to parochial schools.''
   Catholic schools existed as far back as colonial days, but their
numbers grew in step with Catholic immigration in the mid-1800's
and beyond to the big cities of the East. There, according to
University of Virginia sociologist James Davison Hunter, they
``provided havens for Catholics committed to preserving their
ethnic and religious heritage'' in a Protestant-dominated society.
   But in the modern era, as Catholics prospered and grew more
comfortable with life in a pluralistic and secular United States,
they came to rely less on their parochial schools, Hunter says.
   The bishops' injunction to Catholic parents fell by the wayside.
   ``The fact of the matter was we didn't have enough room,'' says
Gallagher of the U.S. Catholic Conference. ``You couldn't go out
and tell everybody to put their youngsters in a Catholic school,
and you can't lay a guilt trip on parents who can't afford it.''
   The Catholic school enrollment slump has hit elementary schools
the hardest. High schools often were organized by region or diocese
to begin with, or sponsored by such orders as the Jesuits or
Sisters of the Sacred Heart, and they drew from a wider base than
parish schools.
   In 1965, Baltimore had 113 elementary schools with 61,000
students. Today it has 86 with 24,000. A quarter-century ago, 80
percent of its teachers were nuns drawing stipends of $600 a year.
Today, the archdiocese pays the nuns $7,000, while lay teachers'
salaries start at $12,416, almost $6,000 below the scale in
Baltimore public schools.
   As recently as 1970, most Baltimore Catholic schools charged
less than $100 tuition a year. Even at tuition rates of $1,100 and
$1,200 a year, Callahan says, it is hard to pay a living wage to
teachers who have families of their own.
   The superintendent also believes Catholic leaders have not done
enough to encourage parents to use the Catholic schools. ``Today
you rarely hear anyone talk about the values of Catholic schools
from the pulpit,'' he says. ``So many people have children in
public schools, they don't want to offend anyone.''
   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett told the NCEA
convention in New York last month that Catholic schools are closing
in part because they have failed ``to make their case to the
public.''
   ``You can't wait around for tax credits or tuition vouchers or
other forms of new government funding...They are not imminent,''
said Bennett, a Catholic who attended both public and parochial
schools.
   He suggested that Catholic schools recruit from public schools
``the worst cases _ the dropouts, the problem discipline cases, the
so-called worst five or 10 percent,'' educate them and ``then ask
society for fair recompense.''
   Bennett suggested that local communities or business groups pay
half the $4,500 that public schools now spend per student. By
contrast, Catholic schools spent about $4 billion in 1985-86, or
$1,072 per elementary pupil and $2,025 for high school students.
   In an interview, Bennett said the Catholic schools ``have not
been aggressive like the evangelical schools. I don't know why
because the Catholic Church has certainly wanted to be aggressive
on other issues. I think it would do better, frankly, presenting
itself as an educator of poor children...than as a critic of the
United States in Central America.''
   Bennett's challenge drew a skeptical response from Catholic
school leaders.
   The NCEA's McNamee called it ``a very creative idea,'' but
added, ``I don't think that even Bennett would think that it could
be implemented entirely and literally in all parts of the country.''
   ``We do have many of the potential dropouts, problem students,
etc., in our schools. They do very well,'' she said. But ``if we
went out and recruited, we would have to hire additional teachers,
administrators, special services, remedial courses and equipment
and so forth now. The schools would not be able to survive until
four or five years from now with the hope that the municipality or
the state might reimburse for these services.''
   But she said Bennett's idea might be useful ``as a jumping off
point for some pilot projects,'' paid for by private industry or
foundations.

   Public educators generally do not regard Catholic schools as
doing them any favors.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said that even in the inner cities, parochial schools
educate ``a select group.''
   ``They are kids who will sit still, who will keep quiet, who
will bring their homework in, who will wear a tie or certain type
of uniform and whose parents are willing to put up a couple of
hundred bucks, even if it's a very small amount,'' said Shanker.
   Catholic and other religious schools have been stymied in the
courts and in Congress in their efforts to secure more government
support. Three of the past four presidents _ Richard Nixon, Jimmy
Carter and Ronald Reagan _ promised wider help. None has delivered.
   Reagan has frequently extolled the idea of tuition tax credits,
but he has been unable to obtain them. The administration also
believes strongly in giving parents wider choice in education, but
lately it has been talking primarily about choice among public
schools.
   The 1965 legislation that provided remedial aid for
disadvantaged children specifically allowed religious schools to
take part. But a 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court drove the remedial
classes out of Catholic school buildings and into vans or other
sites off the premises.
   Minority enrollment in Catholic schools has doubled since 1970.
Blacks, Hispanics and other minorities now comprise 22 percent of
all students. Sixty-four percent of the 234,300 black pupils are
not Catholic.
   Studies by James Coleman, a University of Chicago sociologist,
and others have found Catholic students out-performing their public
school counterparts on the National Assessment of Educational
Progress reading and writing tests. The gap between the average
performance of black and white pupils is narrower than in public
schools.
   Coleman, in a study on the high school Class of 1982, found the
dropout rate between the sophomore and senior year was 14 percent
for public school students, but only 3.4 percent for those in
Catholic school.
   Valerie Lee, a University of Michigan education professor, says,
``There is an institutional pull toward academic pursuits in
Catholic schools for all students, regardless of their ethnic,
social and academic background, that we do not see in the public
schools.''
   Fifty-four of the 149 students at Most Precious Blood are black.
Among them is 13-year-old Alethia Henson, a seventh grader. ``All
the schools I go to close down,'' she said.
   This is the third Catholic school that has gone under for her.
   The Rev. Joseph Hughes, the third pastor at Most Precious Blood
in as many years, says, ``One reason we hate to see our school
leave here is that this is our greatest evangelization tool...Most
of the people moving into the community are black, so it would be a
real opportunity to start building, but we couldn't possibly afford
to hang in there long enough to do anything like that.''
   Before becoming a priest, Hughes was a cost analyst for the
Rouse Co. ``As soon as I arrived and started looking at papers I
realized that, oh, my goodness, this doesn't seem like this is very
responsible in a parish this size carrying this much of a financial
burden.''
   The principal of Most Precious Blood, Dorothy Parker, says
enrollment had dropped from more than 200 four years ago to 149
this year.
   She expects most of her pupils to transfer to St. Anthony of
Padua School, 2{ miles away. The parishes and parents' groups have
arranged a union. St. Anthony has 416 students now and a capacity
of 700; its tuition is somewhat higher.
   The nine teachers on Parker's staff earn from $12,000 to
$18,000. Three are newlyweds without children, but some are women
raising families by themselves.
   Lynda Miller, who teaches math and science to the upper grades,
had her application in with Baltimore city and county schools even
before the news came of the closing.
   Miller said, ``It puts a lot of stress on a person. The emotions
vary. It runs from anger. You're angry because the hierarchy who
appears on the outside to care, when it comes down to the gut
level, sometimes it seems like they really don't.''
   Miller and her former husband pay $1,900 to send their daughter
to a Catholic high school. She calls Most Precious Blood ``a very
close, family-type school where God is brought into their life
throughout, not just in religion class.''
   But she says, ``I'll be honest, if I were in the county and
there was a good public school system, I'd send my kid to public
school.'' She fears that Catholic schools ``will turn more into
private, private schools where only the rich will be able to afford
it.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With foreign investment at record levels and
tourists swarming over the countryside, the Mediterranean nations
of southern Europe are starting to catch up with their
industrialized neighbors to the north. There are some persistent
problems to be sure, but one chief of state predicts the region
will become ``the motor of the European Community.''

   After decades of instability and stagnation,
Europe's southern nations are enjoying a surge of economic growth
that hints at a potential American-style Sun Belt in the Old World.
   Following World War II, a succession of shaky governments led
Italy, while Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey were ruled by
dictatorships or military-backed governments. Their economies grew
by fits and starts.
   Now, for the first time, all five countries _ three of them led
by English-speaking economists _ have governments or coalitions
likely to lead them into the 1990s. Growth rates are generally
higher than the European norm and foreign investment has reached
record levels.
   ``The center of gravity of Europe has moved south,'' says
Portuguese Premier Anibal Cavaco Silva, whose Social Democrats won
a landslide victory in the 1987 elections.
   ``The southern nations will now become the motor of the European
Community.''
   In the 1980s, Greece, Spain and Portugal joined the 12-nation
European Community, marking a more forceful Mediterranean presence
in the trade bloc, with Turkey knocking on the door for membership.
   ``The European Community would like to turn the south of Europe
into a developed area resembling the northern countries,'' says
Antonio La Pergola, Italy's Sicilian-born, Harvard-educated
minister for European Community Relations. ``This could create a
Sun Belt like in the United States in this area.''
   The Brussels-based Community forecasts that the population in
its southern tier will grow faster than in its northern areas.
   Industrialization, drawing its manpower from the higher birth
rates, may thus trigger economic growth similar to that in the
United States that led to a migration from the Northeast to the
southeastern Sun Belt states.
   Symbolizing the area's new dynamism are Spain's
multimillion-dollar preparations for the World's Fair in Seville in
1992 and the Summer Olympics in Barcelona the same year.
   Greece and Turkey are cooling their disputes over Aegean Sea oil
rights and the Mediterranean island of Cyprus to focus instead on
streamlining their old-fashioned economies.
   And Italy, the sick man of Europe in the 1970s, has become one
of its economic superstars and now claims to have replaced Britain
as the fifth richest Western nation. Nowadays, 76 percent of
Italian households have a car, compared with Britain's 58 percent,
while 81 percent have dishwashers, against 77 percent for Britain.
   But smart cars and flashy clothes are not Italy's only visible
signs of prosperity.
   Italian entrepreneurs were involved in 28 of 68 European mergers
and takeovers completed over the past two years.
   Businessmen are anticipating an economic free-for-all in 1992,
when Common Market currency and tariffs finally come down. More
than 320 million Europeans will trade goods and services in a
single market, fulfilling the visionary plans of the Community's
founders when they signed the treaty of Rome in 1957.
   Among them is Carlo De Benedettti, a 53-year-old engineer who
transformed the Olivetti typewriter firm into a computer giant and
is battling for control of the 166-year-old Societe Generale de
Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company.
   Giovanni Agnelli, head of the Fiat automakers, Italy's largest
private company, is credited with spearheading Italy's economic
revival in the early 1980s. Holdings controlled by the Agnelli
family range from communications and media properties, food
processing and biotech industries to mutual funds and robot makers.
   Illustrating newfound confidence in southern Europe, two leading
West German banks _ DeutscheBank and Bayerische Vereinsbank _ last
year took over Italian branches of BankAmerica and First National
Bank of Chicago respectively.
   Although Italy's five-party coalition government still plays
political musical chairs, the economy purrs on.
   Two days after Premier Giovanni Goria resigned on March 11, for
the third time during his seven-month tenure, the Milan stock
market recorded its largest gain since the start of the year.
   Joseph Lapalombara, a Yale University professor, argues in his
book ``Democracy, Italian Style'' that Italy's most glaring problem
_ political instability _ is more apparent than real, and is in
fact a positive measure of the country's heady spirit for survival
and change.
   Coming up fast on the west of the Mediterranean rim are Spain
and Portugal, the EEC's newest members. Both recorded 4 percent
growth rates last year, double the EEC average, contrasted with
West Germany's near zero growth last year.
   ``Portugal and Spain form the area of greatest economic growth
in the EEC and are the countries that exhibit the best economic
prospects for the next five years,'' says Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, a
Peruvian banker with First Boston International.
   In Spain, foreign investors last year poured $7.9 billion into
the economy _ twice the 1986 amount _ to fund one of Europe's
fast-track economies, moving toward what the Spaniards call ``El
Horizonte '92'' (Horizon '92).
   ``I see an important new axis, from Turin to Paris to Madrid,
bringing the center of Europe southward,'' says Juan Luis Cebrian,
the editor of Madrid's daily El Pais.
   ``Spain and Portugal are coming together in a way we would have
thought unbelievable only a few years ago,'' he says.
   The Barcelona Olympic Games and the Seville World's Fair in 1992
will create new housing, high-tech communications, and rail and
road networks, at an estimated cost of $8.9 billion.
   The streets of Madrid are now choked with shiny new cars,
triple-parked. Auto sales increased by 29 percent last year,
according to the Spanish Association of Automobile Makers.
   Using skilled Spanish labor at lower cost than in the United
States, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is building an advanced
microchip plant near Madrid. And at some rchards in Spain, Apple
computers are used to keep track of the orange crop.
   Reaching across continents, Spain has signed a $3 billion accord
with Argentina to form joint-venture companies financed by both
countries.

   ``We lost the industrial revolution, but we're going to win the
post-industrial revolution,'' says Spanish banker Jane Sola.
   What triggered Spain's development was the smooth transition
from General Francisco Franco's 40-year dictatorship to the
pro-business socialist government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   In neighboring Portugal, the European Community's poorest
member, another political switch has spurred economic growth. Prime
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva has brought stability in the wake of
16 years of revolving-door governments.
   Many wealthy Portuguese, who left the country after a 1974
leftist revolution that toppled a 42-year dictatorship, have
returned to dance in fashionable Lisbon nightspots and to present
their daughters at lavish debutante balls.
   Cavaco Silva, a 48-year-old former economics professor, is
pushing ahead with privatization of dozens of large state-owned
companies, including tobacco, banking, media and insurance
interests.
   ``The degree of confidence in Portugal is very, very high,'' the
premier says.
   The first state-controlled company to be put on the block as
part of Cavaco Silva's privatization program is EPSI, Portugal's
largest producer of polyethylene and polypropylene. The Italian
Enichem company is at the top of the list of prospective buyers.
   Cheap labor, which compares favorably with costs in Asia, has
attracted foreign manufacturers and brought unemployment down to
6.6 percent, the lowest in the EEC after Luxembourg.
   A $2-an-hour minimum wage brings in high-tech industries like
Texas Instruments, which recently launched a $43 million expansion
of an electronics plant at Oporto that employs 1,000 people.
   Tourism is also booming, with around 10 million foreigners
vacationing in Portugal every year to make the industry a
$1-billion-a-year business.
   At the other end of the Mediterranean, tourism is still Greece's
biggest foreign exchange earner. A record 8 million tourists spent
$3.2 billion last year.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's Socialist government, in a reversal
of former policy, now wants to broaden the country's economic base
and attract foreign capital into Greek firms through freer
financial markets.
   Reforms of the banking system are laying the groundwork for a
money market that will allow American brokerage houses to buy seats
on the booming Athens stock market.
   Western European investors, taking advantage of new measures
permitting their profits to be repatriated, last year poured more
than $52 million into the Athens exchange last year.
   ``Greece is changing at last,'' says John Costopoulos, president
of Creditbank, Greece's biggest private bank.
   Greeks can now apply for home mortgages and bank interest rates
are high enough to attract private depositors.
   ``Overall modernization of the economy is the basic condition
for our survival and growth,'' says National Economy Minister
Panayotis Roumeliotis, who coordinates economic policy.
   Papandreou and Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal have reached a
``no-war'' agreement and set up a hot line telephone between their
capitals to defuse tensions between the two NATO members.
   Bankers and businessmen are firmly behind the current
Greek-Turkish rapprochement.
   Turkey, which in the 17th century camped 300,000 men before the
gates of Vienna, firing cannons into the city in order to enter
Europe, applied to join the Common Market in April 1987. Greece
says it won't automatically block the application.
   Turkey, the only Islamic nation among the five southern European
countries, is making a bid to replace war-torn Lebanon as a banking
center for the Middle East.
   At the same time, its new seaside resorts are luring Western
tourists for bargain vacations. More than 3 million foreigners
spent $2 billion in Turkey last year, a 60 percent earnings
increase over 1986.
   Ozal, a former World Bank official, says that his export drive
and free-market policies _ including the privatization of state
monopolies _ brought growth of 7 percent last year that will enable
Turkey's economy ``to skip a century.''
   Luxuries like whiskey, instant coffee and French champagne are
now snapped up in Turkey, where the per capita income is half that
of Portugal.
   Massive investment in energy, transport and communications have
transformed many towns into huge construction sites. Turkey is now
planning a third bridge over the Bosporus waterway, reflecting the
country's determination to link itself with Western Europe.
   The EEC absorbs more than 40 percent of all Turkish exports, and
West Germany is home to 1.4 million Turkish workers and their
families.
   But with a 67 percent inflation rate, a currency crunch and a
huge foreign debt, Turkey still has a long way to go to reach the
prosperity of the EEC countries.
   For the other southern European countries, the worldwide October
stock market crash also highlighted persistent problems.
   _Italy is facing wildcat strikes in transport and industry, a 12
percent unemployment rate and a runaway national debt. And the
south of the country, still plagued by crime syndicates like the
Mafia, lags economically far behind the north.
   _In Greece, stagnant exports, Europe's lowest productivity and a
huge public sector deficit keep growth rates low.
   _In Spain, the Socialists are troubled by Europe's highest
unemployment _ 21 percent in 1987 _ and union protesters filled the
streets of Madrid when the government suggested that state and
private employers not grant wage hikes of more than 5 percent.
   _In Portugal, the per capita income of $2,500 is only half that
of Spain and Premier Cavaco Silva concedes that people still go
hungry.
   And if the pace of development can't be speeded up in southern
Europe, the economic spurt that is ending Mediterranean poverty may
run out of steam in the competitive post-1992 market.
   ``Unless there's cohesion among the 12 EEC nations, development
in the southern regions will be like quicksand,'' says La Pergola,
the Italian minister. ``Cohesion must start at the bottom, the
south, through new forms of financial engineering.''

   ROME (AP) _ Here are brief biographies of the leaders of five
key nations in southern Europe.
   
   ITALY _ Christian Democratic Premier Giovanni Goria, 44, who
resigned March 11, has been asked by President Francesco Cossiga to
remain as caretaker premier until a new leader is chosen.
   Party leader Ciriaco De Mita is currently trying to put together
another five-party coalition.
   Goria, a former accountant from the northern city of Asti, was a
surprise choice for premier when he took office on Aug. 1, 1987 at
the head of the shaky coaltaly's 47th postwar
government. Goria was Italy's youngest premier ever.
   Goria previously served as treasury minister and was credited in
that post with loosening the country's restrictive foreign exchition that
was Iange
controls and with helping to bring double-digit inflation to its
present level of about 5 percent.
   He is married and has two children.
   
   SPAIN _ Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a 46-year-old Seville
labor lawyer, took office in December 1982 following a landslide
victory of his Socialist Party. He had no previous government
experience but was head of the parliamentary opposition after Spain
returned to democracy in 1977.
   Gonzalez is married to sch
   
   ROME (AP) _ World War II left the nations of southern Europe
bombed-out and poor, devastated by six years of combat while a few
neutral countries led by dictators watched from the sidelines.
   Italy was brought to its knees by the Nazi occupation and the
Allied invasion, while right-wing dictators kept a tight grip on
Spain and Portugal. Greece was plunged into civil war between
Communists and nationalists. Moslem Turkey was reeling from abrupt
change wrought by wartime contact with the West.
   Italy struggled back on track after 21 years of rule by Fascist
dictator Benito Mussolini with elections in 1946. Funds from the
U.S. Marshall Plan laid the groundwork for industrialization.
   The Christian Democrats, in power through much of the postwar
period, presided over dramatic economic expansion by the 1960s that
was termed an ``economic miracle.'' But in the 1970s, political
instability and worker unrest brought economic crisis and fueled
terrorism led by the leftist Red Brigades.
   In Spain, the pro-German fascist regime of General Francisco
Franco won the bitter civil war of 1936-1939, but watched World War
II from neutral sidelines. In the '60s and '70s, Franco backed the
Roman Catholic Church, traditional landowners and industrialists
but suppressed free-market business initiatives.
   After Franco's death in 1975, the country quickly blossomed into
an ebullient democracy under a constitutional monarch, King Juan
Carlos.
   Portugal also watched from the sidelines under the dictatorship
of Antonio de Oliveira Salazar which lasted 42 years until 1974.
The country veered left after a 1974 revolution, but stabilized in
the 1980s under business-minded, centrist governments.
   Greece recovered economically from the devastating 1946-49 civil
war thanks to Marshall Plan funds. Political instability in the
1960s after years of right-wing government triggered the 1967
colonels' dictatorship, which collapsed after the 1974 invasion of
Cyprus. A referendum that year abolished the monarchy and made
Greece a presidential republic. The socialist government of the
1980s has moved gradually toward centrist, pro-business policies.
   Turkey remained a neutral dictatorship for much of World War II,
then declared war on Germany and Japan in 1945. The economically
backward country became a firm ally of the United States as
American aid helped cut down state capitalism in favor of free
enterprise and Westernization in the 1950s.
   A short-lived military takeover in 1960 ushered in a period of
political and economic problems that led to street violence in the
1970s by Marxist revolutionaries, right-wing ``Gray Wolves'' and
separatist Kurds. The military took over again in 1980, but a
pro-Western democracy was restored in parliamentary elections held
in 1983.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In June, the 500,000th Steinway piano, designed
by artist Wendell Castle, will be unveiled at a Carnegie Hall
concert. Yamaha, Steinway's main competitor, reaches the 500,000
mark every 2{ years on its assembly line in Japan. But at
Steinway's plant in New York, most things are still done the
old-fashioned way. That's what makes a Steinway a Steinway.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a box-shaped, soundproof room, Raymond Parada
stands before a piano keyboard pulled from its shining 9-foot body.
Parada plinks at the keys, listening carefully, making adjustments
instinctively.
   No music pours from the instrument. Parada is not a pianist.
Instead, he ``turns music boxes into Steinways,'' spending 24 hours
with the inner workings of each piano, creating concert grands for
artists from Vladimir Horowitz to Billy Taylor.
   ``The piano must allow an artist to develop his talents. It is
not like an automobile, where it works the same for everybody _ you
turn the wheel right, the automobile goes right,'' explains Parada,
who does things the old-fashioned way at Steinway & Sons.
   In fact, everything's done much the same way it's been done
since John Engelhard Steinway arrived from Germany in 1853 and
switched from cabinetmaking to keyboards. The Steinway piano is
still hand-strung, fussed and fawned over, individually numbered,
tuned and retuned by highly skilled specialists like Parada.
   It still takes one full year to create the Steinway concert
grand, ``the piano by which all others are judged,'' the product of
more than 100 patented piano-making techniques.
   It remains the choice of the great pianists _ Claudio Arrau, Van
Cliburn, Vladimir Horowitz _ as it was the choice of Ignace
Paderewski and Franz Liszt a century ago.
   ``It's the only piano for me,'' says Peter Nero. ``I was 13 when
I started in competition at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 14 when
I started at Juilliard, and it's been Steinway all the way.''
   In June, the 500,000th Steinway, designed by artist Wendell
Castle, will be unveiled at a Carnegie Hall concert. Yamaha, its
top competitor, reaches the 500,000 mark every 2{ years on its
assembly line in Japan.
   The Steinway doesn't come cheap either: The price list runs from
$7,500 to $40,000 for the 9-foot concert grand. Yamaha's least
expensive piano costs about $2,700, while its concert grand prices
are about the same as Steinway.
   How has Steinway survived 135 years, outlasting an assortment of
competitors while keeping its reputation for quality?
   ``A Steinway is a Steinway only because we don't cut any
corners,'' says John Steinway, 70, one of the last two family
members still in the piano-making business. ``We make quality,
nothing but the top quality we can make.
   ``My great-grandfather started that when he started the firm 135
years ago. I often say we're probably thickheaded and stubborn. We
stick to our principles. But it works.''
   ``The Steinway manufacturing process relies on tradition,''
offers William Garlick, an antique piano aficionado now employed as
Steinway's national field service manager. ``That tradition has
carried on, although we don't ignore technology.''
   Instead, an exacting process which combines the innovative and
the antiquated is used to create 3,400 Steinway pianos each year at
the company's 11-acre Queens factory.
   In one part of the plant, a worker hand-trims pieces of veneer
for the piano's outer surface with a 120-year-old machine. Later in
the process, a newly developed machine perfectly shapes its
soundboard to fit the piano body.
   ``Even that is not a production-line concept,'' says Bruce
Stevens, president of the firm since Steinway Musical Properties,
Inc., bought it three years ago. ``It's letting technology do
something even better than we could do it before. One man still
handles that job alone.''
   There are many answers as to what makes a Steinway a Steinway:
the input of the artists, the commitment to quality, the genius of
19th-century piano meister C.F. Theodore Steinway. But those
responses may miss the forest for the trees, which provide the
Steinway wood.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: Steinway wood.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``One of the things done right here is we use only good wood,''
says Garlick. ``We have people constantly looking throughout the
world for good wood.''
   The wood _ imported mahogany, northeast rock maple, yellow
poplar _ is improved through aging. Air-dried outdoors for up to 18
months, the wood is then kiln-dried to remove the moisture and run
through the mill for shaving and rough shaping.
   Each piano's outer rim is bent in a process which appears more
likely to splinter wood than shape it. For the grand piano, it
involves seven men, 19 panels of wood 22 feet long, plenty of
pushing, and a winch. Amazingly, the wood doesn't break but bends
into the shape of a concert grand.
   The process is repeated 150 times a year on the machine
developed in 1880 by C.F. Theodore Steinway, the family's
acknowledged piano genius. The pieces of wood in the rim are
individually coated with old-fashioned animal glue.
   ``It sets up very fast, very strong, and it's acoustically
sound,'' Garlick explains.
   A soundboard is cut to the specifications of each rim. It's
slightly curved and ribs are attached by hand _ two more Steinway
innovations.
   But perhaps the most important function, a simple task which
determines each succeeding step, occurs in the Steinway foundry.
Metal plates shipped in from Springfield, Ohio, are punched with
two holes taken from the original drawings of Henry Engelhard
Steinway.
   Known as the reference holes, these quarter-inch puncture marks
serve no purpose other than to guide creation of the piano from
that point forward. The soundboard, the stringing, the placement of
the keyboard _ everything revolves around the two marks.
   ``It's been the same two holes since Day One,'' Garlick says.
   In the aptly named body-stretching stage, an employee climbs
inside the piano rim and pushes out with his hands and feet before
the plate and soundboard are fitted. The piano ``action'' _ its
hammers, felt and other interior parts _ are painstakingly pieced
together and subjected to repeated quality checks.
   By the time the piano is assembled, wired and shipped to Raymond
Parada's department, it has gone through 25 to 30 checkpoints. The
workers responsible for bigger jobs like soundboard placement,
piano stringing and tone adjustment often sign their work.
   ``It's an aspiration of everybody to be immortal, and so, like
an artist signs his painting, I sign the piano,'' explains Parada,
his voice growing soft. ``I put into the piano the best of myself.''
   His attitude is pervasive throughout the plant. Three
piano-stringers working side by side in the factory use three
different methods to perform their task, each convinced his way is
the right way.
   ``We don't mind that. We encourage the little rivalries between
them, because the product comes out good,'' says John Steinway, who
began his career running wood from the yard to the factory.
   The unique process at the plant means each piano will sound a
bit different. The company allows any perspective buyer, be it
Peter Nero or Peter Zero, to play several pianos and pick the one
which sounds best to them.
   The future of Steinway holds an immediate challenge: a frontal
assault by Yamaha on their once near-exclusive concert grand market.
   There are some defectors. Billy Joel played a Yamaha grand on
his recent album ``The Bridge'' and Bruce Hornsby, winner of the
1987 best new artist Grammy, doesn't use a Steinway.
   While Yamaha made its first concert grands in 1902, they only
recently began concentrating on the grand piano market.
   ``I think Yamaha's doing a very good job these days, but it's
still not a Steinway,'' says Nero, who owns four.

   For more than a century, since 1853, the male
descendants of a German immigrant cabinetmaker followed their
fathers into the business of making quality pianos.
   But the curtain appears to be coming down on that tradition. The
fourth generation of Steinways in the business apparently is the
last.
   Just two of Henry E. Steinway's descendants, both of them past
retirement age, remain with the company.
   Brothers John and Henry Z. Steinway are now consultants with
Steinway & Sons, providing the final link with the creator of the
Steinway piano, their great-grandfather.
   ``They're really involved in a special way. We value them
highly,'' says Bruce Stevens, current president of Steinway. ``What
better link do we have with the past and tradition?''
   The new generation of descendants of Henry E. Steinway chose
different routes.
   ``None of the kids were interested in coming in,'' says John
Steinway, 70, over the constant plink-plink-plink of piano-tuning
outside the office he shares with his brother. ``They all wanted to
go out and do their own thing.
   ``We've got a banker, we've got a computer expert, we've got an
architect _ we've all kinds of things in the next generation.''
   John Steinway can recall childhood dinner guests like Sergei
Rachmaninoff and Arthur Rubinstein breaking bread at the Steinway
table. His father often took the two brothers on weekend day trips
to the piano factory in Queens.
   ``I got brought in with my mother's milk, in a way,'' recalls
John, sitting inside Manhattan's Steinway Hall, an ornate piano
showcase-museum. ``I was brought up in it.''
   Walking around Steinway Hall, John is greeted time and time
again by workers he's known for years.
   ``Number 237 _ that's Horowitz's piano,'' Steinway says,
pointing to a concert grand, one of about a dozen kept in the
basement for use by visiting performers. ``That's one of his bats.''
   Steinway recalls the day he decided to become a piano man.
   ``In those days, a job was a job,'' says John, who joined the
firm in the late 1930s. ``My father said, `If you want to work with
the company, fine. You go out to the factory at 7:30 in the
morning, and start your apprenticeship.' Which I did.''
   Three years later he began moving up in the company. Henry Z.
became president of the company, while John handled marketing and
production. When the inevitable became apparent in 1972, when there
were no members of the Steinway family to move into the business,
the decision was made to sell.
   CBS Inc. purchased Steinway & Sons, but the corporation's
handling of the family trade struck a bad chord with Steinway.
   ``We were not very happy with CBS, as part of a large
corporation,'' Steinway says.
   The company was sold to Steinway Musical Properties, Inc., in
1985.
   ``It's worked out well,'' Steinway says, puffing on a cigarette
and tugging on his suspenders. ``I'm very happy, because I look to
the future and think it's good.
   ``The piano will go on.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Some people go through life with a sure touch
for the practicalities of everyday life. Others flounder. For them,
former TV reporter Betsy Ashton has written a guide designed to
keep them out of the many traps that open up in a consumer society.

   Who among us was raised with an innate knowledge
of which telephone company gives us the best deal? Who, in fact,
ever dreamed that picking a telephone company would be a way of
life in 1988?
   And if you ``wouldn't buy a used car from that man,'' whom would
you buy one from? And how do you negotiate with him when you're not
even really sure what rack and pinion means?
   What about the jungle of financial jargon that everyone else
seems to understand _ like CD's, IRA's, deferred annuity bonds,
Keoghs, municipals, etc.?
   It was simpler when people just went to the bank that gave the
best toaster. If you already had a toaster, the next toughest
choice was whether you wanted the Revere Ware pots or a non-brand
that had pretty yellow flowers on it.
   These are things that almost everyone, at some point in life _
just starting out, after a divorce, recently widowed _ must learn
to deal with without getting stung in the process.
   ``You aren't born with this knowledge. Kids of people who own
businessess or are in the financial world might know some of it,
but most of us don't,'' says Betsy Ashton, a former national
consumer affairs correspondent for television, and author of
``Betsy Ashton's Guide to Living on Your Own,'' due in bookstores
early this summer.
   ``This book is not for people who see an ad on television and
send $5 away and expect to get a diamond ring in return. They
deserve what they get. This book is for reasonably intelligent
people who must face these kinds of things for the first time and
aren't aware of the pitfalls.
   ``This book is not about the things your mother never told you,
it's about the things your father never told you,'' says Ms.
Ashton. Like taxes, audits, how much insurance you need, which
health club to join, how to pick a telephone company and how to
deal with the media if you've gotten yourself into a mess that
would incidentally make a good story.
   A lot of the advice comes from Ashton's nearly 17 years in radio
and television, first teaching art on cable TV, then covering the
courts in Washington, D.C., and later as the consumer affairs
expert there and ultimately for CBS.
   She often got tips from viewers who had been ripped off by one
scheme or another. As a local reporter, she named names and
products.
   ``That's the job of the local reporter, but I don't do that in
the book,'' she says. ``This is more of a household encyclopedia
that would be applicable anywhere.'' She explains, for instance,
some of the oldest tricks in the books, such as the bait and switch
ruse, and how not to go for the bait.
   It's a practical book. The section on health clubs, for
instance, warns against paying the annual membership fee to clubs
that haven't opened yet. Some have gone under before they got
going. Others, she warns, may be on shaky financial ground, so
check them out before handing over your check for a year's
membership.
   Also figure out what you really need. Are you paying for fancy
exercise machines that you're not likely to use. Or a swimming
pool, when what you really want is the racquet ball court? She
advises going to YMCA's or schools to see if you might get the
facilities you want much cheaper. Or, go to a club that has only
the facilities you actually intend using. It will probably be
cheaper.

   She confesses to being a victim herself, joining health clubs to
drop that extra 20 pounds that always crept back on. She finally
calculated that her demanding schedule, working long days, made it
impractical; her visits turned out to cost her $40 a session.
   Her book tells you what questions to ask up front and urges the
timid to push for answers to key questions, especially, ``What is
this going to cost me?''
   ``Healthy skepticism is important,'' she says. ``A financial
planner or an accountant should be able to explain things to you
without talking down to you and telling you to `just trust me.'
   ``Ask him or her about fees, about how much of his income is
derived from commissions, ask for references, look for possible
conflicts of interest.''
   She tells how to find out what the car dealer paid for the car
he is selling you, the toll-free 800 number to call to find out
whether the model of used car you're considering has ever been
recalled, how to spot cosmetic cover-ups on a used car.
   Ashton, 43, and recently remarried, says her book draws on files
she had kept as a television consumer expert.
   ``I spent a lot of time on the telephone updating things, and
re-interviewing people, but basically it was years and years of
reporting that went into the book,'' she says.
   If you're going to try the media, she tells you how. First, do
all the work yourself. The local reporter or columnist doesn't have
time to unearth every single aspect of your case. They get
hundreds, maybe thousands of letters from irate consumers seeking
to enlist the newspaper in their cases.
   You, the abused, must document your claim, agree to be
interviewed, and, if you live in a multimedia town, don't ship out
carbons to every reporter in town. Pick the one you like best,
offer an exclusive story, and hope for the best.
   It helps if the story is interesting and has broad appeal.
   Ashton had an unusual career trail.
   She was accepted by the Peace Corps, but fell in love and
married instead. A talented artist, whose apartment is decorated
with Ashton originals, she worked for an advertising agency, taught
art in high school, and decided that if Julia Child could teach
French cooking on television, she could teach art on there. So she
did.
   She did radio interviews around the feminist movement, covered
the courts for a Washington TV station, and worked as an artist at
the same time.
   ``You learn that lawyers are very repetitive,'' she says. ``The
first time they said something, I took notes, the second time I
started sketching the jurors and the third time I added the color.''
   She turned down the job as consumer affairs reporter the first
time it was offered.
   ``I thought it was going to be all fluff,'' she says. ``I
thought it was the equivalent of being the weather girl.
   ``The second time it was offered, it was explained that it would
be more of a Ralph Nader sort of thing. We were going after
companies and individuals that were ripping off the public. That I
liked.''
   Ashton grew up in the suburbs of Trenton, N.J. with pretty much
of a belief in the goodness of her fellow human beings.
   ``I really didn't know there were these kind of people, people
who simply preyed on others as a way of life,'' she says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He was introduced to music at the Holiness
Church in Birmingham, Ala., and a Catholic nun in Wisconsin taught
him to play the snare drum. He would go on to play with such jazz
greats as Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman and eventually form his
own band. A half-century later, Lionel Hampton is still on the
road, playing his kind of music.

   Vibraphonist Lionel Hampton, who just turned 75,
is leading a swinging band of 17 musicians mostly in their 20s,
following the beat of another generation.
   ``We're doing big business on the road,'' says Hamp, as he is
known to his friends. ``We play every night. We pack the house. I
don't have to play rock 'n' roll. I play what I always played, like
`Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar.'''
   Hampton, who was in the first racially integrated group in jazz
_ Benny Goodman's quartet _ wrote his most famous composition
``Flying Home'' in 1937. He estimates he has played it 300 times a
year for 51 years and it ``still stops the show.''
   ``I like to play with this band,'' says Hampton, who recruits
his musicians from among college graduates who majored in jazz.
``The guys are all interested. Everybody tries to play better than
he played last night. That makes it fun.
   ``I'm trying to play better than I played last night, too.''
   The band spent its annual stint in February at the University of
Idaho Lionel Hampton School of Music, where some 15,000 high
schoolers came to seminars. It opened the Jazzport at Manhattan's
South Street Seaport with two two-hour concerts on both April 1 and
2 and played a benefit for jazz radio station WBGO-FM at Town Hall
on April 7.
   After a birthday bash at Regine's here on April 19, the band
left the next day _ Hampton's 75th birthday _ on a tour of Germany,
France, Scandinavia, Austria, Switzerland and Italy.
   Hampton, who plans to campaign for the Republicans, will play
jazz festivals this summer and appear at the Hollywood Bowl and
Disneyland. He's invited to Brazil for two weeks and on a jazz
cruise for eight days.
   The grin, the unrestrained energy, buoyant personality and
showmanship are still Hampton's hallmarks _ along with his melodic
and swinging performing style.
   ``When I was a kid, I always wanted to put on a show,'' he
recalls. ``I liked to get in the moonshine at night, doing like I'm
on the stage. I always liked to be taking bows.''
   Hampton, who was born in Louisville, Ky., says that when his
father joined the Army his mother moved him to her family home in
Birmingham where he was raised by his grandmother.
   ``We used to go to the Holiness Church every time the church
door opened,'' he recalls. ``There was a swinging band there _
trumpets, saxophones, guitars. We sat down in one of the front pews
next to where the band was. When the sister beating the bass drum
would get happy and start up and down the aisles, I took the
mallets and started beating the bass drum. It was my introduction
to music.''
   Not only has he stayed with music, Hampton says, ``I also stayed
with the Bible and religion all the time.''
   A framed picture of his grandmother, Livinia Morgan, rests on
the grand piano in Hampton's Manhattan apartment. ``I was crazy
about my grandmother,'' he says.
   When the family moved to Chicago, where the schools were tough,
his grandmother sent him to a Roman Catholic school in Kenosha,
Wis. There a nun taught him how to play the snare drum, and how to
twirl the sticks, toss and catch them.
   Back in Chicago, he joined Les Hite's band as a drummer. At age
15 he followed Hite to Los Angeles and two years later they
auditioned to back Louis Armstrong at Frank Sebastian's Cotton Club
in Los Angeles.
   ``Louis liked us so well he took us recording with him,''
Hampton recalls. ``There was a set of vibes in a corner. Louis
said, `Do you know how to play it? Move it out here in the middle
of the floor and play something for me.'

   ``I had been in the Chicago Defender Newsboys Band in Chicago.
They had a xylophone; it's got the same keyboard. I played drums in
the marching band and timpani and xylophone in the concert band. We
had a good bandmaster, Maj. Endicott Smith, who had graduated in
music from the University of Heidelberg. He taught me German
harmony. Anybody interested, he would teach them.''
   Hampton had studied Armstrong's records, so on that October day
in 1930 he romped through Armstrong's trumpet solo in ``Big Butter
and Egg Man'' on the vibraphone. ``It knocked Louis out,'' Hampton
says.
   They recorded eight songs that day. On the first one, Eubie
Blake's ``Memories of You,'' Hampton played vibes while Armstrong
sang and the drums while Armstrong played his trumpet.
   The Les Hite Band backed Armstrong for nine months at the Cotton
Club. Hampton became known.
   When the engagement ended, Hampton assembled his first band.
They traveled, in four cars and a trailer for his drums and vibes,
from San Diego to Vancouver, B.C.
   ``I always played good dance music and played jazz for a show. I
built up a following,'' Hampton says. ``I play a lot of dances now.
They always ask me to make return engagements. Young people dance,
too. I'm just back from a teen-age affair in Washington. There were
5,000 kids there. We were supposed to quit at 10:30. At 12:30 they
were yelling for more and stomping on the floor.''
   In the early 1930s, Hampton traded touring for a job in the
Paradise Nightclub across the street from the Los Angeles train
station. They'd leave the doors open, Hampton says, and sailors
arriving to paint the town would come in. Beer was 25 cents a
pitcher and there was sawdust on the floor.
   ``I had a good band there,'' Hampton says. ``Benny Goodman was
at the Palomar Ballroom. John Hammond was with him. Naturally John
would ask where he could hear some good jazz. He heard us and he
brought Benny down. Lo and behold, I'm on the bandstand playing and
I hear a guy playing clarinet beside me. I could tell it was
Benny's famous clarinet. It was Aug. 19, 1936. I'll never forget.
We played like that about two hours straight. People were calling
people and they were coming from all over town. That place was
packed and jammed. We was blowing.
   ``Benny asked me to come the next morning to a recording date. I
went and we did `Moonglow' and `Dinah.' Those records got so
popular, Benny kept calling me to come to New York. We thought he
was kidding.
   ``The Paradise took the sawdust off the floor and put
tablecloths on the tables. It was $1.25 to come in. After that jam
session, you couldn't get in, even with the price of admission. We
got super-famous overnight, because Benny had come and christened
us.''
   On Nov. 11, 1936, Hampton joined the Benny Goodman Quartet at
the Pennsylvania Hotel in New York City.
   ``Everything was segregated then, black and white,'' he says.
``That night the barrier broke. You've got to give Benny credit.''
   Hampton says that black pianist Teddy Wilson had played
intermission music for Goodman Band concerts and played with
Goodman and drummer Gene Krupa as the Benny Goodman Trio on
records, but never live until that Nov. 11 when the trio became a
quartet.
   ``I had four gorgeous years with Benny,'' Hampton says. ``Then
Benny had back trouble and his doctor told him to rest awhile. He
got me a contract at RCA and I started making all-star records.
They're re-issuing them.''
   In between gigs, Hampton supervises his philanthropies, the
Lionel Hampton Ear Research Foundation and the Lionel Hampton
Endowment Fund, which gives college scholarships. The Lionel
Hampton Community Development Corporation added money to government
money to build the low-income Gladys Hampton Houses, named for his
late wife, and Lionel Hampton Houses in Harlem and middle-income
Hampton Hills in Newark.

   The year is 1938: Hitler annexes Austria, the
Munich Pact lets Germany partition Czechoslovakia, Wrong-Way
Corrigan flies from New York to Dublin, and a brash young comedian
gets his own radio show on NBC.
   ``Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is Bob Hope for
Pepsodent...We're broadcasting from NBC's new building...They tell
me it costs more than Mrs. Roosevelt's annual train fare.''
   Bob Hope hit the airwaves running, ski nose into the wind,
poking fun at every sacred cow in sight.
   As he turns 85 on May 29 and celebrates 50 years with NBC, first
on radio and then on television, Hope hasn't slowed down one bit.
   Over lunch in a sunny corner of his estate in the Toluca Lake
section of Los Angeles (he has equally large digs in Palm Springs),
Hope explains that with less than two weeks before he tapes an
all-star birthday and anniversary salute, he was flying off to
perform in Kansas City, Chicago and Columbus, Ohio.
   After the two-hour special is taped, he will visit Korea for
five days for pre-Olympic ceremonies. On the date of the telecast,
Monday, May 16, he'll be performing in Anaheim, Calif.
   The special, reflecting Hope's penchant for long titles, is
called ``Happy Birthday Bob _ 50 Stars Salute Your 50 Years With
NBC.'' Besides the 20 or more stars who will be at the taping,
another 50 or so will appear in clips from past Hope shows.
   Hope's radio show lasted until 1952. He started on television in
1950.
   ``I came to Hollywood in 1937,'' he says, ``but before that I
was on radio back East. I did a monologue on a show with Shep
Fields and his Rippling Rhythm.''
   He also appeared with Dick Powell on `Hollywood Parade.'''
   Hope was the toast of Broadway in such plays as ``Roberta,''
``Say When'' and ``Red Hot and Blue.''
   He might have come to Hollywood sooner than he did but he was a
little miffed at the studios' lack of enthusiasm over his screen
test and held out for three years.
   Finally, he signed with Paramount and launched his film career
with ``The Big Broadcast of 1938.'' Another star in the movie was
Dorothy Lamour, who was later to appear with Hope and Bing Crosby
in all the ``Road'' pictures.
   ``There was a song in the picture they wanted me to sing,'' Hope
says. ``I showed it to Dolores (his wife, a former singer) and she
didn't think too much of it. The song was `Thanks for the Memory.'''
   The song won the Oscar that year and it became Hope's theme
song. He would later do a film called ``Thanks for the Memory.''
   ``I'd never done a full-length picture before and the director
told me everything was done with the eyes,'' he says. ``You have to
see it to believe it. I did everything but throw my eyes over my
shoulders.''
   On radio, his band leader was Skinnay Ennis, his comic sidekick
was Jerry Colonna and at various times his singers included Frances
Langford, Judy Garland and Doris Day.
   ``We got off to a slow start, but once we started we went to
first in the ratings very fast,'' he says. ``It was a combination
of pictures and radio. Each helped the other. We followed `Fibber
McGee and Molly' on Tuesday nights and Red Skelton came after us.''
   Hope and Crosby were frequent guests on each other's radio
shows, in addition to the ``Road'' movies.
   Once Lucille Ball asked Hope to find a place for her husband,
band leader Desi Arnaz. He was on the show for two years and never
got a laugh. ``I met him later, after `I Love Lucy,' and I said to
him, `You mean you're getting laughs?''' Hope says. ``He fell down
laughing.''
   Hope launched his television career on Easter Sunday 1950 with a
live broadcast from the roof of the New Amsterdam Theater in New
York. His guests were Dinah Shore, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Bea
Lillie.
   Hope, finishing lunch with ice cream and a cookie, sighs and
asks, ``Do you have any idea how many jokes I've done? Early in my
career I did all kinds of jokes. I'd do Italian jokes. People
laughed, but I was terrible with dialects.
   ``I was emcee at the Oriental Theater in Chicago, which showed
movies. I'd introduce the band and other acts and tell jokes. After
that I went into vaudeville. I had two offers but took the Keith
Circuit so I could play the Palace Theater in New York. Out of that
I got onto Broadway and got offers from Hollywood.''
   Hope doesn't answer his own question about how many jokes he's
told. But he does have a secretary pull the scripts from his early
radio shows from the files. He has two massive vaults in a building
on the estate grounds where he keeps all of his material.
   He leafs through a loose-leaf binder holding 50-year-old jokes.
``My uncle ran for office once and the pace was kind of slow...I
pulled back the curtain on a voting machine and what do you think I
found? A guy still voting for Hoover.''
   Another joke: ``I saw a brass band down at the train station.
That is, I thought it was a brass band. I found out later it was
just a shipment of spittoons going to the Republican convention.''

   On her 17th birthday last fall, Linzi Hateley
got a plum of a present, the title role in ``Carrie,'' the new
Broadway musical about a girl with telekinetic powers.
   At the time, Miss Hateley was a student at the Italia Conti
Academy, a drama school in London. Her acting credentials were
meager: a British touring company of ``Annie'' and a small part on
a television series.
   But the next day she was the Cinderella story in the London
tabloids. ``Unknown lands lead in major show co-produced by the
prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company.''
   ``It didn't sink in at all until I settled down and started
rehearsing,'' Miss Hateley says now. It has been a turbulent and
fast-paced few months.
   ``Carrie'' is based on the Stephen King novel that most people
remember as a movie with Sissy Spacek playing the troubled
teen-ager. In the film, Carrie is taunted and tormented by other
high school students and her mother before she gets revenge on prom
night.
   ``I was told right from the beginning not to try and base myself
on Sissy Spacek,'' Miss Hateley recalls. ``The musical tries to
follow the book rather than the film because the show really is
more of a tragedy than a horror story.''
   ``Carrie'' is a unique collaboration of American and British
theater people. With the blessing of actors' unions in both
countries, the show has a joint Anglo-American cast.
   The director is Terry Hands, artistic head of the Royal
Shakespeare Company. The music and lyrics were written by Michael
Gore and Dean Pitchford, the men who wrote ``Fame.'' Debbie Allen,
Broadway's recent ``Sweet Charity,'' did the choreography.
   The show was to co-star Barbara Cook as Carrie's bizarre and
vindictive mother, but Miss Cook, dissatisfied with her role, left
after the show's engagement in Stratford, England, the home base of
the Royal Shakespeare Company.
   ``Barbara was so nice,'' Miss Hateley says. ``She's so motherly
and was always lovely to me. I think she didn't want to be nasty,
which is what the part requires.''
   Betty Buckley, who played the gym teacher in the movie version
of ``Carrie,'' has now taken over the role of the mother.
   ``She came in and said, `Let's get into this,''' Miss Hateley
says. ``The score hasn't really changed a lot since then, just the
way that it is being done has. It's becoming a little weirder now.
Before it was very melodic. Now it's stranger.''
   Miss Hateley is from a small town near Birmingham in central
England. Her father is a toolmaker and her mother a secretary.
Neither had any theatrical aspirations. Their daughter, the second
of two children, did.
   ``When I was very young, I had a lot of energy,'' Miss Hateley
says.``I was always a real pain until I started dancing and got rid
of some of that energy.''
   She was sent to the local dancing school and got jobs in
community productions. At the age of 14, she was accepted by the
Italia Conti in London, and her parents took out loans to pay the
expensive tuition.
   ``I'm paying them back now out of my salary,'' Miss Hateley
says. ``They did so much for me.''
   While at the school, she auditioned for ``Carrie,'' singing ``On
My Own'' from ``Les Miserables.'' After a second audition, she got
the job.
   Her parents came to see the musical in Stratford and were
surprised at her performance.
   ``They knew that I sang well and obviously they were very
confident in me or they wouldn't have let me go to the theater
school in the first place,'' Miss Hateley says. ``But more than
anything, they were shocked with the acting I was doing. They had
never really seen me act.''
   The young actress worked closely with Hands, best known on
Broadway as the man who staged the RSC productions of ``Much Ado
About Nothing'' and ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' with Derek Jacobi and
Sinead Cusack.
   It wasn't until the show moved to New York and started to
rehearse again that Miss Hateley began to understand her character.
   ``I've just suddenly come to realize that the whole thing about
Carrie is that she really is quite an intelligent person,'' Miss
Hateley says. ``She doesn't have to be ugly and she doesn't have to
be awkward. She can be quite beautiful in her own way. She's just
different.''
   When Miss Hateley first started doing the role, she wondered how
she could keep up the intense pace required by it. Now she is
getting used to it.
   ``I take everything as it comes and even if the show isn't a
success, it's still a great achievement for me and a great
experience,'' Miss Hateley says. ``I listen to everybody's advice.
I'm not saying that I always take it but if I listen to it all,
then I can make my own decisions. I'm learning so much and so
quickly. I have to.''

<TEXT>
   On May 13, 1888, Princess Isabel of
Brazil signed the Golden Law and 780,000 slaves went free, three
centuries after blacks first came in bondage from Africa.
   A hundred years later the Brazilian government is commemorating
the event with tributes to what it calls ``racial democracy.''
   Blacks, however, maintain that widespread prejudice and
inequality leave them little to celebrate.
   President Jose Sarney has designated May 13 a national holiday.
The government, the media and the Roman Catholic Church have begun
nationwide campaigns aimed at portraying Brazil's multi-racial
society as integrated.
   But while millions of Brazilian blacks and whites live and work
side by side in apparent harmony, many here contend that ``racial
democracy'' is a myth.
   ``Abolition of slavery here was merely a legal act. It has meant
little in reality,'' said Arnaldo Beltrami, spokesman for the
Brazilian Bishops council, which in the world's largest Catholic
nation is given great importance.
   The Golden Law, already approved by the national legislature,
was signed by Princess Isabel while her father, Emperor Dom Pedro
II, was out of the country. The 780,000 slaves joined millions of
other blacks already released from bondage and they were left to
fend for themselves without education, training or jobs.
   It happened 25 years and 134 days after Abraham Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation in the United States.
   As the slavery issue helped set off the Civil War in the United
States, abolition in Brazil, without compensation to slave owners,
was a factor in the ouster of Dom Pedro's monarchy and the
establishment of Brazil as an republic.
   Today, blacks and mulattoes make up about 80 million of Brazil's
143 million people. They are prominent in sports and entertainment
_ among them the soccer great Pele, singer-composer Milton
Nascimento and actor-vaudevillean Grande Othello.
   But political leaders, army generals, corporate executives,
diplomats and bishops are almost exclusively the descendants of
white Portuguese colonizers or other white European immigrants.
   The 559-seat national Congress has just seven black members.
   Help-wanted ads still specify that applicants should have a
``good appearance,'' meaning they should be white.
   Blacks are unwelcome in many restaurants, bars and upper-class
apartment buildings, where doormen sometimes force them to use the
service entrance.
   ``Blacks here are found in hillside shantytowns, working as
maids or as manual laborers, in prisons and in juvenile delinquency
centers,'' said Benedita da Silva, Brazil's first black
congresswoman and a former maid.
   To the casual observer, Brazil is an astonishing blend of racial
types.
   Centuries of racial mixing, starting with the Portuguese, native
Indians and then African slaves, have produced a range of skin hues
and hair types that the country's Portuguese language defines in
120 different ways.
   Much of Brazilian culture also comes from black Africa,
including samba music, many typical national dishes such as
``feijoada'' black bean stew, cachaca sugar cane liquor, and
popular voodoo-type spirit religions.
   President Sarney, in announcing the May 13 holiday, spoke of a
mixed-race people ``living and growing in harmony.'' He held up
Brazil as a model for nations like South Africa.
   TV GLobo, the country's largest private television network, for
several months has been broadcasting a public service announcement
with well-known black performers and athletes wishing viewers
``Axe'' (pronounced ah-SHEH), an African word meaning ``good luck''
and ``power.''
   Another TV message sponsored by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of Rio de Janeiro shows a black hand and a white hand slowly
clasping while a voice says, ``Many races, one people.''
   The government-controlled Bank of Brazil is paying for a similar
media campaign.
   But racial prejudice still runs deep.
   Paulo de Jesus, 18, lives with his father and four brothers and
sisters in a crumbling Portuguese colonial-era house in Salvador, a
city of 1.8 million, about 1,120 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
Salvador was Brazil's capital in the 17th century and as the
principal slave port became a center of black culture.
   Paulo de Jesus said he does not feel discriminated against, but
he added that he often is stopped, searched and asked for
identification by police officers. Twice he has been arrested on
``suspicion,'' he said.

   In a recent independent survey, 309 Brazilian youngsters 7 to 18
years old were asked to look at photographs of a white and a black
person and to link certain characteristics to each. The survey
indicated that 82.9 percent of the children considered the black
man ``stupid,'' 85.7 percent found him ``ugly'' and 84.2 percent
saw him as ``a thief.'' In comparison, the percentages,
respectively, for the white were 17.1, 14.3 and 15.8.
   In Rio de Janeiro, a black businesswoman married to a white
Swiss citizen told the newspaper Jornal do Brasil that when she
tried to pay for dinner by check at a fashionable nightclub, the
management refused to accept it, apparently in the belief the
checkbook was stolen.
   ``They insulted me and threw me out,'' Elisabeth da Silva
Zobrist told the paper. ``I called the police and ended up with the
manager at the precinct station. They accepted my check only after
the police chief called up my house and confirmed I was who I said
I was.''
   Blacks also lag behind whites in education and income.
   A government census showed blacks on average complete just 2.1
years of schooling, compared to 4.8 years for whites. And blacks
earn 47 percent less than whites doing the same work, according to
a 1985 labor union study.
   ``Blacks have never been integrated into Brazilian society as
full citizens,'' said the black composer and singer Gilberto Gil,
who also is the Bahia state secretary of culture.
   ``We need to think about what Princess Isabel's signature on a
piece of paper actually meant for us, if anything,'' Gil added in
an interview in his office in Salvador, Bahia's capital.
   Starting in the 1500s, Brazil brought in an estimated 3.6
million West Africans to work on sugar, cotton and coffee
plantations and to mine gold and diamonds.
   The abolitionist movement grew after 1850, when the government
outlawed slave trading. In 1871 the Free Womb Law declared that
children born of slave mothers would be considered free.
   When Brazil finally abolished slavery, it was the last country
in the Western Hemisphere to do so, and under sharp international
censure.
   ``The emancipation actually took the wind out of a growing
abolitionist movement. Maybe our lives would be different if the
law had not been signed just then,'' said the black historian and
activist Joao Jorge Rodrigues. He suggested Brazil could have taken
more time to prepare blacks for citizenship.
   But the documentary history of slavery in Brazil was virtually
erased in 1891 when Finance Minister Ruy Barbosa had the records of
slave trade burned on grounds that the country should look ahead
and forget its ``African'' past.
   Possibly because of that, black consciousness today is dim and
black pride almost non-existent. Few black rights groups or
activists exist. Many mixed-race Brazilians seek to appear whiter
and climb the social ladder.
   ``There is no such thing as `black' here,'' said Januario
Garcia, head of the Institute for Research on Black Culture in Rio
de Janeiro. ``People use any word but black to define themselves.
They want to be as white as possible.''
   Still, in this centennial year, awareness of discrimination is
growing.
   At Rio de Janeiro's famous pre-Lenten Carnival parades this past
February, many of the poor, mostly black groups competing for
prizes with floats and samba music chose racism as their themes,
rather than the usual folklore motifs.
   The champion group, Vila Isabel, offered a tribute to Zumbi,
leader of a 17th century slave revolt and a hideaway for runaway
slaves. The runnerup was the Mangueira school, which sang of blacks
``free from the master's whip, but trapped in the slums.''
   Many black groups said they don't intend to celebrate the May 13
holiday but planned festivities for Nov. 20.
   That is the anniversary of the death of Zumbi, killed in 1695 by
Portuguese troops who defended slave owners.
   ``We need to celebrate black strength, not a gift from white
men,'' Garcia said.

   Armed conflicts are besetting the government of
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in India, a nation troubled as well by
a host of other problems that stem from its very own diversity. In
addition to a conflict in Punjab, where militant Sikhs are fighting
to forge their own nation in India's North, another group of fierce
fighters, the Gurkhas, are waging battle to separate from
Marxist-led West Begali state in India's East. Farther east,
refugees from a little-known, 11-year war by Buddhist guerrillas
are spilling across India's border from the Chittigong Hills of
Bangladesh as bloodshed mounts there. Associated Press reporters in
New Delhi recently traveled to India's three hotspots and filed the
accompanying reports.

<TEXT>
   The severed heads of a school principal
and a journalist were left hanging in plastic bags in a town square
set among lovely, wooded hills. Their foreheads were smeared with
vermilion _ a Gurkha mark of revenge.
   The killings in April were among the most brutal in the two-year
campaign by Gurkhas, famed as soldiers in the British and Indian
armies, for the creation of a separate Indian state called
Gurkhaland around this once-tranquil vacation retreat.
   Subash Ghising, 52-year-old leader of the Gurkha agitation, has
been negotiating with Indian government officials, but in an
interview with The Associated Press he seemed in no mood to
compromise.
   ``We want blood for blood, an eye for an eye, and we will settle
for nothing less than a homeland for the Gurkhas,'' he said at his
well-guarded headquarters in Darjeeling, which also is famous for
its tea.
   So far, Ghising's repeated trips to New Delhi have swayed Indian
officials to offer the Gurkha area some governmental power and
development funds, but not to make it India's 26th state.
   The killing goes on, with at least 275 deaths recorded since the
agitation started in April 1986.
   Some officials of West Bengal state, which now governs the area,
say privately the dispute has the potential to lead to more
dangerous demands for a separate country, as militant Sikhs have
done in Punjab state.
   The Gurkhas, who are Indians of Nepalese descent, want 2,250
square miles around Darjeeling, an area slightly larger than
Delaware, as a Gurkha state within India. They say their hilly
homeland is different from the flatlands around the West Bengal's
capital, Calcutta, and that they are ethnically distinct from the
Bengalis.
   The Gurkhas say about 1.4 million Gurkha people live around
Darjeeling and 4.6 million live elsewhere in India. They first came
here in the 1850s to make their way as soldiers or as workers on
tea plantations.
   Ghising, a former army corporal, teacher and bantamweight boxer,
says government force can only aggravate the problem.
   ``By provoking us, by killing or wounding our men, the
government is creating wounded tigers,'' he said. ``You know what a
wounded tiger does? It hunts for men and devours them.''
   Nowadays, only police officers are seen at night outside the
quaint, old houses built by the British who developed Darjeeling as
a ``hill station.''
   Fears have worsened since April 6 when school principal Dileswar
Rai's severed head was found in Kalimpong, 43 miles east of
Darjeeling. He had kept his school open during a general strike
called by Gurkha militants.
   The severed head of Nirmal Rai, a reporter for a local
newspaper, was found at the same place April 12. The journalist,
who was not related to the principal, was accused of being a police
informer.
   The government's response to the violence has been building up a
force of more than 4,000 security forces and paramilitary police
who often open fire with mortars and machine guns.
   ``We are fighting a very well entrenched enemy and the terrain
is in their favor,'' said Raj Kanojia, a police superintendent in
charge of anti-insurgency operations.
   Amid the violence, the tea and tourist trades are suffering. A
backlash by Marxist-controlled unions has forced 30,000 Gurkha
laborers to flee from tea estates to refugee camps in Darjeeling
and the adjoining state of Sikkim.
   Gurkha insurgents have felled at least 2,000 pine trees to block
roads. More than 600 homes have been burned by insurgents or
Marxists who support the Calcutta government.
   More than 250 government buildings have been set ablaze,
including two stations of the ``Toy Train,'' built in 1879 by the
British and so called for its tiny cars and narrow-gauge track.
   The Gurkha campaign also has triggered fears for the security of
the seven strategically important northeastern states near China,
with whom India has a long-standing border dispute.
   The northeast, an area about the size of Colorado, is connected
to the main part of India by a narrow land corridor called the
Siliguri Neck in the envisoned Gurkhaland.
   Ghising, the Gurkha leader, now brushed aside the question of
secession.
   ``We are Indians and we will remain Indians,'' he said.
   But Ghising, who also is the author of more than 20 racy,
potboiler novels in the Nepali language, made it clear he is not
going to give in without achieving his goals.
   He sits in an office guarded by tough-looking Gurkas with their
traditonal curved, 14-inch kukri knives. Behind him is a green
Gurkhaland flag emblazoned with a kukri and three stars.
   He reeled off his demands:
   _Recognition of Nepali as an official Indian language.
   _More government jobs for Gurkhas.
   _Better education and more industry.
   ``If we do not get statehood for Gurkhaland, the Indian
government will regret it,'' he added. ``They have seen only a
flash of Gurkha retaliation, Gurkha courage, Gurkha dedication, but
if we are pushed, we will start a full scale, non-stop
retaliation.''
   About 48,000 retired Gurkha soldiers live in Darjeeling, and
Indian officials fear they could join Ghising's campaign.
   Above the town, a giant graffiti painted on a mountain slope
shows blood dripping from a kukri knife.
   Below it reads: ``Welcome to Gurkhaland.''

   The killing goes on as it has for six
years and the prospects for peace talks have grown slimmer in the
war waged by Sikh militants for an autonomous homeland in the
Indian state of Punjab.
   In an apparent move to open peace talks, Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi freed a radical Sikh priest from jail, but then he said he
would talk only within the framework of the Indian Constitution.
   The militants responded that they will not negotiate until the
government accepts their demand for the independent Sikh nation of
Khalistan, a concept that is very much outside the Consititution.
   ``We will continue tofight in the same manner until we get
Khalistan,'' said Jagir Singh, spokesman for the Panthic Committee,
an underground umbrella grouping of militant Sikh groups.
   ``It is not a demand,'' he said in an interview. ``It is our
right.''
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are a
majority in Punjab. Sikh militants claim they are being subjugated
by Hindus, who form 80 percent of the population.
   The Sikh agitation has claimed at least 735 lives this year and
the violence has worsened recently.
   More than 350 people have been killed in the six weeks since
Gandhi freed the radical Sikh priest Jasbir Singh Rode from jail.
   The killings blamed on Sikh militias have raised fears that the
government would turn a harsher face toward Punjab. At the same
time the priest was freed, Gandhi pushed through Parliament a bill
that would allow the government to clamp emergency rule on Punjab,
severely limiting individual rights.
   Jagir Singh was asked in the interview if he expected a
government move to drive out the radicals who have taken refuge in
the Golden Temple, the Sikh holy place in Amitsar.
   ``We are ready for an attack,'' he said.
   He characterized the militants' attitude with a Punjabi proverb:
``A brick will be replied to with a stone.''
   Indian officials seek to play down the possibility of a raid on
the temple. An army raid in 1984 left more than 1,200 people dead,
most of them Sikhs, and the desecration of the shrine angered the
entire Sikh community. Five months later, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi's mother, was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards
in an act of revenge.
   Police officers in Amritsar see little hope that conciliatory
moves by the government would end the violence.
   ``These people kill nearly 10 people every day,'' said Izhar
Alam, Amritsar district police superintendent. ``We must take
strong action.''
   He added this should include sending security forces into the
Golden Temple, where about 100 armed militants are believed to have
taken shelter.
   Alam also said police alone could not raid the temple complex.
   ``Other forces will have to be included,'' he said. ``The
militants have AK-47 automatic rifles and carbines. All we (the
police) have is .303 rifles and pistols.''
   The biggest impediment to any plan to raid the militants'
sanctuary is a threat held out by Rode, the freed priest.
   ``If the government enters the temple, they will be laying the
foundation for Khalistan,'' Rode said.
   He spoke at a meeting April 13 of about 40,000 Sikhs in south
Punjab. It was his first major appearance since his release and
there were reports he would encourage moderation among the
militants and that a peaceful approach would come from the meeting.
   But most speakers urged more agitation. While Rode did not
directly support moves for Khalistan, he called for continuing a
movement to ``free Sikhs from the bonds of slavery.''
   ``His demands are the same as ours,'' Jagir Singh said a day
later.
   Rode, named to the most influential Sikh religious post shortly
after his release, denies entering into any deals with authorities.
He says the only way for a solution is for the government to talk
directly to the Sikh militants.
   Even moderate Sikhs believe the government should make the first
move for peace, such as freeing hundreds of Sikh youths jailed as
suspected militants.
   Devinder Singh, a farmer at the mass meeting of Sikhs, said the
government first has to prove it wants a settlement.
   ``People in Punjab distrust the government,'' he said. ``We have
been let down too many times. Let them offer something first.''

   Makeshift Buddhist pagodas dot the
jungle across the border from here in Bangladesh. But the rumble of
military vehicles and, sometimes, bursts of gunfire shatter the
tranquil setting, reminders that a little-known bush war that began
11 years ago still rages.
   The hymns of monks are silenced as terror flashes through the
refugee camps filled with Chakma tribespeople on this side of the
border.
   The Chakmas, descendants of the warlike Mongols who once surged
across Asia, are fighting the Bangladesh government to hold onto
their land, their Buddhist religion and their age-old customs
against an influx of Moslem settlers.
   Chakma guerrilla leaders say at least 4,000 people have died in
the cycle of killings and bloody reprisals since the Chakmas took
up arms in May 1977 and killed 40 Bangladesh policemen in their
first ambush.
   The battle is vicious, unequal, unremitting and rarely reported.
   Bangladesh seldom allows foreign reporters to visit the Chakmas'
ancestral homeland in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
   India does not permit foreign journalists to travel to its
border states housing the refugees, but Indian reporters can make
the trip with police permission.
   The Chittagong Hill Tracts, which roll over 5,138 square miles
in southern Bangladesh, border Burma and the northeastern Indian
states of Tripura and Mizoram.
   Belonia Hills is the region in India's Tripura state that faces
the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
   In camouflage uniforms of war, Bangladeshi soldiers move from
village to village in the deep woods and jungles of the hill
tracts, often firing at random to frighten away the Chakmas,
sometimes to kill them, said Bakul Chakma, a refugee at the
Takumbari camp 10 miles from the border.
   The battle, often fought at midnight on jungle paths traveled by
elephants and reptiles, pits 20,000 Bangladeshi soldiers and 40,000
paramilitary troops and policemen against 4,000 guerrillas.
   In the past two years, more than 50,000 tribespeople have fled
to India's Tripura state to avoid the fighting.
   ``We tried enough persuasion. When nothing worked, we took up
arms,'' said Priti Kumar Chakma, a leader of the tribespeople's
``Shanti Bahini,'' or Army for Peace.
   ``What option do we have other than killing those who want to
finish us?'' the 41-year-old guerrilla said in an interview
arranged on condition the location not be disclosed.
   In 1987 Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, said it had received ``increasing reports of
arbitrary arrests, torture and extrajudicial executions'' of
tribespeople in the Chittagong Hill Tracts by Bangladeshi troops.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's government in Bangladesh has
denied the allegations. It says it wants to develop the area and
has pledged the local currency equivalent of $90 million to help
tribesmen come down from the hills and join mainstream society.
   Islam is the official religion of Bangladesh, and about 80
percent of its 105 million people are Moslems. The remainder are
Hindus, Buddhists and Christians.
   Ershad's government in Dhaka, about 200 miles northwest of the
hill tracts, says it is absurd for the Chakmas to demand 11 percent
of the land in Bangladesh when they make up less than 0.5 percent
percent of the population.
   Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated nations.
   Most of the 600,000 tribespeople in the Chittagong Hill Tracts
are Chakmas. The others are Mogs and Tripuraies.
   So far about 300,000 Moslems have settled in the area and
thousands of Chakmas have been evicted from their homes in the deep
woods and moved to what the Dhaka government calls ``ideal
villages.''
   ``The so-called ideal villages are nothing but concentration
camps,'' charged Bimal Larma, a Chakma guerrilla.
   In addition to land, the Chakmas are demanding autonomy, but
this has been rejected by the government.
   The tribespeople, who speak a mixture of Tibetan-Burmese
dialects, fear they will become a minority in the hills where they
have lived for centuries.
   Their political wing, the United People's Party, charges that
some tribespeople have been forcibly converted to Islam and that
Moslem settlers are encouraged to marry Buddhist girls.
   ``We have no similarities at all with the Moslems,'' said
refugee Ranjit Narayan. ``We love pork; they despise it. We worship
Buddha; they follow Islam. Unless forced, we do not kill, but they
kill us at the slightest provocation.'' Narayan, 54, fled to India
in 1986 with his wife, four sons and a daughter.
   ``I have seen my neighboring villages being burned, women raped
and men killed. I told my wife, `We can't stay here anymore. Let us
go.' '' he said.
   They walked four days to reach Takumbari, the largest of seven
refugee camps in Tripura. The camps, which house 50,586 refugees,
have no electricity. The houses are made of bamboo and roofed with
dry leaves.
   Since Takumbari was set up two years ago, it's population has
swollen to 15,510. In that time, 546 people have died of disease
and 549 children have been born.
   The Indian government gives each adult and teen-ager a daily
ration of 14 ounces of rice and about two ounces each a day of
lentils and dry fish, plus 20 paise (about one U.S. cent). Children
under 12 get half-rations.
   Bangladesh has accused India of aiding the Chakma rebels.
   ``This is absurd. We have enough problems of our own,'' Tripura
Interior Minister Samir Ranjan Burman said. ``We are helping the
Chakmas on purely humanitarian grounds.
   ``We cannot push them back, it would mean certain death for
them.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Zelly and Me''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Once upon a time in Hollywood the ``woman's picture'' held sway.
American women flocked to matinees and sobbed and sympathized with
the plight of such stars as Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Norma
Shearer and Greta Garbo.
   No more. Movie matinees are largely populated by small fry and
weary shoppers in malls.
   ``Zelly and Me'' arrives a few decades late. It is patently a
woman's picture: the writer-director, co-producer and leading
performers are women.
   However, despite the best performance yet by Isabella
Rossellini, the film cannot escape a pervading preciousness, and
its chances of finding a wide audience of both sexes seem slender
indeed.
   The Zelly of the title is Mademoiselle (Rossellini), the
European nanny whose life is devoted to her young charge, the
orphaned Phoebe (Alexandra Jones). They live in a mansion presided
over by Phoebe's autocratic grandmother, Coco (Glynis Johns).
   Zelly and Phoebe occupy a fantasy world of stuffed animals, all
with special names and identities, and they share a devotion to the
legend of Joan of Arc (filmgoers will recall that Miss Rossellini's
mother, Ingrid Bergman, portrayed Joan of Arc on the screen).
   For reasons that aren't quite clear, Coco punishes the child for
faultless infractions. The punishments become more severe, even
sadistic. Phoebe, whose parents were killed in a fiery plane crash,
burns herself in retaliation.
   The nanny helplessly watches Phoebe's torment, finding solace
only in day-off meetings with the neighbor in another mansion
(David Lynch). When Zelly is fired by the enraged grandmother, the
pair dream up a scheme to spirit away Phoebe. The conclusion brings
happiness to no one.
   ``Zelly and Me'' is the first feature film by Tina Rathborne,
and it appears at least partly autobiographical. Her attention to
the details of girlhood becomes almost unbearably cloying, and only
in the latter portions does the film gain any momentum.
   Within the confines of a largely ineffectual role, Rossellini
performs with an inner radiance hauntingly like her mother's.
Johns, absent too long from the screen, is effective in a seemingly
unrewarding role. Alexandra Jones is a gifted young actress, fully
capable of occupying the screen by herself.
   David Lynch, director of ``Blue Velvet,'' makes his acting debut
as the neighbor who is not what he seems. He seems stiff in the
role, needful of the direction of, say, David Lynch.
   The Columbia Pictures release was produced by Sue Jett and Tony
Mark. The rating is PG; small children might be frightened by the
girl's punishment. Running time: 87 minutes.

   That wonderful magic from the Disney animation
wand will be in video stores on May 31 in time for summer rentals
and sales.
   Walt Disney Home Video is also offering a limited edition Mickey
Mouse videocassette to help celebrate Mickey's 60th birthday. The
original feature includes snippets from some of the mouse's
greatest hits, including the Socerer's Apprentice segment from
``Fantasia.''
   Other Disney features for summer fun include ``Mickey and the
Beanstalk,'' ``Donald in Mathmagic Land'' and ``The Reluctant
Dragon.''
   And hold on to your feathers, duck fans: Disney also plans to
release three volumes of the hit TV ``Ducktales'' series, featuring
the adventures and misadventures of Duckburg's leading citizen,
Scrooge McDuck, and his nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie.
   The series has received raves from critics. TV Guide said the
animated comedy-adventure show ``features the superior production
values and animation kids of all ages have come to expect from
Disney.''
   Also in May HBO is releasing ``Weeds'' and ``House of Games,''
and Orion Home Video has scheduled Danny DeVito's zany sendup of
matricide, ``Throw Mama From the Train.''
   Videos reviewed this week:
   
   ``Weeds'' (HBO Video, VHS@Beta, $89.99, Rated R
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   NEW YORK _ At the start of ``Weeds,'' Lee Umstetter, doing a
life sentence for armed robbery, attempts suicide twice _ once by
leaping from his cell block at San Quentin, and once by a crude
attempt at hanging himself.
   ``Depressed, are you?'' asks his cell mate.
   ``Well, I needed a little vacation,'' replies the droll Lee,
played by Nick Nolte.
   That's about as deep as the explanations get in ``Weeds,'' a
flat, humorless film based on a play by a real-life ex-con who,
like Umstetter, was confined to the California state penitentiary.
   In the film, Umstetter decides to channel his rage and
frustration into creativity. With only a 6th grade education, he
reads Dostoevski, Tolstoy, Nietszche and Genet.
   Borrowing a bit too liberally from his readings, he writes a
play about prison life called ``Weeds.'' It's produced in San
Quentin and, unaccountably, there happens to be a rich, beautiful
critic in the audience named Lillian Binghamton. Equally
unaccountably, eyes meet and, presto, it's amore.
   Lillian, played by Rita Taggart, writes a rave review and
campaigns successfully to free her new-found love from prison.
   It turns out, though, she isn't much of a critic since she
failed to perceive that the play is largely plagiarized.
   Later in the movie, she catches Umstetter in bed with a younger
woman. There's a touch of chagrin from this person who has freed
her lover from a life in prison. But in a moment or so, it's
forgotten.
   Lillian, in short, is incredibly dimwitted.
   The movie winds on episodically, with Umstetter forming a
traveling acting troupe made up of his old jail buddies. They take
it on the road, finally making it to New York where the New York
Times drama critic takes the wind temporarily out of their sails.
   But by this time the play is not the counterfeit it started out
to be. It's so real, in fact, that they produce it in a prison and
cause a riot.
   Presto! Instant headlines and fame, and the bright lights of
Broadway.
   Sure. Right.
   ``Weeds'' is rated ``R'' for strong prison language and some
nudity.

   ``House of Games'' (HBO Video, VHS@Beta, $89.99, Rated R)
   
   ``House of Games'' is set in the seedy underworld of con
artists, and the movie is _ deliberately _ something of a con
itself.
   Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet, who wrote and
directed this 1980's film noir, repeatedly confounds the viewer by
staging increasingly elaborate confidence games. It's often
difficult to be sure who's conning whom, and that's what makes the
movie such creepy fun.
   Lindsay Crouse plays Dr. Margaret Ford, a psychiatrist who has
just made a lot of money writing a book but who is clearly unhappy,
maybe even clinically depressed. On an impulse, she decides to help
a patient who is a compulsive gambler and visits the House of Games
where she encounters Mike, the ringleader of the con artists,
played by Joe Mantegna.
   She is strongly attracted to Mike and also to the excitement of
his dangerous profession. In a series of plot twists she moves from
victim to accomplice to aggressor, drawn ever deeper into a web of
deceit that seems certain eventually to destroy her.
   Crouse, who is married to Mamet, is fascinating in a role
tailor-made for her, while Mantegna has just the right oily charm
for his part.
   All in all, ``House of Games'' is an original, diverting film
and well worth a look for those who missed it in theaters last year.

   ``Hairspray'' (MCA) _ various artists.
   ``Dirty Dancing'' (RCA) _ various artists.
   ``More Dirty Dancing'' (RCA) _ various artists.
   
   ``Do You Love Me?'' by the Contours is one of peaks of rock 'n'
roll, matching depth of anxiety to banality of lyric in the finest
tradition of the Clearasil generation. ``You broke my heart, 'cause
I couldn't dance ...'' Ah, what a world of pain recalled.
   Then there's that trick fade, before the Contours come booming
back _ ``Work! Work!'' _ in an ecstatic finale.
   Great as it is, ``Do You Love Me?'' doesn't rescue the ``Dirty
Dancing'' soundtrack albums from the contempt of all prudent
consumers. RCA has spread this collection on two compact discs,
giving as little as 35 minutes of retread listening in a format
that would hold twice as much. So they're charging $25 or more for
what is essentially a $2 record in the oldies bin.
   The real sin, though, is the mixture of old and new. Oldies, as
John Waters says, are ``the only known remedy to today's Hit Parade
of Hell.''
   The soundtrack collection from Waters' first mainstream film,
``Hairspray,'' is the better buy. The title track, despite its
satirical intent, is absolutely faithful to the old sound.
   But again, the exasperated consumer wonders, why no instructions
for dancing the Madison along with ``The Madison Time'' by The Ray
Bryant Combo?
   Through such indifference, the old tribal wisdom is in danger of
being lost.

   ``Naked'' (Sire) _ Talking Heads
   
   Too often on ``Naked,'' it's impossible even to guess what the
Talking Heads are talking about. David Byrne's oblique lyrics are
frustrating because there are snatches of wonderful imagery that
leave the listener begging for more details.
   Byrne's eccentricity probably isn't the only reason it's hard to
find a plot in ``Naked.'' The Talking Heads recorded the basic
tracks before Byrne began to work on the tune or words, reducing
his flexibility as a composer.
   But while the record's melodies and lyrics are less than fluid,
rhythmically ``Naked'' is a marvel _ so lively it would make even
Tipper Gore want to dance.
   The Talking Heads brought in studio musicians to create a denser
sound than on their last two records. As a result, instruments dart
in and out of the arrangements, almost always serving to enhance
the syncopation. The band and its co-producer, Steve Lillywhite,
achieved a full but remarkably clean sound.
   Most momentous is the satirical ``(Nothing But) Flowers,'' in
which Byrne provides a fresh perspective on urban sprawl by
describing with mock horror a place where ``highways and cars were
sacrificed for agriculture.''
   ``Mr. Jones'' and ``Totally Nude'' are also made for the dance
floor, while the best of the slower songs is the darkly melodic
``Bill,'' about a fat man, a little girl and a gun. What happens?
We don't know. The song, like too much of ``Naked,'' is clothed in
ambiguity.

   ``Tracy Chapman'' (Elektra@Asylum) _ Tracy Chapman
   
   One of Boston's best kept secrets was a young
poet-songwriter-folksinger named Tracy Chapman. Not any more.
   With the release of her self-titled debut LP the world has a new
musical gift. Her rich contralto with its melancholic underpinnings
sweep us back to the early 1970s _ to Joan Armatrading, Carol King
and Joni Mitchell. Her lyrics, with a deadbolt look at poverty,
racism and inequality take us back even further _ to Bob Dylan,
Odetta, Pete Seeger.
   The LP opens with ``Talkin' Bout a Revolution,'' a song that
tells of ``standing in the welfare lines, crying at the doorsteps
of those armies of salvation, wasting time in the unemployment
lines, sitting around waiting for a promotion.''
   The a cappella ``Behind the Wall,'' talks of a domestic fight:
``Last night I heard the screaming, then a silence that chilled my
soul.''
   As an undergraduate at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.,
Chapman performed in coffee houses and clubs. She was something of
a mesmerizing hit for locals who flocked to hear her.
   Her debut LP, with its range from folk to pop ballad to reggae,
is likely to enchant even more.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Bad Boy of Hollywood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MALIBU, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bruce Willis, a favorite whipping boy of
the scandal tabloids, doesn't think he's that bad.
   ``When I've been talking to people about this film (`Sunset'), I
find them so surprised to see that I'm this calm and that I'm not
throwing chairs and swinging from the rafters,'' he said. ``They're
pretty surprised that I can be this relaxed.''
   Indeed, he was relaxed as he lounged beside the swimming pool on
a sunswept morning at the beachfront home he shares with his wife,
actress Demi Moore.
   After three frantic years of doing TV's ``Moonlighting'' and
three feature movies, Willis is unaccustomed to the leisure that
has been enforced by the screenwriters' strike. Like most
television series, ``Moonlighting'' has shut down for lack of
scripts.
   The actor wore only swim trunks and a cap marked Newark Rational
Company _ ``a small firm that will some day package my films; the
name is an homage to my beginnings in the Garden State (New
Jersey).'' He looked trim, healthy _ and relaxed.
   Willis has been doing interviews for ``Sunset,'' Blake Edwards'
Hollywood period piece in which Tom Mix (Willis) and Wyatt Earp
(James Garner) pursue a murder scandal. Willis interviews have been
rare in recent times.
   ``My wife has helped me in dealing with the matter of
publicity,'' he said. ``It just sells more magazines to say I'm the
Bad Boy of Hollywood than to say that I'm not doing anything this
week, or I'm not throwing any wild parties.
   ``By and large, the basic principle was that if you put my
picture on the cover of a magazine, people were going to buy it. I
sell magazines. I had to realize that if you took all those people
out of that industry, next week a whole new crowd would come in.
Because somebody's got to do that job.''
   Becoming a husband and future father appears to have had a
salutary influence on Willis, also the stimulus of working with
veterans Edwards and Garner in a top-flight production.
   ``The work I had done in television was basically a
two-character show,'' he said. ``The film `Blind Date' was
basically a two-character love story. I had wanted to work in an
ensemble situation with a large cast. The feel on `Sunset' was the
closest I've come to working on stage since I've come out here.
   ``I came on the film three weeks late, because I was finishing
up the season on `Moonlighting.' When I arrived, everyone else had
been working on their characters and were into that genre. Jim
especially made it very comfortable for me. We hit it off right
away, and I had never met him before.''
   There's further evidence of Willis' domestication: He is into
gardening.
   ``I'm having a lot of trouble with snails,'' he complained as he
proudly displayed a tiny bed of marigolds and snapdragons. His
interest in gardening, he explained, harks back to his New Jersey
childhood.
   ``Everyone associates New Jersey with going on the turnpike
through Elizabeth, Newark and that area,'' he said. ``Where I grew
up in south Jersey (Carneys Point) it's very beautiful.
   ``I really grew up out of doors. The majority of my first 16-17
years were outside, which I really didn't appreciate then. As a kid
I always wanted to live in a larger city. Now that I'm older, those
are the memories I have: climbing trees and being in the woods.''
   Willis, 33, spent a few years at Montclair State College, where
he studied drama under Jerry Lockwood. In 1977, he moved to New
York and began a life of hunting work as an actor and tending bar.
   ``I still remember when $20 was a lot of money,'' he reminisced.
``I could eat for three or four days on $20. Of course my diet in
those days was pretty much pizza and beer. In some some ways things
were a lot simpler then. There was only one thing to do: get a job.
Then I didn't have to think about anything else _ as long as the
show ran.
   ``Once I had a structured job for six months. I fell in love
with a girl, and she needed more security in our relationship. I
was anything but financially secure. So I took a job managing a
health club and became the director. The relationship fell apart
and I went back to hunting for acting jobs.''
   His luck began to change when he starred in Sam Shepard's ``Fool
for Love.'' When he was passed over for a role in ``Desperately
Seeking Susan,'' Willis took a trip to Hollywood and soon was
tapped for ``Moonlighting.''
   The ABC series co-starring Cybill Shepherd and Willis as an odd
couple of private eyes had a sensational two years. It recently has
been lambasted by critics and fans for constant reruns.
   ``I think we went through a rough time,'' Willis said. ``Cybill
was off the show having her babies. We really missed having her
there; she brings a lot to the show. Not having her was like
watching the Three Stooges with only one Stooge.''
   He still enjoys doing the show, he said.
   ``I'll stay as long as it remains creative. ... The medium of
television itself has worn pretty thin for me. ABC has been very
generous with expenses, but there are only so many shots you can
do, so many ways to approach a scene. After my experiences in film,
I find myself leaning more towards that.''

   The singing of whales, the howl of wolves
and the trilling of a Grand Canyon wren filled the 800-year-old
Christ Church Cathedral in the university city of Oxford.
   It was a new kind of music for the venerable Norman building,
within the walls of Christ Church College.
   When the six casually dressed American musicians recently
emulated the sounds of the wild on drums and tambourine, the
audience was so intrigued they got up from their seats to look over
the choir rails.
   From among the medieval tombs came music that ``celebrates the
environment,'' as band leader Paul Winter described it.
   Winter, who lives in Litchfield, Conn., and New York, calls the
animals and birds whose sounds he incorporates in his group's
compositions, ``our members at large.''
   The Paul Winter Consort combines classical jazz and folk
instruments drawn from the European and African roots of American
culture. The result is daring, fascinating and never dull.
   ``I have never heard anything which was so unexpected and so
charming at the same time,'' said Jane Howard, an Oxford teacher
who wandered into the concert without being invited.
   The group played in the cathedral for participants from 60
countries at a conference of religious leaders and legislators
discussing how they can use their influence to help solve problems
of the planet, from the threat of nuclear war to pollution and
poverty.
   ``I can feel his music; it's not just something to listen to,''
said Marian Head, a business consultant from Boulder, Colo., who
was helping to run the conference.
   The two-hour concert ended with Winter putting out the lights
and inviting the audience to howl like the wolves. They did.
   ``It breaks the ice,'' he said with a smile.
   Winter and his group are artists-in-residence at the Cathedral
of St. John the Divine in New York City, whose Dean James Parks
Morton was co-chairman of the conference and invited the group to
Oxford. Paul Halley, the group's pianist, is the cathedral organist
and music director.
   Winter plays soprano saxophone, Rhonda Larson plays flute,
Eugene Friesen plays the cello and Ted Moore and Glen Velez are the
percussionists.
   Winter said in an interview he was first inspired to put animal
sounds in his music when he heard recordings 20 years ago of whale
songs made off the Atlantic island of Bermuda.
   He and his musicians have played in 33 countries and made 10
visits to the Soviet Union, where they toured wilderness areas.
   ``I think the only composer who imitated natural sounds before
us is the Frenchman, Olivier Messiaen, who notated the songs of all
French birds,'' Winter said.
   Thanks to Morton's enthusiasm for the arts, the Oxford
conference had the rare treat of an arts program to itself, with
music, songs and sculpture.
   It was coordinated by Naj Wikoff, a 38-year-old sculptor who
presents more than 200 drama, dance, music and poetry performances
a year at St. John the Divine.
   The conference had its own anthem, a 2{ piece called, ``Alpha
Code: The Beginning,'' composed by American concert pianist Byron
Janis.
   ``The conference is every man's struggle,'' Janis said. ``The
music starts with a prayer, then an SOS, and then the prayer is
taken up by more and more people and becomes an expression of
triumph over the problems.
   ``I call it a response to a distress signal from Earth, because
that's what the conference is about.''
   Wikoff said no one should see anything unusual in a conference
grappling with global crises listening to music.
   ``Arts celebrate the human spirit and always have done,'' he
said.
   ``The arts transcend society. People need not only food and a
bed but a sense of hope and beauty.''

   Her confessional lyrics were set to long, winding
melodies and described loves past and present, and the shadowy
thoughts a woman might have in the confines of her room at night.
   But after a 20-year career, Joni Mitchell's latest album,
``Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm,'' shows the Canadian singer's
evolution into a tougher, more issue-oriented chronicler of the era.
   ``These are troubled times,'' said the 44-year-old troubadour,
born in the prairie town of Ft. Macleod, Alberta, and now living in
Los Angeles.
   ``I think my main function is to try to articulate what it is to
live in these times ... to be a scribe or witness to my times. It's
fairly neutral reporting.''
   For her 15th album, Mitchell and her bassist-husband Larry Klein
co-produce 10 songs on such topics as the Vietnam War,
commercialism, the U.S. bombing of Libya and the plight of Hopi
Indians.
   The project builds on the social commentary Mitchell introduced
in her last album in 1985, ``Dog Eat Dog,'' which contained a
savage attack on TV evangelists and addressed the famine in
Ethiopia.
   Recorded in nine different studios in England and Los Angeles,
``Chalk Mark'' includes contributions from Willie Nelson, Wayne
Shorter, Peter Gabriel, Billy Idol, Tom Petty and American Indian
actor Iron Eyes Cody. It is the most ambitious list of guests on a
Mitchell album to date.
   One powerful song, ``The Beat of Black Wings,'' was recorded at
Gabriel's Ashcombe House studio in Bath, England, near the air base
from where U.S. bombers took off for the 1986 foray on Libyan
targets.
   ``It was very close and it occurred to all of us that should
there be a retaliation, we were on target,'' Mitchell said.
   The Soviet nuclear accident at Chernobyl occurred around the
same time, and ``all of our thinking turned to war and how small
the planet was. Suddenly, the globe seems so small and we all seem
so fragile.''
   Her long, blond hair spilling from under a broad-brimmed black
hat, Mitchell was relaxed and chatty, and the new album reflects
her less introspective personality with a light-hearted rocker,
``Dancing' Clown,'' and a lazily-paced rendition of the old Roy
Rogers favorite, ``Cool Water.''
   ``It's not an autobiographical album particularly,'' she said.
``I don't live there anymore.''
   Born Roberta Joan Anderson, the skinny young folksinger from the
prairies was fresh from art school when she hit the coffee houses
of Toronto's Yorkville district a quarter of a century ago. She
worked in the women's wear section of a downtown department store
to pay the rent.
   After a brief marriage to folkie Chuck Mitchell, she moved to
New York where her sinuous melodies and soul-baring lyrics
attracted Judy Collins and Tom Rush to record two of her songs,
``Both Sides Now'' and ``The Circle Game.''
   With a quavering voice as individual as her song-poems, Mitchell
soon emerged in her own right with classics such as ``Big Yellow
Taxi,'' ``Woodstock'' and ``Help Me.''
   Yet despite a devoted following, she never quite won the acclaim
of a Joan Baez or Judy Collins, especially after experimenting with
jazz in albums such as ``The Hissing of Summer Lawns'' which
Rolling Stone magazine rated the worst record of 1975.
   On the other hand, the late jazz great Charles Mingus liked
Mitchell's ``Don Juan's Reckless Daughter'' so much that, knowing
he was dying, he invited her to collaborate on his last six songs
and the result was ``Mingus'' in 1979. Future goals, she said,
include working with jazz trumpeter Miles Davis.
   All of Mitchell's albums feature her imaginative paintings and
designs, and she is now marketing her work after discovering that
limited editions handed out by record companies were selling
privately for large sums.
   ``It would be nice to have the luxury to do nothing else. It's
hard to have two careers,'' she said.
   Asked to define her contribution to the Woodstock generation,
she said Bob Dylan was the prophet while she ``chicken-scratched''
for immortality.
   ``I won't be remembered for the best of my material,'' she
lamented, listing her own favorites as ``Furry Sings the Blues''
and ``Song for Sharon'' from the 1976 album ``Hejira,'' and ``Car
on a Hill'' from ``Court and Spark'' of 1974.
   ``That would make a great golden oldie,'' she said of the latter.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Romancing Nelson Algren</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city, Nelson Algren once said, ``has
literally become my trade.''
   Algren, the winner of the first National Book Award, lived among
the ethnic patches of the Northwest Side of Chicago, bringing to
life the roar of the elevated trains and recording, in his mind and
in notebooks, the travails of the people.
   He hung out in the police precincts, seedy bars and brothels.
Drug addicts, gamblers and migrant workers had his ear.
   The night often was his turf and his fiction breathed the night.
   ``It isn't hard to love a town for its greater and its lesser
towers,'' Algren wrote. ``But you never truly love it till you can
love its alleys, too.''
   The city he loved didn't always return the sentiment.
   Poles, offended with his sketches of the city's underbelly in
``Never Come Morning,'' pressured some library branches to keep the
book out of circulation, Algren and his literary companions
maintained.
   But today, seven years after he died at age 72 in Sag Harbor,
N.Y., there's a romance brewing and it might finally stick.
   A large exhibition room at the library's downtown Cultural
Center is the setting for ``Writing in the First Person: Nelson
Algren,'' a rich tribute to a master of urban realism.
   First edition books and original manuscripts are paired with
Algren's first stabs at writing, including handwritten short
stories, a mock newspaper's front page and summaries of
neighborhood baseball games.
   His Army draft card is displayed with his honorable discharge,
as well as his Detroit birth certificate _ March 28, 1909 _ and
papers showing his name change from Nelson Ahlgren Abraham to
Nelson Algren.
   Pictures and personal letters document his affair with French
philosopher Simone de Beauvoir who accompanied him on trips down
the Mississippi River and to other countries.
   Algren admired Ernest Hemingway and the affection was mutual.
   ``You should not read it unless you can take a punch,''
Hemingway says in a well-worn letter, offering his endorsement for
an upcoming book.
   ``Mr. Algren,'' Hemingway wrote, ``boy, you are good.''
   The exhibit, which opened in late February, was scheduled to run
through May 21 but has been extended for three weeks. Most of the
items were purchased from local collectors or are on loan from Ohio
State University, which has the largest Algren archive.
   Besides the exhibit, there also have been public readings.
Hundreds turned out to hear Pulitzer Prize winner Studs Terkel,
another product of Chicago's literary school of realism and a close
friend of Algren, read from Algren's books, including the poetic
``Chicago, City on the Make.''
   ``He was a wheel on fire,'' Terkel recalled in a interview. ``I
like the idea that he was honored. It's time he was given his
place.''
   Algren, who moved to Chicago from Detroit when he was 3,
graduated from the University of Illinois with a journalism degree
in 1931. His first published works, mostly short stories, stemmed
from his experiences in the South where he traveled by freight
train after college.
   Algren said he once wandered into a Texas college and began
typing a story on an unattended typewriter. He decided to take the
typewriter with him to Chicago to finish the story, but was
arrested for theft and served five months in jail.
   Back in Illinois, he was an editor for the Works Progress
Administration from 1936-40. Finally, ``Never Come Morning,'' about
a Polish prizefighter tagged with a murder charge, was published in
1942.
   It was a book that rankled Polish civic groups for its gritty
descriptions of life in their Chicago neighborhoods.
   ``He was never a coffee table man,'' Terkel said, referring to
Algren's books.
   In 1947, the American Academy of Arts and Letters awarded him
$1,000 in recognition for ``Never Come Morning,'' and the
Rockefeller Foundation granted him $1,000 to work on a new novel _
arguably his best _ ``The Man With the Golden Arm.''
   Algren received the first National Book Award in 1950 for ``The
Man With the Golden Arm,'' a harrowing tale about Frankie Machine,
a Chicago card dealer, back from the war with a ``35-pound monkey
on his back'' _ morphine addiction.
   Otto Preminger made the book into a movie starring Frank
Sinatra, but Preminger and Algren fought fiercely over the
production and the bitter Hollywood experience was one the author
would never forget.
   Another book, ``A Walk on the Wild Side,'' also was transferred
to the big screen starring Jane Fonda.
   He had his detractors. Conservative critics hit Algren for what
they considered his penchant for glorifying hustlers, hookers and
hobos. One once dismissed him as the ``bard of the stumblebum.''
   ``Academics, the English departments, had become the arbiters of
literature,'' Terkel said. ``Nelson was never one who was in their
favor. He sort of put them down and they knew it. They reciprocated
by making him a nonperson. Now he's pretty much a person and that's
kind of good.''
   By the early 1970s, Algren had traveled to Southeast Asia and
the Far East, writing dispatches for magazines and developing more
books. At the same time, his ties to Chicago began to diminish.
   In 1973, he left for good.
   But anyone who 12 years earlier had read his afterword to
``Chicago, City on the Make'' could have predicted the move. The
city that was once a writer's town, he said, was becoming just
another town.
   ``Chicago has progressed, culturally, from being The Second City
to being The Second-Hand City,'' he wrote. ``The vital cog in our
culture now is not the artist, but the middleman whose commercial
status lends art the aura of status when he acquires a collection
of originals.
   ``The word `culture' now means nothing more than `approved.' It
isn't what is exhibited so much that matters as where: that being
where one meets the people who matter.''
   Terkel tried to explain: ``To love a city, you have to smack it
around, too. It was the ambivalent feeling he had.''
   Algren moved to Paterson, N.J., to cover the murder case of
boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter. A novel based on the case, ``The
Devil's Stocking,'' was published posthumously in 1983.
   He settled in Sag Harbor, N.Y., and died, relatively poor, a few
weeks before his May 1981 induction into the prestigious American
Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.
   Money was an irritating subject to Algren. Authors with less
talent were wealthy, he complained, and Hollywood producers reaped
millions without spreading the credit to creators.
   But in an interview published in 1964, Algren seemed to suggest
that writing good fiction, not collecting cash, was his goal.
   ``I think anybody, anybody, if given the choice, would always
take the privilege of having his work wanted by other people rather
than the privilege of having more money than anybody.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Making A Hard Day's Night Easier</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's 2 a.m., and your baby is crying and
won't sleep.
   What to do? Play the Beatles, of course, and within 15 minutes a
hard day's night becomes much easier.
   Award-winning pianist Floyd Domino has turned the music of the
Fab Four into an album of lullabies designed to send bawling
infants straight to Sleepytown.
   ``A lot of adults say it works,'' says the 35-year-old musician
from Austin, Texas.
   The album, ``Baby Road,'' is a takeoff of the Beatles' 1969 LP
``Abbey Road.'' It contains 12 songs, including 11 hits of the
famed group and the title track written by Domino.
   The LP also parodies the ``Abbey Road'' cover, which showed the
four Liverpool lads walking single file across a street. ``Baby
Road'' shows four diapered tots strutting one behind the other
across the road.
   ``These lullabies are dedicated to all children and their tired
moms and dads,'' Domino writes on the album cover.
   Beatles' songs on the LP are ``Hey Jude,'' ``Yesterday,''
``Michelle,'' ``Something,'' ``With a Little Help From My
Friends,'' ``Norwegian Wood,'' ``For No One,'' ``In My Life,''
``She's Leaving Home,'' ``Here, There and Everywhere'' and ``Good
Night.''
   ``I didn't try to compete with the Beatles, just be true to
their music and not use a lot of hot licks,'' said Domino, who
played with country star Waylon Jennings for four years.
   He got the idea for the album when his wife was pregnant.
   ``This is so much better than `Mary Had a Little Lamb,''' he
said. ``I tried to make them sound as simple as possible, but a lot
of production was involved.
   ``I let the melodies come up by using the upper modes of the
piano. The Beatles are very identifiable. You can play the melody
and not be a slave to any original arrangement.
   ``I thought of their songs that could be acoustical and simple
where you don't tamper with the song and it brings it out. Some of
the melodies worked and others would not.''
   The only other musicians on the LP are Edgar Meyer, who played
upright bass, and guitarist Mark Howard. The selections are
strictly instrumentals without any lyrics.
   ``A lot of the songs are better without words, like `She's
Leaving Home.' People think of their daughter leaving or about an
unhappy teen-ager,'' Domino said in a telephone interview.
   He said he chose ``Yesterday'' for ``the purity of the medley.
It's a song you have to include when you do a Beatles' lullaby
record. The sound is very simple: The guitar carries the rhythm and
the piano plays the melody well and draws attention to the song.''
   He said ``Hey Jude'' has a strong emotional impact on people,
especially parents. ``The theme is take a sad song and make it
better. The song means so much to a person because they think of
the words. The song triggers memories and emotions and it makes
parents so happy to be sharing them with their kids.''
   Domino, who's been playing piano since age 5, says he rates
``Michelle'' as the Beatles' hit with the best melody.
   ``I would play it a lot before I recorded this,'' he recalled.
``I always loved playing it.''
   Some Beatles' songs did not fit well. ``Help!'' was too uptempo
for a peaceful arrangement. Domino was wary of the stringed
instruments used in ``The Long and Winding Road.''
   ``Let It Be,'' he said, ``had an identifiable arrangement and I
was reluctant to tackle it.''
   He hopes to do a follow-up project, which like the first will be
on his own Golliber Records in Austin. The next album will include
some of the Beatles' songs he had to omit from the first.
   Domino, born and raised in Berkeley, Calif., had a featured part
in the song ``One O'clock Jump'' which won a Grammy award in 1978
for the country group Asleep at the Wheel.
   After leaving the group, he played piano in the Broadway
production ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.'' He then joined
Jennings' band, but quit two years ago in order to spend more time
at home.
   The ``Baby Road'' project has been more rewarding for him than
playing on the road.
   ``I get great letters from parents saying they are glad I did
this record,'' he said. ``It's been a lot of fun and much more
personal. I save every letter I get.''
   His 2{-year-old son, Will, who helped inspire the project, has a
favorite song on the LP: ``Something.''
   But it's a winner by default.
   ``He'd fall asleep so quickly he never listened all the way
through,'' Domino said.

   The economy reversed a three-month slowdown in
April as production and new orders picked up sharply, according to
a survey of purchasing managers.
   The National Association of Purchasing Managers said Sunday its
index of economic activity rose to 54.9 percent last month from
53.3 percent in March.
   The index had declined the first three months of the year,
indicating a slowing in economic growth. A reading above 50 percent
generally indicates economic expansion, while a reading below that
benchmark indicates the economy is declining, the group says.

   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The government's economic indicators are
pointing to continued growth.
   The Commerce Department said Friday its Index of Leading
Indicators rose 0.8 percent in March after a revised 1.3 percent
gain in February.
   In another report, the government said sales of new homes rose 4
percent in March, the second consecutive monthly advance.
   Earlier in the week, the government said the overall economy
expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of
the year.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., called the
string of upbeat reports ``terrific news on the future state of the
economy.''

   Back-to-back increases in new home sales have
pushed such sales to the highest levels since August, the
government says.
   The 4 percent rise in new homes sales in March followed a 14.1
percent jump the previous month, the departments of Housing and
Urban Development, and Commerce said Friday.
   But some analysts are worried that rising mortgage rates could
limit growth in the second half of the year.

   The average prices that farmers got for raw
products held steady in April for the second month in a row but
were 4 percent above a year ago, the government says.
   ``Prices were higher for soybeans, cattle, hay and oranges, and
lower for lettuce, eggs, milk and strawberries,'' the federal
Agricultural Statistics Board said Friday.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent
this year, compared with a 4.1 percent average increase in 1987.

   OPEC oil ministers have suspended for a

production.
   Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
said early today they would reconvene June 8 to discuss the
proposed reductions.
   Several ministers expressed disappointment at the breakdown of
the four-day-old negotiations, which they viewed as a chance to
shore up oil prices and open a new avenue to cooperation with
non-OPEC producers who had proposed the production cuts.

   Bargainers for Chrysler Corp. and
the United Auto Workers continued negotiations centering on
displaced Wisconsin employees in hopes of clearing the way for a
national contract settlement.
   The final push on the national pact won't begin until local
agreements are reached covering 6,500 employees in Kenosha, Wis.,
and Milwaukee.
   Local talks continued Sunday, and UAW Vice President Marc Stepp,
head of the union's Chrysler department, said negotiations would
continue into the night.
   UAW President Owen Bieber was to join national contract talks
today at Chrysler headquarters.
   Stepp said Sunday he expected Wisconsin workers to be covered by
the same basic language contained in the overall Chrysler
agreement. But any enhanced job security provisions in the
agreement wouldn't be implemented until the Kenosha assembly plant
is closed, he said.
   Talks on the national contract, which expires Sept. 14 and
covers 66,000 active workers in 15 states, began April 18, four
months early.
   Last week, Chrysler said it would wait until the end of the year
to close the 5,500-worker former American Motors Corp. plant in
Kenosha and to transfer K-car assembly work from Detroit to Mexico.

   The stock market hovered in a narrow range
today, resuming its sluggish pattern of late last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.66 to
2,033.99 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 26.35 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Evidence that the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace
has lately been met with little enthusiasm by investors.
   The government reported this morning that factory orders
increased 1.6 percent in March.
   The market also hasn't shown much response to generally strong
corporate earnings reports for the first quarter.
   Analysts say individual investors and professional money
managers continue to shy away from stocks, with memories still
fresh of the crash last fall and controversy continuing over the
effects of computer program trading.
   USG gained 1\ to 42\ in active trading. Desert Partners, which
is offering $42-a-share in a hostile takover bid for the company,
said it was willing to raise the price tag to $45 a share if USG
negotiates a merger agreement.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .19 to 147.68. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .99 at 302.15.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 8.95 to

   Members of the grain millers union at
Archer Daniels Midland Co. have voted by a 3-1 margin to reject the
agricultural company's three-year contract proposal.
   But the American Federation of Grain Millers Local 103 also
agreed to work under the old contract terms while negotiations
continue, an official said. The old contract expires today.
   According to Local 103 President Charlie Hood, members needed
about four hours to examine the numerous differences between the
current pact and the proposal.
   Hood categorized the 44-page document as containing ``excessive
concessionary demands.''
   After turning down the proposal, the local agreed to have a
federal mediator set the next meeting between management and the
union. The move was also acceptable to ADM's negotiator, Hood said.
   Hood refused to comment on pay, insurance or other ``financial
issues.'' Key issues, he said, concerned ``creating a joint
management-labor safety program, trying to eliminate rotating
shifts, extending time off for work-related injuries and basic
civil rights in the plant.''
   He declined to elaborate on the civil rights issue.
   ``The company has made it clear that the reason for these
concessionary demands is for increased corporate profit,'' Hood
said. ``It is difficult for the membership to understand in the
face of past and projected profits that the company needs these
additional concessions.''

   OPEC oil ministers have failed for the
time being to agree on a token cut in oil production and oil
markets reacted swiftly as prices fell today.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister said today he was pleased by the
collapse of the OPEC talks, which were rescheduled for June 8.
   ``It's a very happy ending'' to a week of intense bargaining,
the minister, Hisham Nazer, told reporters as he left the final
session early this morning.
   His comment confirmed that Saudi Arabia has adopted a hard-line
stance against any production cuts that could give oil prices a
boost. A chief beneficiary of higher prices would be Iran, which
relies on oil to finance its war with Iraq.
   Last Tuesday, the Saudi government broke diplomatic relations
with Iran, accusing Tehran of terrorism and subversion.
   The breakdown of negotiations caused oil prices to fall.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
oil, the U.S. benchmark crude, was down 75 cents a barrel to $17.24
in early trading.
   In earlier Tokyo trading, the price of Brent crude oil from the
North Sea was quoted at $16.20 a barrel, down 45 cents from the
close in Europe on Friday.
   The London spot, or non-contract, market was closed for the May
Day holiday, and trading elsewhere in Europe was extremely light.
   Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, said he was not
worried by the short-term reaction of traders in the free market.
   ``People who look at the price on Tuesday and beyond should take
heart ... that OPEC is trying to put its house in order,'' he said.
   Other ministers expressed disappointment at the breakdown of
negotiations, which they viewed as a chance to shore up oil prices
and open a new avenue to cooperation with non-OPEC producers who
had proposed the production cuts.
   ``I would be much happier if we could have agreed on cuts now,''
said Libyan oil minister Fawzi Shakshuki.
   The production cutting proposal was aimed at raising prices to
OPEC's target of $18 a barrel, from the current range of $14 to
$16, by tightening supplies.
   Saudi Arabia led a minority of four cartel members opposing the
proposed production cut of 300,000 barrels a day, or about 2
percent of the group's total output.
   The cuts were to be made in conjunction with the six non-OPEC
producers, who offered to reduce their output by 5 percent, or
about 200,000 barrels a day, if the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries would do likewise.
   Failure by OPEC to decide on a response to the offer was likely
to draw criticism from the independent producers, who met with an
OPEC committee in Vienna last Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Rilwanu Lukman, the president of OPEC, said the cartel leaders
would resume their debate on possible cuts in production at their
regular summer session in Vienna on June 8.
   ``More time is required to clarify some of the points of the
offer,'' Lukman told a news conference this morning. He said that
in the meantime OPEC members would ``do their utmost'' to abide by
their assigned production quotas, which are scheduled to expire
June 30.
   The quotas, agreed on last December, are designed to support an
oil price of $18. OPEC prices have dropped several dollars below
the target price this spring, however, prompting the cartel to seek
collaboration with outside producers.
   The six countries involved in the talks with OPEC were Mexico,
Egypt, China, Malaysia, Oman and Angola.
   OPEC has solicited the cooperation of independent producers
since the start of this decade, when the development of a world oil
glut began chipping away at OPEC's ability to dictate prices.
   In 1986, oil prices collapsed, falling to less than $10 a barrel
in July from nearly $30 the previous November.
   All OPEC countries, including Saudi Arabia, have said they want
to foster closer ties with independent oil producers.
   The Saudis, however, say they think the non-OPEC countries
should bear a bigger share of the burden of reducing supplies. In
the Vienna meeting Nazer proposed a barrel-for-barrel reduction
with the non-OPEC group, sources said.
   In supporting his stand against the proposed cuts, Nazer told
the closed-door meeting that Saudi Arabia has cut its oil output in
recent years from 9.9 million barrels a day to 4.3 million _ a far
larger reduction than any other OPEC member, according to a source
who was in the meeting.
   The Saudis were supported by their main allies, Kuwait, Qatar
and the United Arab Emirates.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on

   Corn showed the greatest strength, opening slightly higher on

   The Transport Ministry said Monday it recommended
to Japanese airlines that they ground and conduct maintenance
checks on Boeing 737 jets of the model that lost part of its
fuselage over Hawaii.
   An official of the ministry's engineering deparment said there
are 21 Boeing 737s in Japan being operated by All Nippon Airways,
Air Nippon and Nansei Koku airline.
   ``We are not ordering the airlines to do so, but we are
suggesting they do it for safety,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He noted the Boeing company's service bulletin had recommended
checks on 737s that have over 30,000 landings, and that there are
nine such 737s being flown in Japan.
   The suggestion came after the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration ordered Hawaii's Aloha Airlines to check old 737
jetliners that have been flown 55,000 times or more.
   The upper fuselage of an Aloha Airlines 737 with 89 passengers
and five crew members aboard peeled off on an inter-island flight
last Thursday. One person was killed and 61 others were injured.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Award Attorneys' Fees to Tribes in Fishing Rights
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to award
nearly $3 million in attorneys' fees to Indian tribes who won a
lengthy court battle against Washington state officials over
fishing rights.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck
down the award on grounds a federal law reimbursing lawyers who
represent the winning side in civil rights cases does not apply to
the Indians' lawsuit.
   Twenty-one tribes sought to recapture legal fees awarded by a
federal judge who then was overruled by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals. The Indians were supported by 33 other tribes who said
their ability to vindicate treaty rights could be undermined if
they are unable to recover legal fees won in court.
   The case acted on today stems from a 1970 lawsuit in which
Indians asserted fishing rights in Washington state waters based on
a treaty signed in 1885.
   Indians relinquished land under the treaty in return for
guarantees of fishing rights. The treaty said the Indians have the
``right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations
... in common with all citizens of the territory.''
   Federal courts ultimately ruled the treaty entitled the tribes
to approximately half the harvestable fish in state waters that
passed through recognized tribal fishing areas. The Supreme Court
upheld those rights in 1979.
   Years of litigation over legal fees followed, leading in 1985 to
a federal judge's award of $2.95 million to the tribes to be paid
by Washington state.
   But the 9th Circuit court threw out the award last year.
   The appeals court said the fishing rights case was not covered
by a 1976 federal law reimbursing the prevailing side's legal
expenses in civil rights lawsuits.
   The appeals court said, in effect, that Washington state
officials did not violate deliberately the Indians' rights by
limiting their fishing harvest. The case was a dispute over the
intepretation of the treaty, the appeals court said.
   ``It is not disputed that the Indians had rights under the
treaty,'' the appeals court said. ``Just exactly what those rights
were was unknown until the Supreme Court decision (in 1979.) If the
state of Washington violates these now known and well-delineated
rights, there would be an actual conflict between state and federal
law which might give rise'' to a federal civil rights lawsuit.
   The appeals court added: ``That, however, has not yet happened
and is not the situation here.'' Therefore, there is no basis for
the award of legal fees, it said.
   Indians said the ruling could be devastating to their efforts at
enforcing treaty rights.
   ``Cases to vindicate treaty rights affecting important resources
of an area may take years to complete because of the extreme
sensitivity of the issues,''said a group of 33 tribes who supported
the appeal by the Washigton tribes. ``Such cases are especially
draining on normally scarce tribal resources.''
   The case is Makah Tribe vs. State of Washington, 87-1390.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States fell by 28 to total 880 this week, Baker Hughes Inc.
announced.
   The rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling
activity, gained ground the week before, rising by four to total
908.
   A year ago, the count totaled 780, Baker Hughes announced Monday.
   Baker Hughes' rig count reflects the number of rigs actively
exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas saw its rig count rise
by four, while Pennsylvania's rig count rose by three, and New
Mexico and Wyoming's rig counts each rose by one.
   The biggest weekly loser was Louisiana, where the rig count
dropped by nine, followed by Colorado, with a loss of seven.
Michigan and Oklahoma's rig counts each dropped by five, while the
rig counts in Ohio and Kansas each dropped by three, and North
Dakota lost one rig.
   California's rig count was unchanged from the week before.

<HEAD>Their Comments Need No Comment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are comments that need no further comment
because they are so clear, incisive, sage or entertaining. There
are others that claim your attention because they are so rare.
   Here are some of the latter:
   _A chairman's letter to stockholders:
   ``Wow! What a great year! Not only was the year 1987 the year in
which your company celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversay as a
company, but it did so in grand style.
   ``It was a banner year. It was celebrated, in part, by a 20
percent increase in revenues, and by a better than 300 percent
increase in net earnings.
   ``This sterling performance was reflected in other ways as well.
   ``Our stockholders realized a 17 percent return on average
stockholders' equity. The company's liquidity is excellent, with
more than $10 million in cash and certificates as of Dec. 21,
1987.''
   The only thing changed in this excerpt from the letter, written
by Francis X. Wazeter, chairman of International Research and
Development Corp., is the paragraphing _ for emphasis _ since good
news becomes weighty in such large doses.
   It wasn't all he offered. In spite of a stock repurchase program
the amount of cash rose by $6.5 million. The company's long-term
debt to stockholder equity was a negligible 0.14 to 1.0. The
pension plan was overfunded.
   _An economic forecaster's admission of error:
   T. Thomas Juster, an economics professor at the University of
Michigan, was among those who expected severe economic
repercussions from the great stock market crash of Oct. 19.
   It hasn't happened yet. On the evidence to date, says Juster,
``the U.S. economy has weathered the storm created by the financial
panic last October, and is likely to resume a modest upward path
after a sluggish first quarter.''
   Among other things, he now observes, ``consumers appear to have
concluded that the stock price decline was an event whose only
impact was to wipe out a few speculators on Wall Street, but that
it didn't mean anything to them.''
   That result, he says, ``comes as a surprise to many analysts,
including this writer.''
   The admission stands out in bold relief, because many of his
colleagues in the forecasting fraternity have never admitted a
thing, and indeed continue to forecast with an assurance that
suggests no miscalculation ever was made.
   _A happy, bullish stock market forecaster:
   As a group, stock market forecasters seen unable to restrain
their pessimism from deteriorating to despair. Fair economic
reports are interpreted as omens. Good news is suspect. Bad news is
assembled to prove the case.
   They have been doing it with the numbers out of Washington. If
the economy shows strength it is viewed as a prelude to inflation
and higher interest rates. If the numbers suggest weakness they
portend a recession in the making.
   Seldom does an economist with one of the big institutions
enunciate his views as boldly as does Edward Yardeni of
Prudential-Bache Securities. He calls the latest economic reports
``beautiful numbers.''
   ``So cheer up!'' he advises. ``Everything is going to be fine.''
   While he expects to see government bond yields below 8 percent
before the end of the year, he asks that bondholders learn to live
with that because the economy will be doing well and inflation will
be low.
   And, he concludes, ``We're still rooting for a 2,700 Dow by
year-end.''

<HEAD>Company Designs Plan For Jittery Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. said Monday it
has designed a plan it hopes will ease employees' jitters about a
possible takeover.
   The ``work force stabilization plan,'' approved by the board of
directors last week, would provide qualified employees with
severance pay and other benefits should they be terminated without
cause within two years of a takeover.
   Chairman C.J. Silas said the plan had been under consideration
for some time and was not in response to any anticipated takeover
attempt.
   ``Phillips has been mentioned frequently as a takeover
candidate, and the board has been concerned that such speculation
is affecting our ability to retain and motivate employees, and
therefore how well we're able to perform for our current
shareholders,'' Silas said.
   Phillips fought off unfriendly takeover attempts in 1984 and
1985. Partly as a result of costs incurred in those battles,
Phillips has reduced its workforce by nearly one-fourth.
   The protection plan includes enhanced severance pay of up to two
years based on years of service, retirement benefits, home purchase
provisions and extension of medical, dental and life insurance
benefits.
   The plan covers eligible longtime Phillips employees on U.S.
payrolls who are terminated without cause within two years of the
trigger date, or employees who resign after a material loss of
position, salary or benefits.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. trade delegation demanded
Monday that South Korea open its domestic markets to U.S. goods and
end restrictive trade practices to help ease the American trade
deficit.
   Peter Allgier, assistant U.S. trade representative, made the
demand at the start of a three-day trade meeting with South Korean
officials which opened in Seoul on Monday.
   South Korean officials said Allgier, chief of the 19-member U.S.
delegation, asked South Korea to slash its growing trade surplus
with the United States by cutting tariffs and dismantling various
import and sales restrictions.
   Hwang Doo-young, head of the 19-member South Korean delegation,
explained Seoul's efforts to solve the problem and presented a
detailed schedule to open its market, the officials said.
   The officials declined to disclose details, however.
   The Seoul meeting, the officials said, will devote its first day
session to discussions on South Korea's high import tariffs and
future plans to open its market for such U.S. services and goods as
advertising, beer and wine.
   The two sides will spend the second day discussing Washington's
demand for retroactive protection of the U.S. intellectual property
rights, the officials said.
   The third will go for talks on eashing South Korea's alleged
restrictions on the sale of U.S. cigarettes, insurance and
agricultural products, they said.
   The Seoul meeting came after a series of bilateral talks on
solving the issues had failed. The United is threatening to
retaliate unless South Korea cuts its trade surplus with the United
States, which reached $9.5 billion last year.

   Contracts for new construction dropped 3 percent
in March, weakened by a sharp decline in commercial and industrial
building, according to a survey released Monday.
   The survey, conducted by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill
Information Systems Co., showed that the value of new construction
contracts on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis fell to $242.4
billion in March from $249.7 billion in February.
   ``With the usual winter volatility out of the way, March
contracting data showed that 1988 construction activity is
beginning to settle into a credible pattern as housing firmed and
commercial building weakened,'' said George A. Christie, F.W. Dodge
vice president and chief economist.
   ``We can look for some temporary improvement of housing starts
in the months ahead as buyers become aware that mortgage rates
won't be going any lower for a while.''
   On the other hand, Christie said, commercial building faces the
prospect of an extended decline as the surplus of office space is
gradually absorbed.
   Contracting in March for commercial and industrial projects
dropped 19 percent from a month earlier, although institutional
building rose 14 percent, the survey showed.
   The value of newly started residential buildings declined 2
percent. Starts of single-family homes reached their highest rate
so far this year, but declines in apartment and hotel-motel
projects more than offset the modest improvement in single-family
building, F.W. Dodge said.
   Contracts for nonbuilding construction _ mainly public works and
utilities _ edged up 1 percent in March. Highway construction
rebounded after several sluggish months, but March contracts for
waste water treatment plants declined, leaving the total value of
public works contracts virtually unchanged from February.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's scuttling of an OPEC plan
for token cuts in oil production may signal a stiffened Saudi
resolve to hold down world oil prices and punish archenemy Iran.
   The Saudis appear increasingly intent on frustrating Iran's
efforts to galvanize a consensus for oil production cuts that could
send prices higher this summer.
   The result may be more in-fighting for the fractious
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and perhaps an even
deeper political paralysis.
   Prices fell sharply Monday after OPEC decided to suspend talks
on a proposed 2 percent cutback in oil production until June.
   Most industry observers had expected the Saudis to go along with
the cutback, since it was so small as to have virtually no effect
on OPEC evenues. An eight-country majority supported the cuts,
which were to be taken in conjunction with cutbacks by a group of
six independent oil-producing nations.
   The fact that Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer stood fast against
the cuts appeared to mean the cartel's most influential member is
unwilling to accept any OPEC action that could lay the foundation
for an Iranian-led price increase.
   Last December the Saudis successfully defeated an Iranian
proposal to raise OPEC's official price by $2.70 a barrel, to
$20.70.
   Iran relies heavily on oil export revenues to finance its
7{-year-old war against Iraq. Saudi Arabia has helped bankroll the
Iraqi war effort.
   Paul Mlotok, who monitored the OPEC meeting for the New York
investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc., said he expected oil prices
to slump this week and then hold steady until OPEC's June meeting.
   Iran and other OPEC members had hoped that by cutting back a
little on production now, when world oil demand is relatively weak,
prices would rebound and then jump even higher this summer during
the traditional peak season for fuel consumption.
   By preventing an accord at the Vienna meeting, the Saudis
probably ensured that any summer price increases will be small,
limiting the benefit for Iran.
   ``This was, for the Saudis, a clear political victory,'' said
Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based oil consultant and former member
of the OPEC staff.
   He said he believed the Saudis never had any intention during
the Vienna meeting of striking a compromise deal.
   ``It was a very well organized and well planned'' effort by the
Saudis to deny Iran the agreement it badly wanted, he said.
   Last week, two days before the OPEC meeting started, the Saudi
government announced it was breaking diplomatic relations with
Iran. It accused Tehran of engaging in terrorism and subversion.
   Kazempour Ardebili, the deputy Iranian oil minister, said after
the Saudi announcement that it may have been intended to spoil the
atmosphere of the Vienna meeting.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian Majlis, or
parliament, on Sunday said the Saudi stalling on oil production
cuts amounted to ``flagrant treachery'' orchestrated by the United
States.
   Saudi Arabia and Iran have been rivals for power and influence
within OPEC from the early days of the cartel, which was formed in
1960 but did not gain a grip on pricing until the Arab oil embargo
of 1973.
   In 1986, however, the Saudis and Iranians appeared to reach a
tacit understanding to work together following a price crash that
sent oil below $10 a barrel.
   The fragile alliance began to unravel last summer after rioting
at the holy city of Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, killed 402 people, most
of them Iranian.
   As long as relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia remain poor,
OPEC is likely to encounter major problems holding oil prices
steady, let alone raising them to the official target of $18 a
barrel.

   First RepublicBank Corp.'s board of directors will
lose some prominent members if shareholders approve the next step
of the ailing bank holding company's restructuring efforts.
   A reduction in the board's size from to 16 from 33 will be
recommended to shareholders during First RepublicBank's annual
meeting June 28, spokesman Joseph C. Bowles said Monday.
   Albert Casey, the new chairman of the bank holding company, had
suggested the smaller board at a meeting last week, and the board
backed that proposal, Bowles said.
   Casey became chairman April 12 after federal insurers and
regulators decided a change in management was necessary to rebuild
Texas' largest bank holding company. A reduction in the size of the
board is a continuation of that change, Bowles said.
   The 17 board members who will not be up for re-election include
First RepublicBank President Joseph R. Musolino and some of Texas'
most prominent business leaders.
   Dallas businessman H.R. ``Bum'' Bright, majority owner of the
Dallas Cowboys; longtime board member James D. Berry, Ed R. Haggar,
chairman of Dallas-based Haggar Apparel Co.; and Texas Republican
Party chairman George W. Strake Jr. also will not be on the ballot,
Bowles said.
   He said no new individuals will be placed on the ballot for
election to the board. Casey, Dallas businessman Charles Cullum and
San Antonio, Texas, businessman Sam Barshop are among the 16 board
members who will remain.
   First RepublicBank posted a first quarter loss of $1.5 billion,
forcing an emergency federal recaptilization of the company. The
loss was the second-largest ever for a U.S. bank after Citicorp's
$2.5 billion loss in the second quarter 1987.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. loaned First RepublicBank $1
billion during the quarter to boost depositors' confidence in the
institution. The FDIC's long-term plan could cost an estimated $2
billion to $4 billion.

   Wheat futures closed substantially lower Monday
on the Chicago Board of Trade while corn finished higher and
soybean prices closed mixed.
   Analysts tied the lower wheat prices to weekend rains and the
higher corn prices to a lack thereof.
   ``Most of the Plains did manage to get rains over the weekend
but it didn't get any further,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst in
Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``It really didn't get into the eastern edges of Kansas and
Nebraska, where there's some dryness,'' he said.
   Corn also was supported by a favorable export outlook, he said.
   Soybeans for May delivery traded as high as $6.98 a bushel
during the session but prices fell on late profit-taking, Gustafson
said.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 6\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.01 a bushel; corn was 1} cents

   Allegis Corp., the parent company of United
Airlines, said Monday it will sell a 50 percent share in its Apollo
computer reservations system for $500 million to USAir and four
European airlines.
   Under terms of the agreement, pending review by the U.S.

   Covia Corp., which is fully owned by United Airlines, will
retain a 50 percent share in the new venture and be the managing
general partner, the company said. Barry Kotar, Covia's president
and chief executive officer, will fill the same roles in the new
partnership.
   Covia Partnership, based in Rosemont, Ill., will operate
United's computer reservations system, its telecommunications
network and provide various data processing services. It will own
the Apollo software, databases and computer center in Denver.

<HEAD>LTV's Profit Up 12.7 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Corp. reported its profit rose 12.7 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier, boosted by gains from the
company's reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy
laws.
   The diversified steel and aerospace giant said Monday that its
first-quarter profit increased to $163.9 million, or $1.16 a share,
from $129.6 million, or $1 a share, in the first three months of
1987.
   The figure for the latest quarter includes a one-time special
credit of $24.8 million resulting from the sale of two iron ore
vessels.
   The rise in net income occurred despite a decline in
first-quarter sales, to $1.88 billion from $1.91 billion a year
earlier.
   ``The deferral of interest, pension and other costs while we are
operating under the protection of Chapter 11 has greatly benefited
both periods,'' said Raymond A. Hay, LTV's chairman and chief
executive officer. The company entered Chapter 11 protection from
creditors in July 1986.
   Hay noted, however, that the deferrals of costs and expenses
have resulted in claims which must be provided for in a plan of
reorganization before LTV can emerge from bankruptcy.
   In January 1987, the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.
terminated and took control of the three pension plans of
subsidiary LTV Steel Co., assuming financial responsibility for
$2.3 billion in unfunded liabilities.
   But in September, the pension agency returned trusteeship of the
plans to LTV, saying it took the step to curb abuse of the federal
pension insurance program. It cited $252 million in profits the
company reported for the first half of 1987 and LTV's establishment
of a new pension arrangement for its workers.
   LTV has said it believes the agency's attempt to return
trusteeship of the pension plans is illegal.
   Excluding the special credit for the sale of the vessels, the
company said its operating income for the quarter rose to $151
million from $139.7 million a year earlier because of higher income
from steel.
   Operating income from steel rose to $131.2 million from $101.1
million in the first quarter of 1987, while steel sales expanded to
$1.3 billion from $1.2 billion.
   Income from LTV's aircraft products division dropped to $11.3
million from $22.2 million, largely because of reduced activity
following completion of the B-1B bomber program in the fourth
quarter of 1987.
   Income from the energy products division rose to $2.6 million
from $900,000 in the first three months of 1987.

   Stock prices showed no clear trend today in a
session marked by some late buying of blue chips.
   Evidence that the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace
has lately been met with little enthusiasm by investors.
   The government reported this morning that factory orders
increased 1.6 percent in March.
   The market also hasn't shown much response to generally strong
corporate earnings reports for the first quarter.
   Analysts say individual investors and professional money
managers continue to shy away from stocks, with memories still
fresh of the crash last fall and controversy continuing over the
effects of computer program trading.

   The oil ministers of Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait said Monday they expected world oil prices to stabilize near
current levels, despite the breakdown of an OPEC meeting.
   But prices on world markets fell sharply after the OPEC
conference ended with no agreement on a proposed 2 percent cut in
the group's oil production.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Monday, West Texas
Intermediate oil, the U.S. benchmark crude, dropped 85 cents a
barrel to settle at $17.14. Prices for refined products also slid.
   Asked by reporters if he thought prices would fall further in
response to the stalemate, Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said,
``I don't see why. I see (market) fundamentals improving.''
   He was referring to projections that oil demand in the main
industrialized countries will pick up this summer, relieving some
of the downward pressure on prices.
   Nazer also said he was optimistic about gaining more cooperation
from non-OPEC oil exporters, including American oil-producing
states.
   ``The oil states in the United States are very, very much
interested in the stabilization of the market,'' he said.
   Kent Hance, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission that
regulates that state's oil industry, held talks with Nazer and
other OPEC officials last week in Vienna.
   Hance told them Texas wanted to ``open a dialogue'' with the oil
cartel, despite Washington's refusal to take such a step.
   Nazer and Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, told
separate news conferences that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries was not worried by short-term reactions in the
oil market.
   ``Our concern is not what happened ... on Monday or Tuesday but
what happens to prices in the medium or long term,'' al-Sabah said.
   At its current oil production rate of about 17.5 million barrels
a day, OPEC stands to lose $122 million a week for each $1 drop in
prices.
   Nazer said his government was confident that prices will
stabilize near OPEC's target of $18 a barrel in the longer term.
   ``We wouldn't pay any attention to short-term gyrations,'' he
said.
   The OPEC oil ministers had come to Vienna hoping to reach
agreement with a group of six independent oil-producing nations on
mutual export reductions.
   The non-OPEC group _ Mexico, Egypt, China, Oman, Angola and
Malaysia _ offered to cut exports by 5 percent, or about 200,000
barrels a day, if OPEC did likewise.
   OPEC member Algeria proposed that the cartel cut its output by
300,000 barrels a day, or about 2 percent, in order to establish a
basis for a more formal relationship with the rival producers.
   But Saudi Arabia, backed by Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates, blocked the proposal, saying OPEC should take more time
to consider a response.
   Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti minister, told reporters OPEC also should
clear up some internal problems before deciding on new methods of
cooperation with other producers.
   He said the lack of agreement within OPEC on such technical
issues as how to ensure compliance with oil production quotas made
any new agreements on production cuts meaningless.
   ``We all realized that the extent of the problem is much greater
than just cutting'' output now by a token amount, he said.
   He said an OPEC committee would study the technical issues
before the next ministerial conference, set for June 8.
   Also, a separate OPEC committee of five oil ministers is to hold
bilateral and group meetings with the six non-OPEC countries prior
to June, he said.

<HEAD>Management Group Says It Has Agreed To Buy Ms., Sassy Magazines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managers of Fairfax Publications (U.S.) said
Monday they have agreed to buy Ms. and Sassy magazines from the
company's Australian parent for an undisclosed price.
   Sandra Yates, president and chief executive of the newly formed
Matilda Publications Inc., and Anne Summers, Matilda's vice
president, said they expected to close the deal on May 20.
   Yates said no changes were planned at either monthly magazine.
   John Fairfax Ltd., based in Sydney, Australia, acquired Ms.
magazine last September. Unconfirmed reports had placed the
purchase price at between $10 million and $15 million.
   Sassy, a new magazine aimed at teen-age girls, was launched in
March. Yates had previously estimated startup costs at $10 million.
   Fairfax was taken private in December, and Yates said the
company decided to sell the magazines to pay off some of its debts.
   Yates said she and Summers held an option to purchase the
magazines, and they decided to exercise it after arranging
financing from an unidentified venture capital group and the New
York office of State Bank of New South Wales.
   ``This financial deal provides us with the best opportunity for
the growth of Ms. and Sassy, while maintaining their
independence,'' she said.
   She said the ``working capital we have been able to secure is
equivalent to what Fairfax would have invested had their plans
remained intact.''
   Ms., which was founded 16 years ago by Gloria Steinem and Pat
Carbine, has recently increased its rate base to 500,000 copies a
month from 450,000.
   No circulation figures have been released for Sassy, but Yates
said the magazine has ``well and truly made its rate base of
250,000.''
   She said other parties had inquired about the magazines, but she
was unaware of any other firm bids for the two publications, which
were put up for sale in the middle of March.

<HEAD>Japan's Surplus Falls 7.2 Percent In Fiscal Year 1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surge in imports caused Japan's merchandise trade
surplus to fall 7.2 percent to $94.3 billion in the 1987 fiscal
year, the Finance Ministry announced Monday.
   The report confirmed the continuing strength of Japan's economy
in spite of the strong Japanese yen, which hurts the
competitiveness of Japanese products in domestic and overseas
markets.
   Exports grew 10.5 percent to $233.4 billion, but imports grew
even faster, rising 26.9 percent to $139.1 billion. Both figures,
measured on a balance-of-payments basis, were records.
   The report did not provide a breakdown of where Japan's imports
were coming from. But other recent figures have shown that the
biggest growth is from the newly industrialized countries of Hong
Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.
   Growth of imports from the United States has been sluggish.
   The trade surplus of $94.28 billion in the fiscal year ended
March 31, although smaller than the 1986 surplus of $101.65
billion, was the second highest on record.
   The report demonstrated that Japan is still able to increase its
exports at a double-digit pace in spite of the drag of the strong
yen. At the same time, Japan's burgeoning consumer economy is
sucking in more imports.
   Imports have also risen because Japanese exporters are getting
more of their components from abroad.
   Finance Ministry officials noted that the composition of
Japanese imports has shifted, with a larger share now consisting of
manufactured goods rather than raw materials.
   Government programs aimed at reducing trade friction by limiting
the economy's reliance on exports and encouraging domestic demand
played a role in cutting the trade surplus.
   ``Although the higher value of the Japanese yen had an effect,
the main cause of the fall in the trade surplus is the government's
program to boost imports,'' the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``These statistics show that the government's effort to change
the country's industrial structure and reduce our dependence on
exports has been successful,'' another ministry official said, also
speaking anonymously.
   The country's current account surplus also plunged almost $10
billion during the fiscal year for its first decline in six years,
the ministry said.
   The current account includes capital transfers and trade in
goods and services to measure a nation's commerce. The ministry
said the current account surplus registered $84.54 billion in
fiscal 1987, down from $94.14 billion the previous year.
   Japan's merchandise trade, measured on a balance-of-payments
basis, does not include freight or insurance charges on either
imports or exports. Another commonly used trade measure, the
customs-clearance basis, includes freight and insurance charges on
imports. That boosts the value of imports and makes the trade
deficit smaller.

   The United States and Japan continued
high-level negotiations Monday in their dispute over increasing the
sale of American beef and oranges in Japan.
   Neither side would disclose whether or how much progress was
made in the round of talks Japanese Agriculture Minister Takashi
Sato started last Wednesday with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter.
   The two cabinet-level officials met both Monday morning and
afternoon and tentatively scheduled another session for Tuesday,
sources said.
   U.S. officials would say only they continued to insist on
removal of Japanese import quotas the two countries agreed to in a
1984 accord that expired last month. Otherwise, the issue will be
pursued before GATT, General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, at its
meeting Wednesday in Geneva, they said.
   Japanese officials said a major issue was ``timing'' of the
removal. They declined to confirm Tokyo news reports of various
Japanese proposals for a three- or five-year interval before full
lifting of the barriers.
   Japan is the major customer for U.S. farm products but its
domestic livestock and citrus producers have insisted on the quotas
on imports of beef, oranges and orange juices as vital to their
livelihood. U.S. exporters have argued that as a result Japanese
consumers are paying more than double the fair price for beef and
oranges.

<TEXT>
   Continuing uncertainty about the health of the
economy supressed demand for office space in the nation's central
business districts during the first quarter, according to a study
released Monday.
   The national real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield Inc. said
office vacancy rates jumped to 15.1 percent during the quarter from
13.8 percent in the previous quarter in the nearly 50 markets it
reviewed.
   ``The uncertainty plaguing the financial markets and the
economy's performance over the past eight months are beginning to
affect the country's major real estate markets,'' said Cushman
President and Chief Executive Officer Arthur J. Mirante II.
   Austin, Texas had the most vacant downtown space with a vacancy
rate of 34.7 percent during the first quarter, up from 33.4
percent, although other oil-dependent cities showed some
improvement from the previous quarter.
   San Jose, Calif., had the second-highest vacancy rate of 28.8
percent, followed by Memphis, 28.1 percent; Denver, 26.9 percent;
Miami, 26.8 percent; Orange County, Calif., 26.4 percent; West Palm
Beach, Fla., 25.8 percent; Houston, 25.5 percent and Dallas, 25
percent.
   Among the cities with the lowest vacancy rates, Hartford, Conn.
led the nation with a vacancy rate of 8.1 percent. Hartford was
followed by Detroit, 8.9 percent; Charlotte, N.C., 10 percent;
Boston, 10.5 percent; Seattle, 10.7 percent; Washington, 10.8
percent; Philadelphia, 10.9 percent; Jacksonville, Fla., 11
percent; Chicago, 12.1 percent and Greensboro, N.C., 12.5 percent.
   A significant decrease in new construction helped vacancies in
suburban markets ease slightly to 21.9 percent from 22.2 percent in
the previous quarter.
   Cushman & Wakefield predicted that office vacancy rates in
central business districts would peak during the current quarter if
economic conditions remain stable, and then resume a downward trend.

<TEXT>
   As part of its inflation-fighting program,
Mexico will hold the peso currency at its current value against the
U.S. dollar until the end of the year, Treasury Secretary Gustavo
Petricioli said.
   Petricioli told local reporters late Sunday that economic
conditions permit the government to continue a freeze on the
exchange rate that has been in effect since March. His remarks were
reported in Monday's newspapers.
   The Treasury chief said that any change in the exchange rate
would give a kick to the inflation rate.
   ``There are people interested in continuing inflation because
this makes the rich richer and the poor poorer,'' he said.
   ``A new slide in the exchange rate,'' he said, ``would be
inflationary and the great majority of the Mexicans want stability
in order to raise the standard of living.''
   He predicted that consumer prices would rise about 2 percent a
month by the middle of this year, well under the record 15.5
percent in January.
   ``Starting from then, the effort will continue so that this
administration ends with very small inflation, which will establish
the bases for a firm and sustained development,'' Petricioli said.
   President Miguel de la Madrid's six-year term expires at the end
of November. He is virtually certain to be succeeded by Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, the presidential nominee of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   Salinas de Gortari's presidential aspirations would be given a
sharp boost if the government were successful in sharply paring
back the inflation rate. The presidential elections will be held
July 6.
   De la Madrid quickly fashioned the Economic Solidarity Pact in
December after consumer prices surged dramatically. In all of 1987,
the inflation rate was a record 159.2 percent.
   As part of the Solidarity Pact, the government announced in
March a freeze on the prices of goods and services it regulates and
the peso-dollar exchange rate.
   It extended the freeze in April and May and announced the
minimum wage for unskilled workers also would be held steady during
those two months.
   The government announced that consumer prices rose 8.3 percent
in February and 5.1 percent in March.
   The exchange rate was 2,241 to 2,273 pesos to the dollar on
Monday in the controlled market, which is used in about 75 percent
of all commercial transactions.
   The free rate, used in tourism and for transactions along the
U.S.-Mexico border, was 2,260 to 2,280 pesos to the dollar.
   In mid-December, the government devalued the currency to 2,200
pesos to the dollar.

   Italy's second-largest bank said Monday it was
seeking to acquire a majority stake in Irving Bank Corp., but
analysts said swaying shareholders away from Bank of New York Co.'s
competing hostile bid remains an uphill battle.
   Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, which had sought a 45 percent
stake in Irving, said it will seek to purchase 9.5 million Irving
shares, or about 51 percent of the New York-based bank.
   The state-run Italian bank is offering $75 a share, the same
price as under its previous plan that sought to purchase 8.5
million shares. In addition, Banca Commerciale said it would pay
intererst on the per-share purchase price from May 31 until the
deal closes.
   Banca Commerciale also said it ``continues to contemplate''
paying Irving shareholders a special $10-a-share dividend on
remaining shares if it is successful in acquiring the bank.
   Irving's board approved the amended offer and recommended
shareholders tender to it, but analysts were less enthusiastic.
   ``I don't think most investors will bother studying it,'' said
Virginia Adair, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. ``I think it will
be treated as fairly insignificant.''
   Irving said the offer, which hinges on a complex restructuring,
has a blended value of between $65.20 and $72.55 a share, a slight
increase over its previous offer.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said his company would not
increase its bid, adding that ``the stock market has chosen to
ignore BCI's proposal.''
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Irving rose
12{ cents to close at $61.62{ a share; Bank of New York rose 12{
cents to close at $30.50 a share.
   Bank of New York, which holds a 5 percent stake in Irving, is
offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of
Irving's 18.5 million shares outstanding, or about $1.08 billion.
   The bank also is waging a proxy fight by running a slate of 16
candidates for election to Irving's board at a shareholders meeting
scheduled for May 6.
   As of last Friday, about 10 million Irving shares had been
tendered under Bank of New York's buyout offer of roughly $64 a
share. Those shares, coupled with the 888,634 shares Bank of New
York already owns, give the bank a 59.2 percent stake in Irving,
the company said.
   The tender offer was extended Monday for a fourth time; it will
expire at noon EDT Friday.
   Separately, Banca Commerciale said Italy's central bank has
indicated it has no objection to Banca Commerciale's purchase of a
controlling interest in Irving. But the Bank of Italy's support did
little to quell analysts' more serious concerns over domestic
regulatory approval.
   Because the ownership structure of the Italian bank is part
industrial and part government, analysts believe approval from the
Federal Reserve could be hard to come by.
   A Banca Commerciale-Irving combination ``would violate our
domestic laws on bank holding companies,'' Adair said.
   Some observers suggested that Banca Commerciale's willingness to
pay interest on its payout to shareholders is an admission that the
deal could run into regulatory snags.
   ``The interest gives some protection about a prolonged approval
process while shareholders are waiting for the Fed to make up its
mind,'' said Stephen Berman, an analyst with County Securities USA.
   ``To some extent it's kind of a recognition of the potential
tie-up of share for a long time,'' he added.
   Bank of New York received conditional approval from the Fed and
the New York State Banking boards in March, and began its tender
offer shortly after.
   Banca Commerciale's stock purchase is part of a complex
restructuring proposed by Irving that includes several cost-cutting
measures and asset sales.
   To that end, Irving said it will sell its 39 percent equity
interest in Banca della Svizzera Italiana to the Swiss-based
financial firm Unigestion SA for $390 million in cash. Irving
estimates a pre-tax gain of $136 million, or $5 per share, from the
transaction.
   The bank also said it would sell its 50-story building at One
Wall Street. Both transactions are expected to fund the special $10
dividend payout.
   Irving Chairman Joseph Rice said in a statement that the bank's
board ``greatly appreciates the willingness of BCI to improve its
offer.'' If the deal were consumated, Banca Commerciale would have
the right to buy an additional 10 percent of Irving stock on the
open market.

   Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. announced Monday that its
executive committee had elected E. John Rosenwald, Jr. vice
chairman and James E. Cayne president.
   Bear Stearns, a publicly traded financial company, is the parent
of Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., a major investment and brokerage firm.
   Both positions, which are new, will apply to both the parent
company and the brokerage subsidiary.
   Both men will continue as members of the board of directors and
executive committee of the parent and as senior managing directors
of Bear, Stearns & Co. Rosenwald and Cayne have been members of the
office of the president since October 1985 when Bear Stearns became
a public company, but that office has been eliminated.
   Rosenwald, 58, has headed the company's corporate finance
department since 1976 and is the senior investment banker in the
department. He joined Bear Stearns in 1954, first as a research
analyst and later in its international department.
   Rosenwald headed institutional sales for 20 years before moving
to corporate finance. He became a general partner of Bear Stearns
in 1962.
   Cayne, 54, is manager of the company's U.S. branch system and is
responsible for individual investor sales. He started at Bear
Stearns in 1969 as a salesman for individual investors and became a
general partner in 1973, building the retail business into a major
division.
   The chairman and chief executive officer of Bear Stearns
Companies is Alan C. Greenberg; the executive vice president and
chief operating officer is Alvin H. Einbender.

   Blue-chip issues staged a modest rally, but the
rest of the stock market lagged in a sluggish session Monday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.94 to 2,043.27.
   But declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 4 to 3 in
New York Stock Exchange-listed trading, with 617 up, 875 down and
488 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 136.47 million shares, against 135.62
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index slipped
.04 to 147.83.
   Evidence that the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace
has lately been met with little enthusiasm by investors.
   The government reported Monday morning that factory orders
increased 1.6 percent in March.
   The market also hasn't shown much response to generally strong
corporate earnings reports for the first quarter.
   Analysts say individual investors and professional money
managers continue to shy away from stocks, with memories still
fresh of the crash last fall and controversy continuing over the
effects of computer program trading.
   ``The market shows little in the way of direction, with many
participants content to remain on the sidelines,'' said Newton
Zinder, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Energy stocks were mostly lower on news that oil-producing
nations hadn't reached any agreement to restrain production. Amoco
dropped | to 77{; Mobil { to 46\; Atlantic Richfield 1] to 87\;
Occidental Petroleum ] to 26|, and Chevron { to 47{.
   Atlantic Richfield reported sharply higher first-quarter profits.
   At the same time, airline stocks rose on the prospect of lower
fuel prices. AMR added 1[ to 44\; Allegis 2] to 84], and Delta Air

   Arkansas Best jumped 7[ to 23, posting the day's best percentage

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $0.31 billion, or 0.01
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter

   American steel companies put 95.5 percent of
their production capacity into use last week, the highest
percentage in nearly nine years, the American Iron and Steel
Institute reported Monday.
   But the trade group noted that actual output was far below that
of nine years ago because production capacity has been slashed due
to competition from foreign mills. U.S. producers now have a
maximum capacity of about 112 million tons a year, compared with
just over 155 million tons when they operated at 96.3 percent of
capacity in the last week of 1979, the group said.
   According to the group's latest report, steel production rose to
2.046 million tons in the week ended April 30, an increase of 3.9
percent from the previous week's 1.970 million tons. The capacity
percentage was up from 91.9 percent the previous week.
   Estimated figures for the year to date put production at 33.653
million net tons, an increase of 27.6 percent from the 26.372
million net tons in the previous year. The steel operations of USX
Corp., the nation's largest steel producer, were shut down by a
strike during the first month of 1987.
   Production so far this year used 90.7 percent of capacity,
compared with 71.4 percent a year earlier.
   Net tonnage by district for the week ended April 30: Northeast
Coast, 276,000; Pittsburgh, 204,000; Youngstown, 127,000; Lake
Erie, 170,000; Detroit, 171,000; Chicago, 559,000; Midwest,

<TEXT>
   Americans increased their efficiency in
producing goods and services at an annual rate of nearly 1 pecent
last quarter, the government said Monday in one of three reports
showing a robust U.S. economy.
   Non-farm businesses improved their productivity by an annual
rate of 0.9 percent from January through March, reversing a 1
percent deterioration in their efficiency during the previous three
months, the Labor Department said.
   Excluding agriculture and government, those businesses
responsible for three-fourths of the nation's economic activity
raised their output of goods and services by 2.7 percent with only
a 1.7 percent increase in hours worked.
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said orders for U.S.
manufactured products increased 1.6 percent in March while
construction spending rose by 1.5 percent, much of it on government
building and highway projects.
   ``Everything is coming up roses,'' said Allen Sinai of The
Boston Co., a New York-based economic consultant. ``A little
trouble on the inflation front and in the financial markets is not
a strong price to pay for this kind of super performance on growth,
jobs and spending. It's an incumbent politician's dream.''
   Meanwhile, on Wall Street Monday, blue-chip issues staged a
modest rally, but the rest of the stock market lagged in a sluggish
session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.94 to
2,043.27 but declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 4
to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The dollar was mixed against major currencies. Bond prices fell.
   Oil futures prices turned sharply lower in a wave of selling
prompted by the failure of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to set temporary production cuts. On the New York
Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate oil, the U.S.
benchmark crude, slid to $17.14 per barrel for June delivery, down
85 cents from Friday's close.
   The increase in factory orders to a seasonally adjusted $216.08
billion in March after no change in February and a decrease in
January was seen as coming from both domestic and foreign markets.
   While an export boom has been occuring for several months,
analysts had seen little in trade figures to indicate that the
devaluation of the dollar had made imports expensive enought to
curb Americans' appetitites for them.
   ``These orders show that domestic auto and clothing makers are
starting to displace the tide of imports,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group, formerly Wharton
Econometrics, in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``There's still no booming demand
in consumer spending.''
   The rise in construction spending was led by a 5.4 percent surge
in government projects, some of the result of Congress overriding
President Reagan's veto of an $88 billion highway bill last year.
   The productivity gains were a surprise to most economists in the
wake of employment reports showing the creation of nearly 1 million
new jobs the first three months of 1988.
   ``The economy is not quite as strong as the employment data
suggest,'' said Donald Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill
Lynch. ``In fact the productivity numbers look pretty good.''
   They showed wages and benefits increased at an annual rate of
3.4 percent in the first quarter, raising the labor costs
associated with each service or product by 2.4 percent annually.
   But those unit labor costs had soared at an annual rate of 4.5
percent in the final quarter of 1987, triggering fears among
several analysts that the nation was on the verge of wage-push
inflation.
   ``Productivity is the cushion you can put in between wage
increases and price increases; this is good news for inflation,''
said David Wyss, an economist for Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass.
   After taking inflation into account _ as measured by relative
changes in total output and prices _ the wage gains the first
quarter of 1988 yielded not a penny more of purchasing power for
workers. Still, it is the first time since the last quarter of 1986
that they have even kept pace with inflation.
   Manufacturing, which still accounts for about one-fourth of the
country's gross national product, continued to lead the effort in
restoring U.S. competitivness.
   Productivity by manufacturers increased at an annual rate of 2.9
percent the first quarter with a 4.3 percent increase in output on
only a 1.3 percent increase in the number of hours worked in the
nation's factories.
   For the first time since early 1986, factory workers actually
kept ahead of inflation, according to the data.
   Nominal wage gains averaging 3.9 percent annually the first
quarter _ the biggest in more than two years _ increased the
purchasing power of assembly line workers by one-half of 1 percent.
Their purchasing power had dropped 2.2 percent in 1987, according
to the data.
   The wage and benefit increases also raised the labor costs
associated with each item coming off the factory floor an average 1
percent, compared with a nearly 2 percent decline in unit labor
costs in 1987.
   ``With unemployment rates at low as they are, you are going to
see some upward pressure on wages,'' said Merrill Lynch's
Straszheim. ``That's good news for wage earners, bad for wage
payers and, accordingly, for inflation.''
   Most economists doubt that the United States can maintain the
first quarter's productivity gains the rest of the year,
particularly if joblessness remains at or near its current level of
5.6 percent.
   ``Output is limited by capacity in some industries, which points
to more hours and sharper increases in labor costs for the rest of
the year,'' said Sinai. ``That in turn will hurt profits and add to
inflationary pressures. Companies often try to increase prices off
of rising labor costs.''

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed; Gold Prices Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices fell and the dollar turned mixed
against major foreign currencies in sluggish trading Monday as
traders reacted to falling oil prices.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at
$445 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $450 an ounce late
Friday.
   The drop in oil prices cooled fears of inflation, and that
helped cause the fall in the price of gold. But currency traders
reacted with uncertainty to the news on oil.
   Foreign-exchange trading was quiet because of holidays abroad.
London markets were closed Monday for a bank holiday, and there was
nothing for the New York market to lead into because the Tokyo
market was to be closed Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
   ``It was very, very quiet,'' said Robert A. White, a vice
president at First Interstate Bank of California in Los Angeles.
   Lower oil prices often hurt the dollar's value, partly because
most oil is bought with dollars. Also, the United States benefits
less from cheaper oil than the import-reliant economies of Japan
and Western Europe.
   Oil traders reacted to the news that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries ended a meeting with no agreement on
a proposed 2 percent cut in the group's oil production.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
oil, the U.S. benchmark crude, slid to $17.14 per barrel for June
delivery, down 85 cents from Friday's close.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 0.51 yen to a closing 125.33 yen from 124.82 yen on
Thursday. Later, in Europe, the dollar was quoted at 125.20 yen. At
the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar stood at 1124.83
yen, down from 125.14 yen late Friday.
   Also in Europe, the dollar gained more than a cent against the
British pound. The British pound was quoted at $1.8645, compared
with $1.8785 Friday. In New York, the pound fell against the dollar
to $1.8723 from $1.8755 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.6783 West German marks, up from 1.6773; 1.3974
Swiss francs, down from 1.3978; 1.2326 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2290; 5.7000 French francs, up from 5.6965; and 1,248.83 Italian
lire, up from 1,248.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's rates:
1.6810 West German marks, up from 1.6725; 1.4015 Swiss francs, up
from 1.3910; 5.7153 French francs, up from 5.6805; 1.8860 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8745; 1,251.60 Italian lire, up from 1,242.00;
and 1.2315 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2280.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $2.06 a troy ounce to close at a bid
$450.30 an ounce.
   Gold in Zurich was also lower, closing at a bid $446 a troy
ounce compared with $449 an ounce on Friday. On New York's
Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery was bid at
$445.60 a troy ounce, down from $451 an ounce late Friday.
   Silver was quoted in Zurich at a bid price of $6.37 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's late London bid price of $6.45 an ounce.
On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery was bid at
$6.353 a troy ounce, down from $6.498 an ounce.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Futures Plunge Along With Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures prices plunged along with those for
crude oil and refined oil products Monday following the failure of
OPEC oil ministers to agree on production cuts.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures were mixed; cattle
and livestock were mostly higher and stock-index futures advanced.
   The discord within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries was seen as negative for the inflation-sensitive precious
metals because it suggests a continuation of low oil prices _ and
low inflation.
   Analysts also cited the steady dollar and a lack of buying from
Europe, where banks and government offices were closed for May Day,
as reasons for the sharp drop in gold and silver futures.
   ``But it was primarily the OPEC news and the effect that might
have on inflation or the lack thereof,'' said John Norris, chief
precious metals trader for Citibank in New York.
   Norris said other economic signals that affect metals prices
have been confusing and individual investors have been notably
absent from the metals markets, leaving the markets prone to
weakness.
   ``The signals are so mixed that no one is taking a firm view one
way or another,'' he said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $5.40 to
$5.50 lower with the contract for delivery in June at $447.20 a
troy ounce; silver was 14.5 cents to 15.4 cents lower with May at
$6.353 a troy ounce.
   Saudi Arabia took a hard line against OPEC production cuts at
the cartel's meeting in Vienna, Austria, which ended Sunday. The
OPEC oil ministers will meet again June 8 and may resume talks on
tightening supplies to raise prices to the cartel's target of $18.
   But if the Saudis remain staunchly opposed to production cuts,
``it could conceivably mean we'll see a futher move on the
downside,'' said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst in New York
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   In trading Monday, West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 60
cents to 85 cents lower with June at $17.14 a barrel; heating oil
was 1.89 cents to 2.42 cents lower with June at 45.95 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.50 cents to 2.24 cents lower with
June at 49.37 cents a gallon.
   Wheat futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade while
corn finished higher and soybeans were nearly unchanged.
   Analysts tied the lower wheat prices to weekend rains and the
higher corn prices to a lack thereof. Corn also was supported by a
favorable export outlook, they said.
   Soybeans for May delivery traded as high as $6.98 a bushel
during the session but prices retreated on late profit-taking, said
Dale Gustafson, an analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
   The Agricultre Department reported Monday that 80 percent of the
winter wheatcrop was in fair condition as of Sunday, with 15
percent rated good and 5 percent excellent.
   The USDA also reported 78 percent of the spring wheat crop was
planted as of Sunday, compared to 61 percent a year ago and well
ahead of the average of 42 percent for that date; and 36 percent of
the corn crop planted, behind the year-ago figure of 43 percent but
ahead of the average of 24 percent.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 7 cents lower with May at $3 a bushel;
corn was 1} cents to 3 cents higher with May at $2.05\ a bushel;
oats were { cent to 1 cent lower with May at $1.58{ a bushel;
soybeans were 2} cents lower to 1 cent higher with May unchanged at
$6.89{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures finished mostly
higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .50 cent higher with June at
70.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .35 cent
higher with May at 78.70 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .43
cent higher with June at 49.17 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .15 cent to 1.28 cent higher with May at 51.95 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .70 point higer at 261.70.

   Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A. said Monday it was
raising the price on most Nissan passenger cars and trucks an
average 1.5 percent.
   The increase, which is effective immediately, averages about
$167 per vehicle, said Thomas D. Mignanelli, executive vice
president of operations for the Carson, Calif.-based U.S. sales and
distribution arm of Japan's Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.
   The company said the increase is the result of the continued
strength of the yen against the dollar.
   Prices for all four-door Sentra models, the Maxima GXE wagon,
the Pulsar SE and Pulsar SportBak SE, are unaffected by the
increase, said Bob Thomas, a spokesman for Nissan.
   Prices for other Sentra models, Maxima sedans, and models
belonging to the Stanza, Pathfinder, pickup truck, 200SX and 300ZX
lines are affected, Thomas said.

<TEXT>
   An index measuring the ability of the typical
American family to buy a home rose in March to the highest level
this year as growth in incomes and lower mortgage rates offset
higher home prices, a real estate trade group said Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said its affordability
index climbed to 114.2 in March, up from a revised February level
of 113.7.
   The March number means that a family earning the median income
of $31,526 annually had 14.2 percent more income than needed to
qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of
a median-priced home.
   The affordability index, which has been above 100 since June
1986, should remain in the positive range for the rest of the year
although they predicted it would probably be pushed slightly lower
in the months ahead because of rising mortgage rates.
   ``We have seen the best news in interest rates in 1988. Our
forecast is for interest rates to drift upward for the rest of the
year,'' said John Tuccillo, the association's chief economist.
   The change in the index last month reflected a rise in the
median price of a home, which climbed to $88,700. This was offset
by a 0.5 percent increase in incomes and a drop in a composite
mortgage rate to 9.08 percent, down from 9.16 percent the previous
month. The composite rate reflects changes in both fixed-rate and
adjustable-rate mortgages.

<HEAD>Executive Recruiter Accused of Insider Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Monday accused a Massachusetts man of violating insider trading
regulations by making stock profits based on information he learned
in his job as head of a corporate recruiting firm.
   The SEC civil complaint accused Michael O. Ingoldsby of making
$14,000 in profit in trading shares of stock in Artel
Communications Corp., a fiber optics company with headquarters in
Hudson, Mass.
   The SEC charged that Ingoldsby, the head of an executive search
firm located in Wellesley, Mass., was hired by Artel in September
1986 to find a new chief executive for the company.
   Ingoldsby allegedly purchased 23,500 shares of Artel stock after
learning that Robert L. Bowman, an executive he had recruited to
head Artel, was about to accept the top post at the company.
   The SEC complaint, which was filed in federal court in Boston,
seeks an injunction barring Ingoldsby from violating
insider-trading regulations in the future and seeks fines equal to
the $14,000 he allegedly made in profit in trading Artel stock.
   Ingoldsby, the head of Michael O. Ingoldsby Associations Inc.,
did not return phone calls asking for comment on the SEC charges.

<HEAD>Small Utilities Group Settles With Bondholders In WPPSS Case</HEAD>

   Twenty-four small utilities and cities in six
Western states reached a $25.8 million settlement Monday with
bondholders who sued them following Washington Public Power Supply
System's default on bonds sold to construct two nuclear power
plants.
   Jack Lowery, lead counsel for the group, confirmed the
agreement, the latest in a series of settlements totaling about
$203 million involving defendant utilities, bond underwriters and
legal firms.
   Lowery said the 24 utilities, in Washington, Oregon, Idaho,
Montana, Wyoming and Nevada, owned a combined interest of 6.5
percent in the two terminated plants, WPPSS No. 4 on the Hanford
nuclear reservation and No. 5 at Satsop, west of Olympia.
   Lowery said most of the $25.8 million would come from insurance
coverage, although some of the utilities would have to pay out of
their own pockets.
   While maintaining they did no wrong, by settling the utilities
saved legal expenses from a case that could take years to resolve
and avoided the possibility of losing their case in a jury trial,
he said.
   The giant case stemming from the WPPSS bond default, the biggest
in municipal bond market history, is to go to trial Sept. 7 in U.S.
District Court before Judge William Browning in Tucson, Ariz.
Dozens of individual cases were combined in the federal action.
   Eighty-eight utilities agreed to build the two WPPSS plants
during the 1970s, but the plants were abandoned in 1982 after cost
overruns and an assessment that the power from the plants would not
be needed.
   The settlement Monday came on the eve of three days of hearings
in federal court in Seattle before Judge Browning in the WPPSS case.

   The American Electronics Association,
which represents the $360 billion U.S. electronics industry, has
opened a liaison office in China, the trade group announced Monday.
   The AEA made the announcement in conjunction with an opening
ceremoney in Beijing, attended by more than 100 Chinese and
American dignitaries.
   AEA officials are in Beijing for three days of meetings with
leaders of ministries, the State Council and key commissions of
China, the group said in a statement.
   ``The liaison will assist U.S. firms interested in doing
business with the PRC electronics sector by providing policy and
technical information, on-site market support and U.S. perspective
on Chinese technology and trade policies,'' said Ralph Thomson,
AEA's senior vice president for public affairs, who will supervise
the venture.
   The establishment of the AEA liaison follows two years of
discussion by leaders of both country's electronics industries.
   Santa Clara-based AEA has more than 3,500 member high-technology
companies in the United States. The group also has an office in
Washington, D.C.

   Gould Inc. said Monday it had agreed to sell its
Industrial Automation Systems Group to a West German company and
would use the proceeds in a program to repurchase up to 20 percent
of its outstanding common stock.
   The computer and electronics company, based in suburban Rolling
Meadows, said it had agreed to sell the automation systems group to
AEG AG, a Daimler-Benz Group member. Completion of the sale was
expected in the next 90 days.
   Gould said it expected the sale to raise $290 million cash,
which would be used for the stock repurchase program authorized by
the board of directors.
   Gould expects to repurchase up to 20 percent of its 45.2 million
outstanding common shares from time to time in the open market or
privately negotiated puchases, or through other means over the next
12 months as directed by market conditions.
   Gould stock closed Monday at $11.50, up 37{ cents.
   ``The plan which we are implementing today reflects the
company's longstanding desire to enhance shareholder value,'' said
James F. McDonald, Gould chairman and chief executive officer.
   Following the sale of the automation systems group, Gould will
have annual revenue exceeding $750 million and a work force of
about 8,500 people in 29 locations worldwide.
   AEG is a leading electrical and electronic engineering group
based in Frankfurt, West Germany.
