   A federal court jury convicted a woman Monday of
killing her husband and another woman by lacing their
Extra-Strength Excedrin with cyanide in the nation's first trial in
a death by product tampering.
   The 12-member jury deliberated almost five days before returning
the verdict against Stella Nickell. One juror held out for
acquittal until the final vote, said the jury foreman, Murray M.
Andrews, 55,
   Mrs. Nickell, 44, of suburban Auburn, was convicted on each
count she faced, two of causing death by tampering with a product
involved in interstate commerce and three of tampering. The first
two counts could result in life sentences.
   King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng said he would wait until
after sentencing, scheduled for June 17, to decide whether to file
state murder charges.
   When the verdict was read by the clerk, Mrs. Nickell bowed her
head.
   The charges stemmed from the June 1986 deaths of her husband,
Bruce Nickell, 52, and of Sue Katherine Snow, 40, also of Auburn.
Both died after ingesting the poisoned painkillers.
   The deaths touched off a nationwide tampering scare and prompted
Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers Co. to recall its capsuled,
non-prescription medications.
   Seven people died in Chicago in 1982 from cyanide-laced
Extra-Strength Tylenol, but those deaths remain unsolved.
   John Weisberg, spokesman for the New York-based Bristol-Myers,
said the company was ``gratified by the jury's verdict, and
particularly appreciative of the efforts of the FBI and other law
enforcment authorities.
   ``Product tampering is intolerable to society. When it occurs
every effort must be made to identify those responsible and to
bring them to justice,'' he said.
   ``We're very pleased it's finally over. It was a tough case for
the jury to decide,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida,
who said she would ask for an ``appropriately severe'' sentence.
She did not elaborate.
   Ms. Maida said she hoped ``it will be a deterrent'' to future
drug-tamperers.
   During the trial, Ms. Maida portrayed Mrs. Nickell as an ``icy,
hard human being,'' unhappy in her marriage and beset by financial
problems, and accused Mrs. Nickell of poisoning her husband to
collect on his life insurance policies.
   Ms. Snow was an innocent stranger caught in Mrs. Nickell's
scheme to make her husband's death appear random, the prosecutor
said.
   But federal public defender Thomas Hillier said Mrs. Nickell was
the victim of a daughter who lied when she said her mother had
discussed killing Nickell with a drug overdose or by hiring a hit
man.
   The prosecution said Mrs. Nickell put tainted painkillers on
shelves of local stores to make her husband's death appear random
and to lead doctors, who had concluded Nickell died of emphysema,
to the true cause of his death.
   Only Mrs. Nickell had the motive, opportunity and ability to
commit the crimes, Ms. Maida told the jury in closing arguments May
2.
   Hillier called Mrs. Nickell's daughter, Cindy Hamilton, 28,
unreliable and noted that pharmaceutical companies had offered a
$300,000 reward to anyone who provided information leading to an
arrest.
   Further, the prosecution could not link Mrs. Nickell to cyanide
purchases, Hillier said.
   Earlier Monday, a juror said she had received an anonymous phone
call Friday in which the caller asked, ``Don't you all know that
she failed the lie detector test?''
   Information about the polygraph test had been kept from the
jury, but U.S. District Judge William Dwyer said neither the
panel's trouble reaching a decision nor the phone call would force
a mistrial.
   He gave Hillier a choice of substituting an alternate juror for
the one who received the phone call, but Hillier declined.
   Ms. Maida said in her closing arguments that Mrs. Nickell's plan
failed because she was careless in mixing the poisonous capsules,
greedy for insurance benefits and owned two of the five tainted
bottles of painkillers found.
   The odds of one person buying two bottles of cyanide-laced pain
capsules at different stores on different days were
``astronomical,'' Ms. Maida said, noting that more than 15,000
bottles had been examined in the Seattle area.
   Ms. Maida also told jurors that Mrs. Nickell might have gotten
away with the scheme if she had been more careful about the bowl
she chose for mixing the potassium cyanide with Anacin and Excedrin
painkillers.
   Mrs. Nickell, a tropical fish enthusiast, used a bowl
contaminated with Algae Destroyer, a compound used to clean fish
tanks, the prosecution alleged. Traces of the compound were found
in the five tainted bottles of Excedrin and Anacin, Ms. Maida said.
   Mrs. Nickell also tripped up in leaving fingerprints on library
books about poisons and cyanide, Ms. Maida said.
   But Mrs. Nickell testified she did the library research to find
out more about her husband's death and to protect children from
dangerous foliage around her rural home.

<TEXT>
   Socialist President Francois Mitterrand has been a
prominent face on the French left since the end of World War II,
but in recent years he has moved markedly to the political center.
   His first two years in office, 1981-83, involved implementation
of long-held Socialist ideas and were largely a failure. The
radical philosophy of ``rupture with capitalism'' foundered on the
rocks of economic reality.
   After trying to spend their way to prosperity, the Socialists
succeeded only in running up the national debt without being able
to stop runaway unemployment. In the face of a growing crisis, the
government was forced to reverse course and institute austerity.
   When the right ousted the Socialists from control of the
National Assembly in March 1986, Mitterrand needed to appeal to a
wider electorate if he was to have any hope of re-election.
   Ironically, after Mitterrand's popularity had fallen to historic
lows at mid-term, it soared after the right regained control of
Parliament, leaving him with little real power in domestic affairs.
   The French seemed to like the balance of power. Mitterrand, 71,
quickly assumed the role of the wise grandfather, referred to
affectionately by many as ``Tonton,'' a child's term for ``uncle.''
   Mitterrand was first elected May 10, 1981, in a Socialist tidal
wave that ousted center-right President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
and then, a month later, the conservatives and centrists who had
held power in the National Assembly for 23 years.
   The founder of the modern French Socialist Party, Mitterrand has
now made four presidential races. He was defeated by Charles de
Gaulle in 1965 and by Giscard in 1974.
   Mitterrand was born Oct. 26, 1916 in Jarnac in western France.
He earned degrees in law and letters in Paris. He was drafted in
1938, and during the German invasion of May 1940 was shot and
captured.
   He escaped from a POW camp in Germany and returned to France.
After the occupation of the Vichy zone by the Germans, he created a
Resistance network. His career-long feud with Gen. Charles de
Gaulle began during the war when Mitterrand refused to join his
Resistance group with de Gaulle's.
   It was during his Resistance days that he met Danielle Gouze,
whom he married in 1944 shortly after the liberation.
   During the chaotic postwar Fourth Republic, Mitterrand held 11
Cabinet posts, including interior and justice minister.
   In the early 1970s, Mitterrand took the moribund Socialist Party
and built it into a major force. But the Union of the Left he
forged with the Communists fell apart in 1977.
   It was not until the final days of the 1981 presidential
election that the two major leftist parties again joined to defeat
Giscard and oust the conservatives.
   Mitterrand shocked much of the West when he brought the
Communists into his government. But that union only lasted three
years, until 1984, when the Communists pulled out in a dispute over
economic policy.

<HEAD>Arms Control, NATO Issues on Tap in Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is facing fights over arms control
and NATO this week as it considers both a Pentagon budget bill and
the historic U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear
weapons.
   First, the Senate will begin work on the military budget, an
annual fight which generally involves wide-ranging decisions on
America's far-flung commitments.
   The bill approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee
authorizes $299.5 billion for the Pentagon, and targets increased
spending for non-nuclear weapons in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   ``This issue of conventional weapons in NATO is something that
we paid an awful lot of attention to this year, given the treaty,''
said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the panel.
   He was referring to the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty
signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   It eliminates both nations' medium-range missiles, and Nunn and
other supporters say NATO's non-nuclear defenses will have to be
bolstered after the missiles are gone.
   The Senate is tentatively scheduled to begin work on the treaty
Wednesday.
   During the Pentagon bill debate, amendments are likely both to
increase spending for NATO and call on U.S. allies in the 16-nation
alliance to pay more of NATO's costs.
   Also expected are proposals providing advice to Reagan from both
conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats about the arms
control policies he should follow in the last six months of his
administration.
   Similar attempts were made the past two weeks in the House
during that chamber's work on its version of the Pentagon budget
bill. The House approved nuclear arms control restrictions opposed
by the administration, along with cuts in Star Wars missile defense
spending which were so deep that Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
threatened to advise Reagan to veto the bill.
   The House is expected to give final approval Wednesday to its
Pentagon bill. Similar action by the Senate will send the separate
measures to a House-Senate conference committee to reconcile the
differences.
   Both measures propose $299.5 billion for the Pentagon in the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1. One difference is that the House voted
$3.5 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is
formally known, while the Senate bill proposes $4.6 billion. Reagan
wanted $4.8 billion.
   The House also voted to order Reagan to send the military into
the fight against illegal drug traffickers. Anti-drug amendments
are likely in the Senate although not as sweeping as the House
proposal, Nunn said.
   In mid-week, the Senate is scheduled to turn to the INF pact,
which Reagan wants ratified before he goes to the Soviet Union on
May 29 for his fourth summit meeting with Gorbachev.
   With 67 votes needed for ratification, Senate leaders have
predicted that 90 or more senators will vote to approve the pact.
   But the debate over the treaty has been clouded by a dispute
over whether both the United States and the Soviets agree on
several points, such as the definition of ``weapons'' and whether
the pact bans ``futuristic'' weapons such as lasers.
   There also are questions about the latitude which will be
allowed U.S. inspectors who will be stationed inside the Soviet
Union to verify compliance.
   While the focus on the Senate floor is on national security
issues, congressional leaders also are preparing to send Reagan the
omnibus trade bill.
   The measure has been passed by both the House and the Senate but
instead of being sent to the White House, it remains stalled on
Capitol Hill while leaders seek to revise it and perhaps avert a
threatened presidential veto.
   Last week, the House voted 253-159 to drop the bill's curbs on
export of Alaska oil, one of two provisions Reagan has said would
justify a veto. The other is a requirement that companies with 100
employees or more give 60 days' notice of plant closings and large
layoffs.
   The measure approved by the House is a technical resolution.
Senate leaders still are trying to get the technical resolution
onto the floor without undue delay. If they cannot, they probably
will abandon plans to drop the Alaska provisions and just send the
bill to Reagan unchanged from the form in which it won final
passage two weeks ago.

<TEXT>
   A political mess has raised
doubts about the future of democracy in this important U.S. ally
and put the dreaded word ``coup'' on the lips of just about
everyone _ from the president on down.
   However, the military has vowed to let democracy unravel its own
tangles, and most people said they were betting against military
intervention.
   Coup rumors have circulated since a week ago, when a dispute
over control of the legislature prevented effective installation of
the 60-member congress elected March 20.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte told journalists Thursday: ``Yes,
we are in the midst of a crisis.'' But he added, ``I believe the
armed forces are absolutely convinced that this (a coup) would be a
fatal course for the country because every coup implies a division
in the armed forces ... and in the middle of a war that would mean
a gigantic danger for national security.''
   Leftist rebels are fighting U.S.-backed government forces in an
8-year-old war that has claimed an estimated 65,000 lives.
   Thirty deputies of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance,
or Arena, took their seats May 1 and claim to constitute the
National Assembly.
   The governing Christian Democrats, including Duarte, contend
that Arena lacks the majority necessary to install the congress and
make laws. The Christian Democrats were resoundingly defeated in
the legislative election, losing their parliamentary majority.
   ``Right now, the country has no legislature,'' Christian
Democratic leader Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes said at a news
conference May 2. He is the party's candidate in presidential
elections set for March.
   The two main parties, along with the smaller National
Conciliation Party, spent the end of last week trying to negotiate
an end to the impasse, but they failed. Positions appeared to have
hardened.
   The Christian Democrats and the Conciliation Party, who claim 30
deputies between them, have formed an informal alliance to block
Arena's control of the legislature.
   One of the Christian Democrats' 23 deputies is claimed by Arena,
which charges the seat was stolen through electoral fraud. That
dispute is before the Supreme Court, but the Christian Democrats do
not recognize its jurisdiction in the matter.
   Government, opposition and military representatives have said
the governmental crisis could deepen if the court rules for Arena,
granting it a 31st seat and an outright majority.
   Arena says the Assembly has 59 members meanwhile and that it
already has a majority with 30 votes.
   The Christian Democrats, in a parallel session, have seated the
disputed deputy in defiance of the court.
   Meanwhile, the military has watched warily from the sidelines.
Col. Mauricio Vargas, chief of operations of the joint chiefs of
staff, said military intervention would do much more harm than good.
   ``Nationally, it would be the rupture of the democratic
process,'' he said. ``Internationally, it would mean isolation that
would bring major repercussions. And to break the democratic system
would be to provide justification for the guerrillas' position that
we don't want democracy in this country.''
   El Salvador receives more U.S. aid than any country in the
Western Hemisphere. Last year's economic and military assistance
was about $620 million.
   President Reagan has repeatedly held up El Salvador as an
example of Central American democracy. Military intervention
presumably would bring strong U.S. bipartisan reaction and possibly
a drastic cut in aid.
   Though a coup appears unlikely, a top government source close to
the president said the military is exerting strong pressure on
politicians to resolve the impasse. The source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the armed forces had ``imposed a
deadline'' but declined to give details.
   Gen. Adolfo Blandon, head of the joint chiefs of staff, said
last week: ``This (dispute) confuses things and is not beneficial
to the democratic process. It is irresponsible behavior on the part
of the deputies in whom the people deposited their trust.''
   Ricardo Alvarenga, named by Arena as the new president of the
Assembly, agreed that damage had already been done: ``This mess
leads the people to the conclusion, which is logical but not
necessarily correct, that the guerrillas are right when they say
our democracy does not work and is not the way to resolve our
problems.''

   The Justice Department is reviewing a Texas
literacy test for would-be law enforcement officers that is failed
by three out of four blacks and two out of three Hispanics.
   The federal inquiry is intended to determine whether the test
discriminates against minorities seeking jobs in nearly 300 Texas
law enforcement agencies.
   Minority groups tend to be underrepresented in Texas law
enforcement, and critics say hiring practices may contribute to the
prevalence of white faces in blue uniforms.
   If the department concludes that the test is discriminatory,
``we'd have to take appropriate steps to address that problem,''
said Justice spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade.
   The test indicates whether a job candidate reads and writes at
high-school level, skills presumed necessary if the candidate is to
understand the laws being enforced.
   One section requires the person to complete a sentence by
picking the correctly spelled word from three choices. Other
sections test grammar.
   Another section asks the test taker to choose the clearest of
three sentences discussing the same topic. The wrong answers
contain ``extremely basic, obvious ambiguities,'' said David
Boatright, an attorney for the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement
Officer Standards and Education.
   The Justice Department has looked at numerous other state, city
or county writing or reading tests for their effect on minorities,
and employment criteria for physical strength and agility and their
effect on women.
   Exams reviewed by the agency have ranged from the Suffolk
County, N.Y., county police test to the Maryland toll facilities
police force's height and weight restrictions.
   In Texas, during the past 7{ months, passing rates were 69
percent for whites; 67 percent for American Indians; 59 percent for
Asian-Americans; 36 percent for Hispanics; and 27 percent for
blacks.
   Overall, 55 percent of the people who took the test between
Sept. 1, 1987, and April 21 passed it, according to the law
enforcement standards commission. People who fail may repeat the
exam.
   As of Feb. 17, the state had 41,916 licensed law enforcement
officers, 7.3 percent of whom were black, according to the most
recent figures from the commission.
   Figures from the 1980 census show 12 percent of Texans are black.
   The commission had the test developed in the mid-1970s and used
Justice Department criteria in drafting it.
   ``We offered to run it by the Department of Justice and they
refused,'' said attorney Boatright. ``We're perfectly happy that
they're looking at it now.''
   One of the 283 law enforcement agencies using the test is
Lufkin. Police Chief Sherman Collins says he doesn't fault the exam
for the absence of black officers on his force, although blacks
make up about one-fourth of the East Texas town's population of
30,000.
   Collins says basic literacy is essential for an officer, and to
help prepare candidates he has enlisted the help of an adult
learning center which offers preparation for the high school
General Equivalency Diploma exam. The local agency is offering a
six-week course to raise reading comprehension and writing skills
up to five grade levels, Collins said.
   ``We want black officers,'' Collins said. ``We would have a
better rapport with the black community if we had black officers
out there serving them.''
   Only one black out of 13 passed the test in Lufkin in June, when
it was offered last. The person who passed was a reporter who took
the exam as part of a news assignment for the Lufkin Daily News.

<TEXT>
   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis says he ``wouldn't know
a horoscope from a telescope,'' but he decided to see what the
stars had in store for him after reading reports President Reagan's
schedule has been affected by advice his wife gets from an
astrologist.
   Dukakis told a crowd at a New York fund-raiser last week that
his horoscope for that day indicated he would be taking on new
challenges and having to make tough decisions.
   ``It is pointless for you to remain in your current position,''
the Massachusetts governor read, drawing giggles.
   Dukakis said he also decided to check the horoscope of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III, whose legal troubles draw frequent gibes
from Dukakis during campaign appearances.
   Meese's horoscope, the candidate said, indicated that he should
find happiness ``elsewhere.''
   ``I'll drink to that,'' Dukakis said as the crowd roared in
approval.

   Dukakis is not generally known for his humor. But he drew laughs
from a group of West Virginia coal miners when he said his ride
into the mine on a cramped rail car was just ``a little bumpier''
than the Boston subway he often takes to work.
   Minutes later, asked if the mine was the first place he had
campaigned where there was not a Greek restaurant, the
Massachusetts governor smiled and said: ``There are Greek
restaurants everywhere.''
   Fellow Greek and Dukakis confidant Nick Mitropoulis chimed in:
``And if there isn't one, there will be soon.''
   Going out of the mine, Dukakis mistakenly turned toward a vein
heading deeper into the mountain.
   After a miner set him straight, Dukakis threw his hands in the
air and said, ``I'm sure glad you guys know where you're going
because I certainly don't.''

   Tarmac football is the latest craze in the Dukakis presidential
campaign.
   Aides to the Massachusetts governor and reporters traveling with
him routinely toss a football around when they arrive at airports
before the candidate.
   Dukakis himself has joined the fun lately, running pass routes
on airport tarmacs in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Omaha.
   In Cleveland last week, Dukakis, who played basketball in high
school, and Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, a standout college hoop
player at Providence, took turns as quarterback and receiver.
   ``OK Raymond, go deep,'' Dukakis said before throwing a perfect
spiral to the mayor.
   ``It certainly beats going around hitting people like George
Bush does,'' said one Dukakis aide, referring to Bush's habit of
throwing light punches or giving back slaps to people he meets
while campaigning.

<HEAD>The Election's Not Over, But There Were Clear Winners and Losers
Among Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only a handful of television viewers witnessed
one of the best ads of the 1988 presidential campaign _ 10 seconds
of Al Haig stuffing pizza into his mouth at a New Hampshire eatery.
   ``It got on the air one day before he withdrew,'' said Jay
Bryant, Haig's media consultant. The ad showed a
mischievous-looking Haig using his fingers to subdue some errant
pizza cheese, and instantly turned the off-putting general into a
likable human being.
   Political media observers, from academics to admakers, say few
if any TV spots this year have broken new technical ground or
connected emotionally with voters.
   Among the notable exceptions was Democrat Dick Gephardt's
``$48,000 Hyundai'' spot _ a trade tirade aimed at Korean tariffs
that price U.S. autos out of the Korean market.
   ``The populist impulses in the Hyundai ad, the defiant
expression, identified with the electorate's feeling of
powerlessness,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor and
author of two books on political ads and speeches. ``It was a
moment of empowerment. It let the voters feel good.''
   Jamieson also nominated the pizza ad, saying it forced the
viewer to reconsider Haig's somewhat negative and militaristic
image. The clear message was that ``if you knew him, you'd like
him,'' she said.
   The short spot shows Haig with a piece of cheese hanging between
his mouth and his pizza slice. He pulls it up to his mouth with his
finger, realizes he's on-camera, and winks.
   Meanwhile, a narrator is saying with mock seriousness, ``Former
Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig. The man with the best
credentials of anyone to be president, who's also a lot more like
you than you think. Vote for him.''
   Also on the air for only one day was another favorite _ a Bob
Dole ad questioning whether George Bush had left any legacy in the
numerous jobs he has held. The ad depicts a man's shadow walking
across a virgin expanse of snow, crunching as he goes, yet leaving
no mark.
   ``After 20 years of walking in the footsteps of giants, isn't it
odd that George Bush has left no footprints at all?'' a narrator
asks. ``It's almost like he was never there.''
   ``That was the most effective line he had going. It was a good
ad. It had the ring of truth and it was appealing,'' said Larry
Sabato, a professor, analyst and author.
   But Dole, coasting on his Iowa victory, didn't use the ad in New
Hampshire. Nor did the campaign carry out plans to reshoot it in
the sand for use in Southern Super Tuesday states. It aired once in
Florida, snow and all, then was pulled.
   ``They were believing the press clippings that they were on the
way to the nomination,'' said Sabato. ``I almost think Dole thought
it was time for healing (after Iowa). And he was trying to lower
that negative of being too harsh.''
   Other effective ads included Gephardt's attack on Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis for promoting Belgian endive as a remedy for
farm woes, and Dukakis ads mocking Gephardt's populist message and
flip-flops on issues.
   Jamieson makes a case for Dukakis's standard biographical ad _ a
fast-paced montage of photographs that begins and ends with the
printed words, ``A president for the 90s.'' It is being used
virtually everywhere and has been the only Dukakis ad on the air in
several states.
   ``It suggests solidity and stability and puts in place basic
premises about what he's done,'' Jamieson said. ``It's not the
funniest, it's not the glitziest, but it is the most effective
except for the Hyundai ad.''
   Haig, Bruce Babbitt and Pete du Pont won nominations for the
worst TV spots of the campaign season, as did the
information-packed Al Gore ads produced by David Garth for the New
York primary.
   ``The Gore spots in New York were awful, disgraceful. They were
just tepid. I felt they were very poorly communicating Gore's
message,'' said Sabato.
   Du Pont was skewered for visual gimmickry and amateurish
production. Jamieson cited one spot in which ``he rotates like a
statue and you see his squared-off jaw and he looks straight into
the camera. I expected it to be an ad for aftershave.''
   Babbitt ``looks very strange'' in many of his ads, Jamieson
said. Haig's initial ads ``made him appear rather evil. They
emphasized his harsh nature,'' said Sabato.
   The early Haig ads tried to put the best face on Haig's military
background by noting, for example, that no wars were started by
presidents who had been generals. But they used ponderous music and
ominous images and some gave the impression of ``Julius Caesar
returns to the Rubicon,'' said Jamieson. ``It was almost
terrifying.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Braces For Bush Attacks On Crime Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During last year's legislative session,
Massachusetts Senate President William Bulger relegated a
capital-punishment bill to committee, effectively killing it.
Bulger supports the death penalty. But he also supports Michael
Dukakis _ and his move spared the governor from having to veto a
death-penalty bill.
   The incident illustrated how carefully the Democratic
presidential front-runner is treading when it comes to crime and
punishment. But Republican George Bush has already attacked Dukakis
on some crime issues, and made it clear that there's more criticism
to come.
   At a news conference in Sacramento last week, Bush faulted both
Dukakis and Democrat Jesse Jackson for not supporting the death
penalty for ``drug kingpins.'' Dukakis opposes the death penalty
under all circumstances.
   Another potential point of vulnerability is the Massachusetts
prison system, one of the most overcrowded in the country. With
6,600 inmates, it is 72 percent over capacity. The legislature,
pushed by Dukakis, allocated nearly $1 billion to expand capacity,
but it will take years to ease the overcrowding.
   And Dukakis ran into a storm of protest last year when William
Horton, a convicted murderer, walked away from a weekend furlough.
He was arrested later in Maryland and convicted of raping a woman
and beating her husband.
   The Horton case prompted angry calls for elimination of
furloughs for first-degree murderers serving life sentences.
   Dukakis defended the furlough program for months, on grounds
that it helped prison administrators by giving lifers an incentive
to behave and gave him a record for judging commutation requests.
   But after key members of the legislature deserted him and
opponents gathered enough signatures to place a furlough ban on the
fall ballot, Dukakis reversed himself and dropped his opposition to
the ban.
   Dukakis, a Harvard Law School graduate and member of the
American Civil Liberties Union, is generally considered a liberal
on domestic issues, including some criminal matters. In addition to
his opposition to the death penalty, he favors controls on handguns.
   However, Dukakis dismayed some liberals when he instituted a
statewide program of police roadblocks to stop motorists to check
for drunken drivers. He has also backed a bill that would tighten
criminal sentencing and _ for the first time in state history _
allow prosecutors to appeal sentences they consider too low.
   As governor, Dukakis created a statewide anti-crime council to
coordinate the efforts of prosecutors, judges, legislators, police
and citizens. Dukakis, who has never missed one of the council's
monthly meetings, says he would create a similar federal program.
   In his campaign literature, Dukakis touts a 14 percent drop in
crime in Massachusetts since 1983 and the lowest homicide rate of
any industrial state. However, most experts attribute the decline
to the aging of the state's population, combined with a low
unemployment rate.
   And Dukakis doesn't mention the embarrassing fact that
Massachusetts remains the nation's auto theft capital.
   Overall, state Sen. Paul Harold, a Democrat who chairs the
legislature's Criminal Justice Committee, gives Dukakis high marks.
   ``As an attorney and as someone who's sat in the governor's
chair, he has a tremendous overview. He's a traditional liberal in
his theories, but if something's not working, he wants to change it
and get on to the next case,'' Harold said.
   James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern
University, said governors can actually do little about criminal
behavior _ and presidents even less. But he said Dukakis should be
credited for his attention to criminal issues he can influence.
   ``When you look at Dukakis, he appears to have liberal leanings,
but ones that do indeed seem to be supported by facts,'' he said.

   The San Francisco woman who gave stargazing
advice to first lady Nancy Reagan says she is ``a serious,
scientific astrologer and ... I really don't like this circus
atmosphere.''
   Joan Quigley confirmed in a telephone interview from her Nob
Hill home Sunday that Mrs. Reagan had consulted her since 1981, as
reported by former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan.
   Regan, in his book, ``For the Record,'' scheduled to go on sale
today, said that ``virtually every major move and decision the
Reagans made ... was cleared in advance with a woman in San
Francisco who drew up horoscopes.''
   Regan said he did not know her identity.
   Ms. Quigley, however, said, ``I can't deny that she has
consulted me. I am very uncomfortable, however, with the situation
because normally I never discuss the identity of my clients, and I
never discuss their affairs.''
   ``I am a serious, scientific astrologer and I am really not one
of these clowns, and I really don't like this circus atmosphere,''
said Ms. Quigley, who has been practicing astrology since 1960 and
has written three books on the subject.
   Jayj Jacobs, a member of the board of directors of the
Association for Astrological Networking, said Ms. Quigley is ``a
specialist in political consulting'' who lectures on
``geopolitical'' astrology.
   ``She's viewed as a competent professional, and a specialist,''
Jacobs said.
   Ms. Quigley, a San Francisco heiress and Republican political
activist, said she did astrological work for Reagan's 1980
presidential campaign. She declined to give the details.
   ``After the assassination attempt, Mrs. Reagan asked me if she
could consult me because she was worried about the president's
safety, as well she might be,'' Ms. Quigley said.
   She said Mrs. Reagan telephoned her at ``various times,''
sometimes on Saturday afternoons from Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland, as Regan reported.
   ``I certainly never controlled the president's actions,'' she
said. ``Mrs. Reagan would want to know if something was a safe time
and I certainly advised her on that.''
   Ms. Quigley said her advice is based on the exact time and place
of a person's birth.
   In a separate interview with television station KRON in San
Francisco, the astrologer said she advised the first lady ``when it
was unsafe to fly.'' She added, ``I never had any contact with the
president.''

   From the day that Donald T. Regan moved from
head man at Merrill Lynch to secretary of the treasury in the
Reagan Cabinet, the World War II combat veteran found the White
House to be alien territory.
   Regan's gruff Marine Corps manner had served him well on Wall
Street but failed to help him survive the political battleground of
Washington or his conflicts with a determined first lady.
   ``When I was chief executive and I said `Jump,' people said,
`How high?''' he recalled shortly after coming to Washington in
1981. When he said the same thing as treasury secretary, he added,
people asked, ``Well, do you have an environmental impact
statement, what do you mean by high?''
   Nevertheless Regan quickly made his mark, winning the
president's praise as ``a very fine salesman'' for the tax-cutting
policies that were a hallmark of the Reagan administration.
   In 1985, Regan and James A. Baker III, then the White House
chief of staff, got Reagan's approval to switch jobs.
   ``As a former Marine Corps colonel and Wall Street star, he
fancied the view from the boss's elbow,'' Michael K. Deaver, who
had been Baker's deputy, later wrote.
   ``Once Don Regan took over as chief of staff, there was only one
man in charge,'' Larry Speakes, then the chief White House
spokesman, recalls in his recent book.
   ``The early reports were glowing,'' said Deaver. ``No hint of an
accident waiting to happen.''
   Troubles soon came, however.
   When the president underwent cancer surgery in July 1985 Regan
aroused First Lady Nancy Reagan's ire by ordering a White House
helicopter to fly him to Bethesda Naval Hospital. According to
Speakes' account, he decided after a telephone call from Mrs.
Reagan that he would go by automobile, as she did.
   After Reagan's prostate operation the following year, the first
lady and the chief of staff again found themselves at odds. She
thought he was scheduling her husband for too much activity too
early in his recovery.
   Then came the revelations that the administration had sold arms
to Iran while seeking freedom for American hostages and that some
of the money had been funneled to help the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   When the presidential board headed by former Sen. John Tower
made its report on the controversy in February, 1987, it found
Regan responsible ``for the chaos that descended upon the White
House.''
   ``He, as much as anyone, should have insisted that an orderly
process be preserved,'' the board said.
   Regan protested, ``Does a bank president know whether a bank
teller is fiddling around with the books? No!''
   This, however, was not the world of finance, but the world of
Washington politics.
   The capital quickly sensed that Regan was on the way out, and
there were widely believed reports that Mrs. Reagan was helping him
on his way.
   The end came on Feb. 27, 1987, when Reagan chose former Senate
Republican leader Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee as his new chief
of staff.
   Regan, hearing the news from then-national security adviser
Frank Carlucci who had seen it on a Cable News Network broadcast,
responded with a one-sentence letter of resignation.
   Now, 15 months and many sentences later, Regan is giving his
side of the story in his book ``For the Record: From Wall Street to
Washington.''
   The book, being published Monday, reveals that Mrs. Reagan used
astrology to determine the timing of the president's speeches and
travel.
   Once again, judging from the president's reaction, Regan may
have chosen the wrong adversary.
   ``I would have preferred it if he'd decided to attack me,''
Reagan said Friday, ``and apparently from what we hear he's chosen
to attack my wife, and I don't look kindly upon that at all.''

   Virtually ever major move and decision the Reagans made during
my time as White House chief of staff was cleared in advance with a
woman in San Francisco who drew up horoscopes to make certain that
the planets were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise.
   Nancy Reagan seemed to have absolute faith in the clairvoyant
powers of this woman, who had predicted that ``something'' bad was
going to happen to the president shortly before he was wounded in
an assassination attempt in 1981.

   At one point, I kept a color-coded calendar on my desk (numerals
highlighted in green ink for `good' days, red for `bad' days,
yellow for `iffy' days) as an aid to remembering when it was
propitious to move the president of the United States from one
place to another, or schedule him to speak in public, or commence
negotiations with a foreign power.

   A full month after the president's release from the hospital,

   There was no choice but to humor the first lady in this matter.
But the president's schedule is the single most potent tool in the
White House, because it determines what the most powerful man in
the world is going to do and when he is going to do it. But
humoring Mrs. Reagan we gave her this tool _ or more accurately,
gave it to an unknown woman in San Francisco who believed that the
Zodiac controls events and human behavior and that she could read
the secrets of the future in the movements of the planets.

   The president was deeply concerned about the hostages, but an
inventory of the time he spent on this problem in a given month
would undoubtedly show a very low total _ minutes rather than hours.
   Like that first meeting with (NSC Adviser) Bud McFarlane at
Bethesda, the events that snowballed into the catastrophe that came
to be known as the Iran-Contra affair made little impression at the
time that they happened.
   Much of what happened was hidden from the president (and
incidentally from me) by McFarlane and his successor as national
security adviser, Adm. (John) Poindexter and by the remarkable
young Marine who was a virtual stranger to both of us, Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North.

   On Nov. 12, only nine days after the story broke, the pressure
from the Hill was so great that the president has no choice but to
talk to a congressional delegation. ... The president told them
that we had, in fact, supplied arms to Iran, but it was only a
small amount and we had not swapped arms for hostages.
   Some of those men were skeptical ... Ronald Reagan never lied to
them; (or in my experience, to anyone.) And there is no question in
my mind that he believed that he was telling the truth.
   He knew, of course, that the United States had shipped anti-tank
and anti-aircraft missiles to Tehran and that certain Iranians had
exerted influence over terrorists in Lebanon to facilitate the
release of the American hostages. But in Ronald Reagan's own mind
that did not constitute a swap of arms for hostages.

   The president ... is a ruddy man, with bright red cheeks. He
blanched when he heard Meese's words. The color drained from his
face, leaving his skin pasty white. ... Nobody who saw the

he knew about the diversion of funds before Meese told him about
it. He was the picture of a man to whom the inconceivable had
happened.

   It was Raisa Gorbachev for whom Western observers, and

rolling. ... At this dinner party ... she did not hesitate to make
use of the opportunities offered to her to educate the president of
the United States on the intellectual and philosophical basis of
the Soviet policy. ... After the door had closed behind the
Gorbachevs, (Mrs. Reagan) said, ``Who does that dame think she

   Mrs. Reagan, who had already shown signs of irritability, now

   ``The parts on abortion have got to come out,'' (Mrs. Reagan)
said (about the State of the Union address.)
   I pointed out that the president had particularly wanted some
language on this subject included in his address.
   ``I don't give a damn about the right-to-lifers,'' Mrs. Reagan
retorted. ``I'm cutting back on the Iran stuff, too. It's too long
and it's not appropriate. Ronald Reagan's got to be shown to be in

   In the four years that I served as secretary of the Treasury, I
never saw President Reagan alone and never discussed economic
philosophy alone and never discussed economic philosophy or fiscal
and monetary policy with him man to man.
   From first day to last at Treasury, I was flying by the seat of
my pants. The president never told me what he believed or what he
wanted to accomplish in the field of economics. I had to figure
these things out like any other American, by studying his speeches
and reading the newspapers.

<TEXT>
   I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I won't be in any more. This is my
last day. I've been your secretary of the Treasury for four years

tell me who my successor is and make a smooth transfer. I deserved
better treatment than this. I'm through. I'm very disappointed.

   I wish to state that my admiration for Reagan as president
remains very great. My judgment of him as a man, in light of my
final experience as his chief of staff, underwent a certain change,
but this is irrelevant. ... any man who had seen as much of the
world as I had seen when I came to Washington knew better than to
put his trust in princes.

   Readers of Donald T. Regan's book, ``For the
Record,'' might be confused by lack of quotation remarks around
most of the quotations from President Reagan.
   In reporting his conversations with the president, the former
White House chief of staff consistently put his own words inside
quote marks, but leaves them out in reporting the president's
remarks.
   Thus, a typical passage reads:
   Hi, Don, the President said. Is this a good time to talk?
   I said, ``Couldn't be better, Mr. President.''
   Regan explains it this way;
   ``Out of deference to the office and the man, I have not
enclosed language attributed to the president in quotation marks
except in cases where his words have already appeared in print
elsewhere.''

<HEAD>As War Drags On, Mozambique Reaches Out To Its Enemies</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<HEAD>By GREG MYRE</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAMPULA, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, mired in a civil war
that is sinking the country ever deeper into poverty and famine, is
making overtures toward its two main enemies.
   The 12-year-old war is stalemated, and Mozambique's Marxist
leaders now appear interested in making a deal with South Africa to
complement generous amnesty terms offered to rebels of the
Mozambique National Resistance.
   Since the amnesty law took effect in December, an estimated 500
to 700 guerrillas have surrendered with a government promise that
they will be not be punished for their war activities.
   Also, Mozambique's president, Joachim Chissano, sent Cooperation
Minister Jacinto Veloso to South Africa on April 26 with a
conciliatory message for President P.W. Botha. The possibility of a
summit meeting was discussed.
   A day earlier, Chissano met with Gavin Relly, chairman of South
Africa's giant Anglo American Corp., to discuss possible business
ventures.
   Chissano continues to accuse South Africa of supporting the
rebels in violation of a 1984 non-aggression pact, a charge
Pretoria denies.
   However, Mozambique's decision to renew high-level contacts with
South Africa suggests it forsees no quick military solutions to the
war, which the U.S. State Department says has claimed an estimated
100,000 lives in the past three years.
   The fighting in northeastern Nampula province, visited recently
by a group of Western journalists, is representative of the
deadlocked war in many parts of Mozambique.
   The rebels roam the countryside at will, attacking villages to
obtain supplies and often kidnapping residents as forced laborers.
   Government troops fight an almost entirely defensive war,
attempting to protect economic installations and to keep
transporation routes open, but seldom seeking out the rebels in the
bush.
   Eighteen of the 21 district capitals in Nampula province have
been attacked since last October. Refugee camps are swelling and
food is in short supply in most areas. Hospitals dispense aspirin
and anti-malaria tablets, but not much else.
   Repeated rebel sabotage on the railway that runs across the
province prompted a European consortium to halt repair work until
the government can guarantee their security.
   ``The frequent attacks disrupt the villages and discourage
people from staying and planting crops,'' said Jacob Jeremiah
Nyambir, the provincial governor. ``We are trying to reorganize the
military and stabilize the civilian situation.''
   Nyambir and other local officials cited several incidents that
highlight the military's shortcomings.
   Nyambir pointed on a map to the three main rebel camps in
Nampula province, but said the military has never been able to
carry out attacks against the locations.
   When rebels raided the northern coastal city of Angoche last
year, they they were repelled by the military, local officials
said. However, the rebels kidnapped 300 civilians and the army made
no attempt to pursue them.
   Because of poor communications, word of rebel attacks on remote
villages can take a week to reach the city of Nampula, the
provincial capital, Nyambir said.
   He said the provincial government has been unable to promote the
amnesty campaign because Nampula's radio station isn't powerful
enough to broadcast much beyond the city limits and leaflets
haven't been published because the printing press is broken.
   Nonetheless, 16 rebels seeking amnesty turned up in the town of
Moma on April 9, but local authorities had no idea what to do with
them, Nyambir said. It took a week before someone could reach
Nampula and receive instructions on how to handle the surrendered
men.
   The war has made Mozambique one of the poorest countries in the
world and is the primary cause of a famine in which an almost 6
million of the country's 14.5 million people need food assistance.
   There are more than a million refugees inside the country and
700,000 Mozambicans have fled to neighboring states, including
South Africa.
   The rebel movement, created in 1977 by what was then white-ruled
Rhodesia, opposes the Marxist policies of the FRELIMO party
government, but beyond that its aims are vague.
   No government acknowledges supporting the rebels and they appear
to have generated little support among the civilian population with
their repeated raids on villages in which they often kidnap
residents and force them to carry supplies and grow food at rebel
bases.
   ``Nowhere have I found support (for the guerrillas),'' said U.S.
Ambassador Melissa Wells. ``I've only found fear and terror.''
   Those who have been kidnapped say the guerrillas make little
effort to explain their positions.
   ``They showed me a picture of their leader and told me that when
they come to power everyone will have a car,'' said Luciano Alouta,
31, who was kidnapped by the rebels in July and escaped a month
later. ``I did not believe what they told me or understand what
they were fighting for.''
   The rebels threatened to kill anyone who left their camp and
made no attempt to become friendly with the captured civilians,
Alouta said.
   Refugees at several different camps in Nampula told similar
stories. In the town of Ribaue, some residents said they sleep in
the surrounding woods to avoid being kidnapped in one of the rebels
frequent nighttime attacks. The hospital and the local
administration building were destroyed, but a cotton gin manages to
keep going, despite four guerrilla raids in the past year.
   The nearby village of Lalaua sits empty following a rebel attack
in early April in which 50 huts, about a quarter of the village,
were burned. The rebels did not occupy the village, but residents
are afraid to return, saying they fear a repeat attack.

<NOTE>Eds: Subs 3rd graf to restore Dukakis' first name</NOTE>
<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Bush Nostalgic for the Good Old Days of 1980</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN WOLMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A movie called ``Rappin'' is playing on Home
Box Office this month _ five times this month, to be exact _ in
which the credits are accompanied by a song whose repetitive
refrain is simply, ``Can't stop, won't stop. Can't stop, won't
stop.''
   It might be the anthem for the current George Bush campaign. He
can't stop, won't stop, running against Jimmy Carter.
   The vice president is trying to take advantage of the fact that
Michael Dukakis, the probable Democratic nominee, often comes
across as a cool, detached technocratic official in the Carter mold.
   But Bush's tactic may backfire if voters decide the similarity
ends there.
   ``Malaise'' isn't prominent in the Dukakis dictionary. He likes
to talk about hard work and miracles. He says, incessantly, that he
wants to be a builder, not a great communicator. He could give
lessons in upbeat.
   Nonetheless, Bush is hoping that when voters look at Dukakis
they will see Carter interest rates, Carter oil prices, Carter
wringing his hands at Camp David, Carter confronting a rabbit with
his canoe paddle, Carter agonizing while the American flag was
being burned and the embassy looted in Tehran.
   Actually, Bush is more than hoping that will happen; the
Republican standard-bearer is trying to make it happen.
   Reagan-Bush ousted Carter-Mondale in 1980 and crushed
Mondale-Ferraro. The temptation to relive these races must be more
than Bush and his staff can bear. Once Dukakis emerged as Bush's
likely opponent, Bush's campaign manager quickly labeled the
Massachusetts governor a ``Northern-fried Carter'' and the concept
became a staple on the campaign trail.
   Bush loves to ridicule ``gloom and doom'' Democrats. In Canton,
Ohio, last week he spoke gleefully about ``the gloom and misery''
emanating from the Democrats' camp. On Tuesday, he said, ``Let Mike
Dukakis go around here talking about pink slips, despair, pessimism
in the United States. I'll be the guy out there talking about hope
and opportunity.''
   Whatever he is, however, Dukakis is no gloom and doom Democrat.
   Speechwriter Bill Woodward recently told David Broder about the
guidance he got when he signed on with Dukakis in 1987:
   ``The first thing he said was: Don't be negative about the hopes
for the country and don't be overly negative about the Reagan
administration.'' Woodward told the Washington Post writer that
Dukakis described ``a problem he saw in the 1980 and 1984
campaigns, the over-preoccupation with what the United States can't
do at home or in the world. He said that wasn't his experience in
life, or in the Massachusetts governorship.''
   There has been some unmistakable gloom and doom in the
Democratic party psyche, but it was the upbeat candidates _ Dukakis
and Jesse Jackson _ who survived the 1988 primaries. And Dukakis
isn't likely to make it easy for Bush to pin the Carter malaise on
him.
   ``The best America is yet to come,'' he says after running down
what he sees as the shortcomings of the Reagan years. ``... We're
going to build a future of hope and pride and opportunity.''
   Still, Bush won't stop.
   ``It all sounds like Jimmy Carter reborn again for the third
time,'' Bush said about the 1988 Democrats. In Cleveland, Bush said
Carter ``hangs over the Democrats like a shadow, an unwanted
reminder of the last time they were in the White House.'' In
Indianapolis, he said no matter whether the Democrats nominate
Dukakis or Jackson, ``It's going to be a very clear choice on the
issues ... as clear as 1980, or as clear as 1984.
   ``I do not want to see this country go back to the failed
policies of the past. Here's where things were when we started:
   ``Interest rates were 21{ percent. Inflation was double-digit.
... Every family getting wiped out. Employment going the wrong way.
This pride in our country down, the military weak. And somebody
said to me after I cited those horrible statistics, `What are you
doing? Running against Jimmy Carter?'
   ``I said, `No, I don't want to run against Jimmy Carter. But we
don't want to go back to the policies that the liberal Democrats
had under Jimmy Carter that led us to those days of malaise.'''
   If only Carter were on the ballot.

<HEAD>Drying Up Reservoirs, Fields In West, Southeast, Texas And
Minnesota</HEAD>

   Drought has threatened water supplies in the West and Southeast,
forced some Texas and California ranchers to sell starving cattle
and allowed topsoil and crop seeds to blow away in the northern
Plains.
   In San Francisco, residents were ordered to reduce water
consumption by 25 percent. Atlanta residents were asked to cut
usage by 10 percent. Los Angeles also has imposed water
conservation rules. In northern Montana's Liberty County, 70 people
attended a 24-hour vigil last week to pray for rain.
   ``It's almost like you saw in the typical 1930s scenes where
clouds of dust are moving across the fields,'' says Fred Kollman,
district conservationist in Norman County, Minn.
   ``You see drifts of dirt almost like snowdrifts in the road
ditches. There is lots of dirt in the air and lots of dirt in the
houses.''
   In the West, two straight winters of poor rainfall and scanty
snowfall in California's Sierra Nevada led to drought. In the
Southeast, parts of the Tennessee Valley have been receiving
below-normal rain since 1984. In Texas, the drought began last
fall. Parts of the northern Plains enjoyed above-normal rain last
summer, but less than expected snow last winter.
   ``I'm not sure how much longer (the area) can take it. It's
scary,'' said extension agent Judee Wargo in Montana's Liberty
County, where rainfall since October has measured 0.73 inch,
compared with an average 3.17 inches for the period.
   Last week, Texas Gov. William P. Clements said Starr and
McMullen counties needed federal disaster assistance because of
drought.
   Starr County has had just over 5 inches of rain since Sept. 1, a
period in which it normally would receive most of its average
annual rainfall of 20 inches. Ranchers have had to sell cattle for
lack of hay and forage.
   In Jim Wells County west of Corpus Christi, extension agent
Billy Paul said ranchers have started burning thorns off prickly
pear cactuses so cattle can eat them. But even the cactus is drying
up in some areas, said Starr County emergency official Alfonso
Perez.
   Despite above-normal rain in Nevada in April, ``the drought is
still on with a passion,'' said state climatologist John James.
   Northern California is having its worst water shortage in 11
years, officials said.
   Winter precipitation was normal or above normal until the end of
January.
   ``But February and March of this year were dismal,
drought-producing months,'' said Gary Barbato, a hydrologist with
the National Weather Service at San Francisco.
   Statewide, snow-melt runoff in rivers through mid-summer is
expected to be an third of normal, said Don Heath, chief of the
state's newly activated drought center in Sacramento.
   As in Texas, some ranchers in California's central valley are
selling cattle and appealing for federal grain subsidies.
   Portions of southern Oregon have been classified as in a severe
drought and sections of eastern Oregon are in an extreme drought,
said Stan Fox, snow survey superintendent for the U.S. Soil
Conservation Service.
   Rainfall in April was near or above normal for the whole state,
but Oregon depends on winter precipitation for most of its water.
Snowpacks around the state range from 81 percent of normal on Mount
Hood to 3 percent of normal in Klamath County.
   The Columbia River is at its lowest level since the 1936-1937
dust bowl years.
   Montana's mountain snowpack this winter was only 75 percent of
normal, meaning less to feed streams during the spring and early
summer. Irrigation reservoirs in the state's eastern and central
part range from 98 percent full to 10 percent.
   ``If we get into a normal July and August _ normally very dry
months _ we're going to have some real trouble,'' said Phil Farnes,
head of the Soil Conservation Service snow survey team.
   The weather service says a mild drought is in effect across
northern Minnesota, North Dakota and eastern Montana.
   Farmers in parts of northwest Minnesota's Red River Valley have
stopped planting for lack of rain, and sugar beet seeds that were
planted are blowing off some fields. Thousands of acres of grass
grown for lawn seed have dried up, while high wind last week blew
away tons of topsoil.
   South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson on Friday declared 12
counties state disaster areas.
   In the Southeast, drought has hit the Tennessee Valley Authority
especially hard, with the rainfall between June 1984 and April 56
inches.
   ``That's better than a year's normal rainfall for the Tennessee
Valley. You're seeing impacts on recreation, hydro generation,
water quality,'' said Larry Richardson, the TVA's chief of
reservoir operations.

<HEAD>State Department Quietly Sends Cambodia Message On U.S. Remains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has quietly sent
Cambodian officials a message in an effort to win the release of
the remains of 80 American soldiers the Phnom Penh government
claims to have from the Vietnam War, a congressman disclosed.
   Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn., said U.S. officials, in a verbal
communique delivered through the International Red Cross two weeks
ago, offered U.S. aircraft and military honor guard to pick up the
remains.
   Rowland, along with Reps. Bob Smith, R-N.H., and Frank
McCloskey, D-Ind., has been lobbying State Department officials to
pursue an offer made to the congressmen by a high-ranking Cambodian
diplomat during the lawmakers' visit to Southeast Asia in January.
   Cambodian officials said they were willing to release the
remains, but have insisted that U.S. officials receive them, not an
intermediary. Rowland said American diplomats had been reluctant to
pursue the remains question with Cambodia because the United States
has no formal diplomatic ties with the Communist regime.
   But the congressman said last week that the State Department
sent the message offering the honor guard and transportation after
two high-ranking members of the House Armed Services Committee _
Reps. Bill Nichols, D-Ala., and G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery, D-Miss. _
also applied pressure on the administration.
   David Lambertson, deputy assistant secretary of state for east
Asian and Pacific affairs who has been handling the Cambodian
remains issue for the administration, did not return telephone
calls Friday.
   A State Department official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said the Red Cross has ``succeeded in engaging the Phnom
Penh regime on this issue (on behalf of the United States) and we
hope its going to work itself out.''
   ``We are encouraged,'' said the official, who refused to discuss
details of the talks or confirm that U.S. military escorts and
aircraft have been offered.
   Rowland, Smith and McCloskey in late March sent a telegram to
Tep Henn, Cambodia's ambassador to Vietnam, saying they would pick
up the remains and personal effects. Tep Henn, in a telegram dated
April 21, responded that he found the congressmen's message
``encouraging,'' but set no specifics for turning over the bodies.
   The congressmen sent another telegram to the ambassador last
week confirming the State Department's offer and suggesting early
June as a possible time for a transfer.
   Some have questioned whether Cambodia can have 80 soldiers'
remains since the Defense Department estimates that only 82
soldiers were lost in Cambodian terrority during the war. No U.S.
remains have ever been returned by Cambodia.
   The identified remains of 179 U.S. soldiers have been returned
from Southeast Asia since 1973 _ 152 from Vietnam, 25 from Laos and
two from China, according to Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon
spokesman.
   The congressional group also hopes to win the release of a
Colorado man who was arrested in Cambodian territory one year ago.
No reason was given for the arrest of Sterling Brian Bono of Las
Animas, and it was not known why the Vietnam veteran was in the
region.

   Smoggy air in the nation's cities may become
significantly cleaner than official projections indicate, new
discoveries about auto pollution suggest.
   Planned new federal regulations to make gasoline less volatile _
harder to vaporize _ may cure a problem only now being recognized,
some analysts say.
   This is the evaporation of gasoline from cars in use, called
``running loss.''
   All cars have systems designed to control evaporation while
parked. The Environmental Protection Agency has assumed the system
also prevents significant vapors from escaping when the car is
driven.
   On a hot day, it now appears, the system can be overwhelmed and
release five to 25 times more unburned gasoline than is permitted
in exhaust.
   The findings are so new that no one has had a chance to
calculate their effect. But they suggest that plans for less
volatile gasoline may significantly reduce this previously
underestimated contributor to smog.
   ``Official predictions have been under-predicting'' future
improvement with the less volatile gasoline in use, said Tom
Austin, a partner in Sierra Research of Sacramento, Calif., air
pollution consultants.
   Gasoline vapor is the major raw material for urban smog.
Chemical reactions with other pollutants in sunlight produce ozone,
which can make your chest feel tight.
   In proposing a regulation to cut maximum summer gasoline
volatility by 22 percent from the current voluntary standard, the
EPA hinted at the new findings last August. But it said results
were too preliminary to use, and did not disclose numbers.
   However, Hugh Shannon of Exxon Research Corp. disclosed numbers
at an American Petroleum Institute briefing last week. He said EPA
has results showing that ``running loss'' can reach 10 grams (about
half a liquid ounce) per mile; his own tests show a maximum of 2
grams per mile.
   The current limit in exhaust is 0.41 gram per mile.
   While declining to reveal specific test results, Tad Wysor, an
engineer in the Emissions Control Technology Division of EPA's Ann
Arbor, Mich. lab, said of the 10-gram figure, ``We haven't seen
anything that it's wrong but there's not a lot to back it up.''
   EPA wants to know whether this has been happening all along, or
whether, as Shannon believes, only recently because of the rise of
fuel-injected engines _ more than 80 percent today compared with
practically none in the mid-1970s.
   Fuel injection systems continuously recycle uninjected fuel back
to the tank, carrying heat from the engine compartment and making
the fuel hotter.
   This causes a pressure build-up which, with today's fuel,
overwhelms the under-hood charcoal canister that captures and
recycles the vapor.
   Sam Leonard, director of automotive emissions control for
General Motors Corp.'s environmental activities staff, said ``You
can't put a big enough canister under there'' to capture all
running losses, but EPA's volatility regulation ``definitely'' will
eliminate them.
   For several reasons, volatility has surged in the 1980s. That
causes more evaporations and more ozone.
   EPA has known that cars passing its stationary emissions test
while using fuel of 9.0 pounds vapor pressure, typical of 1975,
flunk badly on today's fuel, which may be 11.5 pounds or higher.
   Leonard says that on one part of the test, GM researchers found
16 times as much emissions using 11.5-pound fuel compared with
9.0-pound fuel.
   EPA last week published the annual list of areas failing to meet
national ozone standards. The list rose from 62 to 68 names, and
environmental groups said the data showed that smog is getting
worse.
   Most analysts have blamed the failure to reduce ozone levels
more quickly on the failure of states and EPA to require stricter
controls such as vapor recovery systems on gasoline stations.
   William S. Becker, executive director of the State and
Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, said running
losses could be a reason some areas violate the standard, but, ``I
don't think this is clearly the major reason.''
   Still, EPA's Wysor said, ``If all these things fall into place,
it's logical to expect this is a big source and another explanation
that could be offered as to why attainment (of the standards) has
been so hard.''
   EPA estimated that volatility controls will reduce emissions of
ozone precursors by 8 percent in polluted areas that do not have
strict controls of their own, as California does. This did not
include elimination of running losses.
   Austin said his impression from conversations at a recent
meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers was ``if we could
get (both running and stationary) evaporative emissions under
control we could reduce emissions by 10 to 15 percent,'' with
``exponential benefits'' to public health.

   A top aide to Attorney General Edwin Meese III
says a recent congressional report accusing his boss of violating
White House ethics rules should top a ``list of sleaze.''
   Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, who last
year was given additional responsibilities as counselor to Meese,
said the bipartisan Senate report is harmful to ongoing inquiries
into the attorney general's actions.
   ``We've got a process that's in place, people who are
investigating and it seems to me that we do not contribute to an
integrity of that process when we have that kind of report that
comes out that so disserves and so misstates what the facts are,''
Reynolds said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' program.
   ``If that is the best case that one comes up with against this
attorney general for ethical conduct, I would have to say that this
man is as clean as he can possibly be in every respect.''
   Reynolds, the top enforcer of the Reagan administration's civil
rights policies, added: ``If I were making a list of sleaze, I'd
put that (the report) at the top.''
   The report, issued Wednesday by the Senate Governmental Affairs
subcommittee on oversight of government management, concluded that
Meese's violation of the rules resulted in ``improper favoritism''
for the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   The report said E. Robert Wallach sent Meese, then counselor to
President Reagan, 16 memos in 1981 and 1982 detailing Wedtech's
efforts to get a contract to build small engines for the Army and
government officials' opposition to those efforts.
   Meese has acknowledged interceding on behalf of Wedtech, but
says he only wanted to assure that its contract proposal got a fair
hearing.
   Wallach, a longtime friend of Meese, is now under indictment in
the Wedtech scandal. He was paid $1.3 million by the Bronx,
N.Y.-company, which subsequently won the no-bid, $32 million
contract.
   ``Former Counselor to the President Edwin Meese III and former
Deputy Counselor Jim Jenkins failed to observe the White House
policy on contracts with procurement officials, which failure
resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor,'' the
report said.
   The White House procurement policy in effect since October 1981
says that ``obviously, no member of the White House staff should
contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a
personal financial interest or in which a relative, friend or
business associate has a financial interest.''
   Reynolds said the report ``made reference to a policy or rule in
the White House that wasn't in existence at the time the Wedtech
thing was referred over to the attorney general.''
   Independent Counsel James McKay has been investigating Meese's
ties to Wedtech, a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline project promoted by
Wallach, and other matters. In addition, the Office of Government
Ethics is conducting an inquiry into why Meese solicited 30,000
lawyers and businessman to pay more than $3,000 apiece to a
profit-making organization to attend a conference.
   Reynolds maintained that despite the investigations, morale at
the Justice Department remains good.
   ``Actually, it's very good,'' he said. ``We have a lot of
professionals. Everybody in the department is very professional.
   ``Most of the people in the department take the attitude that is
much the same as George Bush's attitude. These are investigations
that are ongoing. They'll play themselves out, the process ought to
be allowed to work,'' Reynolds said.
   ``So far,'' he added, ``nobody has suggested that the attorney
general has done anything that comes close to unlawful activity or
activity that is going to result in an indictment of any kind.''

<TEXT>
   Voters on Tuesday will shape the future
of Mingo County, a poor backwater once so corrupt a fire chief ran
a drug ``carry-out'' and a sheriff allegedly helped protect the
business.
   ``It's up to the people this time,'' said Michael Thornsbury, a
Williamson lawyer and first-time candidate who is running for the
state House of Delegates. ``They can choose the old way, or they
can take the best opportunity they've had to vote good, honest
candidates into office.''
   Tales of corruption prompted voters to sweep incumbents out of
the county courthouse in 1986. This year, most of the old guard _
many under indictment _ didn't bother to run.
   Even so, voters will have a wide choice.
   Fifty political novices are among the 69 candidates who filed
for 12 offices, which include the legislature, county commission
and sheriff.
   In 1986, voters ousted long-time Democratic party boss Johnie
Owens and his slate of candidates in favor of those backed by
Owens' enemy, Larry Hamrick.
   Then in January 1987, an out-of-county judge and prosecutor
specially appointed by the state Supreme Court launched a grand
jury investigation into county politics. Months later, 16
politicians, including Hamrick, were indicted on charges of
conspiracy to subvert Mingo's free elections.
   ``As ordinary citizens of Mingo County, we have been repeatedly
shocked and dismayed at the manner in which the county government
has been organized and run,'' the grand jury said.
   ``What we have heard individually by way of rumor, hearsay and
speculation over the past several years has been verified to us by
sworn testimony.''
   Taking on the power structure is not easy for some ``ordinary
citizens,'' many of whom have long believed their livelihood
depended upon remaining in the politicians' good graces. Poverty
allowed corruption to flourish, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe
Savage, who heads a corruption investigation.
   According to Savage, only 8,700 of the county's 36,000 residents
have jobs. More than 2,600 of the jobs are controlled by
politicians, such as those who run the school board, the county
commission and the anti-poverty agency. As a result, Savage said,
many residents believe they must vote the way they're told by the
politicians.
   ``The political bosses had a long-standing habit of threatening
people's jobs, their food stamps, their Social Security, and many
people just don't know that they _ the bosses _ can't really affect
those things,'' he said.
   This year's deadline for filing for office passed long before
the grand jury returned its indictments. But the investigation was
no secret, and when the filing period ended, most of the incumbents
_ many previously aligned with Owens or Hamrick _ had decided
against seeking re-election.
   ``There are an awful lot of just average good old people running
for office this year,'' said Curtis Fletcher, a high school
assistant principal who is one of five candidates vying for the
Democratic nomination for a county commission seat.
   ``People had no idea what was going on with some of our
leaders,'' Fletcher said. ``They knew about who got gravel for
their road and who got a job at the courthouse.''
   Fletcher, a political newcomer, estimates he will spend about
$2,000 for his campaign.
   ``In the past, you couldn't get elected (to the commission)
unless you were willing to spend $15,000 or $20,000,'' he said.
   According to the indictments, much of that money went to buy
votes for politicians who in turn used their positions to protect
friends and family engaged in other illegal activities.
   Former Sheriff Eddie Hilbert pleaded guilty to buying his job
for $100,000 from Owens, his predecessor. Hilbert allegedly used
his position to protect Kermit Fire Chief Wig Preece, who was
convicted on federal charges of running a ``drug carry-out'' next
door to the town police department, headed by his son-in-law, David
Ramey.
   Preece and Ramey, along with other relatives, were sentenced to
lengthy prison terms for their role in Kermit's drug ring.
   ``They were doing more business than the K-mart,'' said Tennis
Hatfield, a former radio announcer who is a first-time candidate
running for sheriff. ``When you can put up a sign on the building
that says `Out Of Drugs, Back In 30 Minutes,' there's something
more wrong than usual.''

<TEXT>
   A legislator decided to go against the flow
when he noticed how much more time women spent in restrooms than
men, so he penned a ``potty parity'' resolution to help relieve the
situation.
   The measure by Delegate John A. Rollison III calls for hearings
to determine whether the state plumbing code's 50-50 ratio of space
for women's and men's restrooms in public buildings is fair to
females who seem to spend a lot of time waiting in line at public
facilities. The hearings begin in the fall.
   ``I've been surprised by the amount of attention this has
received,'' Rollison said. ``There should be a lot of people at the
hearings.''
   He insists he's quite serious about the issue, despite jibes
from lawmakers and the press. His resolution was passed by both
houses in February amid hoots, chuckles and whispered jokes.
   But Rollison steadfastly refuses to joke about ``restroom
equity'' _ the term he favors over ``potty parity.''
   ``I haven't found anyone yet who will tell me this is not a
problem,'' Rollison said.
   He said his legislative aide, Bonnie Campbell, and his wife
brought the situation to his attention.
   ``Bonnie did some research and found it was a widespread
problem,'' Rollison said. ``Women's restrooms are underdesigned for
their flow.''
   Ms. Campbell said the state's plumbing code calls for equal
restroom space for men and women in public buildings. Because
urinals occupy less space than toilet stalls, men's restrooms often
have more facilities.
   Ms. Campbell cited several other reasons for lines forming in
many women's restrooms while men go through without a wait.
   ``Elderly people take longer,'' she said. ``There are more
elderly women than men, and demographically, that's getting worse.
Also, there are more handicapped women than men. And younger women
often have their children in tow.''
   Rollison said the lack of toilets for women affects their
enjoyment at public events.
   ``Some women won't even buy a beer at a sporting event,'' he
said.
   Savannah Day, a Virginia Tech professor of housing who has
researched the problem, said she had a friend in Florida with a
different approach.
   ``She refused to stand in those long lines at Florida State
football games,'' Mrs. Day said. ``So she would go to the men's
room and her husband would guard the door.''
   The professor said that in addition to the factors cited by Ms.
Campbell, women have more clothing to manipulate and ``do more
activities in the restroom'' _ like talk and apply makeup.
   A Cornell University undergraduate conducted a similar study for
the Department of Transportation in Washington state. Ann Tran, 20,
found that men spend an average of 45 seconds in a restroom stall
compared with 79 seconds for women.
   The sophomore concluded that a 60-40 ratio between women's and
men's toilets would be more equitable.
   Rollison, a Republican, said he expected to take a lot of
ribbing over the resolution, but, he added, ``frankly, it didn't
bother me.''
   After the resolution was approved, Rollison's aides decorated
his office with toilet paper. Hanging on the door was a toilet lid
with the message, ``Congratulations, Jack.''
   Newspapers had some fun with Rollison's resolution. One headline
proclaimed: ``Committee lifts lid on `potty parity.'''

   Rescue workers dug a trench and broke
through concrete walls to save a 13-month-old boy who fell down a
foot-wide pipe into an unused water storage tank where he was
trapped for 2{ hours.
   Stephen Ulrich on Sunday was taken to St. Luke's Hospital where
he was released with just a couple scrapes, said nursing supervisor
Jo Sparks.
   ``I'd say he's a pretty lucky little boy,'' said police Sgt.
Greg Moore.
   Stephen apparently lifted a loose lid off the cistern when his
mother, Kim, went into the house briefly, Moore said. When she
heard screams, she ran outside and found the boy had fallen 6 feet
down the pipe and 4 feet into the storage area, which measured
about 6-by-8 feet, he said.
   The tank was about half filled with dirt, which helped break the
boy's fall, Moore said.

<HEAD>Report Says Estimates of Farm Program Costs Filled With Errors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress knows that Agriculture Department
estimates of farm program costs ``cannot be trusted'' and the
record of the past 15 years bears out that assessment, a
congressman says.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., made the comment Sunday in response
to a report he requested from the General Accounting Office, a
congressional investigative arm. It said farm program costs have
exceeded Agriculture Department estimates by more than $46 billion
over a 15-year span.
   Lawmakers ``know that USDA's budget forecasts cannot be
trusted'' because of the errors, English said.
   The errors make it difficult to foresee program costs and can
have an impact on the amounts that lawmakers authorize, English
said in a statement.
   ``Congress asks two questions when it considers farm program
legislation,'' he said. ``What are the benefits to farmers and the
nation and how much will it cost?''
   The report found the forecasts by the Commodity Credit Corp.
were billions of dollars off target under both Republican and
Democratic presidents and more often underestimated how much money
would be required than overestimated.
   The Commodity Credit Corp. estimates are separate from the
figures contained in the president's budget requests. Those
requests seek funds to pay off net Commodity Credit Corp. losses
already on the books.
   Commodity Credit Corp. estimates are supposed to be a look ahead
to conditions in the economy that could put the nation's farm
subsidy programs on a roller coaster and place new strains on the
budget.
   Underestimates of the costs of farm programs result in too
little money being allocated when Congress makes up its spending
plan and force Congress to come back later in the year to make up
shortfalls.
   The report said Agriculture Department spending for farm income
and price support programs totaled $110.7 billion from 1972 through
1986. It said Commodity Credit Corp. estimates for the period were
$63.8 billion, or $46.9 billion too low.
   ``USDA's budget estimates were substantially incorrect in most
years,'' the report said. It put the average at $3.1 billion a year
beyond the forecasts produced by the Agriculture Department.
   The report reviewed estimates for three individual commodities:
corn, wheat and dairy. They represented 63 percent of net outlays
and 77 percent of the errors of recent years.
   It said the corn budget estimates contained errors on both the
plus and minus sides totaling $25.1 billion. On balance, the
forecasts were off by a net $14.5 billion. That represented the
largest amount of error among the three commodities.
   The report said the errors stemmed from a wide array of
difficulties, ranging from mistakes in forecasting supply and
demand to problems in managing data and documentation.
   ``Although USDA's forecasting methods have generally been
developed by highly skilled staff, little attention has been paid
to reviewing and evaluating whether these methods work as
intended,'' the report said.
   It also said that the ``USDA has not had a structured quality
control program but has taken some action to correct weaknesses.''

<HEAD>Jackson Challenge Of Delegate Seating Likely, Campaign Chairman
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson will probably challenge the
seating of delegates at the Democratic convention in July because
it appears party officials will not act on his objections to the
selection process, his campaign chairman says.
   Willie Brown, speaker of the California Assembly, said he and
other Jackson advisers have spoken to Democratic National Committee
chairman Paul Kirk and other party leaders about Jackson's
insistence that the delegate totals roughly correspond to the
popular vote.
   But those talks, Brown said, are ``not so far productive,'' and
the campaign will likely make challenges to the delegate slates of
states where it believes the selection has been unfair.
   ``I think we are going to end up having to make them because I
don't think it's (the discussion) going to be productive,'' Brown
told The Associated Press on Saturday.
   In recent days, Jackson has said he is appealing to party
leaders for ``some measure of fairness,'' but he has shied away
from any indication that he would make an official challenge or
employ the kind of attack he made in disputing party rules in 1984.
   Jackson uses Puerto Rico as an example _ in that contest, he won
the popular vote but the governor awarded all of the island's
delegates to Michael Dukakis. Party rules allow for such practices,
although in many states the delegate allocation is tied directly to
the popular vote.
   A successful challenge could narrow the gap of roughly 600
delegates between Dukakis and Jackson and make the delegate tallies
more closely reflect the popular vote, which currently stands at
some 37 percent for Dukakis to 28 percent for Jackson.
   ``If we can mount some credential challenge on fairness, this
thing doesn't have to be over,'' Brown said when asked about the
conclusion by some observers that Dukakis all but has the
nomination locked up.
   Jackson has said he will talk with ``super delegates'' from
congressional districts where he won the popular vote, and appeal
for their support even though they are not bound to follow the vote
totals.
   Super delegates attend the convention by virtue of their
position as public or party officeholders.
   On Sunday, Jackson took that a step further, saying that white
Democratic officeholders, especially those in the South who have
benefited from the black vote, should be willing to support him on
that basis.
   He singled out North Carolina Sen. Terry Sanford and former
North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, who angered Jackson supporters by
endorsing Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.. Gore narrowly defeated
Jackson in the North Carolina primary.
   ``It's reasonable to expect that Sen. Sanford will endorse my
campaign. That's a reasonable expectation,'' Jackson said in
Greensboro, N.C., noting that the black vote was crucial to
Sanford's 1986 election.
   Sanford is a super delegate.
   Jackson has also hinted that his supporters might stay away from
the polls in November if they perceived he was being treated
unfairly. He indirectly raised the possibility again on Sunday.
   ``We define our friends by their willingness to be fair and to
be just,'' Jackson said. ``One thing about politics, it does not go
up and down. It goes round and round. Anything that goes around
comes around.''
   Regardless of the outcome of the race for the nomination,
Jackson officials are confident their delegate strength will ensure
their influence on the party platform, and are working on what
issues they want to include.
   ``We won't have to worry about getting every plank we want
considered,'' said Brown.
   In the meantime, Jackson is unveiling the themes that he hopes
will increase that strength in California, the nation's biggest
delegate prize.
   Jackson has an active and broad organization of supporters but
he, like Dukakis, must figure out how to appeal to the wider
population in this state of 25 million that appears to lack
enthusiasm for this year's election.
   Most Democratic officeholders so far are sitting out the
campaign, apparently reluctant to endorse either Jackson or Dukakis.
   Many of them had earlier endorsed one of the five Democrats who
have since dropped out of the race.
   Brown characterized his non-endorsing colleagues in the state
legislature and other neutral politicians as mostly ``mainstream
traditional Democrats'' who would not be expected to endorse the
liberal Jackson and who don't feel they know enough about Dukakis.
   Jackson has been targeting women, environmentalists, Hispanics,
gays and peace activists, and continuing to sound his anti-drug and
anti-Reaganomics themes.
   Brown said campaign strategists are to meet this week to
determine what kind of television commercials will be aired in what
campaign manager Gerald Austin said will be about a $2 million ad
campaign.
   California ``is a hotbed for peace'' and Jackson's positions on
peace in Central America and the Middle East and Africa should sell
well, especially on the state's more than 140 college campuses,
said Brown.

<TEXT>
   When rebels kidnapped peanut farmer
Ibraimo Danancha and stole the shirt off his back, he solved his
problem in a manner familiar to many clothesless Mozambicans _ he
tailored an outfit from tree bark.
   Danancha had worn the sturdy bark for about a month when he
escaped from the guerrillas April 17 and turned up at the refugee
camp in the village of Malema, in Nampula province.
   The bark is rough and grating and none too comfortable, which
also describes life in general for most of Mozambique's 14.5
million people.
   Mozambique's 11-year-war for independence from Portugal
(1964-75), and the current civil conflict which began in 1977, has
left the country one of the poorest in the world despite extensive
resources and fertile lands. For many, their lives have been
reduced to a daily lesson in survival.
   ``It is God's business,'' a Mozambican will say stoically when
calamity strikes. ``That's life,'' another will add.
   Almost 6 million hungry people will need more than 900,000 tons
of food aid in the next year, the government says. Rural villages
throughout the country have been destroyed by guerrillas of the
Mozambique National Resistance. Crops have been wiped out by
droughts and floods in recent years.
   In the cities, food is easier to find, but there are other
difficulties. Beira, the second largest city, is without
electricity during the day and the water system works only
sporadically. In the capital of Maputo, public transportation
consists of an occasional standing-room-only bus.
   While the war has left Mozambique in shambles, it also has
brought forth a certain resiliance and adaptability among its
people.
   In the northeastern city of Nampula, residents stage a
flea-market every Sunday, displaying their talents for improvising.
   The tops of discarded beer cans are cut off and turned into cups
and flower pots. Used nails are meticulously straightened and
resold to people rebuilding homes.
   Condensed milk tins are used as the base for oil lamps. Small
cracker boxes are turned into toy trains with rubber rings used as
wheels. Clear plastic in men's wallets is sought for use as
protective covering for pictures hung in the home.
   A stick attached to a can and some strings is transformed into a
banjo. Shards of glass are collected and glued to the tops of walls
as a security barrier.
   In recent weeks, waves of grasshoppers have begun to appear in
Nampula. Every night, residents with glass jars go out under street
lights and catch the grasshoppers, which are fried and served as a
protein-rich delicacy.
   Women of limited means have learned to rely on ``capalanas,'' a
multi-function wraparound garment.
   It's used primarily as an everyday dress, which can easily be
loosened if the women becomes pregnant. It also can be wrapped and
folded in a manner that creates a pouch to carry a child. At night,
capalanas are employed as blankets.
   ``Most Mozambicans have a very slim understanding of what the
war is about,'' said Rodney Sidloski, the CARE representative in
Nampula. ``But they continue to bounce back and adapt no matter
what happens.''
   Nonetheless, most feel there is no substitute for returning to
their village and their land.
   Carlos Marques, 32, and other members of a refugee camp on
Nampula's outskirts walk more than 12 miles every morning to tend
their fields. They walk back to the camp in the evenings, because
the military can't guarantee their security against nighttime
guerrilla attacks.
   ``We can't stay on the land until it is safe,'' said Marques.
``But I think we will go back. That day will come.''

<HEAD>Unlike '84, Black Share of the Primary Vote is Level in Many
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although Jesse Jackson has been dramatically
successful in the Democratic primaries this year, analysts say he
has not repeated a major accomplishment of his 1984 presidential
campaign: expanding the black share of the vote.
   Four years ago, Jackson drew a vastly higher black turnout in
many states. Blacks made up a fifth of the Democratic electorate in
Ohio, up from 8 percent in 1980; a sixth in Pennsylvania, also up
from 8 percent.
   But while he has drawn enthusiastic crowds, expanded his support
among whites and raised his own share of the black vote this time
around, he has not galvanized more blacks to register and vote.
   ``His first candidacy brought a lot more black voters to the
polls. There was a clear pattern of increased black
participation,'' said ABC News poll analyst John Brennan. ``That
pattern is not repeating itself this year.''
   Black voter turnout is crucial for the Democrats because blacks
make up one of their core voting blocs. Strategists say Jackson
could boost the Democrats' chances if he could deliver an expanded
black vote in the general election _ and hurt the party's odds if
he should discourage black support of the ticket.
   Viewing the primary results so far, ``The major implication is
that you cannot expect an unusual black turnout this year,'' said
independent pollster Peter Hart.
   ``If the Democrats are counting on a disproportionate black
turnout, it seems to be it's going to be difficult to achieve,''
Hart said. ``If Jesse can't achieve it when there's a direct
one-to-one relationship, it's more unlikely to happen when it's not
a one-to-one relationship.''
   Jackson increased black voting in 1984 through massive voter
registration drives. He has not conducted such intensive drives
this year, and exit polls in many states have found the black vote
virtually unchanged from 1984 as a share of the electorate.
   CBS News-New York Times polls said blacks made up 19 percent of
the Democratic voters in Ohio last month, compared to 20 percent in
1984; in Pennsylvania, 16 percent this year, 17 percent in 1984; in
New York, 24 percent this year, 24 percent in 1984.
   ABC News poll results have been similar. ``In Illinois, despite
the publicity about the crowds that greeted Jackson, black turnout
actually was down a bit from 1984,'' said Brennan. ``It was steady
in Pennsylvania, steady in Ohio, down a bit in Indiana, up a bit in
New York.''
   Polls have shown sizable increases in some states: In Georgia,
blacks made up 35 percent of the turnout in the CBS-Times poll, up
from 28 percent in 1984. In Alabama, though, an NBC News poll said
blacks made up 32 percent in 1988, little changed from 30 percent
in 1984.
   In many cases, more blacks may have voted this year than in
1984, but not in numbers any greater than the increase of other
voters, pollsters noted.
   Another issue for Democrats is whether black turnout may
fluctuate in the general election as it has in the primaries, or is
more likely to remain stable. In 1984, some analysts expected a
greater share of blacks, newly energized by Jackson, to vote
Democratic in November, Brennan said. But blacks made up 8 percent
of the general election vote, down a point from 1980 and three
points below their share of the voting age population.
   The 1984 general election may be a poor example, pollster Hart
said, ``because that wasn't a fight that was turning a lot of
people on.'' Still, he said he was surprised that Jackson has not
broadly boosted black voters' electoral share this year.
   ``It just lets you know institutionally how difficult it is,''
Hart said. ``Even one man as good as he is isn't able to
disproportionately shift the electorate.''

   Retail gasoline prices rose an average 1.01
cent a gallon during the past two weeks but the rate of increase
was much slower than during the previous two weeks, an analyst said.
   As of Saturday, the average price of gasoline was 99.85 cents a
gallon, according to the bi-weekly Lundberg Survey check of prices
at 12,000 stations nationwide.
   The previous survey showed an increase of 2.67 cents a gallon in
the average price of all grades at self- and full-serve pumps and
including cash and credit prices and taxes.
   In the more recent survey, the average price per gallon at
self-service pumps were: regular unleaded, 91.66 cents; premium
unleaded, $106.06; regular leaded, 88.34 cents.
   At full-service pumps: regular unleaded, $116.57; premium
unleaded, $127.13; regular leaded, $114.27.
   ``Future price moves are really anybody's guess,'' said analyst
Trilby Lundberg.

   Rachel Lauren Simunich, who weighed less than 2 pounds at birth,
died Friday at Magee-Womens Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman
Mary Hughes.
   Rachel's three sisters and brother remain in critical condition
in the neonatal intensive care unit but are not suffering from
complications, Ms. Hughes said.
   The parents, Terry and Max Simunich of Greenville requested that
no additional information about Rachel's death be made released.
   The couple announced the births of their children April 29. The
babies were three months premature when they were delivered within
five minutes the night of April 27-28.
   Bradley Andrew came first, weighing 1 pound, 10 ounces, followed
by Emily Marie, Allison Nicole, Rachel and Kathryn Elizabeth. The
girls ranged from 1 pound, 8 ounces to 1 pound, 10 ounces.
   The four infants may be ready to go home by midsummer, Ms.
Hughes said. Mrs. Simunich was discharged last week.

   A former political boss convicted of
corruption in a mountain coal mining county charged in a national
news broadcast Sunday that he turned down a $12,000 payment from
Gov. Arch Moore Jr.
   The NBC News broadcast, two days before an election in which
Moore is locked in a tough primary battle with Morgantown
millionaire John Raese, brought an angry response from the
governor's spokesman.
   ``As a former journalist, I think it's a piece of garbage,''
said spokesman John Price.
   ``The governor said that 16 years ago, he had no idea of the
existence of Johnie Owens.''
   Owens, the former Mingo County political boss, charged that
Moore offered him money to buy his organization's backing in 1972.
   ``Arch Moore laid down in the back seat of a car holding $12,000
up in his hand like a common criminal instead of a governor and
begged me to take it,'' Owens said on the broadcast.
   ``The governor said it's strange that 36 hours before West
Virginians go to the polls, a supposedly responsible network would
air the comments of a convicted felon,'' Price said.
   A federal court last month sentenced Owens to 14 years in prison
on four charges stemming from his role in a 1982 conspiracy to sell
the Mingo sheriff's job.
   Raese said he was dismayed by NBC's pre-election broadcast of a
previously unaired excerpt of a WSAZ-TV interview conducted on
April 19 as Owens was about to report to prison.
   ``I'm very saddened by the whole event,'' Raese said. ``It's a
dark moment for Republican politics in West Virginia.''
   Moore, a Republican, beat Democrat Jay Rockefeller _ then
secretary of state, now a U.S. senator _ by 600 votes in Mingo
County in 1972 despite a 7-1 voter advantage for the Democratic
Party.
   The last Republican to win an election in Mingo County before
that was Herbert Hoover in 1932.

George Bush shows a significant lead over Democratic candidates in

   poll conducted by Mississippi State University.
   The survey found Vice President Bush would receive 59 percent of
Mississippi's vote, compared with 41 percent for leading Democratic
hopeful and Michael Dukakis if the election were held now.
   It showed Bush leading Jesse Jackson by 65-35.
   The survey of 433 likely voters was conducted by telephone

undecided votes. The margin of error was plus or minus 6 percentage
points.
   Poll director Stephen Shaffer said the survey found that 94

Democratic voters.
   ``Dukakis is especially hurt among independents, who favor Bush

<TEXT>
   Rodrigo Borja, a center-left lawyer who
promised to distance his administration from the current
government's pro-U.S. foreign policy, was elected president of
Ecuador.
   Borja, 52, leader of the Democratic Left Party, defeated
populist Abdala Bucaram, 36, in an runoff on Sunday to select a
successor to conservative Leon Febres Cordero, Washington's closest
ally in South America.
   With the vote count virtually complete, Borja had 1,631,747
votes to Bucaram's 1,401,153 votes. Nearly 450,000 votes were blank
or nullified. More than 4.6 million Ecuadoreans were registered to
vote.
   Bucaram, speaking on national television from his power base in
Guayaquil, the country's largest city and its major port, conceded
defeat Sunday night and congratulated Borja.
   ``There are no excuses. Dr. Rodrigo Borja is the president of
Ecuador,'' said Bucaram, a fiery campaigner who had sworn to
``punish the oligarchy'' if elected.
   Speaking over television in Quito, Borja said, ``Thank you,
Ecuador, thank you.''
   It was Borja's third bid for the presidency. He was narrowly
defeated by Febres Cordero in a bitterly fought runoff in 1984 and
has pledged to reverse his foe's free-market economic policies.
   But he also told Ecuador's business community not to be
frightened by his election. ``Our victory should not make anyone
nervous. No one should set off a financial panic,'' Borja said
Sunday night. ``We intend to respect private enterprise.''
   Borja has promised to back a moratorium on payment of Ecuador's
$9.2 billion dollar foreign debt if creditors don't agree to
negotiate easier terms. ``I do not believe it is possible to pay
the foreign debt under the conditions they want to collect,'' he
said in a recent meeting with foreign correspondents. ``Either we
pay the debt or we develop the country. We can't do both things at
the same time.''
   The Febres Cordero government suspended payment on the debt last
year after severe economic damage from devastating earthquakes.
   Borja and Bucaram defeated eight other candidates in the first
round of elections Jan. 31 to qualify for the runoff. Febres
Cordero, of the Social Christian Party, came in third, a sign of
his government's low popularity.
   The victory by the left-leaning Borja and Bucaram sent tremors
through Ecuador's financial circles. The Ecuadorean currency
plunged in value from 275 sucres to the dollar to nearly 500 sucres
since the first round of voting.
   Borja has said he plans to establish exchange controls and
restrict imports to protect Ecuador's dangerously low dollar
reserves. He also plans price controls on basic consumer goods.
   He says he will seek close ties to the non-aligned movement and
re-establish diplomatic relations with leftist-led Nicaragua.
Febres Cordero severed relations in 1985 after an argument with
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
   Borja will be sworn in Aug. 10 for a four-year term. He will be
the third elected president since democracy was restored in 1979
after nine years of civilian and military dictatorships.
   Borja will confront the challenge of a governing a nation that
is in its deepest recession since it began exporting oil in the
early 1970s.
   The economy shrank 3.5 percent last year, thanks in great
measure to the sharp drop in the price of oil, Ecuador's major
source of income. Inflation is running at an annual rate of 70
percent, the highest level since 1983, and less than half the work
force has full-time employment.

   U.S. and Soviet artists are trying to draw the
cultural gap between the two countries to a close, and the idea has
people laughing.
   The traveling ``USSR-USA Cartoon Exchange'' features cartoons
from both countries that sponsors hope will erase walls of
misunderstanding.
   Is it working?
   ``Da!'' exclaimed the show's curator, Eric Swenson of San
Francisco. ``Big yes!
   ``Cartoons communicate the universal, wordless art that can make
people laugh,'' he said during the show's debut here this weekend.
``I'm overwhelmed by the instant rapport the artists from the two
countries develop. Listen to the sound in this building.''
   The sound Saturday in the gallery was laughter. Through a live
``videophone'' hook-up, about 10 U.S. artists serenaded a group of
Soviet artists in Moscow. They requested ``a typical American
song'' and got ``Take Me Out to the Ball Park.'' The Americans got
a long-distance ovation.
   ``I'm literally blown away by the quality and the humor,'' said
Brian Bassett, editorial cartoonist for the Seattle Times who draws
the syndicated comic strip ``Adam.''
   ``I guess that's an indication of how little our two cultures
have touched,'' he said.
   Iuri Ivanov, a 41-year-old cartoonist from Moscow on hand for
the opening, picked his favorite American exhibit of the 40 being
shown and sent it electronically to his colleagues in Moscow.
   ``I like it because it's stupid,'' Ivanov said, not being
critical. ``It describes the stupidity of the situation perfectly.''
   The cartoon by Wiley of San Francisco showed a complacent Soviet
Bear and casual Uncle Sam standing in front of two television
cameras, one camera Soviet, the other Amercian.
   The lens in the American camera shows the bear trying to devour
Uncle Sam. Conversely, the lens in the Soviet camera shows Uncle
Sam with a gun to the bear's head.
   ``Very definately the perceptions are changing,'' Ivanov said.
``The more of these type of exchanges, the more this picture won't
be true.''
   Not even the most optimistic of the 50 or so people at the
opening saw rosy Soviet-U.S. relations being painted with one
stroke of the brush. Ivanov, however, hailed increased cultural
exchanges made possible by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy
of glasnost, which has opened doors for Soviet artists.
   The few political jabs in the cartoons shown by the Soviet
artists were light, and any political satire tended to generalize.
Bureaucracy was lampooned, not the bureaucrats.
   In one of Ivanov's watercolors, a man tied to a noose serves as
the clapper in a bell. A smiling man in a uniform swings from the
hapless clapper's feet.
   ``The common man suffers so others can enjoy,'' Ivanov
explained. But he quickly pointed out the picture isn't
representative of capitalism or communism.
   ``It's like that everywhere,'' he said.
   Some Americans are slow to accept glasnost as anything more than
a concept, he said.
   For instance, he pointed to a picture by Milt Prigee, editorial
cartoonist for the Spokane Spokesman Review.
   The cartoon shows a man behind bars, with the familiar smiley
faces drawn around it along with the Soviet sickle and the word
``glasnost.''
   ``The artist doesn't understand the situation of glasnost,''
Ivanov said. ``The bars are cut. That was a problem before, but not
anymore. Things are immensely better under Gorbachev.''
   Asked for an example, Ivanov replied, ``For example, I am here.''
   The show continues here through June 7 before heading to Los
Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago and Washington, D.C. After that
it moves to the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>It Was A Dark And Stormy Paragraph</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What makes a good sentence go bad?
   ``Like an expensive sports car, fine-tuned and well-built,
Portia was sleek, shapely and gorgeous, her red jumpsuit moulding
her body, which was as warm as the seatcovers in July, her hair as
dark as new tires, her eyes flashing like bright hubcaps, and her
lips dewy as the beads of fresh rain on the hood; she was a woman
driven _ fueled by a single accelerant _ and she needed a man, a
man who wouldn't shift from his views, a man to steer her along the
right road: a man like Alf Romeo.''
   That awful thing was submitted to the annual Bulwer-Lytton
Fiction Contest by 20-year-old journalism student Rachel Sheeley of
Franklin College in Indiana. It brought her to the top _ or the
bottom _ of the heap of more than 11,000 entries.
   The top honor _ or, again, the lack of it _ was announced Sunday
by San Jose State University Professor Scott Rice, founder and
``grand panjandrum'' of the literary disgrace he calls ``the
Baltimore Orioles of literature.''
   Whether a boon or bane for the winner's career, Rice points out
that the competition is not a joke-writing contest. ``It really
takes a very good writer to deliberately write bad,'' he said.
   The contest trashes the battered memory of 19th century English
writer Edward George Earle Bulwer-Lytton, whose turgid style is
captured in the opening line of one of his novels: ``It was a dark
and stormy night. ...''
   Rice notes that Bulwer-Lytton also is remembered for such
ringing cliches as ``The pen is mightier than the sword'' and ``The
Great Unwashed.''
   The contest also is a gentle reminder to the world of letters
that it is OK to lighten up, forget the grammar books for a minute
and have some fun, to ``approach the language recreationally as
well as practically,'' Rice said.
   For her effort, Sheeley wins a word processor. This, Rice noted,
illustrates the computer-terminology adage, ``Garbage in, garbage
out.''
   Awards also were made in selected categories.
   Brian W. Holmes of San Jose won in puns: ``Once a month, when
the moon is full, Reverend Jim Bleaker and his lovely wife Teddi
invite members of the church to the parsonage for an evening of
hymn singing, followed by cookies, tea, and a frenzied orgy on the
lawn outside, making sure, of course, to take all the usual
precautions for safe sects.''
   Joan Mazulelwicz of Liverpool, N.Y., won for purple prose: ``The
silent snow fell relentlessly, unceasingly, mercilessly from the
sordid, sullied surreality of the sky as if some enormous, ethereal
diner were shaking grated parmesan on the great, soggy meatball
that was earth.''
   Michael Stratford, Miles City, Mont., won for science fiction:
``Shirley doubted that her alien escort, composed as he was of
vegetable matter, seaweed, and a thick coating of swampy muck,
would be a suitable date for the Intergalactic kegger, but he
turned out to be a real FUNGI.''
   R.B. Nelson, Nottinghamshire, England, won for detective novel:
``With the radio squawking that a 4711 was in progress at 37th and
127th, Murphy knocked car 495 into 3rd and headed up 5th at 70,
little reckoning, as he thumbed his .38, that this would be the day
when his number came up.''

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with three grafs to UPDATE with closing figures; picks

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar steadied against the Japanese yen Monday
after opening lower in Tokyo, while stock prices dropped in a
market traders described as lusterless.
   The dollar opened at 124.73 yen and then edged up to close the
day's session at 124.87 yen, down 0.01 yen from Friday's close.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which shed 46.62 points during last Saturday's half-day session,
continued to slide downward, losing 223.47 points or 0.81 percent
to end the day at 27,264.30.
   
   Dealers said the lack of major market-affecting news is
contributing to a sluggish U.S. currency, and market participants
are watching the dollar's weak showing after the release Friday of
favorable U.S. unemployment figures.
   According to figures released by the U.S. Labor Department,
unemployment in the United States fell to a 14-year low of 5.4
percent in April as the demand for American exports fueled
employment prospects for industry workers.
   An exchange dealer at a major Tokyo commercial bank, who
requested anonymity, said market participants were taking a
``wait-and-see position'' Monday.
   Share prices opened higher in early trading, but fell as
investors decided to sit back, said Yoshio Shimoyama, a trader with
Nikko Securities.
   ``Trading slowed down about midmorning due to a lack of market
incentives after the holiday period,'' Shimoyama added.
   Japanese markets were closed Tuesday to Thursday for national
holidays.
   Share prices for heavy electricals like Hitachi and Toshiba, as
well as light electronics including Sony, fell in the morning
session. Also down were some automakers and precision equipment
makers such as Canon.

<HEAD>Malnutrition Still Serious Problem Among Chinese Youth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About one-third of Chinese youth suffer from
malnutrition despite overall gains made in height and weight in the
past decade, the official China Daily reported today.
   The report quoted State Education Commission Deputy Minister Zuo
Shiyin as saying that under standards of the World Health
Organization based on height-weight ratio, 28.98 percent of male
students and 36.16 percent of female students are undernourished.
The findings came from a two-year study of nearly 1 million Chinese
aged 7 to 22.
   The survey found that urban schoolboys have grown an average 1.2
inches and are 4.8 pounds heavier than they were 10 years ago. City
girls are one inch taller and 3.1 pounds heavier. Young people in
rural areas showed somewhat larger increases in both height and
weight.
   But the daily said the growth rates are still far below those of
Japanese students owing mainly to the gap in nutritional levels.

<HEAD>Strong Earthquakes Rock Japan and Philippines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Separate strong earthquakes rocked northern Japan
and the main Philippine island of Luzon today, swaying buildings
and trees but apparently not causing any serious injuries or
damage, officials said.
   The Japanese quake registered a preliminary 5.2 on the Richter
scale and was the second strong temblor to hit the northern island
of Hokkaido in less than three days, Central Meteorological Agency
officials said.
   They said it struck at 7:44 a.m. (6:44 p.m. Sunday) and was
centered in the Hidaka mountain range, 45 miles away from
Saturday's earthquake, which measured a preliminary 6.4 on the
scale. Local police said there were no immediate reports of damage
or casualties.
   The pre-dawn Philippine earthquake struck at 3:45 a.m. (3:55
p.m. Sunday) and registered a preliminary 5.4 Richter reading, the
Royal Observatory of Hong Kong said. The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology said it was centered 110 miles northwest
of Manila under the Luzon Sea.
   Earthquakes measuring 5 on the open-ended Richter scale are
classified as strong and capable of causing considerable damage in
populated areas. However, both quakes were located deep below the
earth's surface and therefore caused little damage, officials said.
   Both earthquakes also occurred in quake-prone areas where edges
of the earth's crustal plates are thought to rub together, a
Central Meteorological Agency official said.
   ``It's been some time since we had earthquake activity in that
area of Hokkaido, so it's not surprising to have some now caused by
a build-up of pressure between the plates,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The official said there was no way of knowing whether the
Japanese quake was related to the one in the Philippines, 2,250
miles away.
   The Philippine islands are thought to be located on the edge of
a separate, smaller crustal plate which extends up to southern
Japan.
   Institute spokesman Ulpiano Trillanes said the Philippine
earthquake affected a wide area of Luzon island, including Manila,
but apparently caused no serious damage or injuries.
   In the past 35 years there have been two major earthquakes in
Hokkaido. In 1968, the Tokachi-Oki earthquake measuring a 7.9 on
the Richter scale killed 52 people.
   The Richter scale measures the total magnitude of an earthquake.
Every increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold
increase in magnitude, thus a reading of 4.5 would be 10 times
stronger than one of 5.5.

<TEXT>
   Hunters killed 21 rare giant pandas in Pingwu
county of China's central Sichuan province during the past five
years, an official Chinese report said.
   China's domestic China News Service, in a report appearing today
in Hong Kong newspapers, also said courts punished 53 people for
the illegal activity.
   The report also noted that local courts in Sichuan recently
sentenced 27 people for hunting giant pandas and selling their
skin. Three of the criminals received life sentences and were
deprived of their political rights, it said.
   Pingwu is one of the few areas in southwest China where the
giant panda, an endangered specis and a national symbol, is found
in the wild.
   China's panda population, just under 1,000, has been declining
for the last five years because a rare flowering cycle of the arrow
bamboo, the animals' main food, has caused many of the plants to
die.

<HEAD>Crew: $2.5 Million Yacht Singled Out For Seizure Under Drug Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD W. SWINTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crew members on a $2.5 million yacht
seized under a U.S. drug policy called ``Zero Tolerance'' say the
Coast Guard unfairly targeted the craft and was thrilled to find
some marijuana seeds and stems.
   The 133-foot Ark Royal, a white fiberglass floating villa
trimmed with teakwood and polished brass, was escorted into port
Sunday night to be turned over to the government under the
month-old order to seize any vessel carrying even a tiny amount of
drugs.
   ``It's punishment for no just cause,'' said John Koch of San
Diego, one of the six crew members, which included one woman.
``It's just a lot of malarkey.''
   The Coast Guard cutter Tampa stopped the yacht Saturday in the
Yucatan Channel between Cuba and Mexico, and a search turned up
less than one-tenth of an ounce of marijuana, authorities said.
   ``They followed us for maybe one or two hours,'' Koch said.
``They didn't respond to any of our radio calls ... they didn't let
us out of their sight.''
   But Capt. Norman Saunders, commander of the Coast Guard Key West
station, said such searches are random, and the yacht was not
singled out as an example.
   ``We generally look at any northbound vessel going through that
area,'' Saunders said. ``The Yucatan Channel is a natural
bottleneck from the Caribbean to the Gulf of Mexico.''
   Coast Guard officials say the vessel initially was stopped for a
courtesy boarding to check paperwork and safety equipment, but a
full search was ordered after marijuana residue was found in a
trash can.
   ``They found five seeds in a trash can and they rooted through
the whole place,'' said a crew member, who gave his name only as
Roy. ``Ten seeds and a couple of stems are all they found.''
   Crew members say the Coast Guard party then came aboard with
saws and drills hoping to find more illegal drugs, but the yacht's
captain refused to allow any more searching until the ship reached
port.
   Koch said the yacht departed from San Diego more than a month
ago and was headed to Fort Lauderdale and then to the Mediterranean
for charters.
   ``It's the most beautiful boat I've ever seen,'' said Coast
Guard Ensign William Brewer, part of the search party. ``The inside
of it looks like something out of `The Great Gatsby.'''
   The yacht is decorated in art-deco style, and contains works of
art, a grand piano and two Jacuzzis, Brewer said.
   The Ark Royal's registered owner is Michael J. Rogerson,
president and chief shareholder of Tomima Corp., said Coast Guard
Lt. John Felker. Neither Rogerson nor any passengers were on board,
said Felker.
   The American Civil Liberties Union said the seizure was
excessive.
   It violates a sense of proportionality, said Mary Coombs, a
member of the ACLU Miami chapter. ``It's putting people at enormous
risk with no effective way of protecting themselves,'' she said.
   Boater Ken Seger said the Coast Guard is trying to seize private
vessels and sell them as a way of making up money it lost from its
recent $100 million budget cuts.
   But Key West charter boat captain Steve Knowles said he is
refusing anyone on his boat who intends to use drugs.
   ``It's fine if you want to do it, but not on my boat,'' he said.
``I don't want to lose my boat and lose my whole livelihood.''

<HEAD>U.S. Navy Explodes Mine In Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The following dispatch is from Robert Kearns of
Reuters, the press representative in the Pentagon news pool in the
Gulf.
   ABOARD THE USS COPELAND (AP) _ U.S. Navy divers have exploded a
mine found drifting in the northern Persian Gulf by the missile
frigate Simpson.
   The mine found Sunday was the first discovered in the area since
the U.S. missile frigate Samuel Roberts was nearly sunk by a mine
last month.
   Also Sunday, three motor boats raced toward a convoy of U.S.
ships, but veered off. A Navy official said they were probably
operated by smugglers.
   Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke, a Navy spokesman, told a Pentagon media
pool the Simpson reported the mine was 85 miles southwest of Farsi
Island, where the Iranians have a military base. Navy divers
detonated it an hour later.
   Van Dyke said the mine was an encrusted Myam-type mine that
apparently had broken loose from its mooring.
   The Myam is smaller than the type of mine containing 250 pounds
of explosives that holed the Roberts on April 14 off Qatar, 140
miles southeast of Farsi, wounding 10 crewmen.
   President Reagan has accused Iran of laying the mines to disrupt
gulf shipping. In retaliation for the Roberts mining, he ordered
attacks on Iranian oil platforms April 18.
   That led to a string of clashes between U.S. and Iranian ships.
The U.S. Navy claimed it sunk three Iranian warships and damaged
three others.
   A multi-national mine sweeping force has detonated at least six
mines since the Roberts was hit. French warships have reported
finding other mines further south in that period.
   The U.S. Navy, backed by the British, French, Belgians and
Italians, has dealt with scores of mines in or near the gulf since
last summer.
   Sunday's mine discovery came as shipping traffic picked up in
the waterway after a lull caused by last month's clashes.
   But the shipping community remains edgy. Tehran has sworn
revenge for its losses last month.
   Earlier Sunday, three fast-moving motor boats raced across the
Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the gulf, toward a U.S.-escorted
convoy.
   One darted under the Copeland's guns across the warship's bow.
That jarred already jittery nerves aboard the convoy ships as the
whaler-type boat sped past into the wake of the supply ship USS San
Jose and the oil tanker Ranger.
   All three unidentified boats then disappeared into the
sweltering haze, heading toward the Oman coast.
   The Copeland's captain, Cmdr. G.M. Ziller Jr., radioed a warning
to the apparently unarmed boats, but raised no response.
   Ziller said they may have been smugglers who decided to ignore
what he joked was the ``law of gross tonnage'' by zipping in front
of the heavily armed 3,600-ton frigate. ``I don't think there was
any hostile intent,'' he said.
   The convoy passed within range of Chinese-made Silkworm missiles
on the nearby Iranian coast.
   The pace of U.S.-escorted convoys has returned to what it was
before the April 18 fighting and Iranian navy ships have all but
disappeared.
   Four convoys have moved through the strait in the past week and
navy officials say the escort operations will continue as needed.
   Iran's 354-foot supply ship, Booshehr, glided within 2,500 yards
of the 3,700-ton missile frigate USS Jack Williams early Saturday.
   The two ships sailed past each other without incident in the the
closest encounter between the two navies since last month's battles.
   Some U.S. Navy officers believe the Iranians are licking their
wounds and deciding what went wrong before making the next move.
   ``I think they're doing what we would be doing in the same
situation,'' the skipper of the 24,000-ton San Jose, Capt. Willard
J. Halley, told the media pool Saturday.
   ``They're figuring out what happened to the chain of command and
who's responsible and what should be done about it.
   ``This could be a lull while they work on the next step,'' he
said, noting a long-standing split between the regular Iranian Navy
and the Revolutionary Guards who have attacked neutral shipping
with armed speedboats.
   Since the April 18 fighting, Reagan has laid down new rules for
U.S. warships patrolling the gulf, allowing them to help
non-American ships under attack if U.S. intervention is requested.
   The Navy has 28 warships in the region, including an aircraft
carrier-led task force stationed in the north Arabian Sea.

   Just because she'll be 12,000 miles
away at the time of her high school graduation, Susan Lynne
Harrison isn't stopping at anything to fulfill her duties as class
valedictorian.
   The 18-year-old senior from New York state's rural Chenango
County is planning to deliver her speech by phone to her 17
classmates next month. She'll be on the island of Tasmania, south
of Australia.
   ``We initially were just sitting talking with her before she
left fantasizing about what we might be able to do and then decided
we would do it,'' Assistant Superintendent Frederick Kirsch said of
Harrison, who's been an exchange student since February.
   Because of the time difference, Harrison will actually be
speaking at 4:30 a.m. the day after graduation. Mount Upton High
School officials aren't sure how much the phone call will cost.
   Harrison's mother, Janet, will accept her daughter's diploma at
graduation. The high school senior will return from Tasmania in
August, and she plan to enter Syracuse University to study
communications.
   Harrison's not taking any chances on missed connections,
officials said. She's mailing a tape of her speech ``just in case''
and is sending a written copy to be read by a classmate if all else
fails.

<HEAD>Latest In Funeral Coaches: Velvet Seats, Microwave Oven</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mourners wanting to getting their loved ones
to the cemetery in comfort may want to consider the latest in
funeral coaches: one with velvet seats and options like a stereo,
refrigerator and microwave oven.
   The Airstream Family Funeral Coach gets 9 to 12 miles per gallon
and eliminates traffic snarls resulting from caravans of mourners
traveling to the cemetery, according to its manufacturer.
   All this comfort and practicality doesn't come cheap, however.
Funeral home directors can expect to pay $52,000 to $73,000 for the
aluminum coaches.
   The 28-foot vehicle constructed from a motor home chassis can
carry 16 people up front and the dear departed in a separate
compartment toward the rear. The casket can be surrounded by
shelves of flowers and be bathed in spotlight.
   ``Some of the relatives may not have seen each other for 20
years,'' said Karl H. Croel, salesman for the Ohio-based Airstream.
``The time that they get a chance to talk together is when they're
together in the privacy of this coach.''
   Airstream displayed one of its coaches at a recent funeral
directors' meeting in Indianapolis.
   Needham-Storey Funeral Service, which has funeral homes in
Marion and Gas City, owns one: a strictly no-frills model lacking
many of Airstream's available amenities, such as lavatory.
   ``We were somewhat skeptical, but we still voted to go ahead and
buy it,'' said Steven Wampner, co-owner of Needham-Storey. ``We
knew, without a doubt, that it is the (funeral) vehicle of the

<HEAD>Atlanta Panda Visit Opposed by Wildlife Group</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 10 grafs to UPDATE with Toledo action; picks up
8th graf: `Block said China ...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Wildlife Fund, arguing that endangered
animals should not be used to boost zoo profits, plans to oppose a
scheduled visit by a touring pair of Chinese giant pandas to Zoo
Atlanta.
   The fund already has filed objections to panda visits at the
Toledo, Ohio, zoo and the Michigan State Fair in Detroit; however,
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which must approve the visits,
has approved the Toledo visit.
   The agency will not rule on Michigan's panda request until at
least June 6, said spokesman Dave Klinger in Washington.
   The fund contends that the exhibits would serve no scientific
purpose and that short-term loans inhibit panda breeding.
   A delegation from Toledo is in China to pick up the pandas and
is expected to return with the animals Friday, Toledo Zoo
spokeswoman Nancy Foley said.
   The Atlanta visit scheduled for September was arranged by former
President Jimmy Carter during a trip to China last year.
   Rich Block, the fund's director of public programs, said an
American law and an international agreement prohibit commercial
exploitation of endangered animals.
   Block, a former curator of education at Zoo Atlanta, said it was
painful for him to oppose the exhibit because he considers zoo
director Terry Maple ``a great proponent of conservation.''
   Zoo Atlanta officials said they are still preparing their
application.
   Klinger said the Toledo permit requires that China use loan
profits for panda conservation projects; Toledo Zoo officials
ensure the money is used for conservation; and the zoo reports
annually on how China used the money for conservation.
   Block said China typically gets $300,000 to $500,000 for a
three-month panda exhibit.
   None of the applications submitted thus far contains a provision
to use profits to help pandas, he said.
   ``I can see where panda exhibits could be a great boon to panda
conservation,'' Block said. ``If all the extra money realized from
a panda exhibit was returned to conservation, then that would mean
using that creature for its own protection and that would be fine.''

<HEAD>Teachers, Administrators Poised to Approve Power-Sharing Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A small school district plans to embark on an
experiment that will give teachers greater authority but also
greater accountability for producing well-educated children.
   If approved tonight by the school board and the eastern
Pennsylvania district's 400 teachers, the three-year contract
extension will give teachers a greater voice in student discipline
and promotion, budgets and school board meetings.
   If the teachers' new roles do not improve student performance,
the plan and most of the gains teachers stand to make will end with
the contract extension, said William Moloney, superintendent of the
Easton Area School District.
   ``If we find out that dictatorial governance works better, then
by God, we'll do it,'' Moloney said. ``But we believe that's not
true.''
   The idea, called ``shared governance,'' also calls for creation
of a labor-management panel to hear concerns about teacher
transfers, assignments or schedule changes, and a master teacher
panel to recognize superior teachers and to encourage them to
assist colleagues falling short of expectations.
   ``Shared governance says, `You are a professional and we're now
going to give you control over what you are entrusted to do,'' said
Jo Anne Bailey, a fifth-grade teacher and president-elect of the
teachers' union.
   The plan was proposed by Moloney and revised during eight months
of discussion with principals, teachers, union representatives and
school board members.
   The contract extension includes significant increases in
teachers' and principals' salaries beginning in 1990, Moloney said.
The average teacher salary in the district is about $28,400, but
the parties refused to provide specific figures on increases before
the vote.
   Known as an advocate for teachers, Moloney gained their trust
soon after arriving here in late 1984. In 1985, he won approval of
a five-year contract in a district where bitterness led to strikes
in 1976 and 1980.
   Moloney said much of the proposal was based on his
interpretations of recommendations made in the May 1986 Carnegie
Corporation task force report called `A Nation Prepared: Teachers
for the 21st Century.''
   Some of its recommendations have been tried in Rochester, N.Y.,
where Moloney was assistant superintendent before coming to Easton.
Large salaries for teachers and limited shared governance have made
Rochester a much-scrutinized laboratory for school reform, but
Moloney wanted to go further.
   The Easton proposal differs by forcing teachers and principals
to bet major contract provisions on plans scheduled to take effect
two years later.
   All participants _ the school board, teachers and principals _
can veto the plans, which include a new evaluation system for
teachers and administrators and a new program to recognize
outstanding teachers.
   If any provision fails to take effect as scheduled, the
principals forfeit their hefty salary increases and the teachers
lose their personnel committee for reviewing teacher transfers.
   ``This is serious carrot and stick stuff,'' Moloney said.
   The pact is part of Moloney's larger goal _ teaching the
district's 7,600 students to read and write, add and subtract.
   Moloney said his plan will mean nothing if it does not produce
better-educated children. ``The bottom line is demonstrably
improved outcome,'' Moloney said. ``The name of the game in
education reform is better outcomes.''

<HEAD>Dollar Firms Against Yen; Stocks Slide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed in dealings against the Japanese
yen today after opening lower in Tokyo, and stock prices continued
to slide due to a lack of market incentives, traders said.
   After opening at 124.73 yen, the dollar firmed in afternoon
trading to close the day at 124.87, down 0.01 yen from Friday's
close.
   ``The dollar is continuing to hover around the 124-125 yen range
of the past two weeks because of the absence of market-influencing
news,'' said a Mitsubishi Bank exchange dealer, who requested
anonymity.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 223.47 points, or 0.81 percent, closing the day's session at
27,264.30. The index declined 46.62 points during last Saturday's
half-day session.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at a thin 600 million
shares.
   Traders said investors were apparently reluctant to buy shares
due to the approach of a flurry of earnings reports by Japanese
companies in upcoming weeks, the U.S. Treasury's mid-quarterly
refunding due to start Tuesday, and next week's American trade
figures.
   Yoshio Shimoyama, a trader with Nikko Securities in Tokyo, said
trading picked up at the start of the week's dealings Monday
morning but fizzled out by midmorning as market investors sat back
to await fresh incentives.
   In thin afternoon dealings, steelmakers, shipbuilders and
automakers, such as Toyota and Honda, fell in price. Heavy and
light electricals, including Matsushita and Sony, also came under
selling pressure.

   John Demjanjuk will appeal his conviction and
death sentence for Nazi war crimes by next month and Israel's
Supreme Court will hear the case beginning Dec. 5, a court
spokesman said today.
   The spokesman, Shmaryahu Cohen, said in a telephone interview
that the Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, 68, has a June 10 deadline to
file the appeal, but that the retired Ohio autoworker's lawyers
could request an extension.
   The appeal will be heard by five justices for three consecutive
days, and then for another three days between Dec. 12 and 15, Cohen
said, adding that Israeli prosecutors are scheduled to reply from
Dec. 19 to Dec. 29.
   The court will convene at the Supreme Court building in
Jerusalem and provide simultaneous translations of the Hebrew
language proceedings into English and Ukrainian, Cohen said.
   Demjanjuk was sentenced to death on April 25, a week after being
found guilty of being a brutal guard named ``Ivan the Terrible,''
who operated gas chambers at the Treblinka Death Camp in Poland
where 850,000 Jews were killed in 1942-1943.
   Demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistaken identity and that he
was in two German prisoner-of-war camps during the period in
question.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in moderate European trading
early today, but traders predicted it would strengthen on
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.
Gold prices rose.
   One foreign currency dealer in Milan, Italy, said Friday's
figures showing the U.S. unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in
April, the lowest level in 14 years, has strengthened fears the
American economy is overheating.
   ``The unemployment figure sparked fears of renewed inflation,
forcing the Fed to act soon,'' to raise interest rates, she said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar slipped 0.01 yen to a closing 124.87. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 124.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.6815 West German marks, up from 1.6805
   _1.4000 Swiss francs, down from 1.4015
   _5.7155 French francs, down from 5.7230
   _1.8870 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8860
   _1,252.40 Italian lire, down from 1,254.00
   _1.2365 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2375
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8760, more expensive for
buyers than late Friday's $1.8730.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $443.25 a troy ounce, up
from late Friday's $442.10. It was little changed in quiet trading
at midmorning when the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $443.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $443.45, up from $443 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 79 cents to close at a bid
$446.66.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.37 a troy
ounce, up marginally from Friday's $6.36.

<HEAD>Kohl's Party Discusses Damage After Big Loss in State Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH JAUTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stunned leaders of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's governing Christian Democrats gathered today after their
party was ousted from power in state elections in
Schleswig-Holstein for the first time in 38 years.
   The party's top officials, led by Kohl, met in Bonn to assess
the damage done to the conservative Christian Democrats in the
Sunday elections in the northern West German state.
   The results marked one of the worst defeats for the governing
party since Kohl took office five years ago.
   The Schleswig-Holstein poll also was a decisive victory for the
opposition Social Democrats, who had lost ground in a string of
state elections over the past 18 months.
   While the Schleswig-Holstein election will have little immediate
effect on Kohl's coalition government in Bonn, it will boost the
Social Democrats' flagging morale nationwide.
   The results may also increase bickering with Kohl's often
fractious three-party federal coalition.
   The election will also narrow, but leave intact, the Christian
Democratic majority in the Bundesrat, or upper house of the West
German parliament.
   Unofficial results showed the Christian Democrats polled 33.3
percent of the vote, which was called to break the stalemate in the
state's government that followed an inconclusive election in
September 1987. In the September vote, the Christian Democrats had
polled 42.6 percent of the vote.
   The Social Democrats posted a surprising 54.8 percent of the
vote, well above the 45.2 percent it polled in September, according
to the unofficial figures.
   The results were the best-ever posted by the Social Democrats in
Schleswig-Holstein, and gave the party 46 of the 74 seats in the
state's parliament.
   The liberal Free Democratic party _ the junior party in Kohl's
governing coalition _ also posted decisive losses, falling from 5.2
percent of the vote in September to 4.4 percent Sunday.
   The loss was key because it means the Free Democrats failed to
win 5 percent of the vote, and are thus barred from taking any
parliamentary seats under West German law.
   The environmental Greens party also failed to win parliamentary
seats, posting just 2.9 percent of the vote, well below the 3.9
percent it won in September.
   Under West German voting procedures, it will be several days
before the results, based on reported returns from polling
stations, are verified and declared final.
   Political analysts say the Social Democratic majority assures
that the state governor's post will go to Bjoern Engholm, who led
the opposition party through what was a largely lackluster campaign.
   Engholm was the target of a political dirty tricks campaign last
year by former Christian Democratic governor Uwe Barschel.
   After the campaign came to light, Barschel was found dead in a
Geneva hotel in October, and authorities ruled the death an
apparent suicide.

<HEAD>Gdansk Shipyard Workers Reject Compromise Offer To End Strike</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with strikers rejecting managment offer
in informal voice vote at rally. TRIMS to tighten. No pickup.

<TEXT>
   Striking shipyard workers today rejected a
compromise that would have forced them to end their weeklong strike
and drop their demand for legalization of Solidarity in exchange
for a pay raise.
   ``There is no freedom without Solidarity,'' the workers chanted
at a rally this morning as they rejected the compromise offered by
management following a four-hour negotiating session with the
strike committee, union sources said.
   Piotr Konopka, an aide to Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, said
the 400 to 500 workers at the shipyard repeatedly screamed ``no''
when told of the offer.
   The tentative deal had taken shape in talks revived at the
initiative of a Politburo member on Sunday, strike leaders said.
Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, a ranking communist party
Politburo member, twice telephoned a lawyer acting as a mediator to
revive the talks after they broke down late Sunday afternoon,
according to accounts given by strike committee members.
   The conversations between Kiszczak and lawyer Wladyslaw
Sila-Nowicki, a former Solidarity member who has since agreed to
serve on Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's consultative
citizens' council, led to new talks.
   As a result, the strike committee wrote a letter to management
on Sunday in which it agreed to end the strike and postpone its
long-term goal of reinstating Solidarity under the following
conditions:
   _Guarantee of safe passage from the shipyard for strikers and
the people who have assisted them.
   _Promises of no discipliantry action against strikers, including
fines, dismissals or prosecutions.
   _A wage increase of $38 dollars on the average monthly wage of
the last three months, or about $105.
   _Formation of a joint committee from members of the strike
committee and the shipyard workers' council to oversee
implementation of the agreement.
   Management ultimately agreed to a raise of $39 monthly based on
the average wage in the third quarter of 1987, when wages were
somewhat lower, strike sources said. The average pay for that
quarter was not immediately available.
   In addition, strike sources said, there was a promise that fired
Solidarity activists would be rehired, but only if the shipyard was
short of manpower, and an oral promise that some unspecified
political prisoners would be freed.
   The number of strikers was only about half the 800-1,000
reported inside the yard Friday, according to Western reporters
there Sunday. Walesa has remained among the workers at the plant.
The strike began May 2.
   A settlement would have ended a two-week wave of labor unrest
which the government has said is threatening Poland's reputation
abroad and its economic reform plans at home. It has been Poland's
worst labor upheaval since the 1981 military crackdown the preceded
the outlawing of Solidarity.
   The union, born in the Gdansk shipyard in August 1980, was the
first independent trade union in the East bloc.
   Meanwhile, Poland's Roman Catholic primate, Cardinal Jozef
Glemp, spoke out Sunday for the right of all people to participate
in society's decisions. His sermon followed a statement Saturday by
Polish-born Pope John Paul II that strikes can be justified and
Poland lacked ``true democracy.''
   And 55 intellectuals and oppositionists charged in an open
letter that the government's policy of national reconciliation is a
``game of appearances.''
   On Sunday, management told workers inside the shipyard they
could face discipline or arrest if they did not leave by 6 p.m.,
said Konopka. The workers ignored the ultimatum.
   The government has never ruled out the use of force to end the
strike. A predawn raid by a police anti-terrorist unit and riot
police crushed a 10-day strike by steelworkers in Nowa Huta in
southern Poland on Thursday.
   On Sunday morning, at least 7,000 slogan-chanting people
attended a church service to support the workers on strike for a
seventh day.
   Thousands of police reappeared on the streets of this Baltic
port city to maintain order around St. Brygida's Church, where
worshippers rallied and heard a rousing speech by the Rev. Henryk
Jankowski, a friend and adviser of Walesa.
   Food supplies were choked off in a police blockade in place
since Thursday. Children as young as 8 and 10 have been sneaking
into the shipyard with a little food, notes and cigarettes, he said.
   In the wave of strikes that began April 25, workers have pressed
for higher wages to counteract inflation hitting 42 percent in the
first three months of 1988. Authorities have argued that some of
the strikes were instigated by ``professional politicians,''
especially leaders of Solidarity, who want to exploit Poland's
economic troubles for political ends.

<HEAD>Ambassador Denies Briefing Bush On Noriega Drug Deals</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto NY15</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former U.S. ambassador to
Panama denied telling Vice President George Bush as early as 1985
that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega may have been involved in drug
trafficking.
   The ambassador, Everett Ellis Briggs, said on Sunday there was
not enough evidence against Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler, at
that time.
   ``I could not have briefed the vice president on Noriega's
drug-running, drug-smuggling or money-laundering activities because
we simply did not have evidence of those activities at that time
and so any statement to the effect that I did brief him on such
matters at that time simply is not true,'' Briggs told a news
conference in Tegucigalpa.
   The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions that Briggs
had sent cables to the U.S. State Department about allegations of
Noriega's drug dealings, and that Briggs told Bush about the
substance of those cables during a meeting on Dec. 16, 1985.
   Bush, a Republican presidential candidate, has said he knew of
no clear evidence that Noriega was involved in drugs until February.
   Noriega commands Panama's Defense Forces and is the power behind
the civilian government in that nation. The general was indicted by
two federal grand juries in Florida on drug trafficking charges and
has rejected U.S. demands that he resign.
   Briggs was ambassador to Panama in 1985 and is now ambassador to
Honduras. He acknowledged that there were persistent reports about
Noriega and drug trafficking.
   ``Panamanian sources would come to us and say `Why do you have
dealings with this man when it is well known that he is a drug
smuggler?' and our answer always was `Provide us the evidence,' and
unfortunately during the time I was in Panama that evidence was not
forthcoming,'' he said.
   ``Now I am sorry it took so long for us to get the evidence,''
he said. ``I am sorry that we weren't able to get it sooner and I
am very, very glad that the evidence was available finally so that
Noriega could be indicted. I consider him probably the most
pernicious element in this hemisphere at this time.''
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Tegucigalpa read a partial
transcript of Briggs' news conference statements to The Associated
Press.
   The New York Times, quoting unidentified Reagan administration
officials, reported that a memo from Bush aides to the vice
president before his meeting with Briggs said the meeting was to
``discuss U.S. relations with Panama and narcotics matters.''
   Briggs said he did not have a written record of what he and Bush
discussed during their meeting, but he imagined it would have been
the slaying of Hugo Spadafora, a critic of Noriega, and the
circumstances leading to Noriega's ouster of elected President

   After the re-election of Socialist President
Francois Mitterrand, Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the extreme-right
National Front, claimed he is the real leader of the conservative
opposition.
   However, leaders of the moderate right said they would not
consider an alliance with the National Front. They blamed Le Pen
for the defeat of their candidate, Premier Jacques Chirac, in the
presidential runoff election.
   ``The fact that Jacques Chirac refused to accept in any manner
any concessions to the 4.4 million voters that I united condemned
him to failure,'' Le Pen said on national television on Sunday.
   The premier had made gestures during the campaign to Le Pen
supporters with statements about the dangers of immigration and the
need to preserve the French national identity, but he also said he
would not bargain for Le Pen's backing.
   Running on an anti-immigration platform, Le Pen won 14.4 percent
of the vote in first-round balloting April 24.
   Le Pen's party holds 33 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly.
   At a Paris rally on May 1, Le Pen told tens of thousands of
supporters not to vote for Mitterrand but he declined to endorse
Chirac.
   Le Pen, 59, said Sunday the French right is ``the stupidest
right in the world.''
   ``I call on all the French, particularly those who supported the
anti-Socialist candidate, to organize with us and with the National
Front the unification of the French people to assure the identity,
the survival, the greatness of our country, France,'' Le Pen said.
   Moderate rightists reacted angrily.
   ``It is the National Front which, to a great extent, allowed Mr.
Mitterrand's victory,'' said Jean Lecanuet, president of the
centrist Union for French Democracy that has been part of Chirac's
governing coalition.
   Social Affairs Minister Philippe Seguin rejected any alliance
between the conservatives and extreme right.
   ``There will never be a political accord,'' he said. ``We will
continue the path which has always been ours, that is to say, there
will never be a national accord with the Front.''
   ``A defeat for the Socialists is not possible without an
alliance with the National Front,'' said the front's
secretary-general, Jean-Pierre Stirbois. ``This alliance will show
itself in municipal elections next spring in dozens of large
cities.''

   In scattered violence during the
French presidential election, a bus driver was shot and wounded
while driving people to the polls and police dispersed Melanesian
separatists blocking a street.
   In another development, authorities said funerals were held
peacefully on Sunday on the island of Ouvea in this French Pacific
territory for Melanesian separatist kidnappers killed when police
freed their hostages.
   In Paris, the main Melanesian separatist group, the Kanak
Socialist National Liberation Front, hailed the re-election of
President Francois Mitterrand on Sunday. Djim Ouenei, the group's
representative, said the Kanak people, as native Melanesians are
known, were renewing their proposal to negotiate ``to get out of
this colonialist mess.''
   Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac won a record number of votes
in New Caledonia, 90.3 percent, while Socialist Mitterrand took the
rest. But in France, Mitterrand roundly defeated Chirac.
   Native Melanesians make up 43 percent of the inhabitants of New
Caledonia, colonized by France in 1853. Thirty-six percent are of
European descent and the others are Asians and Polynesians.
   Many Melanesians want independence, but but a majority of the
Europeans and others wish to remain part of France.
   Police in the capital of Noumea said the bus driver was hit in
the legs by buckshot Sunday afternoon as he drove 15 Melanesians to
a polling station in Pouembout, on the west coast of the main
island and 150 miles north of Noumea. No other injuries were
reported.
   In the town of Yate on the south end of the main island, police
used tear gas to disperse a crowd of separatists who erected a
barricade.
   The French High Commissioner reported that 14 of 128 polling
stations were moved ``for reasons of public order.''
   Voter turnout on the archipelego was 61.69 percent, up from 59
percent in the first round of balloting two weeks ago in which
Chirac also took the lion's share of the votes.
   The conservative Rally for the Republic in Caledonia, a local
spinoff of Chirac's Rally for the Republic party, controls the
regional government.
   Separatists boycotted and attempted to disrupt the first round
on April 24, but promised last week not to take similar action this
time.
   On April 22, separatists stormed a police station on the island
of Ouvea, northeast of New Caledonia's main island, killed four
gendarmes and abducted others. A second group of gendarmes was
abducted several days later.
   On Thursday, police stormed the cave where the 23 hostages were
being held and killed 19 of the kidnappers. Two members of the
French military assault team also were killed and five people were
wounded.

   Danes vote in a parliamentary
election Tuesday that will serve as a referendum on this nation's
future in the NATO alliance.
   Prime Minister Poul Schlueter called for the elections just
eight months after the last vote because the socialist-dominated
parliament ignored his objections and passed a resolution
toughening Denmark's non-nuclear status.
   Under parliament's resolution, Denmark must notify each visiting
warship that nuclear arms are barred from Danish ports in peacetime.
   That has been the Danish stand for 31 years, but until now it
has been merely a general statement of policy.
   NATO said such a resolution would undermine the unity of the
Western alliance and could threaten the ability of the United
States and Britain to protect Denmark in an emergency.
   Schlueter, leader of the minority center-right government,
called for new elections rather than implement the resolution.
   The opposition campaign has taken on an anti-American tint,
centered around the slogan: ``Denmark decides for itself.''
   ``If there are two people agreeing on Danish politics, it's
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher,'' says an election poster
depicting the U.S. president and the British prime minister in an
embrace.
   ``Forty-three years ago Denmark again became part of the free
world,'' counters a poster for the Liberal Party, a member of
Schueter's four-party center-right alliance.
   Polls indicate that most Danes agree with the traditional
anti-nuclear position. One recent survey said 82 percent of those
asked favored a nuclear-free zone in Scandinavia, and 46 percent
said they would support the idea even if it meant Denmark's
expulsion from NATO.
   Early polls indicate that neither the conservative-led
government nor the socialist opposition may emerge as a clear
winner on Tuesday, and Denmark could once again be governed by an
unwieldy minority coalition.
   Surveys trying to forecast Tuesday's outcome have been
inconclusive, but several have shown modest gains for the
opposition partnership of the Social Democrats and the Socialist
People's Party.
   In last September's election, Schlueter's coalition won 70 seats
in the 179-member Folketing, and the socialist bloc took 81 seats.
Each side also had two more supporters from the autonomous
territories of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
   The balance of power is held by the 11-seat Social-Liberal
Party, which usually supports the government's economic policies
and the opposition's foreign and defense policies.
   The anti-tax Progress Party, with 9 seats, and the far-left
Common Course Party, with 4 seats, make up the balance.
   The shape of the next government could be determined by Niels
Helveg Petersen, the Social-Liberal leader, who could even make a
bid to become prime minister in the event of a deadlock between the
two traditional blocs.
   Three other parties are contesting the election, but none is
expected to pass the minimum of 2 percent of the votes cast needed
to gain a seat.
   Polls open at 9 a.m. for the 3.9 million eligible voters.
Results should be known shortly after they close at 8 p.m.
   Schlueter argues that the anti-nuclear resolution could lead to
a refusal by allied ships to pull into Danish ports. ``It would be
totally devastating for Denmark's defense,'' he told a news
conference Thursday.
   ``We will not accept a resolution that brings our full
membership of NATO into doubt,'' added Foreign Minister Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, the Liberal Party leader.
   If the resolution is allowed to stand and visiting ships are
given a letter, ``the next step would be to ask for an
acknowledgement of that letter, the next step would be to demand
guarantees, and the next step would be the right to inspection,''
he said on Friday.

   Shiite Moslem militias battled for
control of high-rise buildings in the south Beirut slums today, and
gunfights were reported inside a hospital. Police said 40 people
were killed and 105 injured.
   The fighting was in its fourth straight day, with both sides
using tanks, mortars and rockets.
   Today's casualties brought the overall toll to 129 dead and 322
wounded since the fighting began Friday between the Syrian-armed
Amal militia and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Most of the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon are believed held in
the labyrinthine slums.
   The fighting flared after two weekend cease-fires collapsed in
the battle for control of slums that stretch for 16 square miles
along Beirut's southern edge. The clashes began when four Amal men
were killed in a street ambush and Amal blamed Hezbollah.
   Gunbattles flared in the al-Sahel hospital, where a doctor said
militiamen forced surgeons to operate at gunpoint on dead comrades
``to bring them to life.''
   One doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said rival
gunmen had shot it out inside the hospital.
   ``We've been forced many times to abandon casualties because of
gunfights in the emergency ward,'' she said.
   Doctors confirmed allegations by both sides that wounded
fighters have been dragged from ambulances and hospitals by their
rivals and slaughtered.
   Amal, Syria's main ally in Lebanon, and the Hezbollah fighters,
who are loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran, have long
been bitter foes in a struggle for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million
Shiites, the country's largest single sect.
   Police said Hezbollah fighters, wearing red headbands, appeared
to have gained considerable ground in the densely populated
Ghobeiri, Bir el-Abed, Hay Madi and Meshrafieh neighborhoods.
   Much of the fighting centered on high-rise buildings used by
both sides as strongpoints and sniper nests.
   The fundamentalist Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella
group for Shiites holding most of the kidnapped foreigners in
Lebanon. There has been no word on the captives' fate since the
fighting broke out.
   ``God willing, we will liberate Hay Madi and Bir el-Abed and
free all the foreign hostages,'' said Amal fighter Tarek Saad as he
trained his shoulder-fired rocket launcher at Hezbollah positions
in Hay Madi. ``We know they're imprisoned there.''
   Thunderous shell blasts shook Beirut all night as both sides
mounted grenade-throwing forays against each other's strongpoints
behind barrages of fire from tanks, mortars and multi-barreled
rocket launchers.
   Amal's irregulars, with green or black headbands, control most
of the districts of Haret Hreik, Mreiji, Roweiss, Shiyah and
Kasskass, a police spokesman said. He cannot be named under
standing regulations.
   ``Hezbollah has established control over half of the slums. It
only controlled one-third before the current fighting,'' the
spokesman said.
   A cease-fire at midnight Saturday broke down after 16 hours.
Syrian and Iranian mediators called another cease-fire for 10:30
p.m. Sunday. But the fighting raged on and intensified after
midnight.
   The newspaper As-Safir said the current confrontation has set
the stage for the Syrian army to move into the slums to disarm the
two militias.
   Syria's military intelligence chief in Lebanon, Brig. Gen. Ghazi
Kenaan, met with leaders of both warring factions as well as
government and religious figures today.
   Syria deployed 7,500 troops in Moslem west Beirut in February
1987 to end militia warfare in the capital. It has not sent its
forces into the southern slums, a traditional Hezbollah stronghold.

<TEXT>
   First lady Nancy Reagan prevented President
Reagan from speaking out at the height of the Iran-Contra affair
because her astrologer told her the time was not right to go out in
public, former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan said
today.
   ``The president was practically immobile during that period of
December 1986, January and February of '87, all because the first
lady was saying no, no, no he can't go out,'' Regan said on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' program.
   ``Now she used as an excuse the fact that he had a minor
operation right after the Christmas holidays. But I said, `No, this
president is going to get shot down in flames. He's not out talking
to the people about Iran-Contra. He should be making his own case.'
But he didn't.''
   In his book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington,''
which went on sale today, Regan said he believes the president's
contention that he knew nothing of the Iran-Contra affair, in which
proceeds from secret U.S. arms sales to Iran were diverted to the
Nicaraguan rebels, until told about it by Attorney General Edwin
Meese III on Nov. 25, 1986.
   ``The president ... is a ruddy man, with bright red cheeks. He
blanched when he heard Meese's words. The color drained from his
face, leaving his skin pasty white. ... Nobody who saw the
president's reaction that afternoon could believe for a moment that
he knew about the diversion of funds before Meese told him about
it. He was the picture of a man to whom the inconceivable had
happened,'' Regan wrote.
   He said that he urged the president to conteract the effects of
the Iran-Contra affair by undertaking an active speaking schedule
outside Washington, but was balked by astrological advice to the
first lady that ``harm would come to Reagan if he went out of the
White House.''
   ``By humoring her, we had given her control,'' he said of Mrs.
Reagan.
   Regan, in his memoir, portrayed the president as a hesitant and
unassertive chief executive controlled by a wife who relied heavily
upon the predictions of an astrologer.
   Former press secretary Larry Speakes, who also wrote a ``kiss
and tell'' book about his years in the White House, said today he
was not aware of the first lady's reliance on astrology.
   ``I didn't see it and had no evidence of it,'' Speakes said on
CBS's ``This Morning'' show. ``I've got no reason to doubt. But I
never saw any crystal balls in the Cabinet Room. From time to time,
strange people did come into the White House. But I didn't know
that they were astrologers, if they were.''
   The White House issued a brief statement about the book on
Sunday that said: ``Vindictiveness and revenge are not admirable
qualities, and are not worthy of comment. Donald Regan's attempts
to defame the first lady, on Mother's Day no less, are certainly in
that category.''
   Asked about the White House statement, Regan responded: ``They
ought to know it when they see it.''

   Sikhs inside the Golden Temple opened
fire today on nearby government security posts, police said,
setting off a gun battle in which two civilians died and five
paramilitary troops were injured.
   The Sikh extremists began firing automatic rifles at 1:15 p.m.,
and the troops returned fire with light machine guns, according to
police superintendent Baldev Singh. The fighting continued for at
least three hours.
   Singh said it was not known if any militants where killed or
injured in the exchange.
   The civilians killed in the crossfire outside the Golden Temple
complex were identified by police as Venod Kumar, 30, a Hindu who
worked with the Red Cross, and Dilip Kaur, an 80-year-old Sikh.
   Among the injured was the deputy inspector general of the
paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force, S.S. Virk. He was out of
danger after surgery for a bullet wound on his chin, the United
News of India said.
   Virk and other senior paramilitary officers had gone to
government security posts on rooftops near the shrine to look at a
bunker Sikh militants were building at the western end of the
Golden Temple complex.
   Police said the militants opened fire from at least 16 sites in
the temple complex, mainly with Chinese-made AK-47 automatic rifles.
   The troops returned fire with light machine guns, according to
Singh.
   Shops and businesses in bazaars around the Golden Temple closed
their shutters, and an indefinite curfew was imposed on the old,
walled, central part of Amritsar to keep civilians indoors.
   More than 1,000 police and paramilitary troops were rushed to
the temple to seal exits and prevent people from entering.
   Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1982
for more political autonomy or an independent homeland for Sikhs in
Punjab. The Golden Temple is Sikhism's holiest shrine.
   In June 1984, the Indian army stormed the Golden Temple to drive
out militants, and more than 1,200 people were killed. Later that
year, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two Sikh
bodguards in revenge for the raid, setting off anti-Sikh rioting in
which 2,000 people died.
   The gun battle today was the worst in a series that began
shortly after Jasbir Singh Rode was restored as the temple's chief
priest in early March. Rode had been in custody under the
government's anti-terrorism rules, but was freed in an effort by
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to placate the extremists and lure them
into negotiations.
   Since Rode's return, there have been persistent reports that the
militants have been building bunkers and firing ports in the temple
complex.
   The militants fired on police outside the temple last week when
security forces tried to arrest a Sikh militant as he was heading
for the shrine. The militant escaped and fled into the temple, but
he was believed wounded.
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million population but are a majority in
Punjab.
   Meanwhile, five more people were reported killed by Sikh
extremists in overnight attacks in Punjab, the United News of India
reported. The slayings followed an attack by the radicals in
neighboring Haryana on Saturday in which 13 Hindus were killed
during a wedding party.
   The latest killings raised to about 940 the number of deaths
blamed on the Sikh separatists this year.
   The rate of killings is more than twice that of 1987, when 1,000
people were killed by Sikh extremists. Most victims have been
Hindus or moderate Sikhs in Punjab.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that an
Arab-American accused of inciting riots in the occupied lands must
stay in jail until his deportation hearing in two weeks.
   Also today, Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian during
rioting in the occupied West Bank.
   Israeli officials say Mubarak Awad, 44, helped promote the
5-month-old Arab uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least
185 Arabs and two Israelis have been killed there since Dec. 8.
   The three-judge panel today set Awad's deportation hearing for
May 23, accepting a statement from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
that Awad's release would endanger national security.
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner denied an Israel radio report that
the prime minister received a message from Secretary of State
George P. Shultz objecting to Awad's treatment.
   The judges today also turned down the prosecution's request to
deport Awad immediately and hear his appeal in his absence.
   Prosecutor Nili Arad presented an affadavit that accused Awad of
``taking part in the publication of leaflets which issued ... a
call for violent and hostile actions against the state by residents
of the (occupied) territories.''
   Arad said that if the court released Awad, he would continue
these activities until his trial began.
   The court turned down an offer by Awad's lawyers, Jonathan
Kuttab and Avraham Gal, to free their client in return for a
promise that he would not speak out publicly and would pay for a
police guard to supervise him.
   Awad's American wife, Nancy Nye, told reporters after today's
hearing, ``I learned a long time ago not to be optimistic or
pessimistic but to see what happens.'' She has denied her husband
wrote a leaflet inciting violence.
   Awad, born in Jerusalem, left for the United States in 1968 but
returned in 1985. He founded the Palestinian Center for the Study
of Non-Violence.
   Earlier today, he blew kisses to supporters as he entered the
courthouse for the hearing. During a recess, he told reporters he
was in the fourth day of a hunger strike.
   ``I feel good. I'm still fasting, but I started to drink water.
I still believe in Israeli law and Israeli justice and I hope I
won't be disappointed,'' he said.
   At the Deheishe refugee camp near Bethlehem in the occupied West
Bank, meanwhile, a man was fatally shot in the head today when
soldiers opened fire on rock-throwing Palestinians, hospital
officials and Arab witnesses said. The victim was identified as
Ibrahim Mohammed Haniyah, 34.
   Troops fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition at
dozens of Arabs who hurled rocks at soldiers and Israeli cars, said
Deheishe resident Saed Rasi. Israel radio said three Arabs were
wounded. The army said it was checking the reports.
   In Arab east Jerusalem and the occupied territories, business
was virtually shut down by the latest of dozens of general strikes
called by Palestinian uprising's organizers.
   On Sunday, Palestinian leaders called on Arabs in the Gaza Strip
to defy an order by the Israeli government requiring more than
300,000 residents to exchange their Israeli-issued identity cards
for new documents.
   Palestinians alleged the order was intended to break an Arab tax
boycott because only those who paid all taxes would be eligible for
new cards. Israeli military sources denied this.
   Also Sunday, a masked assailant fatally shot a Palestinian woman
in front of her children in the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin,
the Israeli news agency Itim reported. Arab sources said Amne Ahmed
Ali, 45, was suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities.

   Police arrested 60 people after a group of
dissidents met to form a democratic alternative to the Communist
Party, a spokesman for the group said. He said 14 people remained
jailed today.
   The arrests were made Sunday at one of three locations in Moscow
where the dissident group was holding organizational meetings, said
Yuri Mitiunov, one of the organizers of the group, the Democratic
Union.
   Mitiunov said police came to one location and detained 60
participants. Forty were released shortly after their arrests, he
said, and 20 were held overnight. Six were released this morning,
he said.
   About 148 people attended the group's initial meeting on
Saturday to form the political organization, then broke into the
smaller groups on Sunday.
   Mitiunov told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that
the dissidents jailed are all from outside Moscow.
   ``Those jailed were ordered to leave Moscow and refused,''
Mitiunov said. ``Under our law it is legal for visitors to be here
three days and they had not been here that long so they had a right
to remain.''
   At the village of Kratovo outside Moscow, where another meeting
was to be held today, ``the house was encircled by militia,'' said
Tamara Grigoryants.
   ``The commanding officer of the militia said that under no
circumstances would he allow the meeting to take place,'' she said.
   Yevgeniya Debryanskaya, who played host at the meeting where the
arrests took place, said Sunday that the fledgling party drafted
principles calling for a multi-party democracy, a new constitution,
an independent trade union and the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers
from Eastern Europe, the western Ukraine and the Baltic states.
   While Democratic Union members met, editors of 30 unofficial
journals challenging the government monopoly on publishing gathered
separately in Moscow to form an organization called the Independent
Publications Club.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishop Condemns IRA at Airman's Funeral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINSFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic bishop today condemned
the ``murderous tactics'' of the Irish Republican Army in his
eulogy for a British airman slain in the Netherlands.
   The Rt. Rev. Joseph Grey, bishop of Shrewsbury, said at the
requiem Mass for 20-year-old Senior Aircraftman Ian Shinner that
there could be no justification for his killing.
   Shinner died in a spray of IRA bullets while sitting in a car
with two other British airmen outside a pub in the Dutch town of
Roermond on May 1. An hour later, two more enlisted men were killed
by an IRA car bomb at Nieuw Bergen 35 miles away.
   Among today's mourners in St. Joseph's Church in Shinner's
eastern England hometown were 35 colleagues from his West
German-based regiment. They included Richard Grant, a 22-year-old
airman who survived the gunfire that killed Shinner.
   ``This young man's life was taken in such a horrifying fashion,
for which really no justification can be found,'' Grey told
mourners. ``No cause can justify the employment of such murderous
tactics.''
   A Royal Air Force squad fired three shots over Shinner's coffin
as he was buried with full military honors. His regimental cap and
the Union Jack flag which had draped his coffin were handed to his
brother Neil, an 18-year-old soldier in the British army.
   Funerals for the airmen killed in the car bombing, John Miller
Reid and John Baxter, both 21, were held Saturday in Scotland.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army is waging a guerrilla
campaign to oust the British from Northern Ireland and unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Catholic Irish
Republic.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today met privately
with President Julio Sanguinetti, the agnostic leader of this
nominally Roman Catholic but highly secularized country.
   The pope, bundled up against a 45-degree chill on a foggy South
American fall morning, rode in a bulletproof limousine to the
75-year-old French baroque-style presidential residence in the
Prado district, once the capital's most elegant but now a bit
run-down.
   Aides say John Paul has been buoyed by the official reception he
has received in tiny Uruguay, population 3 million, which is
considered the most secular country in South America. It maintains
strict separation of church and state and calls Christmas
``Families Day'' to avoid religious connotations.
   The pontiff, who is on the last day of his visit to Uruguay,
today was to travel to the orange-growing city of Salto on the
northwestern border with Argentina. He is then to fly to La Paz,
the 2{-mile-high capital of Bolivia, the next country on his
12-day, four-nation pilgrimage.
   Since arriving in Uruguay on Friday, the pope has taken on one
of the most difficult issues in Latin America: how to spread the
wealth controlled by a few.
   In a stop Sunday in Uruguay's gaucho (cowboy) country, John Paul
came up against the contrasts that have bedeviled governments for
generations throughout much of Latin America.
   Herds of cattle grazed peacefully on large estates outside Melo,
a northeastern city of 40,000 near the Brazilian frontier that
church officials say is one of the poorest regions in Uruguay.
   Speaking to a crowd of 50,000 gathered on a dirt field, John
Paul said he was directing an appeal to ``all Catholic faithful and
all Uruguayans of good will.''
   ``Those who own land and other categories of wealth must take
into account that there is a social mortgage on all private
property,'' John Paul said in Spanish, explaining that this meant
the property must be used for the good of the entire community.
   He cited church documents that wealth should be used to create
jobs and that farmworkers should be paid enough to prevent the
swelling of migrations to the cities. Nearly half of Uruguay's 3
million residents live in this capital beside the River Plate.
   The pope also spoke out strongly for union rights, saying that
those who sought to better the conditions of workers deserve
``unconditional support.''
   Vatican officials say they have been delighted at the turnout of
government officials at papal events and by the local media's
coverage of the visit. President Julio Sanguinetti, an agnostic,
flew to Melo for the papal stopover.
   The church says 80 percent of the country is Roman Catholic but
only about 5 percent attend Mass regularly in Montevideo. Divorce
has been legal since 1907, separation of church and state is
mandated by law, and teaching religion is banned in public schools.
   A Vatican official, briefing reporters on grounds of anonymity,
noted that two Cabinet ministers have attended each event, in
Montevideo, Melo and Florida. ``We hope this is the start of a new
climate,'' the official said.
   The pope's tour is his ninth to Latin America in his
nine-year-old papacy, reflecting the Vatican's interest in the
region.
   Latin America is expected to contain half the world's Roman
Catholics by the end of the century. There are an estimated 860
million Roman Catholics now in the world.
   After Uruguay and five days in landlocked Bolivia, the
67-year-old pope will visit Peru and Paraguay before returning to
Rome on May 19.

   ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' a lavish stage
version of the horror film about a singer and the mysterious figure
who pursues her, and ``Into the Woods,'' Stephen Sondheim's
collection of fairy tales without fairy-tale endings vie for the
Drama Desk award as best musical.
   In fact, ``Phantom'' and ``Into The Woods'' were the only
nominees in the category, according to Sunday's announcement by the
association of drama critics, reporters and editors.
   ``Into The Woods'' led the musical division with 13 nominations.
Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and the Lincoln
Center revival of Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes'' each received 11
nominations.
   ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' August Wilson's look at black
life in the early part of the century, topped nominations in the
play category with seven.
   Awards will be announced May 25 and presented June 2.
   Broadway's most prominent newcomer, the singer-actress Madonna,
did not get a nomination, but her two ``Speed-The-Plow'' costars
did. The David Mamet play premiered last week.
   For the first time in many seasons, none of the 22 categories
was eliminated, but some categories had a small field. James
Lapine, for ``Into the Woods,'' is the only nominee for best book
of a musical.
   For outstanding new play, ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' ``M.
Butterfly'' by David Henry Hwang and ``Speed-the-Plow'' were
nominated from Broadway and ``Boys' Life'' by Howard Korder, ``The
Road to Mecca'' by Athol Fugard and ``Woman in Mind'' by Alan
Ayckbourn were nominated from off-Broadway.
   Actors nominated from musicals were David Carroll for ``Chess,''
Michael Crawford for ``Phantom,'' Joel Grey for ``Cabaret,'' Howard
McGillin for ``Anything Goes'' and George Merritt for the
off-Broadway ``Lost in the Stars.''
   Musical actresses nominated were Sarah Brightman of ``Phantom,''
Judy Kuhn of ``Chess,'' Patti LuPone of ``Anything Goes,'' and
Bernadette Peters of ``Into the Woods.''
   Actors nominated were Derek Jacobi for ``Breaking the Code,''
Delroy Lindo for ``Joe Turner,'' John Lithgow for ``M. Butterfly,''
John Malkovich for ``Burn This'' and Joe Mantegna and Ron Silver
for ``Speed-the-Plow,'' all Broadway performances.
   All the actresses nominated, except Glenda Jackson for her role
as Lady Macbeth, were off-Broadway performances. Other nominees
were Kathy Bates for ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,''
Stockard Channing for ``Woman in Mind,'' Amy Irving for ``Road to
Mecca,'' E. Katherine Kerr for ``Laughing Wild'' and Gordana
Rashovich for ``A Shayna Maidel.''
   The Drama Desk added an outstanding ensemble acting category
this year for the second time in its 39-year history. The three
off-Broadway casts nominated opened in ``Boys' Life,'' ``The Day
Room'' and ``Oil City Symphony.''

<HEAD>Jury Back for Sixth Day in Sentencing Convicted Killer of Alday
Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After getting a replacement for a juror
described as ``incoherent,'' the jury returned to court today for a
sixth day of deliberations on whether Wayne Carl Coleman should die
for his part in the six 1973 slayings of the Alday family.
   Superior Court Judge Hugh Lawson on Sunday morning excused a
juror and replaced her with one of three remaining alternates. At
3:30 p.m., he sent the jurors back to their hotel with instructions
to return today.
   The jury met briefly with Lawson this morning before resuming
its talks.
   Defense attorney Tom West moved again Sunday for Lawson to
declare the jury deadlocked. That would bring Coleman an automatic
life sentence.
   Coleman was one of three men originally convicted and sentenced
to die for the 1973 slayings of six members of the Ned Alday family
in Seminole County. The verdicts were thrown out in 1985 by a
federal appeals court which cited pretrial publicity.
   The juror who was excused did not accompany the other jurors to
the DeKalb County Courthouse Sunday morning. She arrived separately
and then testified before Lawson.
   Much of her testimony was inaudible. Several times, she said,
``They put a bug in my ear. Remember Mary Alday.''
   Mary Alday was raped and killed in a field near the mobile home
where her husband, Jerry Alday, and four other Alday men were
killed on May 14, 1973.
   A deputy assigned to watch the sequestered jurors testified the
juror ``was mumbling nonsense. She was not coherent. She is not
physically or mentally capable to continue.''
   The deputy said the woman could be made to return to the jury
only by force.
   The jury last Monday convicted Coleman of six counts of murder.
On Wednesday, the jurors began deliberating whether he should be
sentenced to death or life in prison.
   The woman replaced Sunday was the second juror to be replaced by
one of the four alternates.
   West said Sunday he believes the case may now be the longest
penalty deliberation in recent Georgia history. Lawson has given no
indication when he might halt deliberations. On Saturday, he gave
the jurors a second set of instructions and told them he wants them
to reach a decision.
   One of the other two men originally sentenced to death, Carl
Isaacs, was convicted a second time in January and again condemned
to die. The third defendant, George Elder Dungee, is to be retried
later in Columbus.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson spent the night at the home
of an unemployed coal miner, then declared at a rally today that
his message of economic equality is crossing racial lines in the
nation's depressed areas.
   Democratic rival Michael Dukakis and Republican George Bush took
a break from the rigors of the presidential race by tending to
business at home today, one day before West Virginia, along with
Nebraska, has its primary.
   Jackson, who spent Sunday night at the home of Junior and Becky
Cook, said that in the poorer sections of West Virginia his message
is well-received _ even in a town such as all-white Arnett.
   ``They have their race, but they don't jobs,'' Jackson said.
``They have their race, but they don't have health insurance. They
have their race, but they don't have hot and cold running water.
   ``Their race does not address those needs.''
   The town of Arnett has only 300 residents, but more than 500
people showed up to greet Jackson when he arrived at the Cook home
Sunday night.
   ``The overwhelming number ... were very favorable and very
supportive,'' Jackson said, though Becky Cook said some ``made some
smurky remarks.''
   Jackson said of the detractors, ``We have to displace people's
fears with security and give them assurances they've never had
before.''
   On Sunday, speaking at Tri-State Airport near Huntington and
later at a rally in Beckley, Jackson criticized both Bush and
President Reagan, asking, ``What is Reaganomics but reverse Robin
Hood? What is Reaganomics but union-busting?''
   Jackson also reacted to reports that Bush was briefed three
years ago about a Panamanian drug connection. The Democratic
candidate said, ``The reason Mr. Bush has not led the charge to
fight drugs is because he knew of the administration's dealings
with the drug dealers.''
   He called Bush's alleged knowledge of contacts between
Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega and drug dealers
``intolerable.''
   Meanwhile, however, in Honduras, the former U.S. ambassador to
Panama, Everett Ellis Briggs, denied telling Bush as early as 1985
that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega may have been involved in drug
trafficking.
   The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions that Briggs
had sent cables to the State Department about allegations of
Noriega's drug dealings, and that Briggs had told Bush the
substance of those cables on Dec. 16, 1985.
   Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner, and Bush, who has the GOP
nomination locked up, were taking today off from campaigning, with
Dukakis back home in Massachusetts and Bush in Washington.
   In Beckley, an obviously weary Jackson occasionally stumbled
over his words. Even so, he managed repeatedly to bring the crowd
to its feet _ despite a two-hour wait for the candidate.
   A town heavily dependent on the coal industry, Beckley is the
site of some of West Virginia's worst economic conditions, and
Jackson referred to that situation in attacking Reaganomics.
   ``Profits are up, wages are down. Plants are closed, mines are
closed _ and workers are abandoned,'' Jackson said.
   He attacked ``absentee coal mine companies,'' which he said
``drain the coal and drain the coal miner, strip the soil and strip
the people, then leave you abandoned.''
   He advocated a Pan-American Energy Alliance to coordinate
policies for oil from Canada, the United States and Central
America, coal from Appalachia, and hydro and solar power.
   Jackson ended his Beckley speech by citing President Franklin
Roosevelt, who he noted used a wheelchair. Jackson then climbed
through the crowd to greet a disabled woman, Jan Lilly of
Huntington, who had listened to his speech while sitting in a
wheelchair.

   An American naturalist said today he was
``very lucky'' to survive an attack by a rhinoceros that charged
and badly wounded him while he was working in the jungle with his
5-year-old son.
   David Smith, 46, of St. Paul, Minn., was attacked Saturday while
on a research outing with his son Alex and local hunters.
   He told The Associated Press he hoped to return to his work soon
in southern Nepal. ``I was very lucky ... it (the rhinoceros) did
not open my abdominal cavity,'' he said. ``I hope to be out of the
hospital in a couple of weeks' time.''
   The University of Minnesota researcher was taken to the hospital
in Patan, south of Katmandu, by army helicopter.
   His wife, Francie Cuthbert-Smith, a bird specialist at the
University of Minnesota, said of her husband plans to return to
work: ``He is always happiest when he works in the Chitwan
jungles.''
   Smith set up camp at Sauraha village, near the Royal Chitwan
National Park, 75 miles southwest of Katmandu, early last month.
His wife and two sons _ Alex, 5; and a month-old baby _ joined him
March 28.
   The rhinoceros attacked while Smith was working in the jungle
about 160 feet from their living quarters. Smith said his party was
setting traps to catch small animals for research when the
rhinoceros appeared.
   ``We did not hear the sounds of any animal on that morning,''
Smith said. ``But all of sudden, I saw a rhino rushing towards (me)
... charging from a distance of about 15 feet.
   ``I turned around and started to run. But I realized that I
could not escape, so I used my hands ... pushing to keep the animal
away.
   ``It gored my chest,'' he said. ``The animal hit me about 12
times. Sometimes I was able to roll. I did (this so) ... the animal
would miss me.''
   Smith received four major wounds to his head, chest, leg and
buttocks.
   His wife said the main danger of such an attack comes from the
animal's razor-sharp lower teeth, not from its huge horn.
   ``He was extremely brave,'' said Dr. Hemanta Mishra of the King
Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation in Katmandu. ``He handled it
very coolly.''
   Mishra told the St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch by
telephone that the rhinoceros had charged Smith's son. There was no
time to get the boy out of the way, so the father charged the rhino
to draw it away from his son, Mishra told the newspaper.
   Others put the boy into a tree, then threw stones and sticks at
the rhinoceros to drive it off, Mishra was quoted as saying.
   Smith was in the park conducting a small-mammal survey sponsored
by his university, the Smithsonian Institution and the nature
trust, Mishra said.
   The animal that attacked Smith was an extremely rare Great
Indian one-horned rhinoceros, which is found in sizable numbers
only in Chitwan Park and an animal preserve in India, said Peter
Jordan, an associate professor in the University of Minnesota's
Fisheries and Wildlife Department.

   A fire whose smoke was visible for 40 miles
roared through a coal-powered electric plant near here today,
causing a roof to collapse, but no serious injuries were reported.
   The extent of damages in the $1.2 billion plant, which opened in
1984, was unclear, said fire dispatcher Miller Norton. No
disruption in service to utility customers was expected.
   The fire erupted in a system that keeps hydrogen gas from
escaping into the atmosphere, according to Jeff Fela, public
affairs representative for Seminole Electric. Hydrogen gas is a
standard coolant for electric generators.
   One person, believed a worker at the Seminole Electric
Cooperative Plant, was treated at the scene for unknown injuries,
said Capt. James White, shift commander at the Palatka Fire
Department.
   Another person earlier unaccounted for was found, Norton said.
   A plume of smoke was visible in Jacksonville, about 40 miles
north of the plant.
   At least 30 fire units from the local department and surrounding
counties were called to the scene after the fire was reported about
5 a.m., White said. More than 100 fire, rescue and law enforcement
officers were called to help battle the blaze.
   ``It is contained from what we are told,'' Major Paul Usina with
the Putnam County Sheriff's Office said shortly after 9 a.m.
   The two coal-fired generators where the fire erupted are located
on a 2,000-acre site six miles north of Palatka off U.S. 17.
   The fire erupted on the second floor of the six-story main plant
of the 600-megawatt facility after the hydrogen leak developed on
one of the two turbines, officials said.

<HEAD>Military Fugitive Returned To Argentina For Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cashiered army Gen. Carlos Suarez
Mason, Argentina's most-wanted military fugitive, was extradited
from the United States today to face trial for the murders of
suspected leftists in the 1970s.
   The extradition was ordered April 27 in San Francisco by U.S.
District Judge Lowell Jensen, who ruled Suarez Mason could be tried
in Argentina on charges of 39 murders allegedly committed by troops
under his command. If convicted, the maximum sentence is life in
prison.
   The 64-year-old former general fled Argentina in 1984 and was
arrested by federal marshals in Foster City, Calif., a San
Francisco suburb, where he has been living under an assumed name.
   Federal Police Chief Juan Pirker confirmed that Suarez Mason
arrived at Ezeira International Airport at 9:05 a.m. aboard an
Aerolinas Argentinas flight from New York. Pirker said Suarez Mason
was accompanied by five guards, but he refused to provide further
details.
   The handcuffed prisoner was escorted off the plane by federal
police officers, witnesses said, was put aboard an armored vehicle
and taken to federal police headquarters in downtown Buenos Aires.
   Suarez Mason was stripped of his military rank in April 1984
after he was declared ``in rebellion'' when he failed to appear
before a military tribunal for questioning in connection with the
abduction, torture and murder of suspected leftists.
   At least 9,000 Argentines disappeared in a so-called ``dirty
war'' waged against leftists by the military regime that seized
power in 1976 after ousting former President Isabel Peron.
   Suarez Mason's trial was personally ordered by President Raul
Alfonsin shortly after he took office in December 1983, ending
nearly eight years of rightist military rule.
   Suarez Mason was commander of the Buenos Aires-based 1st Army
Corps from 1976 to 1978, when he was promoted to head of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. He retired in 1981 and was named president of the
state oil monopoly Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, a post he
held until 1982.
   Argentina sought Suarez Mason's extradition on 43 separate
charges of murder. He also has been accused of 635 cases of human
rights abuse as well as misappropriation of more than $2 million
while he headed the state oil monopoly.
   In approving Suarez Mason's extradition, Jensen ruled he could
be tried on 39 murder murders, as well as an additional charge of
forging a passport renewal.
   But the judge rejected the four other murder charges after
ruling that identification of the victims was inadequate. He also
ordered the dismissal of 23 kidnapping charges, saying the 5-year
legal deadline for filing the charges expired in 1984.
   Under the extradition law, Suarez Mason can be tried only on

   Two American physicians have been allowed to
perform an autopsy on a political activist and visit a jailed
dissident in Czechoslovakia, apparently the first time a
Soviet-bloc country has agreed to such concessions.
   The doctors, part of the Somerville-based Physicians for Human
Rights, performed an autopsy last Wednesday on Pavel Wonka, a
35-year-old imprisoned dissident who died April 26. Wonka had been
arrested in 1986 for his political activities, among them running
for office, human rights officials said.
   Jonathan Fine, executive director of the Somerville
organization, said the Czech government allowed the American
doctors into the country after they requested permission to perform
an autopsy.
   In January, one American doctor from the group visited
Czechoslovakia in the hope of meeting with Wonka but it could not
be arranged at that time, Fine said.
   Fine said the Czech government did not explain why they allowed
the doctors into the country but ``it's speculated'' that because
Czech officials had already completed an autopsy on Wonka, they
believed they had nothing to hide.
   Both Fine and the Helsinki Watch human rights monitoring
organization in New York said they believed no other Soviet-bloc
country had permitted American physicians such access.
   Doctors Robert S. Lawrence and Robert H. Kirschner, who
performed the autopsy, said they found no evidence of torture or
beatings and said the probable cause of death was pulmonary emboli,
or blood clots on the lung.
   But Fine said it was unusual for a 35-year-old man to die from
the disorder and speculated that harsh prison conditions may have
contributed to Wonka's death.
   After performing the autopsy, the two doctors also spent 90
minutes with Jiri Wolf, 36, who is serving a prison term of
undetermined length on charges of slander against the state.

   President Francois Mitterrand, who steamrolled to
re-election over conservative Premier Jacques Chirac, faces the
task of forming a new Socialist-led government while the right
controls the parliament.
   Chirac offered to resign Tuesday, and was awaiting a response
from the Socialist president, sources in Chirac's office said today.
   Chirac lost to Mitterrand in runoff voting Sunday. Final results
from the Interior Ministry showed Mitterrand with 54 percent of the
vote to Chirac's 46 percent.
   The leading candidate to succeed the premier appeared to be
Michel Rocard, a former agriculture minister and Socialist Party
member. Other possibilities were former finance ministers Jacques
Delors and Pierre Beregovoy.
   The sources in the premier's office, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Chirac's chief of staff Maurice Ulrich called
Mitterrand's advisers to propose to transfer the reins of
government on Tuesday afternoon.
   There was no immediate indication from Mitterrand on whether he
would be ready to name a successor so soon.
   Reporters who gathered at Chirac's Hotel Matignon offices on the
Left Bank saw aides busily packing up files in cardboard boxes and
plastic sacks, to clear the way for the new premier's staff.
   The financial markets responded favorably this morning to the
election results. The French franc was steady to higher in early
trading while the stock market was steady to higher in calm trading
shortly after the exchange opened. The general market indicator was
up 1.06 percent after 30 minutes of trading.
   Currency traders said the franc's steady opening level was
expected since Mitterrand's economic policies are not viewed as
differing widely from Chirac's.
   Mitterrand, 71, is the first president elected twice by popular
vote. Charles de Gaulle was elected in 1958 and 1965, and two other
men served twice. But before a 1962 constitutional amendment,
French presidents always were chosen by indirect election.
   Unlike 1981, when Socialists danced at the Bastille to mark a
historic victory for the left, victory celebrations this year were
subdued. Mitterrand supporters did honk their car horns along the
Champs-Elysees, and 40,000 people waved French flags and rallied at
the Place de la Republique.
   In the first round of elections on April 24, Mitterrand won 34.1
percent of the vote to lead a field of nine candidates. Chirac was
second with 19.9 percent.
   Mitterrand's election to a new seven-year term puts an end to
two years of uneasy ``cohabitation'' between a Socialist president
and a rightist premier.
   But the immediate future may be even more confusing.
   To govern, Mitterrand's premier could form a coalition of
minority Socialists, who hold 215 seats in the 573-seat parliament,
with some centrist deputies now allied with the right. Or, he could
ask the president to dissolve the National Assembly and hold new
elections.
   More likely, the new premier will try to survive as head of a
minority government without any formal coalition, avoiding defeat
in the hostile assembly by steering clear of controversial issues
for several months.
   The one significant program Mitterrand's aides have said he
would pursue is re-establishment of a wealth tax, with the proceeds
used to pay most of the cost of a minimum guaranteed income of
about $350 per month.
   In an interview published Friday in the leftist magazine Le
Nouvel Observateur, Mitterrand said France needs to increase
investment in education, the economy, social programs and the
building of a united Europe.
   ``In all these areas, the state has a major role to play,'' he
said. ``But we can't expect everything from it. The final
responsibility falls to business. We need a new generation of
business leaders who understand that it is the quality of their
products and the competitivity of their prices that will bring
success.''
   But Francis Perigot, head of the French employers association,
said his members will be keeping a close eye on the new
government's moves.
   ``I will be watching that the next government pursues and
expands policies favorable to the competitivity of business,''
Perigot said.
   National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said Sunday that Chirac
was ``condemned to failure'' because he refused to do enough to
attract the front's extreme-right supporters.
   The strength of Le Pen, who drew 14.4 percent of the vote in the
election's first round, increased speculation that some pro-Chirac
centrists would join a coalition with the Socialists.
   Simone Veil, health minister under former center-right President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said she saw ``no problem in principle''
in a governing alliance between centrists and Socialists.
   Many centrist leaders, though, ruled out supporting a
Socialist-led government.
   ``We have absolutely no intention of making a pact of alliance
with Socialism,'' said Culture Minister Francois Leotard, president
of the Republican Party, the largest component of the center-right
Union for French Democracy coalition.

   A swarm of tornadoes and powerful storms struck the Midwest with
high winds and hail, killing a construction worker, damaging roofs,
knocking down power lines and leaving thousands blacked out today.
   More than 80 tornadoes or tornado-like storms touched down
Sunday _ 32 in Illinois, 25 in Wisconsin and 22 in Iowa and one
each in Indiana and Arkansas, and at least 160 reports of
thunderstorms with wind gusts over 50 mph, some with baseball-sized
hail, the weather service said.
   One man, a 39-year-old construction worker, was killed Sunday
night when a house he was building collapsed on him in high winds
in Crown Point, Ind., about 15 miles south of Gary, officials said
today.
   Sunday marked the region's second day of violent weather. In
rural Gretna, Neb., a 29-year-old woman and her 2-year-old daughter
died after a tornado struck their mobile home Saturday night.
   Storm damage reports covered eastern Kansas, northeast Texas,
from Arkansas through southern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and
western Kentucky.
   In eastern Iowa, more than 5,000 Iowa-Illinois Gas & Electric
Co. customers were without power for several hours Sunday, and
several thousand Iowa Power And Light Co. customers were blacked
out in the Des Moines area.
   A car show near Rockford, Ill., ended as 81-mph winds tossed
tents, debris, and portable toilets. ``One outhouse flew right past
me and then I got hit by another one as I was running away,'' said
Dwight Dunlop, 21.
   The winds toppled a 60-foot-by-180-foot big top tent and pulled
out dozens of metal stakes that were driven into the ground. A sign
reading, ``Not responsible for damage,'' was all that remained
standing.
   At Winsome Park, a nearby apartment complex, high winds lifted a
10-car garage away from the vehicles it sheltered and threw it into
another building.
   In the Chicago area, winds gusted up to 55 mph, downing trees
and wires. Commonwealth Edison officials said high winds caused
electricity to be cut off to about 40,000 people in the Chicago
area, but by midmorning power had been restored to all but about
6,000 customers.
   An air traffic controller at Chicago's Midway Airport complained
of a sandstorm as strong winds swept through the city. Midway and
O'Hare airport officials said some flights were delayed by the
storm.
   Mort Edelstein, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the weather-related problems were compounded
by a major fire at an Illinois Bell switching center in suburban
Hinsdale.
   ``The regular telephone lines linking the Chicago-area (air)
control center in Aurora with the towers at Midway and O'Hare go
through Hinsdale,'' Edelstein explained. ``Both towers switched
immediately to backup communications systems, but the bad weather
was nearing Midway, so approaches there were stopped.''
   Edelstein said that after the worst of the weather passed,
planes were allowed to take off from Midway, and the airport was
reopened to approaching flights after several hours. There was
little effect on O'Hare, he said.
   A tornado touched down near Elwood, Ill., southwest of Joliet
shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, tearing the roof off a condominium,
but no injuries were reportd, the National Weather Service said.
   In East Peoria, high winds ripped part of the roof off a popular
seafood restaurant, doing an estimated $200,000 damage. Authorities
said about 225 diners were inside the restaurant at the time, but
no one was injured.
   In north-central Wisconsin, two people were hospitalized with
injuries after high winds with rain and hail struck their mobile
homes in Marathon County. The extent of their injuries was not
immediately known.
   ``We've had several roofs blown off, power lines knocked down,
numerous reports of trees down, I'd say 20 or 30 reports,'' said
Jack Burbank, a civil defense official for Columbia County, just
south of Marathon.
   Thunderstorms with high winds rumbled across the northern half
of Indiana on Sunday, damaging buildings in Benton County and
Lebanon and injuring one person when a mobile home was blown over
in Wabash County, authorities said.
   A tornado with ice cube-size hail brought down trees and power
lines Sunday near Arkadelphia in southwest Arkansas, but no
injuries were reported.

   Education Secretary William J. Bennett, a
frequent critic of low standards in America's schools and colleges,
announced today he will leave President Reagan's Cabinet in
mid-September.
   Bennett, often a magnet for controversy during his 3{-year
stint, signalled last month that he intended to step down in the
fall, a few months before the Reagan administration draws to a
close.
   Bennett's spokesman, Loye Miller, issued the following statement:
   ``Secretary Bennett met today with the president and
subsequently with Education Department staff to say that he intends
to leave his position in mid-September. He expressed his gratitude
to President Reagan for the opportunity to serve in his Cabinet.
The secretary reiterated to his staff his intention to continue at
`full speed ahead' during the next few months.''
   Bennett told the staff he had recommended that Linus Wright, the
undersecretary of education and a former superintendent of schools
in Dallas, be nominated to fill the post for the final months of
Reagan's term. There was no immediate word from the White House,
however, on who Reagan would nominate.
   Bennett was unavailable for further comment. He told the staff
and the president that he wants to do some speaking and write a
book.
   In a jocular reference to the furor over former White House
chief of staff Donald Regan's memoirs, Bennett ``said to the
president, `Not that kind of book. A book about education,''' his
spokesman related.
   What lies ahead for the brash, combative Bennett, who has
clashed repeatedly with teachers' unions, quarreled with the
surgeon general over AIDS education, accused college presidents of
being greedy and upbraided Harvard and Stanford for changes in
their curriculum?
   Bennett said after delivering the commencement address Saturday
at the University of Southern Mississippi that he hasn't made any
definite plans.
   But he is likely to hit the lecture circuit and says he wants to
write a book capsulizing his critiques of the quality of America's
schools and colleges.
   Bennett, who converted from the Democratic to the Republican
party on May Day in 1986, has already proven a big draw on the GOP
fund-raising circuit, where he has been much in demand as an
after-dinner speaker.
   One speculated post is apparently not in the cards: the
vice-presidency on George Bush's tickets.
   Although Bennett is widely believed to have had his eye on that
spot, Bush has been conspicuously silent about Bennett during all
his talk about being ``the education president.'' Aids to Bennett,
who asked not to be identified, said they have had virtually no
contacts with the Bush camp in recent months, and Bennett is not
expecting to play any formal role in the Bush campaign.
   But Bennett is expected to attend his first Republican
convention in New Orleans this August, where party chairman Frank
Fahrenkopf has asked him to be on hand for the platform
deliberations, spokesman Miller said.
   In the past three years, according to the trade publication
Education Week, Bennett has spoken at 63 Republican functions
across the country.
   He has been a peripatetic Cabinet officer, visiting nearly 100
elementary and secondary schools and 50 campuses, and giving dozens
of speeches to school groups.
   Bennett, 44, was chairman of the National Endowment for the
Humanities for two years before succeeding T.H. Bell in the
Cabinet. Previously, he ran a humanities think-tank in North
Carolina and taught at several universities. He holds both a Ph.D.
in philosophy from the University of Texas and a law degree from
Harvard.
   He has been a relative ``pauper'' in Reagan's inner circle,
renting, not owning, a home in a pricey suburban Maryland
neighborhood. He and his wife, Elayne, have a young son.
   But his personal fortunes could pick up quickly if, as expected,
he lands a big advance contract for a book and pulls down lecture
fees running into thousands of dollars for each appearance.
   There has been speculation that Bennett may eventually run for
office, possibly from his adopted state of North Carolina. He
resisted an overture from Maryland GOP officials to seek the
nomination to challenge Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.
   Bennett said at the Education Writers Association meeting in New
Orleans April 17, ``I probably will step down in early fall. ...
People tell me that once you get past the convention, everyone
focuses on politics and it's hard to get other things done. If
that's the case, I will leave and see what's available.''
   Bennett said, ``I want to write a book that tells the truth
about education.''
   Bennett's latest report, ``American Education: Making It Work,''
concluded that American schools have improved somewhat over the
past five years, but still have a long way to go.

   China claimed Monday that Vietnamese troops
crossed the border and killed three Chinese farmers as they tilled
their fields.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Chinese border guards and
militia ``were compelled to fight back and wiped out the enemies.''
It did not give details of the clash, which it said occurred
Saturday, nor did it say how many troops were involved.
   Xinhua, quoting unidentified military sources, said Vietnamese
troops have crossed into southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region two dozen times in the past 10 days and stolen cattle, grain
and cloth from local residents.
   China and Vietnam have regularly accused each other of small
attacks along their 800-mile border ever since they fought a brief
border war in 1979.
   China claimed Vietnamese troops made a series of ``harassing
attacks'' into Guangxi Zhuang in April, beating one Chinese to
death and kidnapping others. It said each time the Chinese militia
sent the invaders fleeing.
   China and Vietnam also have clashed over their rival claims to
the Spratly Islands, also called the Nansha Islands, in the South
China Sea. Large oil deposits are believed to be located near the
islands.

<DATELINE>LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years ago, in his State
of the Union message, President Reagan launched a venture to take
aviation into the 21st century.
   ``We are going forward with research on a new Orient Express
that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from Dulles
Airport (outside Washington), accelerate up to 25 times the speed
of sound, attaining low Earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within two
hours,'' he said.
   Research on an aerospace plane already had been going on for
years in the part of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration that gets little public attention _ NASA's first A,
for aeronautics, sometimes also known as the little A.
   ``We are called the space agency by many, probably including
yourself,'' Jeremiah F. Creedon, the director for flight systems at
the Langley Research Center, told a visitor. ``Many of us here
think the (aeronautics) A is a large one.''
   Together with other NASA research centers _ Ames and Dryden in
California and Lewis in Ohio _ Langley's business is to develop
technology and to pass it on, without cost, to aircraft companies.
   Few planes fly today without engines, designs, materials and
structures conceived at NASA. No single company alone could afford
the agency's $2 billion investment in wind tunnels.
   Reagan's rosy prediction followed years of research by NASA
engineers before they decided that the aerospace plane, dubbed the
X-30, was even possible.
   In the summer of 1990, engineers will decide whether to actually
build the X-30. If the answer is yes, it could begin flight tests
that would finish when the 21st century is ushered in.
   It will be the largest experimental aircraft project ever
undertaken by the United States, costing $3.3 billion.
   The idea of the X-30 is to develop technologies that will be
useful for planes at a slower speed _ such as 3{ times the speed of
sound, or Mach 3.5.
   The military, and perhaps package delivery firms such as Federal
Express and United Parcel Service, are the only ones that have use
for a plane flying 25 times the speed of sound.
   ``There is tremendous potential for all kinds of vehicles
operating at high Mach numbers,'' said Douglas Dwoyer, manager of
hypersonic technology at Langley. ``The national aerospace program
is aimed at an experimental aircraft to demonstrate technologies
for this family of hypersonic aircraft.''
   Although the big airplane manufacturers have little interest in
building a Mach 25 plane, they do want a craft capable of flying
between Mach 2 and Mach 3.5, for the years 2000 to 2010.
   At Mach 2.7, a trip from Los Angeles to Tokyo would take just
under four hours.
   The United States did research in the 1960s on a supersonic
transport, the SST, but dropped the program in 1970 because of
costs and environmental concerns.
   ``The nation essentially allowed its entire research and
technology base in hypersonics to disappear,'' said Dwoyer. ``We
are bringing tunnels on line that haven't operated in almost 20
years with instrumentation systems that are 20 years-plus old.''
   Meanwhile, the British and French produced the Concorde, capable
of twice the speed of sound.
   The Concorde was designed with 1960s technology and can barely
carry enough fuel to make it from Europe across the Atlantic. The
business of the future is with the Pacific Rim _ Japan, China,
South Korea _ where a fast, 6,000-mile airplane is needed.
   Roy Harris Jr., director of aeronautics at Langley, sees a real
need for a long-range SST.
   The airlines that serve that market are pushing hard, he said.
Boeing and Douglas are trying to determine how many Mach 3.5 planes
might be needed by the year 2000. ``It looks like it's on the order
of 300 to 400 airplanes for the world market,'' said Harris _
holding out the prospect of a world market for an American plane
that would help untilt the trade balance.
   But the British, the French, the Soviets and the Japanese also
have ambitious aeronautics programs.
   Despite such competition, the United States treats its
aeronautics limb as a poor relative. Out of a $9 billion NASA
budget, aeronautics R&D this year gets only $430 million; $53
million of that is earmarked for the aerospace plane.
   The money issue is a sensitive one at Langley.
   ``I think we are grossly underfunded,'' said Dwoyer. ``On a
$400-million-a-year program, we cannot maintain our capability.''
   Until 1970, the U.S. jet transport industry had 90 percent of
the long-range market. Now that's down to 70 percent.
   ``For 70 years you could go to any airport in the world and look
out on the ramp and you see `Made in the U.S.A.,'' Harris said. Now
the European-built Airbus, a superb plane, can be seen at most
airports, too.

   North Korea has banned almost all contact with
Japan in retaliation for sanctions Japan imposed against the
communist nation last January, North Korea's official news agency
said Monday.
   ``The travel of all delegations has virtually been suspended
between our country and Japan,'' the Korean Central News Agency
quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying.
   The news agency said individuals attending international
conferences or sporting events would still be allowed to go to
Japan.
   Japan imposed sanctions on North Korea on January 26 after
accusing it of downing a South Korean passenger jet last November.
Japan said it would sharply restrict contact between Japanese and
North Korean diplomats and prohibit North Korean officials from
entering the country.
   Last Friday, North Korea canceled a visit to Japan by two
zoological experts scheduled to arrive Tuesday with a rare Korean
wolf for the Kyoto Municipal Zoo. Also Friday, Japan said it would
waive its sanctions to let two North Koreans compete in a table
tennis match here in mid-May.

   Suspected Kurdish guerrillas raided a
hamlet near the Syrian border and killed 11 villagers, including
eight children, the Anatolia news agency reported Monday.
   The semi-official agency also said security forces found the
bodies of three villagers kidnapped by the rebels on Saturday after
the guerrillas killed another 11 people during a raid on a township.
   It said the bodies were found near the hamlets of Tarakli and
Uckardesler.
   A band of rebels raided Behmenin hamlet in the Taskoyu village
late Sunday and sprayed a villager's house with automatic gunfire,
killing the 11 people inside, the agency said. A 2-month-old infant
was among the dead.
   Sunday's attack was similar to the one Saturday during which
rebels affiliated with the Kurdish Labor Party raided a township 62
miles from Taskoyu.
   In the past, the rebels have aimed such raids at civilians
suspected of collaborating with Turkish security forces.
   The Kurdish party seeks to set up an independent Marxist state
in parts of eastern and southeastern Turkey.
   About 800 civilians and soliders and about the same number of
Kurdish insurgents have been killed since the Kurdish guerrillas
started hit-and-run attacks in 1984.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's 52 million
people.

   An American organization has presented a fancy
new wheelchair to the son of senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Rich Walsh, head of the Resource Center for the Handicapped in
Seattle, said the chair was presented to Deng Pufang. ``His aides
told me he took it home and tried it out,'' Walsh said Monday.
   Walsh said the chair was custom-designed for the 43-year-old
Deng, who has been unable to walk since radical Red Guards forced
him from a fourth-floor window during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution. His father, Deng Xiaoping, was purged twice during the
decade but rose to power in 1978.
   Walsh said he met the younger Deng when he visited Canada and
the United States in October. Deng toured rehabilitation centers
and raised funds for the China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped,
which he heads.
   ``Deng and I really hit it off,'' said Walsh. ``He's just got a
great sense of humor.'' He said he decided to give him a wheelchair
after noticing that Deng's was ``an antiquated old beater.''
   Walsh, 50, who lost use of his arms and legs in a car accident
11 years ago, said Chinese officials have agreed to send several
disabled Chinese to enroll in his center's vocational training
program this year.
   He said they also discussed preliminary plans for the non-profit
center to set up a pilot program for training the disabled in
Beijing.

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca and singer
Aretha Franklin are among five celebrities featured in a brochure
urging tourists to ``feel at home in our hometown.''
   Whose hometown? None of the five lives here.
   Iacocca, Franklin and talk-show host-psychologist Sonia Friedman
live in suburban Bloomfield Hills. Writer Elmore (Dutch) Leonard
lives in suburban Birmingham and actor Tom Selleck _ who was born
in Detroit _ lives in Southern California.
   About 100,000 visitors to the Motor City have received the
brochure, including 35,000 members of the American Association of
Retired Persons, which will holds its annual convention here this
week.
   The Metropolitan Detroit Convention & Visitors Bureau, which
produced the brochure, says it is splitting hairs to claim the
featured celebrities lack Detroit addresses because the bureau
represents metro Detroit.
   But Friedman's comment in the brochure may be a giveaway.
   ``It's a wonderful place to visit,'' she says.

   Prince Andrew took a bumpy step Monday
toward a long-term career in the Royal Navy.
   The Duke of York stumbled over a coil of rope as he boarded his
new ship, the guided-missile destroyer HMS Edinburgh at the Rosyth
Naval Base in eastern Scotland. He recovered quickly to stride up
the gangplank and report for duty as the destroyer's newest junior
watchkeeper.
   Andrew, 27, second son of Queen Elizabeth II, joined the navy on
a medium-term commission in 1979 and, after serving in the Falkland
Islands War against Argentina, became a helicopter warfare
instructor.
   He switched to the navy's ``general list'' last fall so he could
continue his naval training and advance beyond his current rank of
lieutenant.
   The destroyer sails from Rosyth on June 13 for six months in the
Far East and Australia, which means Andrew will have to apply for
special permission to return to England in August when his wife,
the former Sarah Ferguson, is expected to deliver their first child.
   ``The navy tries, wherever possible, to free men in his
situation who want to be at home when their children are born,''
said a Defense Ministry spokesman.
   ``He will be able to apply to take leave, but whether or not he
gets it is up to the captain and depends on whether he can be
spared.''
   Andrew is fourth in line to the throne following his older
brother, Prince Charles, and Charles' two sons, Princes William and
Harry.

   Empress Zita of Austria, widow of the
last Hapsburg ruler Karl I, discreetly marked her 96th birthday
Monday.
   Closest family members gathered to celebrate in this Swiss
village, where Zita has lived for three decades in an old people's
home run by Franciscan nuns, said Bernd Posselt, press agent for
her son Otto von Hapsburg.
   She is in good health except for fading eyesight, he said in
Munich, West Germany.
   Born in Italy as a princess of Bourbon-Parma, Zita is Europe's
last living empress. Her husband, the last crowned head of the
Hapsburg dynasty that ruled for 640 years, died in exile on the
island of Madeira in 1922 at age 34.
   After the Allied victory in World War I, Karl had agreed to
``temporarily relinquish'' his imperial rights, but never
officially abdicated.
   Zita, who had eight children, once held court at Vienna's
Schoenbrunn castle. She now lives in two plainly furnished rooms.

   A murderer who escaped five weeks ago
with two other inmates from a maximum-security prison was
recaptured today about 10 miles from the prison, state police said.
   Details of the arrest of Tommie Mollohan this morning were not
immediately available, a state police dispatcher said.
   Mollohan, 45, had been sighted several times in the remote,
wooded area of Marshall County since his escape April 3. The two
inmates who escaped with him from the West Virginia Pentitentiary
in Moundsville were recaptured last month.
   Penitentiary officials had described Mollohan as the mastermind
of the breakout. He was serving a life sentence without chance of
parole for the 1973 robbery and murder of a grocer. At the time,
Mollohan had escaped from a Florida prison and also was wanted in
Georgia and North Carolina on armed robbery charges.
   The other two escapees also were serving life sentences without
chance of parole.

   Israeli helicopter gunships on Monday
raided a village in south Lebanon which is policed by United
Nations peacekeeping troops, security sources said. No casualities
were reported.
   Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said one house was
damaged in the attack on Kabrikha, 16 miles east of Tyre.
   Kabrikha is policed by Irish troops of the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon. The Irish battalion did not fire on the helicopters, the
sources said.
   They said the house that was hit may have been used by a
guerrilla group to launch cross-border attacks into Israel.
   The raid was Israel's seventh air strike in Lebanon this year.
Forty-nine people have been killed and 71 wounded in the earlier
raids.
   In Tel Aviv, the Israeli military command denied the report,
saying there had been no air raid on Kabrikha.

   Not wanting to take a bath on an old water
tower, city officials have been advertising it for sale, but it's
not easy finding a buyer.
   ``It's a cute tank,'' says the mayor of this Dallas suburb, Lou
Duggan. ``It's not like the other tanks _ the cylindrical looking
type of tanks.
   ``It's the kind that has a bell shape to it. It looks like a
golf ball on the end of a golf tee.''
   Coppell's use for the decade-old 250,000-gallon tower dried up
in January with the installation of a 1.5 million-gallon tank to
service its more than 15,000 residents.
   ``There's no used water tower lot where you can go and sell a
used water tower,'' Councilman Tom Morton said recently.
   Duggan said he'd accept a $200,000 offer for the tank, which he
said probably would cost about $250,000 new.
   One thing that may discourage a potential buyer is the cost of
dismantling and moving the tower, which could cost as much as the
tower itself, city officials say.

   Expertise in botany isn't a requirement
to be a lawman, says Randolph County Sheriff Steve Shults.
   If it were, the sheriff noted Sunday, officers might have
noticed sooner that the five little green plants growing outside a
county courthouse door weren't tomatoes _ they were marijuana.
   ``Back in the winter, we made a drug arrest ... and marijuana
was seized growing in a flower pot. Well, we plucked the little
plant, and we dumped the dirt outside the back door,'' Shults said.
   In late April, sprouts poked through the dirt in a spot where
tomatoes used to grow.
   ``We thought it was the tomatoes, back again,'' the sheriff
said, chuckling again.
   ``Finally, a city officer said, `Are you sure those are going to
be tomato plants?' And we weren't so sure,'' the sheriff said.
   They watched the plants a while longer and decided they were
marijuana sprouted from seeds in the dirt they dumped. They were
``pulled and trashed,'' Shults said.
   ``Everybody kind of took it as a joke. And, of course, there's
nobody in the courthouse suspected of growing this marijuana.''
   Shults said dirt has always been dumped in the spot, where
plumbing work left an indentation in the soil. The practice will
continue, he said.
   ``But next time, we'll poke around in the dirt a little more,''
Shults said.

   A U.S. cargo ship accidentally struck and sank a
Chinese fishing boat in the East China Sea, leaving 17 fishermen
missing, the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday.
   Xinhua said the U.S. ship, the President Monroe, left the scene
immediately after the accident Friday afternoon and made no effort
to rescue the fishermen.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Mckinney Russell said the Chinese Foreign
Ministry notified the embassy of the accident, but that he had no
other information.
   ``It's still an alleged incident as far as we are concerned,''
Russell said. ``We haven't been able to confirm there was a
collision. We don't know where the (U.S.) vessel would have come
from or where it was bound.''
   Lloyds Register of Ships says the President Monroe belongs to
American President Lines of San Francisco. It is a 860-foot long
container weighing 40,627 tons.
   Xinhua said the accident took place off the port of Lianyugang
in coastal Jiangsu province. It said the Chinese boat carried 20
fishermen and was registered to the Jiangsu Fisheries Corp.
   The report said the Foreign Ministry ``reserves the right for
further representation.''
   Russell said he interpreted that to mean the Chinese might sue
the American shipping company if an investigation supported their
version of events. He said he did not expect any political
repercussions.

   Lawyers for a man accused of killing 16
people, including 14 members of his family, have decided against a
defense based on the insanity plea. Prosecutors have pledged to
seek the death penalty.
   Juror selection began today in the murder trial of R. Gene
Simmons, 47, a retired Air Force master sergeant. He's charged with
killing two people during a 45-minute shooting spree Dec. 28 in
Russellville.
   ``We plead not guilty and we're just going to make them prove
their case,'' defense attorney John Harris said Sunday. ``We're
just going to see that they don't get out of line, that they give
him a fair trial.''
   Harris said he expected jury selection to last two days, and
that testimony would take three days.
   It was only after Simmons surrendered in connection with the two
killings that police found the bodies of his wife and 13 children,
grandchildren and in-laws at his home in rural Pope County. He
faces a July 18 trial on murder charges for those killings.
   Tests on Simmons found no evidence of a problem such as a brain
tumor that could have affected his behavior, doctors said.
   Today's trial is for the deaths of a former co-worker, Kathy C.
Kendrick, 24, who officials say spurned Dimmons' advances a year
before she was killed, and James D. Chaffin, 33, apparently killed
by chance.
   ``It was a cruel and senseless act that was committed and the
death penalty would certainly be justified,'' prosecutor John Bynum
said. Simmons could be sentenced to die or to life in prison
without parole if convicted.
   He also faces five counts of attempted murder and one count of
kidnapping, but Harris hopes to get those charges incorporated into
the two murder charges.
   The trial has been moved 50 miles to this town of 3,500 people
because of pretrial publicity, yet Bynum, Harris said, has ``stated
emphatically he has no intention of bringing up'' the 14 other
deaths during the trial.
   ``I don't think he can get a fair trial anywhere in Arkansas
because of all the pretrial publicity,'' Harris said.
   Bynum said an impartial jury can be found in Franklin County,
but acknowledged, ``I don't expect to find a juror who hasn't heard
about the case.''
   After Simmons' arrest, deputies went to his home and found the
bodies of five relatives, including two of his children and their
spouses. Four had been shot and Simmons' 11-year-old granddaughter,
had been strangled.
   They apparently died after arriving for a Christmas gathering.
The next day, police found seven bodies, including Simmons' other
children and his wife, Becky, in a shallow, kerosene-soaked grave.
   Some had been shot, others strangled, apparently before
Christmas, police said. They also found the strangled bodies of two
infant boys in trunks of abandoned cars on Simmons' land.
   The gun that killed Miss Kendrick and Chaffin had been used to
kill some of Simmons' relatives, ballistics experts said.
   Feelings are running high in this east-central Arkansas county.
Sheriff Gordon McCain said 18 to 20 officers will provide court
security and spectators will have to pass through a metal detector
to enter the courtroom.
   Robert Wood, president of Woodline Woodline Motor Freight in
Russellville, where Simmons surrendered, said last week it was
``unfortunate we have to go through the motions'' of a trial.
   ``I would be severely upset if he were found innocent,'' Wood
said. ``On the other hand, if he were found innocent, he wouldn't
make it far past the front door of the court.''

<HEAD>Ethiopian Red Cross Cuts Ties With ICRC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethiopia's Red Cross Society has
cut its ties with the International Committee of the Red Cross
because the international group refused to hand over its food
supplies in the war-torn north.
   Ethiopian Red Cross Chairman Dawit Zewdie announced the break
Sunday in a speech marking Red Cross Day and the 125th anniversary
of the international Red Cross movement.
   The Geneva-based Red Cross was part of a massive relief effort
to save an estimated 7 million Ethiopians from starvation following
severe crop failures last year.
   More than 3 million of those people are in the northern
provinces of Eritrea and Tigre, where the international committee
was feeding about 500,000 people until last month when the
government expelled all foreign aid workers from the provinces,
citing security reasons. The government is battling two separate
insurgencies in the region.
   Before leaving, international Red Cross workers locked up about
53,000 metric tons of food and equipment, including approximately
40 trucks.
   Jean-Jacques Fresard, the international body's chief delegate in
Ethiopia, said the action was according to the group's general
policy.
   ``Supplies are never handed over ... without having our
expatriate presence to monitor and control the operation,'' Fresard
said in a telephone interview.
   Fresard said the move by the Ethopian Red Cross had been
expected.
   ``They wanted to go on with the joint agreement only if we
handed over all our supplies,'' said Fresard. ``We couldn't do
that.''
   It was not immediately clear what practical effect the break
will have, since the government expulsion last month put a stop to
international Red Cross operations in Eritrea and Tigre.
   Fresard said he did not believe it would affect operations in
Gondar, where the international organization is feeding 100,000
people and hopes eventually to reach 230,000 drought victims.
   Bekele Geleta, secretary-general of the Ethiopian Red Cross,
said he was unsure whether the Ethopian group would allow the
international Red Cross to go on working in Gondar.
   ``We would like to continue, but the ICRC is causing a lot of
problems,'' he said.
   Relations between the international Red Cross and the Ethiopian
government have deteriorated since the expulsions. Ethiopia has
accused the international group of running covert operations in the
north and of supporting guerrillas who have been fighting for 27
years in Africa's longest civil war in Eritrea.
   The international Red Cross, which has an international mandate
under the Geneva Convention to operate in regions of conflict, has
maintained an office in Ethiopia since the East African nation
fought a full-scale war with Somalia in 1977-78.

   Paparazzi and star-watchers may be disappointed
when the 41st Cannes Film Festival opens Wednesday _ it's going
back to basics.
   Apart from the participation of Clint Eastwood and possibly
Robert Redford _both as directors rather than actors _ the famed
festival is being billed this year as a cozy gathering of movie
buffs and professionals.
   After the 40th anniversary extravaganza last year, some film
purists find the change a welcome return to the style of previous
festivals, when the films themselves outshined the stars, fancy
receptions and big deals being signed.
   The choice facing the Cannes jury each year is whether to select
films which are certain to be a commercial success, or to innovate
and bring some newcomers into the limelight. It is difficult to
achieve the right balance.
   By favoring less commercial films, the Festival runs the risk of
losing the big ones completely. If it loses, a prestigious,
high-budget film loses a lot, but a low-budget film can only gain
if it wins a glittering prize at the world-famous festival.
   Festival officials say the focus this year will be on a search
for the talent of tomorrow. The jury has decided to ``help the
cinema build its future,'' festival President Pierre Viot said at a
recent news conference.
   Fifteen countries are represented by 21 films in the main
competition.
   This year's festival will be an opportunity for film makers
outside the commercial circuit to show their worth. The jury's
selection includes many films by young directors and works from
countries just beginning to gain a reputation for their movie
industries.
   For example, China makes its Cannes debut with ``King of
Children'' by Chen Kaige, and New Zealand is represented by Vincent
Ward's ``The Navigator.''
   One of two French entries is ``Chocolat,'' a story of colonial
life in the African Cameroons. It is the first full-length film of
Claire Denis, who made her mark as assistant to German New Wave
film maker Wim Wenders.
   ``A World Apart,'' a British film directed by Chris Menges,
tells the story of apartheid in South Africa. Menges made his name
as a director of photography, working on films such as Roland
Joffe's ``Mission.''
   A more familiar name on the list of entrants is that of American
director and scenarist Paul Schrader. Known for ``American Gigolo''
and ``Mishima,'' he is represented in Cannes by ``Patty,'' based on
the 1974 kidnapping of Patricia Hearst, William Randolph Hearst's
granddaughter.
   Despite the many litte-known names, stargazers will still have a
chance of seeing a few Hollywood greats.
   Director Clint Eastwood is expected to present ``Bird,'' a
biography of the alto sax player Charlie ``Bird'' Parker.
   Robert Redford, who has been in the Soviet Union showing some of
his films, may appear in Cannes to present his new film ``The
Milagro Beanfield War.'' The feature tells the story of a tiny
village in New Mexico, where residents take up arms against big
business and the establishment.
   In an effort to cater to true movie lovers, the organizers have
even restricted the presence of television at this year's festival.
   Critics said the 1987 festival became a vehicle for the small
screen. Many televised variety shows used the festival as a
backdrop.
   Said Viot: ``We do not want the festival to become the
battleground for a (television) ratings war.''

   A moderate earthquake rattled portions of
south-central Alaska early Monday, but there were no immediate
reports of damage or injuries, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center
reported.
   The 8:33 a.m. temblor measured 4.7 on the Richter scale, the
center reported. The quake was centered about 20 miles northeast of
Valdez, and was felt strongly in that city, said Tom Sokolowski,
head of the warning center.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 time
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4
moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A
magnitude 7 quake is a major earthquake, capable of widespread
damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake capable of tremendous damage.

<HEAD>New Rules on Gasoline Evaporation May Help Clean Up Hidden Air
Polluter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cities may have been made significantly
smoggier than previously predicted by an unrecognized form of auto
pollution _ a source that planned new regulations should clear up,
according to several analysts.
   The newly recognized source is evaporation of gasoline from fuel
systems while cars are running. The Environmental Protection Agency
has been assuming these ``running losses'' could be neglected in
assessing the formation of ozone, the major component of smog, from
volatile compounds like gasoline.
   New findings suggest the amount of gasoline that evaporates from
a car's fuel system when the vehicle is being used on a hot day may
be five times to 25 times greater than the amount of unburned
gasoline that is permitted to escape in exhaust: 2 grams to 10
grams per mile in ``running losses'' compared with 0.41 grams out
the tailpipe.
   Ten grams of gasoline is about half a liquid ounce.
   ``If all these things fall into place, it's logical to expect
this is a big source and another explanation that could be offered
as to why attainment (of the air quality standards) has been so
hard,'' said Tad Wysor, an engineer in EPA's Emissions Control
Technology Division in Ann Aror, Mich.
   ``Official predictions have been under-predicting'' future
improvement, said Tom Austin, a partner in Sierra Research of
Sacramento, Calif., air pollution consultants.
   All cars must pass tests for gasoline emissions while parked.
Newly proposed EPA regulations are designed to reduce this
stationary evaporation, along with vapors lost during refueling.
   They will require refiners to cut summertime gasoline volatility
_ its tendency to evaporate _ by 22 percent from the current, often
exceeded, voluntary standard. They also will require the existing
auto vapor recovery system to be enlarged to capture refueling
vapors.
   Ozone worsens breathing problems. EPA last week released the
names of 68 urban and rural areas where air did not meet the
federal ozone standard in 1987, up from the 62 on the previous
year's list.
   Though EPA said a warm summer in the East in 1987 helped push up
ozone violations, environmental groups immediately claimed that the
data showed that the smog problem was getting worse.
   EPA has known for years that today's gasoline volatility _ 11.5
pounds of vapor pressure is the summer standard in much of the
country _ will cause cars to flunk its stationary emissions test
badly. The fuel used in that test must be 9.0 pounds, the pressure
the agency wants to make the mandatory maximum.
   Nine pounds was typical of gasoline in 1975 when test
specifications were drawn up.
   Sam Leonard, director of automotive emissions control for
General Motors Corp.'s environmental activities staff, said GM has
found that emissions on one part of the stationary test are 16
times greater with 11.5 pound fuel than with 9.0 pound fuel.
   Hugh Shannon of Exxon Research Corp. outlined one explanation
for the unexpectedly high running losses at a briefing on vapor
recovery systems sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute last
week: the near-abandonment of carburetors for fuel injectors by
engine manufacturers.
   Fuel injection systems continuously recycle uninjected fuel back
to the tank. Accordig to Shannon, the returning fuel picks up heat
in the engine compartment, making fuel in the tank run 20 degrees
warmer than the outside air.
   This heat raises the pressure of the higher-volatility fuel.
That appears to overwhelm the existing charcoal cannister in the
vapor recovery system, leaving the vapor nowhere to go but to the
atmosphere.
   Leonard said he believed the running loss problem was mostly a
warm-climate phenomenon affecting ``probably less than 1 percent of
miles traveled'' nationwide.
   But Michael Walsh, a consultant often used by environmental
groups, said, ``One percent sounds like a low number to me.''
   ``The ozone problem is a warm-weather problem. ... We have a lot
of places in this country with plenty of hot days in the
summertime,'' Walsh said.

<HEAD>Judge: Juror Received Call About Defendant's Lie-Detector Test</HEAD>

   A juror in the trial of a woman accused of
killing her husband and another woman with cyanide-laced medicine
received an anonymous telephone call saying the defendant had
failed a lie-detector test _ a detail jurors were not allowed to
hear, the judge said today.
   The anonymous caller asked the juror, ``Don't you all know that
she failed the lie detector test?'' U.S. District Judge William
Dwyer told attorneys in the case this morning.
   Dwyer called the incident ``a most regrettable occurrence, and
most irresponsible by whoever did it.'' He said he would interview
the juror before making a decision on how to proceed.
   The woman juror wrote him a letter in which she reported
receiving the phone call Friday night, Dwyer said. The juror said
she did not recognize the caller's voice, and that the caller hung
up before she could ask who it was, Dwyer said.
   The development came as jurors prepared to return to
deliberations today after a weekend off. Although they told him
Friday they were deadlocked, Dwyer urged them to keep deliberating.
The trial began its fourth week today.
   He also agreed to provide them with addition information they
requested on the legal definition of reasonable doubt.
   Today, Dwyer promised, the court reporter would read backximum sentences
of life in prison, while the maximum for
tampering is 10 years on each count.
   Mrs. Nickell's husband, Bruce Nickell, 52, and Sue Katherine
Snow, 40, died in June 1986 after swallowing cyanide-laced
Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules.
   The deaths resulted in a nationwide tampering scare and prompted
Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Meyers to recall all its
over-the-counter drug capsules.
   Prosecutors argued that Mrs. Nickell wanted to end her marriage
and financial problems by killing her husband and collecting as
much as $176,000 in life-insurance benefits, and then tried to
cover up the crime by placing more tainted capsules in stores to
give the appearance of random tampering.
   Ms. Snow was an innocent stranger caught in the scheme, the
prosecution said.

   The Danish election campaign drew to
a close Monday in a race that could decide the strength of
Denmark's commitment to the NATO alliance.
   Conservative Prime Minister Poul Schlueter, in a final appeal
before Tuesday's vote, said he sought a mandate to restore
Denmark's credibility in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Schlueter called the election after he failed to block a move in
parliament last month to toughen Denmark's anti-nuclear stance. The
move was sponsored by the opposition Social Democrats.
   If implemented, the resolution would require Denmark to notify
each visiting warship of Denmark's peacetime ban on nuclear weapons
in its territory.
   The resolution was seen as a challenge to NATO's policy of
keeping a nuclear option. Under that policy, U.S. and British ships
refuse to say whether they are armed with nuclear weapons.
   Schlueter, who has led minority governments for six years,
called the snap election on the issue just eight months after the
last vote.
   It was Denmark's 19th election since War War II _ a European
record _ and the first time since then that Danes were asked to
vote mainly on a foreign policy issue.
   Twelve parties are contesting the election, three more than are
currently represented in the 179-member Folketing, or parliament.
Schueter's four-party alliance of center-right parties controls 70
seats.
   Schlueter said in an interview published Monday that the Social
Democrats' motion had undermined Denmark's credibility with its
Western allies.
   ``This is a referendum about NATO,'' he told the conservative
newspaper Berlingske Tidende.
   He also said he expected a long period of post-election haggling
to form a workable coalition, and that he hoped for a broad
alliance that would command a majority in parliament.
   He did not rule out a partnership with the Social Democrats,
Denmark's largest party.
   ``There is an undeniable need for a group of parties to
thoroughly discuss the major political problems,'' he said.
   ``I would go so far as to say that it is not advisable to
appoint a prime minister or a government if there is the least
doubt that a new majority is behind them,'' Schlueter said.
   Pre-election polls indicated another election stand-off is
likely between the two major blocs, with the Social-Liberals again
holding the balance. The party, with 11 seats, supports the
government on domestic policy and the opposition on foreign issues.
   As many as half a million voters, nearly one in eight, will
decide at the last minute how they will vote, said Ole Borre,
political science professor at Aarhus University.
   ``Many haven't decided who they will vote for, or whether they
will vote at all,'' he told Berlingske Tidende. Turnout last
September was 86 percent, about average in Denmark, where 3.9
million citizens are registered to vote.
   Polls show the far-right Progress Party, campaigning on a
platform of deep tax cuts and limiting immigration, is the only
party likely to advance strongly.
   In the latest poll published Sunday, the Progress Party took
eight percent, compared with the 4.8 percent it won in the previous
election.
   Social Democratic leader Svend Auken has denied that his party
is anti-NATO, and has accused Schlueter of exaggerating the meaning
of the resolution.
   Auken, 44, facing the electorate for the first time as party
leader, is taking over from former Prime Minister Anker Joergensen,
who resigned after the last round of balloting.
   The Social Democrats campaigned under the slogan ``Denmark
decides for itself.'' Posters depicting President Reagan embracing
Prime Minister Magaret Thatcher implied that the United States and
Britain wanted to dictate Denmark's nuclear policies.
   The Social Democrats, who dominated Danish politics for 40 years
until they relinquished power in 1982, led Denmark into NATO as a
founding member in 1949.
   The party drifted toward a hardline anti-nuclear stance shortly
after it became the opposition and sponsored a motion to stop
Denmark's payments toward the stationing of cruise missiles in
Europe.

<HEAD>Trade Bill Veto Could Hold Up Action on Arms Pact, Byrd Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential veto of the omnibus trade bill
could hold up ratification of the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile
treaty, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd said Monday.
   ``Lots of things could happen'' if the president carries out his
threat to veto the 1,000-page bill, Byrd told reporters.
   He stopped short of any specific threat to hold the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact hostage to a presidential
signature on the trade bill. But he said an effort to override a
presidential veto could shoulder aside floor debate on the treaty.
   The treaty, which was signed last December in Washington, calls
for the elimination of all U.S. and Soviet missiles with ranges
from about 300 miles to 3,000 miles.
   President Reagan has called on the Senate to ratify the measure
by May 29, the opening date of his Moscow summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``When the president promises that we'll have another trade
bill, he has got to remember that a veto would take precedence over
the treaty,'' Byrd said.
   Under Senate rules, he said, House override of a trade bill veto
would automatically force senators to take up a similar effort.
Thus, debate on an override could be the order of business on the
floor on May 29, he said, with the arms pact still pending.
   ``May 29 is just a date on the calendar,'' Byrd said. ``It means
absolutely nothing to me or this Senate.''
   The trade bill was passed by Congress two weeks ago. Instead of
sending it to Reagan's desk, however, lawmakers retained it on
Capitol Hill while they attempted to make further revisions.
   The House last week passed a technical corrections resolution
that also would drop restrictions on export of Alaska oil.
   That measure simply would authorize an official known as the
enrolling clerk to dot the i's and cross the t's in the bill _ and
erase the Alaska provisions.
   Byrd said he hoped to bring up the resolution in the Senate as
soon as possible, but would need the unanimous consent of senators
to do so. He said he would discuss that with Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan.
   It was expected the Senate would take up the resolution this
week.
   Major provisions of the trade bill would streamline procedures
for use of import restrictions to aid U.S. industry and to
retaliate against international trade violations.
   Scores of other provisions range from billions of dollars in
agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil
companies.

   The following is a text of a statement that
chief White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater issued today in
response to the release of a new book by former White House chief
of staff Donald T. Regan:
   The new book by Donald Regan is a kiss-and-tell story in the
mold of all such books which seek to exploit the presidency or the
first family for personal self-interest.
   President Reagan expressed his view of these kinds of books
several days ago, indicating his deep personal disappointment in
this breach of confidence. In addition, the president emphasized
last week that he had made no policy decisions based on astrology.
   We also recognize that the first lady has an interest in
astrology. After the March 30 (1981) attempted assassination of the
president, she reached out to friends, to ministers, family and her
friend who advises on astrology. But we cannot comment on her
private communications with the chief of staff.
   Suffice to say we are very proud of the Reagan record, the
accomplishments of the administration in the last seven years and
the achievements and strengths of the president.

   Former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, beginning a week-long visit to the United States, paid a
courtesy call Monday on President Reagan.
   Amid trade tensions, dialogue between the United States and
Japan expanded during Nakasone's prime ministership, and the two
leaders developed a first-name, ``Ron-Yasu'' relationship.
   Nakasone, 69, remains an influential member of the Japanese Diet
(parliament) in the Liberal-Democratic Party headed by his
successor Noboru Takeshita.
   On Tuesday, Nakasone was scheduled to speak at the inauguration
of the Yasuhiro Nakasone professorship in Japanese studies at Johns
Hopkins University, created in his honor with a $1 million
endowment by the Japanese shipbuilding industry. Later appearances
were scheduled at the University of Pittsburgh and Rutgers
University.

   Barbra Streisand says she has been hearing
unusual noise since she was a child and it helped her understand
St. Joan, whose character she used for a radio audition when she
was 13.
   ``I knew she was telling the truth'' when she said she heard
voices, Streisand said in an interview in the June issue of Ladies
Home Journal.
   ``I don't hear voices, but I hear noise. All the time,'' the
singer said.
   Streisand evidently hears a wider range of sound on more levels
and registers than most people.
   ``Doctors can't do anything about it,'' she said. ``I used to
put scarves around my head to muffle the noises, but ... it only
made it worse. It's annoying and I've never gotten used to it.
Sometimes when I'm under more stress the noises become louder, but
if I'm having a good time I sort of forget it momentarily.''
   She also talked about her latest beau, Don Johnson, star of the
``Miami Vice'' television series.
   ``When I'm with Don, I can enjoy my celebrity because I don't
have to apologize to the man I'm with for getting all the
attention,'' she said. ``Don gets as much attention as I do.''

<HEAD>Air Traffic Controller's Error May Have Contributed to Martin
Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An error by an air traffic controller
may have contributed to the 1987 jet crash that killed actor Dean
Paul Martin, the Riverside Press-Enterprise reported.
   A controller warning, which incorrectly gave the location of
Mount San Gorgonio, may have caused Martin to turn too sharply and
lose control of his F-4C Phantom jet, said veteran Lockheed test
pilot Tony LeVier.
   LeVier made his conclusions after reviewing an analysis by the
U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard, according to reports
obtained by the newspaper through the Freedom of Information Act.
LeVier's conclusions were published Sunday.
   Martin, a captain in the California Air National Guard and son
of entertainer Dean Martin, and his weapons officer, Capt. Ramon
Ortiz, 39, died March 21, 1987, when the jet traveling at 600 mph
crashed into a San Bernardino Mountains canyon.
   The accident report draws no conclusions about what happened
during the last seconds of Martin's flight.
   Air Force pilots and air traffic controllers declined to comment
on what might have caused the crash which killed Ortiz and the
35-year-old Martin.
   But LeVier said it is clear Martin made too sharp a left turn,
probably in a moment of panic as he feared hitting the mountain
ahead.
   If you turn the F-4 too quickly, the nose will pull the airplane
up, disrupting the plane's aerodynamics, said LeVier, who has
tested 70 aircraft during his 46-year career.
   ``The airplane simply becomes uncontrollable. The ... thing goes
ape,'' LeVier said.
   According to the accident analysis, Martin was at 11,500 feet,
flying in clouds and had not heard two previous instructions to
turn left. His plane was far off its route and heading toward the
peak. The controller reportedly told the pilot he was three miles
south of a 13,000-foot peak. But the analysis said the peak is
11,502 feet, not 13,000 feet, and Martin's aircraft was 8{ miles
from the summit, not three miles.
   Air Guard Maj. Steve Mensik, spokesman for the Guard in
Sacramento, said the controller's erroneous communication with
Martin-Ortiz was a contributing factor to the crash.
   FAA officials at Ontario International Airport said the
controller who handled the Martin-Ortiz flight committed no error.
   David Fowler, the controller's supervisor, said there were many
factors, including the work-load and weather, that might cause the
controller to miscalculate the distance of the fighter from the
mountain. He said his office has not read the latest accident
investigation report.
   A spokesman for the pilot's family called LeVier's analysis an
assumption. Mort Viner said he had heard other equally plausible
causes for the crash.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will make
his fourth trip to the Middle East this year in a fresh attempt to
promote Arab-Israeli peace talks, the State Department announced
today.
   ``There are problems there that need to be resolved,'' Charles
E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said in announcing that
Shultz would travel to Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Syria next month.
   Redman said Arabs and Israelis had urged Shultz to return to the
region. But he declined to say whether any of the parties had
changed their positions.
   ``All the people in the region have been very insistent on the
fact that the secretary and the administration continue these
efforts,'' Redman said.
   He said President Reagan had directed Shultz to return to the
region.
   There, Shultz again will promote a Mideast peace conference to
be followed by negotiations in two stages. The first would be
designed to provide some form of self-rule to the 1.5 million
Palestinian Arabs who live on the West Bank and in Gaza under
Israeli control. The second would deal with an overall Middle East
settlement.
   ``It is the only workable alternative,'' Redman said.
   Shultz will fly to the Middle East at the windup of the Moscow
summit meeting June 2 and then attend a meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's foreign ministers in Madrid June
9-10, said the U.S. official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   Three trips by Shultz to the Middle East this year failed to
produce peace talks. But he refuses to give up. ``Who's afraid to
struggle against odds?,'' he said at the end of the last venture in
April. ``What am I saving myself for, anyway?''
   Shultz told a Senate appropriations subcommittee two weeks ago
that ``under the right circumstances'' King Hussein of Jordan would
be agreeable to the U.S. proposal for a peace conference.
   Shultz also testified, however, that Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir had made the conference the ``centerpiece'' of his
objections to Shultz's plan.
   Shultz also was unsuccessful last month in Moscow in trying to
persuade the Soviet Union to accept a limited role in the
negotiations.
   Shamir and Shultz are opposed to giving the Soviets a chance to
shape the outline of a Mideast settlement. But Hussein is insisting
on Soviet involvement.
   On the other hand, Jordan is reluctant to negotiate with Israel
without a guarantee that it would recover all the land it lost
during the 1967 Mideast war. Shultz has advised Hussein that was
not ``in the cards.'' But he backs the idea of Israel trading some
territory on the West Bank for peace and said the future of
Jerusalem should be decided in negotiations.
   Despite the long odds, Shultz said he did not think his plan was
``fated to failure.''
   Shultz's plan called for a peace conference in mid-April, the
opening of negotiations on the Palestinians May 1 and a second
stage of talks on an overall settlement beginning Dec. 1.
   The first two deadlines have passed. But, Redman said, ``We need
to get this underway as soon as possible.''

   Civil aeronautics officials today
accused U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis of taking a Panamanian plane
to a U.S. military base without authorization.
   ``As far as we are concerned, until we conclude the
investigation, that plane was hijacked or stolen,'' Maj. Pascual
Gonzalez, director of the Civil Aeronautics Board, said at a news
conference.
   A U.S. Embassy official said Sunday that the plane carrying
Davis flew to an American air base because Panamanian agents
harassed his security detail at a commercial airport.
   The private plane carrying Davis and members of his family
landed briefly at the commercial airport, then departed after the
confrontation was reported by the security detail awaiting his
arrival, the official said.
   Davis did not leave the aircraft while it was at the commercial
airport. The embassy official, Terrence Kneebone, did not say
precisely what the Panamanian agents did.
   Long lines formed outside banks early today as people waited to
make limited withdrawals from their accounts for the first time in
more than nine weeks. Some customers said they had waited for more
than two hours before the banks opened this morning.
   A government order shut down banks March 3 following a run on
savings by panicky depositors and the imposition of U.S. economic
sanctions in an effort to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
resign as chief of the Defense Forces.
   Bankers and government officials agreed to reopen after
negotiations.
   Noriega, the power behind the government, was indicted in the
United States in February on drug trafficking charges. The general
has denied the charges and said they are politically motivated.
   The sanctions, including the freezing of an estimated $50
million of government funds in U.S. accounts, helped produce a
severe cash shortage in Panama, which uses the U.S. dollar as its
currency.
   Davis and family members were returning from a day trip to the
Pacific Coast island of Contadora when the plane approached
Paitilla Airport in Panama City. As the small jet landed, Davis saw
several Panamanian security agents armed with rifles ``harassing''
his security detail, Kneebone said.
   U.S. security officials were in contact with the plane by radio
as it prepared to land, Kneebone said, and spoke with Davis on the
ground. Davis decided to fly elsewhere because of the Panamanian
agents' ``fairly hostile actions,'' Kneebone said. The plane then
requested and received takeoff clearance from the airport tower
before flying to Howard Air Base, five miles northwest in the
former Panama Canal zone.
   One of the Panamanian security agents at Paitilla Airport
demanded to know who was on the plane with Davis, said Kneebone.
   Maj. Gonzalez said the plane also was carrying Gabriel Lewis
Jr., son-in-law of deposed President Eric Delvalle and son of
Gabriel Lewis Galindo, co-founder of an opposition group.
   Gonzalez said the incident started when four armed embassy
security men _ all U.S. citizens _ were seen by airport security on
restricted grounds.
   When they were being questioned, the plane came in, according to
Gonzalez. The aircraft taxied to the apron and the embassy security
people then talked by radio with those on the plane, the major
added. Then the plane took off for Howard Air Force Base.
   Gonzalez said it appeared the passengers were ``afraid'' when
they saw the airport security people.
   He said there ``are procedures that must be followed by all
civilian aircraft when landing at a militay base and spending the
night.'' Those procedures were not followed, he said.
   ``The incident could have been avoided if the four embassy
security men had first reported to the airport security when they
came in,'' Gonzalez said.
   The owner of the plane, Hugo Giraud, identified the aircraft as
a two-engine six-seater Piper Seneca. Giraud said it had been
leased by a pilot, Rigoberto Ng.
   It was the second incident in which Panamanian security agents
apparently sought to interfere with the ambassador's movements in
Panama. On April 3, a military vehicle unsuccessfully tried to stop
Davis' chauffer-driven limousine as he was leaving the residence of
the Vatican ambassador.

   Angola's U.S.-backed rebels said Monday
they killed 64 government soldiers and eight Cubans and also shot
down three Soviet-built aircraft in several attacks last week.
   Rebel casualties were given as 12 killed, 10 wounded and two
missing.
   Also Monday, a press report said South Africa's foreign minister
would meet Thursday with Angolan officials to pursue last week's
ground-breaking Angolan peace talks in London.
   South African soldiers are fighting in support of the
13-year-old rebel movement against Angola's Marxist government,
which is backed by Soviet advisers and an estimated 40,000 Cuban
troops.
   The rebel group, the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, made Monday's claims in a statement distributed in
Lisbon. There was no independent confirmation.
   The rebels said they killed seven Cubans May 2 in an assault on
a wood-processing plant near Conde in the oil-rich northwestern
Angolan enclave of Cabinda. They said 64 Angolan soldiers were also
killed in actions across six provinces last week.
   The rebels claimed their anti-aircraft batteries shot down a
MiG-21 plane Thursday as it bombed the village of Kanamba in
southeastern Moxico province.
   They said the Cuban pilot died, and two village children were
killed by falling wreckage.
   The statement also said that two MI-17 helicopters were shot
down the previous day in the area. There was no mention of
casualties.
   The guerrillas said violence in Angola would ``continue and
increase'' until the government, the Soviet Union and Cuba agreed
to negotiate an end to the civil war. The rebels were not included
in the U.S.-brokered talks in London between delegations from
Angola, Cuba, and South Africa.
   The South African Press Association said Foreign Minister Roelof
``Pik'' Botha would meet with Angolan officials on Thursday to
follow up on those talks.
   The officials will gather in Brazzaville, Congo, according to
the official sources quoted by the press association. It said the
talks would last until Friday and that Defense Minister Magnus
Malan might accompany Botha.
   The report said the Brazzaville talks would not involve the
United States.

   If you dream of owning your own island in the
sun, this could be your summer.
   Those folks at MTV _ who in the past have given away a house and
a town _ teamed up with Coca-Cola for a summer sweepstakes
promotion with an uninhabited Caribbean island as top prize.
   ``They say it's lovely,'' said rock singer Cyndi Lauper, on hand
Monday at a Manhattan restaurant to promote the contest. ``It does
have water on all four sides. Which makes it an island.''
   The promoters would say nothing specific about the landscape or
cost of the 25-acre island two miles off Ponce, Puerto Rico.
   But, said Harriet Seitler, an MTV marketing executive, ``It

   The island will be awarded by Miss Lauper to one of 225
sweepstakes winners of a Caribbean cruise in July.
   The performer, who'll be making her first trip on a cruise ship,
said, ``Maybe I'll do a little singing. Maybe you'll do a little
singing. But I do watch `Love Boat' so I know what goes on during
these cruises.''
   Miss Lauper, who's joining the contest to help push a new record
and her movie ``Vibes'' with Jeff Goldblum and Peter Falk, promises
the winners plenty of chances to see the film.
   ``The good thing about this cruise is it could be my movie every
night. I think I'd like that,'' she said.

   Shamir issued a statement saying Awad might incite Arabs to
violence and endanger Israel's security.
   Awad was born in Arab east Jerusalem and also has a home in
Wapakoneta, Ohio. In the deportation order, the reason for
expelling him is given as expiration of his tourist visa.
   Prosecutor Nili Arad submitted an affadavit Monday, however,
that alleges incitement by Awad. It includes testimony by an agent
of the Shin Bet security service referred to as ``Yossi'' who says
Awad ``posed as a moderate ... but his actions were a serious
threat to security and public order.''
   He accused Awad of ``taking part in the publication of leaflets
which issued ... a call for violent and hostile actions against the
state by residents of the territories.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``dispatched a message'' to
Shamir on Monday about the Awad case. Last week, the department
objected to deporting him without a hearing.
   Awad, who advocates non-violent resistance, denies allegations
of incitement.
   Official charges against him fall short of accusations made
Friday by Avi Pazner, spokesman for Shamir.
   Pazner accused him of drafting Leaflet No. 15, one of many
issued by underground leaders. It urged Palestinians to use
violence against Israeli soldiers.
   Awad, dressed in jeans, a blue-striped shirt and a sport jacket,
looked fit despite a hunger strike he is said to have begun after
his arrest. He smiled and blew kisses to supporters, who packed the
courtroom.
   ``I feel good,'' he said during a recess. ``I'm still fasting
but I started to drink water. I still believe in Israeli law and
Israeli justice and I hope I won't be disappointed.''
   His wife, Nancy Nye, told reporters: ``I'd much prefer to have
him at home with me and I'm very concerned about him physically.
I'm sure he'll continue the hunger strike.''
   She said she had not seen her husband privately since Friday and
police would not let her talk to him during the recess. ``I was
able to touch his cheek,'' she said.
   Soldiers fired on stone-throwing Palestinians at the Deheishe
refugee camp near Bethlehem, killing 34-year-old Ibrahim Mohammed
Haniyah, the army said. Four other Palestinians were wounded.
   A leaflet distributed late in April exhorted Palestinians to
honor Arab ``martyrs'' Monday. Israel radio said the call for a
total work and transport strike was observed.
   Most of the 100,000 Palestinian working in Israel stayed home
and streets in the occupied lands were deserted.
   In Gaza, masked youths threw stones at cars and strike
organizers used mosque loudspeakers to declare: ``Every worker who
goes to work will be punished.''
   Soldiers arrested three women from the Shati refugee camp near
Gaza and ordered them held for six months, said Khaled Kidra, their
lawyer. He said they were members of a camp women's committee and
identified one as Widad Saleh, 35 and mother of seven children.
   The army said it could not confirm the report and was
investigating.

   The Israeli army does not have enough shells
for its tanks and artillery, which could affect its readiness for
war, the government comptroller's office declared in a report
issued Monday.
   It also said the military does not keep close enough track of
U.S. aid.
   ``Ammunition stockpiles are a central part of army preparedness
for war,'' the report said. ``The findings of our survey show
significant malfunctions which must be rectified as soon as
possible.''
   Comptroller Yaacov Maltz presented the 983-page report at a news
conference. About one-fifth of it was devoted to the military.
   It said management problems have eroded the profitability of
Israel's large weapons industry, and investigators could not
determine exactly what use was made of $1.8 billion in U.S.
military aid in 1986 because it was lumped with other
foreign-currency expenditures.
   Maltz's report did not suggest the money was misspent but said
records of how it was used were inadequate.
   ``Some of the budget in foreign currency is allocated along with
American assistance funds, without any differentiation to monitor
what is being purchased with what money,'' it said.
   The comptroller said the investigations, conducted last year,
found shortages of essential weapons. He blamed them on cuts in the
defense budget, red tape and a need to divert funds to other
projects he did not name.
   His report said surveys found inadequate supplies of 105mm tank
shells, 155mm and 175mm artillery shells and mortars. In keeping
with army regulations, no figures were given.
   Maltz said a more detailed report was delivered to the military.
Eitan Haber, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said the army is
prohibited by law from responding publicly to such reports.
   Other parts of the Maltz document said training courses for
soldiers were inadequate and lists of ammunition storage depots
were outdated, raising questions about public safety. It cited
shortages of emergency medical supplies, food, water and shelters
in northern settlements bordering Lebanon.
   A section on the weapons industry criticized one of Israel's
leading arms developers, Rafael Armament Development Authority, for
losing money in major arms deals. Most losses are covered by the
Defense Ministry.
   It mentioned a $35 million deal by Rafael in which the military
was expected to absorb a $3.3 million loss. Instead, projected
losses had reached $11.7 million and could total nearly $15
million, according to the report.
   Because of censorship regulations it gave no further details of
the 1966 contract, but said ``the economic viability of the project
was not adequately checked.''
   Elsewhere in his report, Maltz was critical of the public health
system, which has been disrupted by strikes and other job actions
by doctors, nurses and maintenance staff. The report said more than
30,000 Israelis had to wait up to three years for operations as a
result.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Europe welcomed the re-election of
Francois Mitterrand as president of France, and political leaders
of all persuasions sent their congratulations Monday.
   Commentators foresaw uncertainty for France with a Socialist
president and rightist-dominated Parliament, but that was the case
before the election. They complimented Mitterrand for running a
shrewd campaign and criticized the tactics of his conservative
opponent, Premier Jacques Chirac.
   Congratulations from around the world cut across ideological
lines.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany looked forward to
continued cooperation between the two governments. His conservative
Christian Democrats said in a statement: ``The proven
Europe-oriented tandem of Kohl-Mitterrand will be able to continue
its successful work in the future.''
   Austria's Socialist chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, expressed
satisfaction that Chirac failed and praised Mitterrand's ``moderate
and statesmanlike policies.'' Another socialist, Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou of Greece, said those policies would strengthen
his country's relations with France.
   Some conservative newspapers welcomed the re-election despite
their idealogical opposition to Mitterrand.
   ``If not more than two cheers are in order for Mr. Mitterrand's
triumph, it is hard to weep many tears of chagrin over Mr. Chirac's
defeat,'' said London's Financial Times.
   It accused Chirac of ``grotesque attempts'' to win votes:
gaining the release of French hostages in Lebanon after ``scarcely
glorious negotiations with their captors,'' ordering a bloody
attack on New Caledonian separatists and allowing a French secret
service agent convicted in the bombing of a Greenpeace
environmentalist ship to return home despite an exile agreement.
   The left-leaning Guardian said Mitterrand's victory ``is not
only deserved but also in his country's best interests as well as a
relief for France's Western allies.''
   It said of Chirac: ``The nakedness of the loser's ambition and
his readiness to mortgage French interests at home and abroad in
the pursuit of personal power finally outweighed his undisputed
talents and phenomenal energy.''
   El Pais, a Spanish center-left daily, said said Chirac ``dared
to put at risk traditional values and interests to win votes. It is
the opposite of what a responsible statesman must do.''
   Sweden's main Social Democratic paper, Aftenbladet, said the
result placed Chirac's future in doubt and seriously diminished the
legacy of Charles de Gaulle.
   ``One thing is certain,'' it said in an editorial. ``Most of the
Gaullism that has so long dominated the picture is now eliminated.''
   A conservative Belgian paper, La Libre Belgique, said: ``The
French did not let themselves be impressed by the increased
spectacles put on in recent days by a Jacques Chirac visibly on the
ropes and for whom defeat is all the more scalding.''
   In opposition to Mitterrand, said Switzerland's independent Le
Matin, ``there was nothing but unrest, divisions, sectarianism and
demagogy.''
   In the Soviet Union, leader Mikhail Gorbatchev hailed
Mitterrand's success and expressed a wish for ``our personal
contacts to play their positive role in promoting disarmament,
building the common European house, settling regional conflicts,
building trust, and improving the international climate on the
whole.''

   Unidentified men in a van fired at
troops guarding a television transmitter late today, wounding at
least one soldier, the military said.
   Sgt. Estelito Cadag of the Philippine Constabulary's Capital
Command said the shooting continued for more than 30 minutes as the
troops, in their confusion, also fired at responding policemen and
soldiers.
   ``The guards thought that the responding troops belonged to the
same group that had attacked them,'' Cadag said by telephone.
   He said an investigation was under way to determine the
identities of the men in the van and establish the reason for the
attack. Cadag said the attack occurred at 10 p.m.
   Dozens of troops rushed to the Kanlaon Broadcasting System
transmitter in suburban Quezon City and other broadcast facilities
in the capital to increase security at the installations.
   Military guards were posted at various radio and television
stations in the capital following at least six coup attempts
against President Corazon Aquino's government during the past two
years.

<HEAD>Hot Primary Races for Nebraska Senate, West Virginia Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Nebraska Sen. David Karnes and West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore
face tough Republican primary fights Tuesday, while Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd is heavily favored to win West Virginia's
Democratic nomination to a sixth term.
   Karnes, 39, was a political unknown when he was appointed last
year by Gov. Kay Orr to complete the term of the late Democratic
Sen. Edward Zorinsky. He is being aggressively challenged by
four-term Rep. Hal Daub, who wanted the Senate appointment for
himself.
   Daub, 47, has accused Karnes of being a ``rubber stamp'' for Orr
and President Reagan and said he had ``flip-flopped'' on many votes
to please the president, including the trade bill and last year's
highway bill that raised the speed limit to 65 mph.
   Karnes has said he will not answer such name-calling, but Mrs.
Orr said last week it was ``sad'' that Daub ``feels he has to take
a desperate approach.''
   An Omaha World-Herald poll last week showed Karnes backed by 41
percent of those interviewed, while Daub was supported by 40
percent. Nineteen percent were undecided, and the margin of error
was 4 percentage points.
   Whoever wins the GOP primary is expected to face 44-year-old
former Gov. Bob Kerrey, whose only opponent in the Democratic
primary is Ken Michaelis, a 45-year-old disbarred lawyer.
   In Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, where Daub is giving
up his seat, four Democrats are seeking the nomination, including
Cece Zorinsky, widow of the senator.
   In West Virginia, Moore is seeking a fourth term as he battles
Morgantown millionaire John Raese in the Republican race for
governor. On the Democratic side, seven candidates are vying for
the nomination.
   Moore, 65, trailed in early polls but has surged ahead, pushing
the theme that his state is making an economic recovery. He takes
credit for cutting taxes by $311 million in the past four years,
although he fought most of the cuts when they were imposed by the
Legislature.
   He also cites his accomplishments at bringing news businesses
and bringing 30,000 jobs to the state, although the total number of
employed West Virginians has increased by just 5,700 since Moore
took office in 1985.
   Raese, 38, maintains the state is in perilous financial shape
and said Moore made just 10 percent of $385 million in budget cuts
recommended by the Governor's Task Force on Waste Management.
   Raese, who has a reputation as a ``rich kid'' who loves fast
boats and hard living, lost to another millionaire, Jay
Rockefeller, in his first try for office in the 1986 Senate race.
   Moore was the subject of an NBC report Sunday in which former
Mingo County political boss Johnie Owens said Moore offered him
$12,000 to include his name on a list of recommended candidates
when Moore was running for re-election in 1972. A Moore spokesman
called the report ``a piece of garbage,'' and Raese said he was
``saddened by the whole event.''
   The leading Democratic contenders for governor appear to be
former House of Delegates Speaker Clyde See _ the 1984 nominee _
and Charleston insurance executive Gaston Caperton, who waged an
increasingly bitter war of negative television commercials.
   Byrd, 71, is opposed in the Democratic primary by Huntington
moving company owner Bob Myers. Byrd says he will give up the
majority leader's job to become Senate Appropriations Committee
chairman if he is re-elected and Democrats retain control of the
Senate.
   In the GOP Senate primary, state Sen. Jay Wolfe is expected to
defeat Bernie Lumbert of Buckhannon, an unemployed welfare
recipient.
   Of West Virginia's four U.S. representatives, all Democrats,
only Nick Joe Rahall of the 4th District is opposed. He faces
former state legislator Ted Stacy and lawyer William Sanders.

<HEAD>Iraq Building New Oil Pipeline to Boost Strategic Position</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq is building a new pipeline that will
allow it to pump oil through either Turkey or Saudi Arabia, The
Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday.
   The pipeline is expected to be completed by 1990 and would
increase Iraq's ability to maintain exports vital to Baghdad's war
effort against Iran.
   The respected weekly oil industry newsletter, published in
Nicosia, said the 400-mile, 42-inch line will parallel an existing
north-south pipeline running the length of the country. It will
hook into a network linking Iraqi oilfields with outlets across
Saudi Arabia in the south and Turkey in the north, the weekly said.
   The project will secure Iraq's ability to pump its oil safely
out of the war zone. Iran, its foe in the 7{-year-old war, has to
send its tankers to run the gantlet of Iraqi fighter-bombers
through the Persian Gulf.
   The pipeline also would remove the threat to the industrialized
world if Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz, the only way in and out
of the gulf.
   The Iraqis already have three pipelines linking their southern
oilfields with Saudi Arabia's Red Sea terminal of Yanbu and their
northern oilfields with the Turkish port of Yumurtalik on the
Mediterranean. They carry an estimated 2.5 million barrels of oil a
day. About 200,000 barrels a day are trucked across Jordan and
Turkey.
   The new pipeline will have a capacity of 900,000 barrels a day,
the survey said.
   The Iraqis began building their pipeline network several years
ago after the war cut them off from their main export terminals in
the northern gulf and Syria closed a pipeline to the Mediterranean
that crossed its territory.
   Syria, Iran's main Arab ally, has been feuding with Iraq for
eight years. The two countries are ruled by rival wings of the
Baath Socialist Party.
   In the early days of the war, Iraq's oil exports plummetted to
about 650,000 barrels a day.
   Now, Iraq is developing new oilfields in southern and central
Iraq which industry experts say could boost production to around 5
million barrels a day by the end of the next decade.
   The drive to boost exports is vital to Iraq. The war, which
costs it at least $10 billion a year, has increased its foreign
debt to an estimated $50 billion. By next year, providing oil price
remain stable, Iraq could expect to earn $15 billion from crude
exports.
   In contrast, Iran has pegged its anticipated oil revenue, on
which it also relies to pay for its war effort, at only $9 billion.
   The Iraqi air force has been pounding Iran's oil industry and
tankers in a bid to throttle Iran's economic lifeline. The war and
the threat to shipping have touched off a frenzy of pipeline
building and planning by Persian Gulf states.
   Saudi Arabia is upgrading its network, and Kuwait and Abu Dahbi
are studying new pipelines. Iran is racing to build pipelines to
its Arabia Sea coast to avoid the dangerous gulf route.
   The Oslo-based International Association of Independent Tanker
Owners said in a recent report that pipelines now under
construction will cut demand for supertankers by 46 cargoes a year
between the Persian Gulf and Western Europe.

   Motorists nationwide are paying an average of
$1 a gallon for gasoline, an increase of more than a penny a gallon
over the past two weeks, an industry analyst said.
   The increase of 1.41 cents a gallon was a ``dramatically slowed
rate compared to the rises surveyed during April,'' Trilby Lundberg
said Sunday.
   The average price of gasoline was 100.25 cents a gallon,
according to the bi-weekly Lundberg Survey check of prices at about
12,000 gas stations in every state. The latest survey was completed
Saturday.
   The previous survey showed an increase of 2.67 cents a gallon in
the average price, which includes all grades, self- and full-serve
pumps, cash and credit prices and taxes.
   As of May 6, at self-service pumps prices per gallon were:
regular unleaded, 91.46 cents; premium unleaded, 105.86 cents;
regular leaded, 88.56 cents.
   At full-service pumps prices were: regular unleaded, 119.56
cents; premium unleaded, 129.50 cents; regular leaded, 115.29 cents.
   The Lundberg Survey inadvertently reported a preliminary rather
than a final set of numbers on Sunday, Ms. Lundberg said.

   The chief magistrate Monday dropped
charges against a former Cabinet minister who was arrested 19
months ago on allegations of treason and terrorism.
   Magistrate Constance Byamugisha said the state failed to produce
enough evidence against David Lwanga, who was minister of
environment protection in President Yoweri Museveni's government at
the time of his arrest in October 1986.
   Lwanga, 45, was arrested with 18 other people and charged with
plotting to forcefully overthrow Museveni's government. Museveni
seized power in January 1986 after a 5-year bush war.
   The treason charges against Lwanga were dropped last year for
lack of evidence, but police immediately re-arrested him on
terrorism charges stemming from the same case in which he was
accused of possessing a machine gun and 150 rounds of ammunition.
   Courts also have freed for lack of evidence most of the 18
people arrested with Lwanga. Among those still in jail is former
Vice President Paulo Muwanga, who faces a reduced charge of illegal
detention.

   ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Into the Woods''
and ``Anything Goes,'' three big musical hits, topped the list of
shows receiving Tony nominations today as the best of the 1987-88
Broadway season.
   All three productions received 10 nominations each, with
``Phantom'' and ``Into the Woods'' competing in the best musical
category and ``Anything Goes'' nominated as a revival.
   Also nominated for best musical were ``Romance@Romance'' and the
South African musical ``Sarafina!''
   ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' by August Wilson received six
nominations, including best play. It will compete in that coveted
category against ``A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing, ``M.
Butterfly'' by David Henry Hwang and David Mamet's
``Speed-the-Plow.''
   Nominated for best actor in a play were Derek Jacobi, ``Breaking
the Code''; John Lithgow, ``M. Butterfly''; Robert Prosky, ``A Walk
in the Woods''; and Ron Silver, ``Speed-the-Plow.''
   Nominees for best actress were Joan Allen, ``Burn This''; Blythe
Danner, ``A Streetcar Named Desire''; Frances McDormand, ``A
Streetcar Named Desire''; and Glenda Jackson, ``Macbeth.''
   For actor in a musical, the nominees were Scott Bakula,
``Romance@Romance''; David Carrel Crawford,
``The Phantom of the Opera''; and Howard McGillin, ``Anything
Goes.''
   Actress in a musical nominations went to Alison Fraser,
``Romance@Romance''; Joanna Gleason, ``Into the Woods''; Judy Kuhn,
``Chess''; and Patti LuPone, ``Anything Goes.''
   There were several surprises among the shows and performers not
nominated. Sarah Brightman, wife of Andrew Lloyd Webber who stars
in his `` Phantom of the Opera'' was not nominated for best actress
in a musical. Neither did Bernadette Peters get a nod for her role
in ``Into the Woods.''
   Madonna, making her Broadway debut in ``Speed-the-Plow,'' also
failed to get a nomination as did John Malkovich for ``Burn This''
and Christopher Plummer for the revival of ``Macbeth.''
   Also snubbed was `Chess,'' the big British musical. It received
only two nominations _ for Kuhn and Carroll _ in the acting
categories.
   The Tonys are named for actress-director Antoinette Perry, who
was active in the American Theater Wing during the 1940s.
   The winners, voted by more than 600 theater professionals, will
be announced June 5 in a program broadcast nationally on CBS.

   The body of Agop Agopian, slain leader of
the terrorist Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia,
has been flown to Iraq for burial, a police spokesman said Monday.
   Agopian's body was shipped to Baghdad aboard a regular Iraqi
Airways flight Sunday night, said the spokesman, who requested
anonymity.
   Agopian's 24-year-old wife, Jeanine Tutusian, accompanied the
body. It will be buried in the northern Iraqi border town of Mosul.
   The ASALA leader was gunned down April 28 by a masked man
outside his home in Athens' Old Phaleron suburb.
   According to the spokesman, the ASALA leader was born Haritoun
Takoshian and his parents, Macardic and Siranoush Takoshian, still
live in Mosul.
   When he was killed, Agopian was carrying a South Yemen
diplomatic passport in the name of Abdul Mohammed Kasim.
   ASALA, founded by Agopian in 1975, seeks the foundation of an
independent Armenian state in eastern Turkey and vengeance for what
it claims was the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman
Turks in 1915-1916.

<HEAD>Jury Selection To Begin In Small's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Eight months after Stephen Small was found
dead before a $1 million ransom could be paid, the case is headed
for court.
   Jury selection begins Tuesday for Daniel J. Edwards, 31, one of
two people charged with kidnapping and murder.
   The jury will be selected in Rockford, then taken to Kankakee
and sequestered during the trial, expected to last up to three
weeks, said prosecutor Michael Ficaro.
   Edwards and Nancy D. Rish, 26, both of Bourbonnais, were
arrested two days after the abduction and hours before police found
Small's body Sept. 4 in woods between the Indiana border and
Kankakee, a city of 30,000 approximately 60 miles south of Chicago.
   No trial date has been set for Ms. Rish, who lived with Edwards.
   Small, 40, was kidnapped early Sept. 2, and a $1 million ransom
was demanded in telephone calls to his wife, Nancy.
   The family never received clear instructions for the cash
delivery.
   Small, the great-grandson of former Gov. Len Small and member of
a family with major media holdings, apparently had been buried
alive in about three feet of sand in a homemade box supplied with a
jug of water, candy bars and an unconnected battery-powered light.
   Air supplied through slits in the plywood by a plastic pipe
apparently ``was just not sufficient,'' said Kankakee County
Coroner James Orrison, who indicated Small died quickly.
   The Illinois attorney general's office has indicated it will
seek the death penalty for Edwards.
   Police said Small was lured from his restored Victorian home by
a telephone call from a person identifying himself as a policeman
and asking him to come to a house he used as an office because it
had been burglarized.
   Before dawn, Mrs. Small received a call saying her husband would
be found in a box if the ransom was not paid. The call included a
tape-recorded message from Small saying he had been kidnapped.
   Late in the day, a call with instructions for delivering the $1
million was unclear. The person promised to call back the next day,
but the Small family received no other calls.
   Police searching the area spotted the Smalls' 1987 Mercedes-Benz
on Sept. 4 about 13 miles southeast of Kankakee and soon discovered
the buried box containing the body.
   At a court hearing Sept. 8, Larry Beaumont, Assistant Kankakee
County State's Attorney, said Edwards had made ``statements and
confessions'' and led police to Small's body.
   Edwards, who described himself as an unemployed electrician and
the father of two, slashed his wrist in the Kankakee County jail
the following day. The wound was closed with eight stitches.
   Small had been vice president of Mid America Media, a group that
owned radio and cable television stations, but the company was sold
in 1986.

   The White House denounced Donald T. Regan
today as exploiting the presidency with his book detailing Nancy
Reagan's interest in astrology, but left open the question of
whether stargazing still plays a role in presidential scheduling.
   President Reagan said again that he never used astrology to make
policy decisions.
   At a Rose Garden ceremony honoring small business executives,
Reagan was asked whether he permits the consultation of
astrologists in connection with schedules and public appearances.
   ``Well, you asked for it,'' he replied. ``I can't because I
never did.''
   Moments later, however, Reagan's chief spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, said the president had misunderstood the question
shouted by a reporter from the rear of the Rose Garden. Reagan
thought he was being asked whether astrology was being used to make
key policy decisions, Fitzwater said.
   So Reagan was in effect merely reiterating a statement he made
last Friday, denying that stargazing played a role in policy
decisions, his spokesman said.
   Earlier, Fitzwater left open the question of whether astrology
still plays a role in scheduling.
   For her part, the first lady says she will keep talking to her
astrologer, her spokeswoman said.
   Fitzwater told reporters that President Reagan feels ``deep
personal disapointment with this breach of confidence.''
   ``I was taken aback by the vengefulness of the attack. It comes
through to me that Don Regan doesn't really like me,'' Mrs. Reagan
was quoted as saying by her press secretary.
   Fitzwater gave a sharply-worded statement to reporters as the
first lengthy White House reaction to the book by the former White
House chief of staff entitled, ``For the Record: from Wall Street
to Washington.''
   In the book, Regan contended Reagan ``laid down no rules and
articulated no missions'' while his wife presided over a ``shadowy
distaff presidency'' heavily influenced by astrological advice.
   ``The new book by Donald Regan is a kiss-and-tell story in the
mold of all books that seek to exploit the presidency or the first
family for personal self-interest,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The president emphasized last week that he made no policy
decisions based on astrology. We recognize that the first lady has
an interest in astrology,'' he added.
   The spokesman defended the first lady's interest in stargazing,
as well as her input into the preparation of the president's
schedule.
   ``She has every reason to make contributions on presidential
schedules and activities,'' Fitzwater said. ``She has every right
to continue it,'' he added at another point.
   Asked repeatedly whether she continued to rely on astrological
predictions in such matters, Fitzwater replied, ``I don't know.''
   The spokesman also took issue with Regan's contention that
astrology played a major role in decisions about the president's
schedule. Asked about any factual errors in the book, Fitzwater
replied there were ``a whole lot of things, but we're simply not
going to go into it.''
   ``I know the first lady is very upset about anybody trying to
exploit her concerns for her husband's safety and welfare,'' he
said.
   Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press secretary, said today
that Mrs. Reagan told her she intends to keep talking to the
astrologer. The woman has been identified as a San Francisco
socialite, Joan Quigley.
   Asked if the first lady will continue to use astrology in
helping plan the president's schedule, Mrs. Crispen said only,
``She will more than likely continue to talk to this person because
she does get some comfort from it.''
   ``It doesn't control their lives ... she doesn't see any harm in
it,'' Mrs. Crispen added.
   Regan's book details his allegations that Mrs. Reagan consulted
an astrologer about scheduling of presidential events.
   The book pictures Reagan as a reluctant decision-maker, saying,
``Never did he issue a direct order, although I, at least,
sometimes devoutly wished that he would.''
   ``He listened, acquiesced, played his role, and waited for the
next act to be written,'' Regan wrote of the president who dumped
him in favor of former Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr. at the height of
the furor over the Iran-Contra affair. Mrs. Reagan was widely
reported at the time to have a played a major role in influencing
the president to replace Regan.
   The White House issued a statement Sunday saying:
``Vindictiveness and revenge are not admirable qualities, and are
not worthy of comment. Donald Regan's attempts to defame the first
lady, on Mother's Day no less, are certainly in that category.''
   In an interview Sunday, Regan said, ``I don't think this is an
attack on his wife. ... There are no adjectives, no deprecation of
the first lady. I merely told the story of what she did or didn't
do during my period as chief of staff.''
   The former chief of staff said he regarded Mrs. Reagan's
interest in astrology as a harmless eccentricity at first and ``it
wasn't until it began to impinge and in my judgment harm the
presidency in the latter part of 1986 and early 1987 that I began
to protest.''
   Regan said he was donating all of his proceeds from the book,
published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, to charity.
   In his book, the former chief of staff wrote ``my admiration for
Reagan as president remains very great'' although ``my judgment of
him as a man, in light of my final experience as his chief of
staff, underwent a certain change.''
   Over and over, however, he described the president as a leader
who holds the reins lightly.
   ``Theodore Roosevelt believed that the president could conduct
his office in any way that was not specifically prohibited by the
Constitution,'' he wrote. ``Reagan, who laid down no rules and
articulated no missions, conferred a Rooseveltian latitude on his
subordinates.''
   Regan, who was secretary of the treasury before moving to the
White House, said that in his four years at the Treasury
Department, ``I never saw President Reagan alone and never
discussed economic philosophy or fiscal and monetary policy with
him man to man.
   ``From first day to last at Treasury, I was flying by the seat
of my pants. The president never told me what he believed or what
he wanted to accomplish in the field of economics. I had to figure
these things out like any other American, by studying his speeches
and reading the newspapers.''
   As for the first lady, he said, ``Mrs. Reagan regarded herself
as the president's alter ego not only in the conjugal but also in
the political and official dimensions, as if the office that had
been bestowed upon her husband by the people somehow fell into the
category of worldly goods covered by the marriage vows.''
   He said of Mike Deaver, who served as deputy chief of staff
before Regan came to the White House, that ``his function in the
White House had as much to do with the mysterious process of
managing this shadowy distaff presidency as with his visible role
as the custodian of the presidential image.''
   Regan says that ``virtually every major move and decision the
Reagans made during my time as White House chief of staff was
cleared in advance with a woman in San Francisco who drew up
horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable
alignment for the enterprise.'
   He said he did not know the woman's identity. However, Time
magazine, which published excerpts from the book, identified her as
Joan Quigley of San Francisco. Ms. Quigley confirmed in a telephone
interview that she had been giving Mrs. Reagan astrological advice
since shortly after the assassination attempt on the president in
1981.

<TEXT>
   The Hollywood Hills home where band leader
Woody Herman was nearly evicted shortly before his death must be
sold and half the proceeds given to his daughter, a judge ruled.
   Herman bought the home from Humphrey Bogart in 1946 for $50,000.
He and his wife gave it to their daughter, Ingrid Herman Reese, in
1982.
   But the Internal Revenue Service seized the house in 1985 to
offset a $1.6 million tax debt accrued in the 1960s via delinquent
payments by members of Herman's Thundering Herd band. The house was
sold to William Little for $99,000, a third of its value.
   Ms. Reese, who was given no notice of the IRS sale, argued she
should still hold a half interest in the house.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Mallano agreed, ruling Friday that
the IRS didn't properly notify Ms. Reese of its plans to sell the
property.
   Little had sought to evict Herman and Ms. Reese last September
for failure to pay rent. A judge intervened and Herman was allowed
to live there with his daughter until he died in October.

<HEAD>Treasury Urges Caution On Tougher Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department urged Congress Monday
to proceed cautiously on proposals that would toughen the tax on
some activities of colleges, hospitals and other organizations
which generally are exempt from taxation.
   Such changes could force universities, for example, to pay tax
on income earned from their cafeterias, or tax hospitals on profits
from their pharmacies.
   ``It would be premature to make far-reaching changes to the law
at this time,'' Don Chapoton, assistant secretary of the treasury
for tax policy, told the House Ways and Means oversight
subcommittee.
   If numerous proposals being weighed are ever formalized into a
bill, he added, ``it will be important to assess the over-all
impact of such legislation on tax-exempt organizations in order to
determine whether the benefits of the legislation justify the
imposition of such burdens.''
   Several members of Congress favor strengthening the special tax
on non-profit organizations' income that is not related to the
purpose for which their tax exemption was granted. The levy is
known as the ``unrelated-business-income tax.''
   The tax was enacted in 1950 to protect taxable enterprises that
find themselves competing with exempt organizations. The tax
produced $119 million last year _ almost double the 1986 figure _
from 30,500 organizations. There is some evidence, officials said,
that this increase was attributable to subcommittee hearings last
year, which were widely followed by non-profit groups.
   The increased collections, said Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, the
committee chairman, were ``a result of either better compliance by
tax-exempt organizations or a dramatic growth in income-producing
activities subject to the tax or both.''
   The Treasury Department estimates that if all the toughest
proposals being considered were enacted, the maximum yield would be
no more than $5 billion a year.
   Chapoton noted, however, that the tax does more than produce
revenue and protect taxable competitors. The tax ``also serves the
important goals of enhancing the efficiency of the governmental
subsidy inherent in tax exemption and of helping to ensure the
accountability of tax-exempt organizations.''
   Although Chapoton endorsed some of the several suggestions the
subcommittee drafted last year for tightening the tax, he rejected
two major changes.
   Present law exempts from tax a non-profit organization's income
generated by a business that is ``substantially related'' to the
organization's exempt purpose. The proposal would exempt income
only if ``directly related.'' That would generate considerable
uncertainty without improving the standard, Chapoton said.
   He also said the administration opposes a suggestion that
Congress declare what specific income-producing activities standing
alone by themselves should be tax-exempt. Under that test, Chapoton
said, operations of dormitories, dining halls and hospital
pharmacies likely would be taxable.
   A long line of witnesses gave the subcommittee advice on all
sides of the issue.
   _American Arts Alliance: ``Due to recent changes in federal tax
and spending policies, rising costs at non-profit arts institutions
and stagnant federal funding, this is no time to make any further
changes in policies that have stimulated the growth of the arts in
America.''
   _National Association of College Stores: ``Some institutional
bookstores pay more in taxes than many small businesses. This
suggests that ... (the present tax) is working.''
   _Small Business Administration: Present law has ``allowed
non-profits to earn non-taxable income from activities never
contemplated by Congress in carving out their original exemption.
The distinction between the two sectors has become blurred _ in
some instances, beyond recognition.''
   _Independent Sector, representing numerous charities and other
non-profit organizations: Several proposals being considered by the
subcommittee ``would result in changes going far beyond corrected
perceived abuses and anomalies to radically altering the way the
tax system affects the viability of charities in this country.''

<TEXT>
   Science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein,
whose ``Stranger in a Strange Land'' is one of the classics of the
genre, has died at his home at the age of 80.
   His death was announced today by the Monterey County Coroner's
office.
   Heinlein, who moved to this small tourist community recently,
died on Sunday, according to the coroner's office.
   The cause of death was not known.
   Heinlein wrote more than 45 books, some of which were turned
into movies, and received science fiction's highest awards,
including the Hugo.
   Born in Butler, Mo., Heinlein graduated from the U.S. Naval
Academy in 1929 and served for five years, including time on the
carrier USS Lexington, then worked in other fields before beginning
a writing career that saw him become one of the most popular and
prolific writers of science fiction.
   Heinlein won numerous awards for his novels and short stories,
written in a simple, spare matter-of-fact style that made them
popular with both children and adults.
   He won the Best Science Fiction Novel award from the World
Science Fiction Convention in 1956, 1959, 1961 and 1966; the Nebula
award from the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1975 and an
unprecedented four Hugo awards; in 1956 for ``Double Star,'' in
1959 for ``Starship Troopers,'' in 1961 for ``Stranger in a Strange
Land'' and in 1966 for ``The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.''
   Other works include ``The Green Hills of Earth,'' ``The Door
into Summer,'' ``Methusalah's Childen,'' ``Puppet Masters,'' and
``Job _ A Comedy of Justice.''
   Heinlein held post-graduate degrees in physics and mathematics
from the University of California at Los Angeles, and served as an
aviation engineer for the Navy during World War II. As an engineer,
he wrote a number of non-fiction technical books and articles.
   A strong supporter of the military throughout his life, Heinlein
was a guest commentator during the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969.
   Although he was politically conservative, Heinlein's ``Stranger
in a Strange Land,'' published in 1961, became one of the
counterculture's handbooks. Its hero, alien Valentine Smith, became
a symbol of the hope for universal amity for his ability to
harmonize _ or ``grok'' _ readily with humans.
   Heinlein is survived by his wife, Virginia. The couple had no
children.

   Vice President George Bush knew of allegations
of drug trafficking by the government of Gen. Manuel Noriega well
before the Panamanian's indictment earlier this year, but viewed
the information as speculative, a campaign official said Monday.
   Peter Teeley, spokesman for Bush's Republican presidential
campaign, said Panama was just one of a number of countries about
which there were such reports. He repeated Bush's central
contention that he did not have clear evidence of Noriega's alleged
drug dealing until Noriega's indictment in Florida in February.
   The question of exactly when Bush learned of Noriega's alleged
role in drug-dealing has become a major issue in the presidential
race. It was raised in the Republican primaries before Bush locked
up the GOP nomination and now is being pressed by Democrats Michael
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
   Bush has consistently maintained he had no direct knowledge of a
Noriega role in drug trafficking _ just as he has said he lacked
early knowledge in the other case that follows him as he campaigns,
the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair.
   Democratic front-runner Dukakis frequently criticizes what he
calls ``dealing with drug-running Panamanian dictators'' by the
Reagan-Bush administration. And Jesse Jackson asserts, ``The reason
Mr. Bush has not led the charge to fight drugs is because he knew
of the administration's dealings with the drug dealers.''
   Critics have asserted that, either Bush knew more than he is
saying on the subject or, if he didn't, he should have as head of
the South Florida Task Force, a federal drug-inderdiction effort,
in the early 1980s.
   Bush, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has
made the war on drugs a major campaign issue, challenging both
Dukakis and Jackson to stand with him in supporting the death
penalty for ``drug kingpins.''
   Teeley said Bush's assertion that he had no prior knowledge of
specific Noriega drug dealings does not suggest Bush was completely
in the dark.
   ``I think anybody who knows anything about what's gone on in the
world of international narcotics trafficking is fully aware that
there are all sorts of rumors and reports about foreign officials
being involved in drug trafficking, money laundering and payoffs.
Some turn out to be accurate, some are not,'' Teeley said.
   ``We heard all sorts of accusations about the government in the
Bahamas, Columbia, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico and Panama,'' he added.
``But the question is, when do you get concrete evidence that
soemthing of this nature is indeed true?''
   The New York Times, quoting unidentified administration
officials, said in Sunday editions that the former U.S. ambassador
to Panama, Everett E. Briggs, told Bush during a December 1985
meeting about the allegations. However, Briggs told reporters in
Hondurus, his present post, that he had not presented Bush with
evidence of a Noriega-drugs link.
   ``I think that the ambassador's comments speak for themselves,''
Teeley said Monday.
   Asked during a campaign stop in Los Angeles last Thursday
whether he ever had been told of reports of ties between Noriega
and drug trafficking, Bush said, ``Not that I was ever aware of.''
   He also said that, even now, he does not know much ``about the
specifics of the indictment.'' Asked if he would advocate the death
penalty for Noriega if he is tried and convicted, Bush said: ``I'd
like to see the evidence behind the allegations.''
   Meanwhile, administration and Bush campaign officials, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity, said that President Reagan will
formally endorse Bush on Wednesday, most likely in a White House
ceremony in advance of a Wednesday GOP banquet that both the
president and Bush will attend.

   Peter Lord Carrington, the outgoing secretary
general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was presented
the Pentagon's highest civilian award Monday and lauded as ``just
the right leader'' for the times.
   ``This ceremony represents the heartfelt tribute of one nation
among the many he served, a tribute on behalf of all citizens who
today live markedly more secure because of this man's dedication,''
said Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, crediting Carrington with
helping secure a new arms treaty with the Soviet Union.
   Carrington was honored with the Defense Department Medal for
Distinguished Public Service during ceremonies that featured honor
guards from each U.S. armed service, a cannon salute and two bands,
including a fife and drum corps.
   Carrington responded by saying he wished he had a NATO medal
that could be presented to Carlucci and his predecessor, Caspar W.
Weinberger, in thanks for America's commitment to a free Europe.
   ``Nobody ... could fail to be impressed by the morale, by the
readiness, by the competence of the United States forces assigned
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,'' hen said.
   ``You should be proud of them, and we should be grateful. I know
that it is a heavy burden for the United States to keep the forces
that you have throughout the world.''
   Carrington, an Englishman who has led the 16-nation NATO
alliance since 1984, will be replaced this month by West German
Defense Minister Manfred Woerner.
   His reference to the heavy burden born by the United States
comes at a time when a growing number of congressional leaders are
demanding that America's allies in Europe along with Japan and
South Korea contribute more to the common defense.
   Carrington said he hoped the United States bore the burden
``because you believe it's in the interest of the United States as
well as in the interests of your allies _ because self-interest is
more lasting a basis than general goodwill.''

<HEAD>West German Cadet Ship Visits Haifa, First By Military Unit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAIFA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German cadet ship sailed into this
Mediterranean port Monday in the first visit by a German military
unit to the Jewish state.
   The West German ambassador cited the port call as an example of
solid bilateral relations.
   Some Israelis, however, said they felt uneasy at the sight of
German military men strolling through Haifa's streets.
   ``They are young people and I have nothing against them,'' said
Moshe Biermann, 54, a bank clerk who lived through World War II as
a boy in Romania.
   ``But when I see a German uniform, I still feel a stab in my
heart,'' he added as seven cadets wearing traditional
white-and-blue sailor suits passed him on Haifa's bustling main
street.
   The three-mast sailing ship Gorch Fock is in Haifa for a
five-day stay that will include a soccer match between German and
Israeli cadets, visits to Israeli families and a trip to the
Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.
   The port call in Haifa is part of an 11-month sail around the
world for the Gorch Forck before it returns to its homeport, Kiel,
in June. Stops have included France, Mexico, the United States,
Australia and Oman on the Persian Gulf.
   West German Ambassador Wilhelm Haas described the relationship
between the defense establishments of Germany and Israel as good,
and said ``the visit of the ship fits very well into this picture.''
   Israel is selling ammunition, aircraft and remote-control
vehicles to West Germany, and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin visited Bonn last year.
   Asked about the feelings of unease expressed by some Israelis,
Haas said: ``German officers come here, as Israeli officers come to
Germany. They don't hide their uniforms. Why should they.''
   But some cadets said they were apprehensive before coming to
Israel.
   ``It's a mixed feeling,'' said Peter Fromm, 21, of Duesseldorf.
``We don't know what the reaction is going to be. We were advised
that if there was a problem, we should remain calm.''
   Added Uwe Kroll, 23, of Bremerhaven: ``We are not here for our
amusement, like in Australia, where we had one party after another.
Here especially, you feel like a representative of Germany.''
   As the cadets strolled through the steep streets to buy film and
souvenirs, some passers-by stopped and turned when they heard the
young sailors speaking German.
   ``Who are they, Germans?'' one passer-by asked this reporter.
``You shouldn't be talking to them after what they have done to our
people.''
   During a beer break at a downtown cafe, the cadets said that
before their arrival, they were briefed about Israel, especially
the Holocaust in which six million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.
   ``We were told that nearly every family in Haifa was affected by
the Holocaust,'' said Kroll, whose grandfather served in Hitler's
navy. He said he would like to meet an Israeli family, but that he
had to stand guard at the time such visits are scheduled.
   ``We talked about the Holocaust, about the guilt of the German
people,'' said Karl Friedrich Schinkel, a West German navy
spokesman who briefed the cadets. ``We didn't prettify anything.''
   An Israeli navy vessel was docked next to the Gorch Fock, and an
Israeli reserve soldier, who would only identify himself as Rafi,
walked over to take a closer look at the 90-meter-long white barque
equipped with 23 sails.
   ``It's beautiful,'' he said. ``I don't care if it's from
Germany, or Holland or any other place.''
   Added another Israeli soldier: ``Time has passed. We are buying
their cars and their machines. But we will never forget.''

   Two units of a coal-powered electric plant
were knocked out of service Monday when a spectacular fire roared
through one unit, but no serious injuries were reported, a company
spokesman said.
   ``Unit 2 suffered minor damage and should be back in operation
in about a week, but Unit 1 sustained major damage,'' said Jeff
Fela, a spokesman for Seminole Electric Cooperative in Tampa.
   Fela said Monday it was too early to estimate the damage.
   The fire erupted early Monday in the seal oil system in the
turbine generator. Seal oil is a lubricating fluid that forms a
seal that keeps hydrogen gas from escaping into the atmosphere,
Fela said. Hydrogen gas is a standard coolant for electric
generators.
   One person, believed to be a worker at the $1.2 billion Seminole
Electric Cooperative Plant, was treated at the scene for unknown
injuries, said Capt. James White of the Palatka Fire Department.
   Fire crews expected to be on the scene most of Monday, spraying
down hot spots, said Maj. Paul Usina of the Putnam County Sheriff's
Office.
   The two 600-megawatt coal-fired generators are located on a
2,000-acre site six miles north of Palatka.
   The fire ``was all through the building, from the bottom up, but
it was more or less contained on the higher floors by our men,''
Palatka fire dispatcher Elizabeth Ward said.
   The fire was not expected to have any impact on power to
customers of Seminole, Fela said.

   Actor Tom Selleck _ now officially unemployed _
says he watched the two-hour ``Magnum, P.I.'' finale at co-star
Larry Manetti's house in Los Angeles, and is thrilled the show
clobbered its competition.
   The final episode of the CBS series, which aired May 1, topped
the week's ratings.
   ``I'm delighted the show went out such a winner,'' Selleck said.
``To go out absolutely on top is about as nice as anything that
could happen to the show,'' Selleck said in the The Sunday

   Selleck said he starts work on a new movie in July, and will
take it easy until then.
   ``I'm going to disappear,'' he said. ``I am officially
unemployed.''
   The last time he was out of work was in 1980, but then he wasn't
so grateful for the free time. He arrived in Honolulu expecting to
begin filming ``Magnum.'' But the Screen Actors Guild went on
strike, and Selleck had no regular paycheck.
   ``I went to work for $7 an hour for my landlady as a handyman to
help pay the rent,'' he said.

   Long before Maddie Hayes met David Addison, her

   ``I don't think I've told anybody this, but yes, I went out with

<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Monday that each year of
his administration has seen ``unparalleled growth'' of small
business and that the climate has never been better for
entrepeneurs.
   ``The record, quite simply, is incredible,'' he said at a Rose
Garden ceremony honoring small business. ``Small business provides
well over two-thirds of all new jobs; about 40 percent of our
aggregate national output; the bulk of new products and
technologies; most of the jobs generated for younger, older and
female workers; and over 66 percent of all `first jobs.'''
   Reagan said the past five years have seen the longest unbroken
period of peacetime growth on record.
   ``The climate necessary to nurture small business development
has never been better,'' Reagan said. ``Clearly the econopmic
policies of the 1980s ... have made it immensely easier to start up
a small business and keep it going.''
   The ceremony coincided with the administration's seventh report
to Congress on the state of small business.
   ``Small business news continues to be good news,'' the report
said. ``The continuation of this strong small business record is a
national priority.''
   Reagan presented plaques as ``Business Persons of the year'' to
boyhood friends Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, who started Ben and
Jerry's Homemade Inc. of South Burlington, Vt., and made it the
third largest distributor in U.S.
   ``Beginning with two employees in 1978, the company now employs
200, and the $8,000 in start-up money now generates annual sales of
$30 million selling to grocery stores in 35 states and in 45 ice
cream parlors around the country,'' Reagan said.
   The president also told the White House guests that ``small
business is about hopes and dreams,'' making dreams come true.
``Those dreams, those hopes,'' he said, ``are a singular and great
natural resource.''

   Forensic specialists identified another body
Monday from the Shell Oil Co. refinery explosion, and emergency
crews searched for a final missing person, company officials said.
   Six Shell employees are known dead, and 42 were injured when the
gasoline-refining unit blew up here and caught fire before dawn
Thursday.
   A seventh Shell worker has yet to be found. The blast damaged at
least 250 homes in Norco and broke windows 20 miles away in New
Orleans.
   The dead man identified Monday was Roland Satterlee, 35, of
LaPlace, said Shell spokeswoman Sarah Colletti. His was one of
three badly burned bodies recovered from the plant Friday.
   FBI forensics specialists joined in the recovery effort Sunday
and are helping to identify the victims.
   ``They're directing us in moving rubble and debris so we don't
disturb anything underneath. They'll help us find the missing
employee, hopefully,'' Colletti said.
   Listed Monday as missing or among the unidentified dead were
Jimmy Poche, 36, of Harahan; John Moisant, 38, of New Orleans; and
Bill Coles, 28, LaPlace.
   The refinery won't resume operations until cleanup and repairs
are finished, but some small boilers were started up Monday for
maintenance, Colletti said.
   Shell officials have said the company's 1,600 employees will be
kept on the job cleaning and restoring the plant until it reopens.
   The blast's cause remains unknown.

<HEAD>Premier Prepares to Resign as Mitterrand Ponders New Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac on Monday
prepared to resign and hand over power to a new Socialist-led
government a day after he was trounced in an election by President
Francois Mitterrand.
   Meanwhile, the Paris stock market responded positively to the
Socialist incumbent's victory.
   While aides packed files and personal items in cardboard boxes
and plastic sacks, Chirac made an appointment to hand his
resignation letter to Mitterrand on Tuesday, his spokesman said.
   The move clears the way for appointment of a new premier.
   Officials at presidential Elysee Palace made no comment, but
Mitterrand was widely expected to name Chirac's successor within a
day or two.
   Mitterrand, 71, swept away his 55-year-old premier in Sunday's
voting, winning re-election to a second seven-year term and ending
two years of uncomfortable ``cohabitation'' between the political
opponents.
   Final results announced Monday afternoon gave Mitterrand
16,710,723 votes or 54 percent, to 14,221,682 or 46 percent for
Chirac.
   Michel Rocard, a 57-year-old former agriculture minister, was
billed as the most likely choice to lead the new government.
Mitterrand has said he wants non-Socialists included in the Cabinet.
   Rocard has been known for his openness to the political center,
a characteristic that has helped make him suspect among some
officials in his own Socialist Party.
   Other possible premiers include two former finance ministers,
Jacques Delors and Pierre Beregovoy; and Mitterrand's chief of
staff, Jean-Louis Bianco. But political commentators said the wily
president could well surprise everyone with an unexpected choice.
   The Socialists control only 211 seats in the 577-member National
Assembly, so the life of the new government could be difficult _ or
short.
   Te new premier could try to negotiate a coalition with centrist
members of parliament but will probably try to survive at least
several months by avoiding controversial issues apt to lead to a
legislative defeat.
   Mitterrand could also dissolve the body and call new elections,
but he has vowed to do so only if his first government loses a
parliamentary vote of confidence and falls.
   The Union for French Democracy, the center-right coalition body
that was aligned with Chirac's Rally for the Republic for the past
two years, said in a statement that it would judge the new
premier's proposals one by one and not automatically vote to
censure his government.
   Meanwhile, the extreme-right National Front claimed it was the
new leader of France's right. It issued a statement saying its
head, Jean-Marie Le Pen, ``has become at this hour the de facto
leader of the national and popular opposition to organize the
France of French people against socialism.''
   The National Front's position was greatly strengthened by Le
Pen's surprising 14 percent of the vote in the first round of
presidential elections April 24, when Chirac drew just 20 percent
and Mitterrand captured 34 percent.
   Meanwhile, the Paris stock exchange reacted calmly and favorably
Monday to the election news. The general market indicator showed a
gain of 0.9 percent at the end of the afternoon session, after a 2
percent jump earlier. Advances led declines by 118 to 65, with 23
issues unchanged.
   The market responded very differently seven years ago after
Mitterrand's surprise first victory. Investors sold madly,
frightened by Mitterrand's radical rhetoric and pledges to include
Communists in the government.
   Analysts said Mitterrand's victory was widely anticipated this
time.
   Morever, Mitterrand has been moving toward the political center
in the past few years, and it appeared the new government would not
make major changes in economic policy.
   One of the few significant programs Mitterrand has said he
intends to pursue is re-establishment of the Socialist wealth tax,
abolished by Chirac in 1986. The proceeds would fund a minimum
guaranteed income.

<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday
blamed one of his party's worst state election losses in years on
bickering within his coalition government and backlash from a
political dirty tricks campaign.
   Kohl's comments came after leaders of his conservative Christian
Democratic party gathered to assess the damage done in Sunday's
elections in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.
   The chancellor's party was ousted from power in the state for
the first time in 38 years, losing nearly 10 percent of the vote.
   But the election was a decisive victory for the opposition
Social Democrats, who won 54.8 percent of the vote after they had
lost ground in a string of state elections over the past 18 months,
according to the unofficial figures.
   The results were the best-ever posted by the Social Democrats in
Schleswig-Holstein, giving the party 46 of the 74 seats in the
state's parliament, an increase of 10 seats from the previous
election.
   Unofficial results showed the Christian Democrats won 33.3
percent of the vote and 27 seats, down from 33 seats.
   Sunday's vote was called to break the stalemate in the state's
government that followed an inconclusive election in September 1987.
   In that contest, the Christian Democrats polled 42.6 percent of
the vote, while the Social Democrats got 45.2 percent.
   ``The clashes that occurred from time to time certainly did not
help us,'' said Kohl, speaking of the in-fighting within his
three-party federal coalition in Bonn.
   The chancellor also told reporters that a principal cause of the
unexpectedly large loss was ``the deep shock that lingered'' from
the Barschel affair, one of the biggest domestic scandals to hit
West Germany in recent years.
   Uwe Barschel served as the Christian Democratic governor in
Schleswig-Holstein until he resigned last fall after news of a
political dirty tricks campaign surfaced in the West German media.
   Barschel was found dead in a Geneva hotel room in October, and
authorities ruled his death an apparent suicide.
   Meanwhile, the youth wing of Kohl's Christian Democrats called
on the chancellor to reshuffle his Cabinet as a means of offsetting
the Schleswig-Holstein election loss.
   ``A freshening-up of the coalition with younger people is
urgently called for,'' Christoph Boehr, head of the Youth Union,
was quoted by the Bild newspaper as saying.
   After meeting with Christian Democratic leaders, Kohl
acknowledged to reporters that his party had suffered a ``serious
loss'' in the state elections.
   But the chancellor said he was convinced the coalition would
continue to be popular and predicted it would be re-elected in the
1990 federal elections.
   Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, head of the Christian
Democrats in Schleswig-Holstein, said at the same news conference
that he had no intention of resigning his party position because of
the election debacle.
   The liberal Free Democratic party _ the junior party in Kohl's
governing coalition _ also posted losses, falling from 5.2 percent
of the vote in September to 4.4 percent Sunday.
   The loss was decisive, because the Free Democrats failed to win
the minimum 5 percent of the vote. Under West German law, a party
must win at least 5 percent of the vote to take any parliamentary
seats. As a result, the Free Democrats lost all four of their
places in the parliament.
   The environmental Greens party also failed to win parliamentary
seats after receiving only 2.9 percent of the vote _ well below the
3.9 percent it won in September.
   It will be several days before the results, based on returns
from polling stations, are verified and declared final under West
German law.
   Political analysts say the Social Democratic majority assures
that the state governor's post will go to Bjoern Engholm, the
party's candidate for the position.
   The election turnout was 77.4 percent, up slightly from 76.6
percent last September.

<TEXT>
   A weekend fire at an Illinois Bell switching
station kept telephones idle for 35,000 customers in Chicago's
western suburbs Monday and caused delays at major airports.
   No remedies were expected until at least midweek, Illinois Bell
officials said.
   Crews at the Federal Aviation Administration's control center in
Aurora were using a backup phone system, but the lack of full
service meant controllers had to stagger the arrival of flights by
20 miles.
   ``Major trouble, major,'' said FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein.
   Fire departments from 15 communities battled the fire at the
Hinsdale station, west of Chicago, for three hours before it was
brought under control Sunday evening.
   The facility houses computerized switching equipment that serves
customers by connecting their local calls directly to the number
dialed and routing long-distance calls.
   Customers in the suburbs of Hinsdale, Willowbrook, Clarendon
Hills and parts of Darien, Burr Ridge and unincorporated Oak Brook
lost all service, said Illinois Bell spokeswoman Laura Littel.
   Some pockets farther south had limited phone service because
some of their calls go through the Hinsdale station, Ms. Littel
said.
   She said phones were dead for 35,000 customers, but the number
of consumers with only partial interruption was unknown.
   The cause of the fire was unknown.
   At O'Hare International Airport, Edelstein said 55 to 60
incoming flights were allowed per hour, down from the normal level
of 75. The Aurora air traffic control center also handles traffic
for Chicago's Midway Airport.
   O'Hare's biggest tenant, United Airlines, had delays of at least
30 minutes, spokesman Matt Gonring said.

<HEAD>New Standard for Handling Currencies Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world has shifted to a new standard for
managing the dollar and other currencies, a transition brought
about through secret negotiations worthy of a spy novel, according
to a new book released Monday.
   ``Managing the Dollar: From the Plaza to the Louvre'' traces the
high-stakes bargaining between the United States and its major
allies over the past three years as the Reagan administration
sought desperately for solutions to the huge U.S. trade deficits.
   But the book, being published by the Institute for International
Economics, a Washington think tank, argues that the agreements,
both the public ones and the private deals, have proven
``agonizingly fragile.''
   ``The possibility of backsliding, over-committing or reneging
has continually threatened the credibilty of these deals,'' author
Yoichi Funabashi told reporters at a briefing.
   Funabashi, a Japanese newspaper reporter, spent a year
researching the book, which for the first time throws light on the
shadowy world of international monetary agreements reached between
the so-called Group of Seven: the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   The book traces the shift in the Reagan administration, which
until 1985 stood by as the dollar surged to new highs. It ignored
critics who argued that the high-flying dollar was devastating
American manufacturers and farmers, whose products were being
priced out of world markets.
   After James A. Baker III succeeded Donald T. Regan as treasury
secretary in early 1985, administration policy shifted
dramatically. Funabashi said a principal architect of the change
was Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, who wrote a secret
memorandum to Baker in April 1985 outlining a strategy to
strengthen international coordination and manage currencies.
   Darman proposed that the administration promote a move away from
the floating exchange rates to currency ``reference ranges.''
   From the end of World War II until 1973, the world was on the
gold standard, with the price of gold set at $35 an ounce and the
currencies of other governments set at fixed rates based on the
dollar.
   This system was replaced by floating exchange rates, in which
each currency was set on the open market. This process, however,
caused extreme volatility and wide swings in the value of the
dollar and other currencies, playing havoc with international trade.
   Darman's memo argued for the floating exchange rate system to be
tamed by the adoption of reference ranges, which would limit
currency swings. Currencies would be kept in specified ranges
through the use of such tools as intervention, by which governments
buy and sell dollars and other currencies on the open market in an
effort to influence the value.
   The first effort at managing the dollar's value came in an
agreement between the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain
and France at a meeting at the Plaza Hotel in New York on Sept. 22,
1985. The five countries agreed to use coordinated intervention to
drive the value of the dollar lower as a way of correcting the U.S.
trade deficit.
   A weaker dollar makes imports more expensive and American
products more competitive on overseas markets.
   The administration considered the negotiations leading up to the
Plaza agreement so sensitive that the talking paper distributed to
countries before the meeting was called a ``nonpaper'' and its
contents were kept secret.
   The United States and its allies switched course again in
February 1987 with the Louvre agreement, named for the Paris
building where the meeting took place, which said that the dollar
had declined far enough. The nations pledged to intervene in
currency markets to defend the dollar against continued downward
pressure and adopted a form of Darman's reference ranges.
   The book said the participants agreed to stabilize the dollar to
keep it falling more than 5 percent below a base of 153.5 yen to
the dollar, a range that has never been publicly confirmed.
   The dollar has continued to fall, however, and now stands around
125 yen, down more than 18 percent from the lower limit established
by the Louvre accord.
   ``The major story of this book is that it should lay to rest any
lingering doubts about whether the world is still on a floating
exchange rate system or something else,'' said C. Fred Bergsten,
executive director of the institute. ``The Louvre put into place a
rather detailed, reference range system.''

   Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee
said today serious differences have developed between the Kremlin
and the White House over on-site verification provisions of the
medium-range missile treaty and urged the Senate not to open debate
on the pact until they are resolved.
   ``There are serious problems and until they are resolved I think
it would be very difficult to proceed with a full-fledged debate in
the Senate,'' said Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine.
   ``My feeling is that until these disputes are resolved we should
not proceed,'' Cohen said.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the chairman of the intelligence
panel, agreed. ``There are serious ambiguities that remain. There
simply has not been a meeting of the minds on verification
problems. There are a number of things that have to be resolved,''
he said.
   Soviet officials have been quoted in recent weeks as backing
away from certain on-site inspection procedures spelled out by the
treaty. Boren told reporters: ``This is no way to begin a
relationship under a treaty as important as this if these
deliberate ambiguities remain.''
   If they are not resolved quickly, ``I would be very reluctant to
proceed,'' Boren said.
   Cohen said that administration officials have said they are
encouraged by the nature of recent contacts with Soviet officials
on the dispute over the treaty. But Cohen said he is ``less
optimistic'' that differences can be resolved quickly.
   Senate debate on ratification of the treaty had been tenatively
been set to begin Wednesday.
   But Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia said
Monday that he will not permit the debate to begin as long as
serious problems remain.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty requires the
elimination of all U.S. and Soviet missiles with a range of between
300 and 3,400 miles worldwide.

   Ronald Reagan held both Gorbachevs spellbound
with Hollywood stories during the Geneva summit, according to the
latest tales from the White House, but after Raisa Gorbachev
sparkled in dinner table conversation, Nancy Reagan fumed: ``Who
does that dame think she is?''
   Former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan, in his book,
``For the Record,'' published Monday, portrayed a first lady who
tried to keep presidential spokesman Larry Speakes from uttering
the word ``cancer'' when a malignancy was found in her husband's
colon and who kept Regan from riding the helicopter to Bethesda
Naval Hospital because helicopters were too ``presidential'' for
staff members' use.
   And he told of a president who perks up in the presence of women
_ and unfailingly offers a fatherly wave to the pretty stewardesses
across an airport tarmac.
   Beyond his disclosure of Mrs. Reagan's reliance on a Nob Hill
astrologist, Regan's book gave out-of-school tales about a first
lady with a pervasive, protective role in her husband's presidency.
   The Iran-Contra arms and money affair made Mrs. Reagan's
``sensitivity to criticism more acute than ever,'' Regan wrote, and
as a result Mrs. Reagan gave him frequent directions on how to
handle the matter.
   ``The first lady's telephoning was so frequent that I was
spending two or three times as much time talking to her as to the
president,'' he said.
   Mrs. Reagan was influential in Regan's unceremonious departure
from the White House. By then, hard feelings between the two were
common knowledge in Washington.
   In recalling all _ the latest in a series of White House gossipy
memoirs about disarray within the Reagan presidency _ Regan
described how Raisa Gorbachev, the stylish wife of the Soviet
leader, upstaged Nancy Reagan at their first social session _ a
dinner during the 1985 Geneva summit.
   Mrs. Reagan was hostess, he wrote, but Mrs. Gorbachev ``did not
confine herself, as most other wives of heads of state and
government did in such meetings, to cross-chat with Mrs. Reagan on
palace housewifery and other harmless subjects.
   ``Mrs. Gorbachev was a highly educated woman _ a professor of
Marxist-Leninist theory,'' Regan said. ``At this dinner party and
the later one at the Soviet Mission, she did not hesitate to make
use of the opportunities offered to her to educate the president of
the United States on the intellectual and philosophical basis of
Soviet policy.
   ``It was evident that she was mistress of her subject, an
intellectual with a truly impressive grasp of a specialty that she
regarded as the key to understanding Soviet society and the world
beyond,'' Regan recalled. ``Reagan listened to Mrs. Gorbachev's
extremely detailed and fervently argued opinions with gallant
courtesy.
   ``Gorbachev, like any husband in his circumstances, kept his
peace,'' Regan said. ``Mrs. Reagan, however, chaffed under the
monologue. After the door had closed behind the Gorbachevs, she
said, `Who does that dame think she is?'''
   As for Reagan, he entertained the Gorbachevs with stories about
his acting career. They questioned him about how movies are made
and how the Hollywood stars live.
   ``The Gorbachevs devoured every detail,'' Regan said. ``Like any
other movie buffs, they were very pleased to be in the company of
somebody who had known Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne and Humphrey
Bogart and nearly every other famous movie star personally, and was
able to describe what they were really like.
   Regan wrote dryly that the president did not tell the leader of
the communist world about his role of driving communists from the
union during his terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild.
   Reagan tends to glow in the company of women, Regan wrote: ``The
presence of Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick or Secretary of
Transportation Elizabeth Dole at a Cabinet meeting always made for
a heightened presidential mood; he was more amusing, more
talkative, more of a participant than a presence.
   Regan said everyone who travels with the president has come to
believe that Pan American World Airways assigns its prettiest
stewardesses to the plane carrying the White House press corps.
   ``This happy circumstance did not escape the president's
notice,'' he said. ``When Air Force One landed, the president
always looked for thePan Am stewardesses from the press plane and
gave them a fatherly wave. They waved back enthusiastically, pretty
young women in their uniforms smiling at the most famous man in the
world.
   ``It was a moment everyone looked forward to on presidential
journeys.''

   Despite repeated failures, Secretary of State
George P. Shultz will make another attempt in early June to
persuade Arab and Israeli leaders to agree to negotiations on
Palestinian self-rule and an overall Middle East settlement.
   ``There are problems there that need to be resolved,'' State
Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said Monday in announcing
Shultz will visit Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Syria immediately after
the superpower summit in Moscow.
   Shultz will remain in the region from June 3 until a meeting of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign ministers in Madrid
on June 9-10.
   ``The status quo is not tenable,'' Redman said in announcing
that President Reagan had directed the secretary to try again.
   After a fact-finding tour of the region last October, Shultz
flew to the Middle East in late February, reported to Reagan at an
allied summit meeting in Brussels and returned in early March. He
made a separate trip in April but failed to line up any of the
Mideast leaders except Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   Still, Shultz vowed to keep at it, fighting the long odds.
``What am I saving myself for, anyway,'' he said at the end of the
last venture.
   Redman said Arabs and Israelis had urged Shultz to keep trying.
``All of the people in the region have been very insistent on the
fact that the secretary and the administration continue these
efforts,'' the spokesman said.
   He acknowledged, however, that the plan for negotiations had not
won approval and declined to specify any changes in position by the
various leaders that might make this trip a success.
   ``The real reason the secretary is going is because at this
stage we've not yet been able to bring about the negotiations to
which all of this effort is directed,'' Redman said.
   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said, meantime, that
Shultz believes that ``though the prospects for progress may not
look encouraging, at the moment he really has no other course but
to keep at it.'' He spoke to foreign correspondents at the Foreign
Press Center.
   Shultz initially hoped a Mideast peace conference could be
convened in mid-April, setting up negotiations on the Palestinians
on May 1 between Israel and a delegation headed by Jordan that
included Palestinians.
   His plan called for a second stage of talks opening Dec. 1 that
would deal with an overall settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Syria, Egypt and Lebanon would be invited to join the negotiations.
   Shultz told a Senate appropriations subcommittee two weeks ago
that ``under the right circumstances'' King Hussein of Jordan would
be agreeable to the U.S. proposal for a peace conference.
   However, Shultz testified that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir had made the conference the ``centerpiece'' of his
objections to Shultz's plan.
   Shultz also was unsuccessful last month in Moscow in trying to
persuade the Soviet Union to accept a limited role in the
negotiations.
   Shamir and Shultz both are opposed to giving the Soviets a
chance to shape the outline of a Mideast settlement. But Hussein is
insisting on Soviet involvement.
   On the other hand, Jordan is reluctant to negotiate with Israel
without a guarantee that it would recover all the land it lost
during the 1967 Mideast war. Shultz has advised Hussein that was
not ``in the cards.'' But he backs the idea of Israel trading some
territory on the West Bank for peace and said the future of
Jerusalem should be decided in negotiations.
   Despite the long odds, Shultz said he did not think his plan was
``fated to failure.''

<HEAD>Ecuador's Left-Leaning President-Elect Reassures Business Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Rodrigo Borja, a
center-left politician, urged business leaders not to be frightened
by his election despite his criticism of the free market policies
of his predecessor.
   ``Our victory should not make anyone nervous. No one should
start a financial panic. We intend to respect private enterprise,''
he said late Sunday night after winning the presidency.
   Borja, a 52-year-old law professor, defeated Abdala Bucaram, a
36-year-old populist, by a margin of 52.8 percent to 47.2 percent.
   The president-elect, whose four-year term begins Aug. 10, will
replace Leon Febres Cordero, an arch-conservative who has
championed free enterprise and has been Washington's closest ally
in South America.
   Borja, who lost a bitterly-fought runoff contest to Febres
Cordero in 1984, has pledged to reverse his opponent's free-market
policies and seek close ties with the non-aligned Third World
movement.
   ``Now it is Dr. Borja's turn to show that his political
alternative is valid,'' Interior Minister Heinz Moeller said Monday.
   Borja will face the challenge of governing a small nation that
has seen its oil-generated prosperity fade away in the past few
years as the price of petroleum has dropped.
   Oil has been the main source of income for Ecuador since the
early 1970s.
   The country's foreign reserves have dropped to under $50
million, and Febres Cordero, who took pride in keeping up payments
on Ecuador's $9.2 billion foreign debt, was forced to stop
repayments last year after devastating earthquakes crippled the
country's oil industry for nearly six months.
   The economy shrank by 3.5 percent in 1987 and annual inflation
is running at nearly 70 percent, the highest level in five years.
Less than half of the work force is fully employed.
   Borja's Democratic Left Party espouses a social democratic
doctrine.
   He has said he will impose exchange controls, restrict imports
to save dollar reserves and regulate prices of basic consumer goods
to fight inflation.
   He also announced plans for a more restrictive foreign
investment policy and a moratorium on foreign debt payments if
creditors do not agree to negotiate easier terms.
   ``Either we pay the debt or we develop the country. We can't do
both at the same time,'' he said in a recent meeting with foreign
correspondents.
   Febres Cordero's policies ran against the trend of
left-of-center governments in South America, but Borja's victory
pushes Ecuador back into the regional pattern.
   U.S. officials say they expect no problems in dealing with
Borja, who is widely described as highly intelligent, hard-working
and honest.
   But analysts say demands from organized labor for huge wage
increases and for quick economic solutions will prove to be a
formidable test for the new president, who even his backers say he
may not have the strong leadership ability needed to keep the
confidence of the population while he seeks solutions.
   Borja reflected a sense of the limitations of his power when he
said Sunday night: ``The condition of the country does not permit
miracles.''
   ``Borja's biggest weakness is his lack of charisma,'' said
Benjamin Ortiz, editor of the independent Quito newspaper Hy.
   But Borja, in contrast to the stormy political climate
surrounding Febres Cordero, is expected to enjoy a relatively
tranquil relationship with Congress, which his Democratic Left
Party controls.
   Febres Cordero had engaged in bitter fights with an
opposition-controlled Congress throughout his term, during which
opposition legislators talked about impeaching him.

<HEAD>House Panels Given June 21 Deadline to Draft Drug Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright announced Monday he
has set a June 21 deadline for committees to draft legislation to
step up the government's fight against illegal drugs.
   Wright, D-Texas, said he hoped the package would build upon the
anti-drug programs Congress passed two years ago, just before the
last election. But he denied it was just an election-year ploy.
   ``Anything we do that people like'' is denigrated as motivated
by re-election politics, he said, but that should not deter
lawmakers. ``We cannot sit by as the United States loses the war
against drugs,'' he said.
   Congress has already been attaching anti-drug amendments to
existing legislation.
   The Senate voted to bypass Congress' commitment to limit overall
spending in order to add $2.6 billion to its fiscal 1989 budget for
an upcoming anti-drug bill.
   The House has voted for additional money for the Coast Guard and
new powers for the military to intercept drugs coming into the
country.
   The legislation Wright said would be completed next month would
be like the Senate proposals, with money for programs such as
treatment of addicts, law enforcement and prison construction. He
said the cost had not yet been determined.
   ``We'll see how much it takes and then we'll find ways to pay
for it,'' he said.
   Wright said House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., would
be working with Republicans to make the bill bipartisan. However,
Republicans said the Democrats already were drafting the
legislation without GOP input.
   While the Democratic proposals center on increased federal
spending, Republicans are drafting alternatives that would increase
penalties for drug offenders, including capital punishment for
traffickers involved in deaths.

<TEXT>
   Rebels fired rockets into the Afghanistan capital
of Kabul Monday, killing at least 11 people and most of the victims
were children, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   The unusually heavy attack on Kabul came less than a week before
the Soviet Union is to begin withdrawing its 115,000 military
personnel from Afghanistan. The Soviets sent the troops into the
country beginning in December 1979 to help the Marxist government
battle anti-communist rebels.
   In a short dispatch from Kabul, Tass said 17 rockets were fired
into densely populated districts of the city ringed by the Hindu
Kush mountains.
   ``The missiles fell mainly between houses on lawns where
children were playing,'' Tass said. ``According to preliminary
data, not less than 11 people were killed, mainly children,'' and
12 people were wounded.
   The Soviets are to start removing their troops Sunday under
U.N.-mediated accords between Pakistan and Afghanistan that were
signed April 14 in Geneva.
   Under the agreement, the Soviet military units are to leave
Afghanistan within nine months. Soviet officials have said
privately they want all the troops home by the end of the year.
   Rebel rocket strikes on Kabul used to occur frequently, but
Western diplomats based there told visiting reporters in April the
attacks became less frequent in recent months as Soviet and Afghan
troops gained more control of areas aound the capital.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, rebel leaders issued a statement saying
guerrillas had captured another government post in northern
Afghanistan as Soviet-Afghan forces continued vacating positions.
   It said rebels seized the headquarters of an administrative
district in Takhar province near the Soviet border Sunday. That
brought to nine the number of government strongholds the rebels
claime they have captured since late April.
   Millions of Afghan refugees who fled the war are living in camps
in Pakistan and most of the rebel organizations have headquarters
in Pakistan.

<HEAD>US to Seek Information From Algeria About Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior U.S. diplomat headed for Algeria on
Monday to seek information about the whereabouts of American
hostages in Lebanon and to discuss relations with the United States.
   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said he also will ask
Algerian authorities to cooperate with the United States in
apprehending the hijackers who took over a Kuwaiti jetliner last
month and flew it to Algiers, killing two hostages along the way.
   Whitehead spoke to foreign correspondents at the U.S.
Information Agency's Foreign Press Center in Washington hours
before leaving for a week-long swing through Algeria, Tunisia and
Morocco.
   ``We'll be talking, particularly to the Algerians, about the
hostage situation, to determine if there's anything they known
about our American hostages still in captivity and to see if
there's any role that they can play,'' Whitehead said.
   There are nine Americans among 18 foreigners believed held by
pro-Iranian radicals in Lebanon. Algeria, with its history of
international mediation, acted as a broker in securing the 1981
release of 52 American hostages held by Iranians at the U.S.
embassy in Tehran for more than a year.
   Whitehead will likely discuss the fate of the U.S. hostages when
he meets next week in Paris with French officials. France
negotiated the release of its remaining three hostages in Lebanon
last week.
   Softening recent U.S. criticism of Algeria, Whitehead said the
United States ``had no basis to criticize in any severe way''
Algeria's handling of the Kuwaiti hijacking. Algerian officials
mediated an end to the 16-day hijacking, freeing the 31 hostages
and spiriting the hijackers to an unknown destinations.
   U.S. officials initially expressed anger that the Algerians
allowed the hijackers to get away.
   Whitehead said the Algerians had to balance the desire to catch
the hijackers with concern for the safety of the hostages. ``It was
a difficult job,'' he said.
   ``We hope Algeria will participate with us in further efforts to
apprehend the hijackers,'' Whitehead added.
   The United State still does not know whether the hijackers left
Algiers, he said, despite news reports that the seven or nine
pirates flew to Syria and from there made their way to Lebanon.
   Discussing his planned talks in Tunisia, Whitehead said he would
make it clear to the authorities there that the United States did
not have any role in last month's assassination of Khalil Wazir.
Wazir, the number two man in the Palestine Liberation Organization
is believed to have been killed by Israeli commandos.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man Michael Dukakis left ``minding the store''
in Massachusetts while running for president is a veteran of 40
years in and around government.
   Hale Champion has been a reporter, a Harvard official, an aide
to California Gov. Pat Brown and a health official in the Carter
administration.
   Balding, rotund and 65, Champion gives the impression that he's
seen it all and that nothing fazes him _ not complaining
legislators or angry lobbyists, budget shortfalls or the way the
news media covers it all.
   To read one Boston newspaper, Dukakis' chief secretary said in
an interview last week, ``you would have thought blood was coursing
through the corridors of the Statehouse, entrails draped over the
balconies.
   ``Where? Who? I mean it's simply a bunch of people doing their
work.''
   Just doing your job. ``That's the way he looks at it,'' Champion
said of his boss, the governor who has risen to become the
Democratic presidential front-runner. ``Sometimes that's why people
think he's not exciting enough, not emotional enough.''
   But, said Champion, ``that's what I like about him. I mean
that's what gets things done. That's what gets things taken care
of, not emoting hour after hour.
   ``And if that says I am unemotional about those things, maybe I
am.''
   Champion's strength is that ``there isn't anything that he can
think of that he hasn't seen before,'' said Dukakis' press
secretary James Dorsey. ``He's sort of like a deeply set
foundation'' for the administration.
   Champion himself was a press secretary, and then executive
secretary and finance director for Brown, who was Ronald Reagan's
predecessor as governor of California.
   His career also includes financial vice presidencies at the
University of Minnesota and Harvard University; a stint as director
of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, when he first met Dukakis,
and two years as undersecretary to Joseph Califano at the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare in the Carter
administration.
   He was in semi-retirement as executive dean of Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government when Dukakis tapped him to become his chief
secretary a year ago.
   ``I was never interested in working, you need to understand,''
he said with a smile. ``He resisted my arguments and persuaded my
wife, and here I am.''
   Considering Champion's background and symmetry of thinking with
Dukakis, little had to be discussed between the two on what the job
entailed. ``He and I both assumed that I knew what `minding the
store' meant,'' Champion said.
   He has faced comparisons to John Sasso, the politically savvy,
longtime Dukakis associate who had been chief secretary before
moving over to run the campaign. Sasso later left over his part in
the ``attack video'' episode that helped drive Sen. Joseph Biden
from the presidential race.
   Some lawmakers have criticized the lack of courting they get
from Champion. ``I don't do as much of it as John did ... never
will, never did when I did this kind of job before (for Brown),''
Champion said.
   But he keeps in close contact with legislative leaders, and that
to Champion is most important.
   While Champion frequently remarks on how there is nothing new
under the sun in his job, there are some aspects that are different
in keeping an administration going while the chief executive is
running for president.
   First, he must make sure Dukakis is abreast of events back in
the state while the governor spends three or more days a week on
the campaign trail. Second, he has been chiefly in charge of
bringing Dukakis' constitutional successor, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy,
more into the daily operations of the administration.
   And third, he has found that virtually every administration
initiative _ from a universal health care bill to the state budget
_ and many bills being pushed by individual lawmakers are publicly
cast in the context of the impact on Dukakis' presidential campaign.
   ``At first I did get a little bit (upset),'' said Champion.
``It's ridiculous, but it's every single thing.''
   But Champion said Dukakis and his administration have tried to
solve any problems in that area by living the old saying, ``What's
good politics is good government.''
   ``If you look like you are doing what you ought to be doing
generally, as against a gimme here and a gimme there, that's the
best politics,'' Champion said. ``As a matter of fact, that's why
Michael is where he is today, because he has always taken that kind
of attitude.''
   Champion said he isn't interested in a return trip to Washington
if Dukakis is elected. Rather, he's counting down the last months
he believes he will be in his present post and is looking beyond
the part-time teaching position waiting for him at Harvard. What
he's really looking forward to, he said, ``is that time when I am
not even teaching.''

   City government came to a standstill Monday
while thousands of people streamed by the coffin of Richard S.
Caliguiri in the City-County Building, where he governed Pittsburgh.
   ``I didn't know him personally, but I liked him. He was one of
the nicest persons. I'm going to start crying and I'm not even
related to him,'' said Mary Ronschke, 75, a Pittsburgh resident who
waited in line.
   An estimated 2,000 people viewed the flag-draped coffin in the
first hour after the doors were opened. Gov. Robert Casey was among
those who filed past the coffin.
   Caliguiri's heart stopped Friday from what his doctors said was
an accumulation of protein caused by the rare, incurable disease,
amyloidosis. He was 56 and in his 12th year as mayor. He was
credited with steering Pittsburgh through the collapse of
steelmaking in the area.
   Monday was an official day of mourning. City offices, courts,
public and parochial schools, and buildings were closed.
   After a funeral Mass on Tuesday, Caliguiri will be buried two
plots away from his mother, Catherine, in Calvary Cemetery in
Pittsburgh.
   ``It'll be quite a while before we have another one like him,''
said Jerry Esposito. ``I don't think anybody perceived what a
symbol this young, unpretentious man came to be. He remained true
to the common man, kept his honesty and his values.''
   Esposito, an emergency medical services official, recalled
Caliguiri's efforts as a City Council member to help improve
ambulance service in western Pennsylvania.
   ``Richard was the first member of this city body who was
perceptive enough to know that that was an issue worth giving his
support and understanding to,'' he said. ``This young man had the
courage to support that issue through all the turmoils and battles
that ensued.
   ``This city now enjoys as fine a paramedic protection as any
municipality in the country.''
   William Parker, social service administrator for the
Neighborhood Centers Association, said he liked Caliguiri for
something else the mayor helped give the city.
   ``He has never done anything for me personally, but I appreciate
the fact that he was able to keep our streets in good condition,''
he said. ``He had begun to make Pittsburgh a city that one could be
proud of. I often have visitors from out of town, and I'm just so
pleased to be able to show them the progress that has been made.''
   ``He was a gift at a time when we needed a gift,'' state Labor
Department spokesman Mike Acquaviva said as he waited in line.
   Acquaviva credited Caliguiri for his reaction to the collapse of
steelmaking in the cradle of the steel industry.
   ``Most politicians would be defensive when things are crumbling,
but he drew upon both the public and private sector to make some
pretty bold initiatives,'' Acquaviva said. ``When we deal with
unemployment numbers, we're dealing with numbers, but he looked at
it as people.''

<HEAD>Report Says Agency Not Buying Equipment Wisely</HEAD>

   Congressional investigators have determined
that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is wasting millions
of tax dollars on unneeded equipment it cannot use, a House
subcommittee chairman said Monday.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., said a one-year review by the
General Accounting Office found the INS apparently ``has no
consistent method of deciding what it needs or how to purchase
equpment that would fill those needs. The result is that at best
we're getting equipment that doesn't really do the job.''
   The INS responded Monday to concerns raised in the report with
plans to establish a research and development steering committee
that will develop procurement procedures based on some GAO
recommendations, said spokesman Verne Jervis.
   The INS planning office, which includes research and
development, will also be moved so that it reports directly to the
INS commissioner's office, where it will receive ``enhanced
visibility and increased access to top management,'' Jervis said.
   English said he was concerned efforts in the war on drugs were
being hurt by the INS' apparent waste of ``millions of dollars on
equipment the INS can't really use.''
   ``There's no question that INS and particularly the Border
Patrol are underfunded when it comes to the war on drugs.
Therefore, money wasted on unwise purchases is money that cannot be
used to halt the flow of drugs across our borders,'' he said in a
statement.
   The GAO report, to be released Thursday at a hearing by
English's government information, justice and agriculture
subcommittee, found that ``the INS had no defined, formal method of
technology selection.''
   In one instance, the GAO found the INS had ordered the purchase
of 11 undercover vans outfitted with an extendable infrared scope
for monitoring the U.S. borders, at a cost of more than $130,000
for each vehicle, even though operational tests were incomplete.
   And the report said the infrared scopes, which could have been
used to support linewatch operations in various Border Patrol
sectors, sat unused for at least 7{ months at Fort Huachuca, Ariz.
   ``Had those scopes been available for use in detection in
various sectors, some INS agents could have been deployed for other
activities. The value of the agents' work that was foregone by the
INS as a result is estimated to be in the range of $1.4 million to
$3.4 million,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Milk Producers Federation Asks Farmers to Lobby Against
Price-Support Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nation Milk Producers Federation asked
dairy farmers Monday to join its lobbying effort to stop a further
cut in federal milk price supports scheduled by the Agriculture
Department next year.
   The 72-year-old federation, which represents most of the
nation's dairy cooperatives, wants Agriculture Secretary Richard E.
Lyng to use his authority in the 1985 farm law to cancel the next
reduction in milk supports on Jan. 1, 1989, in favor of an
alternate plan to cut production.
   ``Enough is enough,'' said federation president Tom Camerlo of
Canon City, Colo. ``Dairy farmers are tired of suffering continual
price reductions after having done more to address federal policy
concerns than any segment of U.S. agriculture.''
   Camerlo said Lyng has the authority to set up a new whole-herd
buyout or a diversion program, both of which have been used in
recent years to trim U.S. milk production.
   However, Lyng has been steadfast against reviving the buyout and
diversion programs as an alternative to the reduction in price
supports.
   Camerlo and other federation officials told a news conference at
the National Press Club that the 50-cent reduction scheduled for
next Jan. 1 would put the milk support level at $10.10 per 100
pounds of milk, the lowest since 1979.
   ``Dairy farmers will have to live at 1979 income levels with
1989 costs,'' he said.
   Milk price supports have been lowered progressively from a
record high of $13.10 per 100 pounds since 1983 to help discourage
surplus production. A diversion plan to pay farmers for cutting
back production, and a whole-herd buyout, or Dairy Termination
Program, also were used.
   The 18-month whole-herd buyout program began April 1, 1986, and
continued through October 1987. More than 1.22 million dairy cows,
heifers and calves were sent to market by thousands of producers
who agreed to quit the dairy business for at least five years.
   About 38 percent of the buyout program's cost of $1.8 billion
was paid by dairy farmers themselves who were charged assessments
on milk they sold. Similar arrangements helped hold down costs on
the earlier diversion plan.
   Camerlo said the 50-cent reduction next Jan. 1 would come as
milk production costs, including feed, are on the upswing. The
two-way crunch would add up next year to a 37 percent slide in
dairy farm income from 1987 levels, he said.
   Dairy farmers have contributed $2.9 billion in assessments since
1983 to reduce the costs of their programs by 50 percent overall,
Camerlo said.
   Federation leaders have met frequently with USDA officials,
including Lyng, in an attempt to persuade them to abandon the path
of lower milk supports.
   ``The secretary has been consistent, as has his staff, that they
will cut the price,'' Camerlo said. `` They do not intend to
utilize the authority that they have in the '85 act to implement a
whole-herd or Dairy Termination Program.''

   The National Organization for Women on Monday
released a list of prominent Democratic women and said the
Democratic Party should consider them for key convention roles as
well as for the vice presidential nomination.
   NOW also urged the Democrats to continue official support of the
Equal Rights Amendment, abortion rights and gay rights, and to add
a new platform plank promoting women candidates.
   ``We think it would be a very serious mistake'' to eliminate all
potentially controversial issues from the platform, NOW President
Molly Yard said at a news conference a day before she was scheduled
to testify before the party's platform committee.
   Yard distributed a list of 47 prominent Democratic women, saying
she wants the party to consider them as national convention
speakers and officers as well as potential running mates.
   On the list are current and former office-holders from Congress
down to city council, including former New York Rep. Geraldine
Ferraro, who was chosen by Walter F. Mondale as his running mate in
1984. Women's groups, including NOW, heavily lobbied Mondale to put
a woman on the ticket.
   Others on the list include Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado,
Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, Rep. Barbara Kennelly of
Connecticut, Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire, former San Francisco
Mayor Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.
   Asked which vice presidential nominees would be acceptable or
unacceptable to NOW this year, former NOW chief Eleanor Smeal named
Sen. Sam Nunn as a negative example.
   Citing the Georgia senator's support for banning abortion and
for an ERA only with amendments, she said, ``His position on
women's issues would not be called exemplary.''
   ``We want both parties to consider a woman vice presidential
candidate,'' Smeal said. ``There are plenty of prospective
candidates out there who are women and we think they should be
considered seriously.''
   Smeal and Yard said they are confident ERA, abortion and gay
rights, as well as others supporting child care, family leave, pay
equity and a minimum wage hike, will remain in the platform.
   ``They don't have the votes to delete these planks. They're just
not there,'' Smeal said. She said there would be a strong feminist
contingent at the Atlanta convention in July.
   Smeal said she would introduce a new platform plank requiring
equal representation of women candidates in primaries. She noted
the Democrats already have a rule requiring equal numbers of men
and women on committees and at conventions.
   Under her proposal, endorsements by Democratic organizations
would have to be split 50-50 between male and female candidates.
She said she intends to press it at the Republican convention as
well.
   Smeal said the current system amounts to ``incumbent protection
clubs'' that give people ``30 years of job security whether they're
doing the job or not. ... This is just suicide to have a policy
that is keeping their decisionmakers virtually all white men.''
   Democratic leaders, including party chairman Paul Kirk, have
said they may try to win a brief platform acceptable to all
Democrats that excludes specific mention of controversial topics.

   Police broke down the doors of a country cottage
where a dissident group planned to meet and arrested five people
Monday. Sources said 70 other activists met nearby and founded an
alternative party to the Communist Party.
   The new group calls itself the Democratic Union. It seeks a
multiparty parliamentary democracy in the Soviet Union, independent
trade unions, a new constitution and withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Eastern Europe and areas of the present Soviet Union seized in
World War II.
   Over the weekend, 60 of its supporters were reported arrested in
Moscow and one of the group's founders, Yuri Mityunov, said Monday
that 14 remained in jail after being arrested Sunday night.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called for more
democratic election procedures, including multiple-candidate
elections. But the Communist Party he heads has given no sign that
it will accept any organized opposition to its monopoly on
political power, which is enshrined in the Soviet constitution.
   Andrei Babitsky, an editor of the dissident journal Glasnost,
said uniformed and plainclothes police encircled a cottage in the
woods near the village of Kratovo, 25 miles southeast of the
capital, where the Democratic Union planned to meet Monday
afternoon.
   The two-floor wooden cottage has been used for meetings of the
staff of Glasnost, an unofficial publication that takes its title
from the Russian word for openness. Gorbachev has used glasnost to
describe some of his reforms.
   ``A militia officer asked to see our identification documents,
but we refused, saying there was no grounds,'' Babitsky said in a
telephone interview. ``He then went for reinforcements, and about
50 uniformed militia, plainclothesmen and KGB officers suddenly
appeared. They had obviously been waiting nearby.''
   Sergei Grigoryants, a former political prisoner who is the
founding editor of Glasnost, was arrested on the lawn outside,
Babitsky said. ``We closed all five doors to the dacha, but police
broke them in,'' he added.
   Babitsky said he was arrested along with Yuri Petrovsky, who
also works with Glasnost; Viktor Kuzin, a founder of the Democratic
Union, and a man known only as Volodya who Babitsky said was in the
vicinity of the cottage by chance.
   Babitsky said he was held for almost nine hours without being
charged, then released by police shortly before 9 p.m. with no
explanation.
   Another dissident was in the country house, but fled before he
could be detained, another Glasnost editor, Andrei Krivov, said in
a telephone interview Monday night.
   Krivov said people who talked to Grigoryants at the police
station in Ilinskoye, near Kratovo, reported that Grigoryants ``was
frisked, his clothes were ripped, and a large sum of money he was
carrying was taken.''
   Mityunov reported by telephone that about 70 members of the
Democratic Union, kept from meeting at the cottage, gathered at a
nearby rural club.
   ``In a half-hour, they adopted the basic program for the party,
a declaration and a charter,'' he said.
   ``I think the formation of the party is a big event in the
unification of forces to fight against the bureaucratic
totalitarian regime,'' said Mityunov, a former member of the
Communist Party who was fired from his editorial job on state-run
Radio Moscow in 1986.
   Babitsky said he learned from Grigoryants' wife Tamara that the
Glasnost editor-in-chief was sentenced to seven days in jail for
resisting authorities. ``I saw him arrested, and he did not such
thing,'' Babitsky said.
   Petrovsky, Kuzin and the man known as Volodya received five-day
jail terms, but the dissidents group did not know on what charges,
Babitsky said.
   The Kratovo cottage was sealed by police and newspapers and
books inside may have been taken away by investigators, Babitsky
said.
   `I fear this action may be the defeat of `Glasnost,''' he added.
   The typewritten journal began appearing last year.
   Kratovo is located in a region foreigners are barred by law from
visiting.
   The Soviet constitution calls the Communist Party the ``leading
and guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its
political system.''
   Although new dissident groups and independent publications have
sprung up up throughout the country since hundreds of political
prisoners were freed in early 1987, authorities have crushed
efforts to form an opposition to the Communist Party.

   Farmers idled about 59.9 million acres of
cropland under 1987 acreage reduction programs, an area larger than
all of Minnesota and Maryland combined, Agriculture Department
figures showed Monday.
   The preliminary report for compliance in the 1987 programs said
the acreage represented about 87 percent of the base acreage for
wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice.
   In 1986, by comparison, farmers idled 44.6 million acres, or 82
percent of their total base for those crops.
   Wheat farmers idled 23.8 million acres last year, followed by
corn, 23 million acres; sorghum, 4 million; barley, 2.9 million;
oats, 800,000; cotton, 3.8 million; and rice, 1.6 million.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says US Can't Afford to Fall Further Behind in Star Wars
Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States cannot afford from a
military perspective to fall further behind in its ``Star Wars''
research, the Pentagon said Monday.
   The Defense Department, in a required annual report on the
Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars program, said even 3
percent annual increases in funding for the research would not be
enough to ``keep pace'' with the Soviet Union.
   The Russians continue to modernize their offensive as well as
defensive weaponry, gradually improving their ability to destroy
U.S. forces with a surprise attack, the Pentagon report said.
   ``The resulting asymmetry between Soviet and U.S. forces has led
to a destabilizing situation, one that must be redressed,'' the
Pentagon said.
   A Star Wars defense system that could shoot down Soviet missiles
offers the promise of a more stable peace, the Pentagon insisted.
The mere process of attempting to develop such a system complicates
Soviet military planning and strains the Russian economy.
   If, on the other hand, Congress continues to cut deeply into
Star Wars funding, ``the United States will not only waste its
greatest leverage _ the innovation possible in a free society _ but
it cannot expect to do more than react to Soviet initiatives in
strategic defense,'' the Pentagon said.
   ``We are faced with either delaying the time when a decision on
whether to deploy defenses could be made, or eliminating some
technology efforts, thereby reducing the number of defense options
that can support a decision.''
   The Pentagon included the new plea for funding in a report that
runs to several hundred pages, reviewing the work done over the
past year in various technological fields.
   Release of the report comes just a week after Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci warned he would recommend that President Reagan
veto the Pentagon's fiscal 1989 budget bill if cuts are made to the
$4.5 billion requested for Star Wars.
   While the administration has been forced to abandon its goal of
increasing overall defense spending by 3 percent a year, it
continues to request steep hikes for Star Wars. Since 1983,
however, Congress has cut almost $5 billion from the roughly $18
billion requested for Star Wars.
   ``While the Congress has increased (Star Wars) funding every
year, the difference between what the administration has requested
and what the Congress has appropriated is so large that it has had
a substantial and increasingly detrimental impact on the program,''
the Defense Department asserted.

   House Majority Leader Tom Foley of
Washington is sidestepping suggestions from Idaho Democrats and
others that he be the party's vice presidential nominee this fall.
   Foley, in Idaho Falls for a Democratic gathering over the
weekend, said he was flattered to have his name mentioned, but
``what I'd like to do is stay in the House of Representatives.''
   He did not, however, rule out the possibility of being part of
the Democratic ticket, saying only that that the decision will
belong to the presidential nominee.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus says Foley could fit in well with the
party's hopes for carrying the West in the presidential election.
   ``I'm not saying (Massachusetts Gov. Michael) Dukakis would have
to have Foley to win the West,'' said the governor, who formally
endorsed Dukakis last week. ``But it would make it much easier if
he had someone of that stature.''

   A Pat Robertson supporter says Vice
President George Bush could lose voters in November if the Georgia
Republican Party fails to resolve complaints by Robertson backers.
   A party credentials committee met in Columbus on Saturday but
took no action on appeals concerning disqualifications of delegates
to the upcoming state convention. Most of the appeals were filed by
Robertson supporters.
   ``If it's not settled to our satisfaction, we may not vote for
Bush,'' said John Spencer, coordinator of Muscogee County Americans
for Robertson. ``We may write in another candidate ... Robertson or
Dole or Kemp.''
   The party has disqualified 928 delegates out of 2,300 to attend
the state convention in Albany May 20-21. Robertson backers contend
party regulars are trying to keep them out of the convention by
invoking trivial and previously unenforced rules, such as one
requiring proof of advertising of county conventions.
   Of the 30 national convention delegates chosen earlier at
district conventions, 20 were party regulars and 10 were Robertson
supporters.

   Gov. Robert P. Casey, who declined to
endorse a Democratic presidential candidate before last month's
Pennsylvania primary, said Monday that Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis is the best man for the job.
   In a statement released by his office, Casey endorsed Dukakis as
``the man who has demonstrated the consistency, the experience, the
intelligence and the drive not only to be a good candidate for
president, but to be a great president as well.''
   Casey said Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, the remaining Democratic
candidate, have both ``continued to speak to the needs and
interests, the hopes and dreams of the American people.''
   In his statement, Casey said Dukakis has gained valuable
experience as a governor.
   ``Mike Dukakis knows what it's like to balance a budget, a feat
the Republican administration has never accomplished, despite all
its rhetoric to the contrary,'' Casey said. ``Mike Dukakis knows
how to bring together a wide array of constituencies to enact
programs which serve the needs of people.''

   Anti-abortion activists expressed
disappointment Monday at Nancy Reagan's reported declaration that
``I don't give a damn about the right-to-lifers,'' but they praised
President Reagan's steadfast support for their cause.
   The first lady was quoted by former White House chief of staff
Donald T. Regan in his new book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street
to Washington.''
   Regan wrote that during a telephone conversation from Washington
with Mrs. Reagan at Camp David, Md., on Jan. 24, 1987, the first
lady demanded that all mention of the abortion issue be eliminated
from the draft text of her husband's State of the Union address.
   ``I pointed out that the president had particularly wanted some
language on this subject included in his address,'' Regan said he
responded.
   He quoted Mrs. Reagan as saying: ``I don't give a damn about the
right-to-lifers.''
   The State of the Union speech that the president delivered three
days later contained no references to abortions.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Monday
that ``I don't have any knowledge at all'' whether Mrs. Reagan
actually made such a statement.
   Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press secretary, refused
comment.
   Anti-abortion leaders, asked for reaction, refrained from any
direct criticism of Mrs. Reagan and chose instead to praise her
husband for his unwavering support.
   ``If, in fact, Mrs. Reagan's quote is accurate, we are very
disappointed, but it does not affect the respect we have for how
the president has helped the pro-life movement throughout his
administration,'' said Tom Glessner, executive director of the
Christian Action Council, an evangelical Protestant organization.
   ``We would ask Mrs. Reagan to ... let us know if, in fact, this
is how she regards the right-to-life movement,'' Glessner said.
   Kay James, public affairs director for the National Right to
Life Committee, the largest U.S. anti-abortion organization,
refused to discuss the first lady or her remarks.
   ``I think what's important is what the president has done,'' she
said. ``What is apparent to us is that the president has always
been extremely supportive in all his speeches, his initiatives and
his policies, and that's what we have to go on.''
   Said Jack Fowler, Washington bureau chief of the Ad Hoc
Committee for Life, an anti-abortion lobbying group: ``It's
upsetting, if it is true, although it doesn't change our attitude
toward the president himself. We know the president is pro-life.''

<TEXT>
   American hostage Terry Anderson's greatest fear is
a commando raid against his captors in Lebanon, an action that
would mean his certain death, a Frenchman who shared a cell with
Anderson said Monday.
   Marcel Fontaine, 45, a diplomat released last week after nearly
three years of captivity, said he and Anderson were in the same
cell for six months and frequently spoke of the possibility that
either the French or the Americans would turn to military action.
   ``We were afraid,'' Fontaine told Anderson's sister, Peggy Say
of Batavia, N.Y., during a meeting in his home. ``Every time
anybody knocked on the door, two guards immediately stepped in,
pointed guns at us and waited for whoever was going to come in.
   ``There is no chance that any commandos would ever get in
without us being killed. We were all of us always afraid that there
would be a commando raid by the French or the Americans.''
   Mrs. Say arrived in Paris Monday to meet with Fontaine and two
other French hostages released Wednesday in Beirut _ journalist
Jean-Paul Kauffmann and diplomat Marcel Carton.
   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East Correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped in West Beirut March 16, 1985, by pro-Iranian
Lebnanese and is the longest held Western hostage in Lebanon.
Lebanese kidnappers are holding 18 foreigners, including nine
Americans.
   Fontaine said Anderson does not know that his father and his
brother have died since he has been in captivity. The Frenchman
said he knew of those deaths because he had heard of them earlier
on the radio, but he didn't tell Anderson for fear it would have a
serious effect on his morale.
   Probably the second greatest worry of the hostages, said
Fontaine, is becoming seriously ill. He said no medical treatment
is allowed, and if they should suffer a serious ailment, they would
simply die.
   That is what happened to another Frenchman, Michel Seurat. The
Islamic Jihad organization, which claims to be holding Anderson and
others, claimed Seurat was killed. But the recently returned
Frenchmen said he died of illness, probably cancer.
   Fontaine said Anderson's morale is high. The diplomat frequently
praised Anderson's courage. He said Anderson exercises
continuously, walking round and round in his cell to keep fit.
   Fontaine said he began teaching Anderson French, and he has
learned to read it rather well. Anderson, in turn, taught Fontaine
English.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, preparing for his expected role as the
party's presidential nominee, talked foreign policy with Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey on Monday. Rival Jesse Jackson exhorted coal
miners to help him turn the race around on the eve of primaries in
West Virginia and Nebraska.
   An aide to Republican George Bush, meanwhile, acknowledged that
the vice president was aware of allegations of drug trafficking by
the government of Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega well
before Noriega's indictment this year _ an issue on which both
Dukakis and Jackson have been attacking Bush.
   Bush campaign spokesman Peter Teeley said Bush viewed the
information as speculative at the time.
   Jackson alone among the three remaining presidential candidates
was actively campaigning Monday.
   He spent Sunday night at the home of an unemployed coal miner
and his wife, Junior and Becky Cook, in all-white Arnett, W.Va.
More than 500 people showed up to greet him in the economically
depressed town of only 300 residents.
   ``They have their race, but they don't have jobs,'' Jackson said.
   ``They have their race, but they don't have health insurance.
They have their race, but they don't have hot and cold running
water,'' he said. ``Their race does not address those needs.''
   Jackson visited a coal mine in southern West Virginia, then
visited a toxic waste dump as he toured the state, saying his call
for economic help was cutting across racial lines.
   There are 37 Democratic delegates at stake in the West Virginia
primary, and 25 in Nebraska.
   Dukakis made only brief campaign forays into both West Virginia
and Nebraska last week. He has a commanding lead in delegates to
the Democratic National Convention.
   Still, Jackson told 1,500 people in Martinsburg, W.Va.: ``We're
within striking distance. West Virginia, you can make a
difference.''
   ``The race is tight,'' Jackson said. ``I'm coming to the last
lap. I'm running longer and running stronger because my mind is
made up. We've come too far. We've got to go on now. Press on.
Press on. Press on.''
   Dukakis spent the day at the Statehouse in Boston, where the
Massachusetts governor met with Bradley for a briefing on
U.S.-Soviet relations. Dukakis did not come out to comment to
reporters after the hour-long meeting.
   Bradley said the subject of the vice presidential spot on a
Dukakis ticket was not discussed. He added, ``That's not in the
cards. Massachusetts and New Jersey don't go well together.''
   Dukakis planned meetings with other members of Congress during a
stopover in Washington on Thursday before flying west to campaign
in Oregon and California.
   Dukakis aides said the governor will begin receiving Secret
Service protection Wednesday. Dukakis has previously declined the
protection.
   Questions about Bush's knowledge of Noriega's alleged drug
dealing have emerged as an issue in the presidential race, with
Dukakis and Jackson both asserting the Reagan administration
continued to deal with the Panamanian dictator despite evidence of
drug invovlement.
   They have pointed to Bush's experience as former head of the
CIA, and head of the admnistration's task force on federal drug
interdiction, as evidence he knew or should have known about
Noriega.
   Teeley, answering questions about the issue, said Bush's
assertion that he had no prior knowledge of Noriega's specific drug
dealings does not suggest he was completely in the dark on the
possibility. He said Panama was one of a number of countries about
which there were such reports.
   ``I think anybody who knows anything about what's gone on in the
world of international narcotics trafficking is fully aware that
there are all sorts of rumors and reports about foreign officials
being involved in drug trafficking, money laundering and payoffs,''
Teeley said. ``Some turn out to be accurate, some are not.''
   In other developments:
   _ Dukakis came under fresh attack from former Democratic Gov.
Edward J. King of Massachusetts, who beat him in 1978 but lost
their rematch in 1982. King, now a Republican, has appeared on
television and radio shows in recent weeks to criticize Dukakis,
with his expenses paid for by the Bush campaign.
   In a Cambridge, Mass., speech, King said Dukakis deserves no
credit for the state's economic turnaround.
   _ Dukakis was endorsed by Gov. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania,
where Dukakis won the state's primary overwhelmingly two weeks ago.
He also picked up public backing from Rep. Harley O. Staggers Jr.,
D-W.Va., and Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., both of whom will attend
the Democratic convention as ``super delegates.''
   _ House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., one man mentioned as
a Democratic running mate, said in Idaho Falls, Idaho, that he was
flattered to have his name mentioned but ``what I'd like to do is
stay in the House of Representatives.''
   _ The National Organization for Women listed 47 Democratic women
it said should be considered for roles at the Democratic National
Convention and for the vice presidency.
   NOW also urged the Democrats not to exclude from the platform
statements of support for the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion
rights, gay rights and other issues. Democratic leaders, including
party chairman Paul Kirk, want a brief platform that avoids such
controversial topics.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II arrived Monday in
Bolivia, South America's poorest country, flying here from Uruguay
on his four-nation tour.
   Thousands of people, including many peasants in Indian dress and
the traditional bowler hats, welcomed the pontiff at the La Paz
airport, 13,150 feet above sea level and ringed by snow-capped
Andean peaks.
   The pope arrived from Montevideo, Uruguay, aboard a Boeing 727
of the Bolivian state airline.
   The jetliner's oxygen level was reduced to prepare John Paul for
his visit to high-altitude Bolivia.
   A Vatican advance team had already been sent to the mountainous
capital to test the possible effects of kneeling and kissing the
ground at such an altitude.
   On his four-nation, 12-day visit to South America, which began
Friday, the 67-year-old pontiff was also scheduled to travel to
Peru and Paraguay.
   The pope's schedule calls for five days in Bolivia where
government austerity measures that eliminated 20,000-percent annual
inflation have caused serious labor unrest due to mass layoffs. The
country is also a major source of the world's cocaine.
   In Uruguay, where the pope made an overnight stop in March 1987,
John Paul asked for a renewal of religious fervor and for more
priests. This small nation of 3 million is South America's most
secularized society, with an agnostic president and only lukewarm
interest in church affairs.
   After arriving in Uruguay Saturday, the pope visited the towns
of Melo near Brazil, Florida outside the capital of Montevideo and
Salto on the northwestern frontier with Argentina.
   John Paul was presented with gifts ranging from a live fawn to a
nest of a local birds.
   In Salto, Uruguay's second-largest city with 77,000 residents,
John Paul spoke at a mass Monday about his hopes for a renewal of
evangelization in South America, saying ``religious fervor is not
fanaticism but is coherent with Christian life.''
   Earlier Monday, John Paul met privately in Montevideo with
President Julio Sanguinetti, an agnostic. Sanguinetti, a highly
popular leader, became president in 1985 when he restored democracy
to Uruguay after 12 years of harsh military rule.
   Papal aides said in Uruguay that the pope has been buoyed by the
official reception he has received in a country where divorce has
been legal since 1907 and Christmas is called ``Families Day'' to
avoid religious connotations.
   ``We hope this is the start of a new climate,'' said a Vatican
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The pope's tour is his ninth to Latin America since he became
head of the 860-million-member Roman Catholic Church nearly 10
years ago. John Paul ha traveled abroad on papal pilgrimages 37
times.
   This trip takes the pontiff to Bolivia and Paraguay for the
first time. He visited Peru in 1985.
   John Paul is scheduled to spend his 68th birthday in Paraguay on
May 18 and returns to Rome on May 19.

<HEAD>Acclaimed Science Fiction Author Dies At 80</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY33</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARMEL, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert A. Heinlein, whose science fiction
explored the future while questioning the morals and beliefs of the
present, has died at the age of 80, it was announced Monday.
   Heinlein, who added the word ``grok'' to the language and
dreamed up the water bed, was ranked with Isaac Asimov and Arthur
C. Clarke among the greatest practitioners of science fiction. His
fiction explored the seeming contraditions of his own philosophy,
which embraced libertarianism and a passionate faith in the
military.
   He died of heart failure Sunday at his home in this small
tourist community about 130 miles south of San Francisco, said
Terry Rice of the Monterey County Coroner's office.
   Heinlein had suffered for many years from emphysema and had
undergone numerous operations, including one to relieve restricted
blood flow to his brain.
   ``Robert Heinlein has been writing science fiction now for 48
years and from the very start he was recognized as a grand
master,'' Asimov said Monday. ``In 1975 the Science Fiction Writers
of America set up just such an award, and he was the first to get
it. There was no argument, much like George Washington becoming the
first president.''
   Asimov said he and Heinlein had served together in Philadelphia
during World War II, during Heinlein's second Navy hitch, and
``formed a close friendship wich never entirely broke up.''
   His favorite bit of Heinlein writing was the opening to ``Door
Into Summer,'' in which ``he described a cat better than anyone has
ever described a cat. The work that impressed me the most was
`Solution Unsatisfactory,' written before the Manhattan Project, in
which he accurately described the current nuclear stalemate.''
   Robert Anson Heinlein was born in Butler, Mo., on July 7, 1907.
He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and served for five years,
but was forced to retire after contracting tuberculosis.
   Flat broke after a failed campaign for the California
legislature in 1938, Heinlein saw an ad in Thrilling Wonder Stories
magazine offering a $50 prize for a story by an amateur. Instead of
entering that contest, Heinlein sent his first story to Astounding
Science Fiction magazine, which paid him $70.
   His books were written in a spare, matter-of-fact style but
presented readers with thoughtful questions about how life should
be lived.
   In his most popular novel, ``Stranger in a Strange Land,''
Valentine Michael Smith is a human raised by Martians. Smith
challenged his home planet's values with his own priorities,
including universal free love, nudity and many sexual encounters.
He also ``discorporated'' or made disappear authority figures he
felt were bad.
   The book, which became something of a text for the
counter-culture of the 1960s, introduced ``grok,'' Heinlein's word
for intuitive understanding. In that book, Heinlein also introduced
the water bed.
   In ``Methuselah's Children'' and later in other books, character
Lazarus Long provides more food for thought. For instance, on how
to get help, Long says: ``Never appeal to a man's better nature. He
may not have one. Invoking his self-interest gives you more
leverage.''
   Another Heinlein invention, now in common use worldwide, is a
device known as a ``waldo,'' named for the principal character in
the short story, ``Magic, Inc.'' Waldo, who was handicapped,
invented remote-controlled robot arms.
   Two years ago, Heinlein told writer Eric Hoffman that ``writers
don't know how to retire.''
   ``The bottom line,'' he said then, ``is `pay to the order of
...' with the right figures in the blanks. That's the most
important measure of a writer's work. Freelance writing is free
enterprise.''
   Heinlein won numerous awards for his novels and short stories
and was popular with both children and adults, and he was not at
all ashamed that much of his work was for ``pulp'' magazines, under
his own name or pseudonyms.
   ``They didn't want it good,'' Heinlein told The New York Times
in 1980, ``they wanted it Wednesday.''
   Heinlein won the Best Science Fiction Novel award from the World
Science Fiction Convention in 1956, 1959, 1961 and 1966; the Nebula
award from the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1975; and an
unprecedented four Hugo awards, in 1956 for ``Double Star,'' in
1959 for ``Starship Troopers,'' in 1961 for ``Stranger in a Strange
Land'' and in 1966 for ``The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.''
   Other works include ``The Green Hills of Earth'' and ``Puppet
Masters.''
   Heinlein is survived by his wife, Virginia, whom he married in
1948. The couple had no children.

<HEAD>Lawyers for Hakim, Secord, Drop Insistence on Seeing Ultra-Secret
Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The defense has removed a minor obstacle to
the review of classified documents in the Iran-Contra conspiracy
case, according to a transcript of a closed court hearing released
Monday.
   Retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and their lawyers will review a
small group of ultra-sensitive documents that government security
officials were reluctant to show to arms dealers Albert Hakim and
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord.
   Gesell is allowing the defense to review the material to verify
prosecution claims it is not relevant to charges that the four
defendants conspired to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran
arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   ``We don't want to be viewed as obstructing this process,''
Hakim's lawyer N. Richard Janis told U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell, according to the official court transcript of Friday's
closed hearing.
   Janis said he and Secord's lawyer, James E. Sharp, agreed to
abide by the determination of the other defense lawyers that the
documents are not relevant to the case.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh estimated that between 35
and 70 pages of sensitive material not relevant to the case have
been identified by his office and government security experts.
   The defense concession does not dispose of the larger problem of
disclosing sensitive information that may be determined to be
relevant when the case goes to trial.
   Gesell issued an order Monday giving Walsh until May 30 to draw
up a list of secret documents he wants to use as evidence that
won't be declassified by the government.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, only the
government can declassify documents before they are introduced into
evidence. If Walsh is unable to persuade government agencies to
declassify important evidence, Gesell could drop some or all of the
charges.
   No trial date has been set.
   At a hearing two weeks ago, Walsh described some of the most
sensitive documents in his possession as containing information
about U.S. intelligence and military planning. The disclosure of
some secrets could subject some people in the Middle East to
torture or death, Walsh had said, apparently referring to hostages
held there.
   Gesell has ruled that each defendant has the right to examine
the classified material that Walsh has deposited in a secure
facility where the defense lawyers are sifting through a massive
amount of classified documents compiled by the prosecution.
   But government security officials have refused Secord and Hakim
access because the material contains a small number of pages of
ultra-sensitive material.
   Hakim, an Iranian-born U.S. citizen, has never had a security
clearance and Secord has not had one since he left government
several years ago.
   An interdepartmental task force is reviewing some 300,000 pages
of classified material. More than 105,000 pages of documents have
already been put in the secure room that was constructed by the
Justice Department.

   Lech Walesa led a strike rally at the
Lenin shipyard Monday and some 700 workers responded, ``We'll win!
We'll win!'' They shouted down a management offer and took their
strike into its second week.
   Walesa, who founded the independent union Solidarity at the
shipyard in the turbulent summer of 1980, told his comrades he
still has a ``couple of beautiful cards'' to play.
   In his speech, before the workers were asked whether they wanted
to continue striking, Walesa said: ``I was afraid we were broken. .
.. But the mood is changing. People are coming back'' to the
strike. ``Their wives are saying, `You can't abandon them.'''
   At a prayer meeting in the morning, Walesa had told the
strikers: ``We're in good shape. Those who wanted to leave are
gone. Only the tough ones are here.''
   The Solidarity founder, a shipyard electrician who won the 1983
Nobel Peace Prize, and strike committee leader Alojzy Szablewski
spoke at the 45-minute afternoon rally. Walesa, 44, told the
strikers last week he was too tired to lead the strike but would be
the last to leave the shipyard.
   Strikers in Poland customarily occupy the plants rather than
leaving them.
   Szablewski said late Monday that Tadeusz Goclowski, the Roman
Catholic bishop of Gdansk, was trying to get talks with management
started again but there were no signs of resumption.
   Shipyard workers turned down the management offer of pay raises
and reinstatement of some fired activists because it did not
include a legally recognized chapter of Solidarity. The independent
union, first in the Soviet bloc, was suppressed and then outlawed
after martial law was declared Dec. 13, 1981.
   State television reported the rejection of the management offer
and said in an official commentary:
   ``The hint of hope for a positive solution which we presented on
Saturday and Sunday in our newscasts turned out to be illusory. The
organizers of the illegal strike are rejecting every initiative for
a conciliatory and humanitarian settlement.''
   Poland's communist government has not ruled out ending the
strike with force. A pre-dawn police raid last Thursday crushed a
10-day strike by steel workers at Nowa Huta in southern Poland.
   Workers at the 15,000-employee Ursus tractor factory outside
Warsaw tried to mount a strike Monday in sympathy with those at
Gdansk's Lenin shipyard, but it fizzled.
   Opposition spokeswoman Ewa Milewicz said most of the tractor
plant's first shift refused to work and employees leaving the plant
told a photographer at 2 p.m. the strike included about 1,000
people from three departments.
   Employees leaving later, however, reported only about 100
strikers occupying a canteen and said they ended the protest by 9
p.m. The official news agency PAP denied there had been a strike.
   Western reporters who were at the 11,000-worker Lenin shipyard
late Sunday said about 300 strikers remained. Their number appeared
to have more than doubled by the time Walesa spoke at midafternoon
Monday.
   ``If I can find a way to win this strike, I'll have a second
Nobel in the pocket,'' Walesa said.
   ``We'll win! We'll win!'' the workers shouted.
   ``I have a couple of beautiful cards in my hands that I haven't
played yet,'' Walesa said.
   Rejection of the settlement offer came after talks that lasted
more than four hours and ended soon after 8 a.m.
   A morning rally ended with the crowd chanting, ``There is no
freedom without Solidarity!''
   The second rally was held because the strike committee said it
wanted the workers to give the matter more thought. A mediator,
lawyer Wladyslaw Sila-Nowicki, also advised them to reconsider the
proposal, but the strikers again rejected it.
   Sila-Nowicki said he had spoken several times with Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszcaak, the interior minister. The lawyer said Kiszcaak assured
the workers they would not be prosecuted or fired for striking if
they took the offer.
   Sila-Nowicki said management had agreed to a joint commission of
strike committee members and management to oversee implementation
of the agreement. Management had rejected that point Sunday.
   Management agreed to a 15,000-zloty ($38) monthly pay raise, but
the total included some raises already promised, and said
Solidarity activists fired after the imposition of martial law in
1981 would be rehired as needed. Martial law was lifted later,
replaced with tough new regulations.
   Pay at the Lenin shipyard averages 42,000 zlotys ($105) monthly.
   Kiszczak also promised the release of most political prisoners,
including some jailed since the strikes began two weeks ago,
Sila-Nowicki said.
   Ten Western journalists were detained Monday after leaving the
shipyard, held about 2{ hours and released after polite
questioning. Film and tape recordings were confiscated and the
reporters were told not to enter the yard again without permission.
   Those detained were a reporter and photographer for Reuters, a
reporter for the West German agency DPA, a reporter and
photographer for The Associated Press, reporters for the Financial
Times of London and Newsweek magazine and a three-member West
German television crew.

<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II presided Monday at
the opening of Australia's new Parliament House, which took nearly
$1 billion and eight years to build. About 2,000 aborigines
protested outside.
   The British queen called the building a crowning expression of
Australian faith in parliamentary democracy and noted that it
replaces a provisional Parliament building opened 61 years earlier
by her father, King George VI.
   Aboriginal activists and sympathizers began gathering at dawn to
protest the proceedings and their number grew to about 2,000 by the
time the queen arrived.
   Chants of ``Shame, shame, shame!'' and ``We want land rights
now!'' virtually drowned out the national anthem ``Advance
Australia Fair'' during welcoming ceremonies attended by Prime
Minister Bob Hawke and other dignitaries.
   Robyn Dass, an aboriginal activist, said the new building is on
a site sacred to the aborigines.
   Police said cables of the outdoor public address system were cut
before the queen arrived but were restored about 10 minutes into
the ceremony.
   The opening of Parliament House is a highlight of year-long
celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the European settlement of
Australia.
   At a final cost of $1.1 billion ($836 million U.S.), it also is
the nation's most expensive building. There is enough concrete in
it to build 25 replicas of Sydney's landmark Opera House.
   Opening it was Elizabeth's last official function of a
three-week tour that was her 11th visit to the country as queen.
   Huge crowds welcomed her and her husband, Prince Philip. The
aborigines turned their backs on the royal couple and sat down en
masse.
   During the queen's inspection of an honor guard, a 3-year-old
aboriginal girl left the crowd and thrust a bouquet of flowers into
her hands.
   She accepted the flowers, wrapped in aboriginal ribbons of
black, red and gold, but did not speak to the girl, Zena Wickes.
   In dedicating the bulding, the queen said: ``I rather doubt that
the founding fathers of the Australian federation could have
foreseen that their work would be crowned by such a confident
expression of Australia's faith in parliamentary democracy.''
   Hawke paid tribute to Australia's indigenous people in his
speech, noting that they had lived in the area for 21,000 years.
The aboriginal word ``canberra'' means meeting place.
   The new Parliament House has 4,500 rooms, public galleries
seating 1,000 people, kitchens capable of producing 8,000 meals a
day and parking space for more than 2,000 vehicles.
   The old building, half a mile away, is to become a museum.

   Rival militias fought hand-to-hand Monday
for control of Shiite slums and rained shells on each other's
positions in the grim shantytowns despite Syrian army orders to
stop the four days of carnage.
   Police said 65 people were killed and 150 wounded Monday,
bringing total casualties in the Shiite territorial war to 154 dead
and 367 wounded.
   The thunder of shellfire rolled over the city all day and into
the night. Gunmen atop racing ambulances fired into the air to
clear traffic so the wounded could reach hospitals. Radio stations
appealed for blood donations.
   Doctors confirmed allegations by both sides that wounded
fighters were dragged from ambulances and hospitals and slaughtered
by their rivals.
   Fighting began Friday between the moderate militia Amal, which
means Hope and has Syria's backing, and the radical, pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Syria has 25,000 soldiers in Lebanon, about 7,500 in Beirut. It
is the main power broker after 13 years of civil war but is being
challenged by Iran, which the Syrians support in its 8-year-old war
with Iraq.
   The battle for control of Beirut's southern slums, where an
estimated 250,000 Shiites live, raised fears about the fate of 18
foreign hostages. They include nine Americans and most are believed
held by Hezbollah-affiliated kidnappers in the 16-square-mile
Shiite enclave.
   Late Monday, six committees, each grouping a Syrian officer, an
Iranian Embassy official, a representative of Amal and one from
Hezbollah, were formed and charged with enforcing a cease-fire.
   Fighting eased as the committees drove into the slums, but
sporadic bursts of cannon and machine-gun fire echoed in the region
well into the night.
   Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites are its largest sect. With Syria's
blessing, Amal crushed Hezbollah last month in predominantly Shiite
south Lebanon. The four-day battle cost 62 lives and 150 people
were wounded.
   Among Monday's victims were three Amal militiamen killed with
axes. Their bodies were taken to Beirut's American University
Hospital. Officials there said it was full to capacity and could
not handle more casualties.
   An Amal spokesman said privately the three ``were axed to death
after they were taken prisoner by Hezbollah.''
   Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syrian military intelligence chief in
Lebanon, said he told both factions to stop fighting.
   ``It is impermissible to let the current state of affairs
continue,'' he told reporters after meetings with government,
religious and militia leaders.
   Asked whether Syrian troops would intervene, he said: ``We hope
it won't come to that, but we shall not allow the bloodshed to
continue.''
   Syria moved 7,500 soldiers into Moslem west Beirut in February
1987 to end a monthslong power struggle between Amal, led by
Justice Minister Nabih Berri, and Walid Jumblatt's Druse militia.
   Senior Moslem clerics urged Syria to repeat in the southern
slums ``the successful west Beirut experiment of the past year.''
   Gun battles were reported in al-Sahel Hospital. A doctor said
some militiamen forced surgeons at gunpoint to operate on dead
comrades ``to bring them to life.''
   An American University Hospital employee said: ``We take only
victims needing emergency surgery, then send them to recuperate''
at inadequately equipped clinics in Druse-held mountains outside
Beirut.
   Police said Hezbollah fighters, wearing red headbands, appeared
to have gained ground Monday in the densely populated Ghobeiri, Bir
el-Abed, Hay Madi and Mesharafieh districts.
   Amal's fighters, whose headbands are green or black, control
most of Haret Hreik, Mreiji, Roweiss, Shiyah and Kasskass, a police
spokesman said.
   ``Hezbollah has established control over half of the slums,'' he
said. ``It only controlled one-third before the current fighting.''
   The spokesman, whose name cannot be used because of regulations,
said Amal had an advantage because it and the Syrians control
entrances to the slums.
   ``This is Amal's trump card,'' he said. ``It can move in
supplies and reinforcements from several other areas at will, while
Hezbollah cannot get a fly in or out.''
   An Amal fighter in the Shiyah district, Tarek Saad, aimed his
shoulder-fired rocket launcher toward Hay Madi and said to
reporters: ``God willing, we will liberate Hay Madi and Bir el-Abed
and free all the foreign hostages. We know they are imprisoned
there.''
   There has been no word on the hostages since the fighting began.
   Police said about half the slum residents had fled to west
Beirut, camping on sidewalks or taking refuge in mosques, sports
stadiums or schools.
   Ahmed Kurdi, an Associated Press photo technician, was trapped
with his wife and six children Friday in a shelter in Bir el-Abed,
but escaped Monday.
   ``Shells rained nonstop around us,'' he said. ``Kids screamed
and there was no way to comfort them or feed them.''
   When fighting abated for a short time Monday, Kurdi said, ``I
told my wife `This is our chance to get out.' We did, dodging
sniper fire as we ran out of Bir el-Abed.''

   ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Anything Goes''
and ``Into the Woods,'' three big musicals, dominated the 1988 Tony
award nominations Monday as each show garnered 10 nominations.
   Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Phantom,'' the story of a deformed
composer and his love for a young soprano, and ``Into the Woods,''
a reworking of several fairy tales by Stephen Sondheim and James
Lapine, will compete for best musical of the 1987-88 Broadway
season against ``Sarafina!'' a South African show about township
high school students, and ``Romance-Romance,'' two one-act musicals
about love.
   The same four musicals were also nominated for best score.
   ``M. Butterfly,'' the story of a love affair between a French
naval officer and a star of the Beijing Opera, topped the
non-musical categories with seven nominations.
   It will compete for best play against ``Joe Turner's Come and
Gone,'' August Wilson's drama about the grandchildren of slaves
coming to terms with the past; David Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow,'' a
Hollywood morality tale of two movie producers; and ``A Walk in the
Woods'' by Lee Blessing, a two-character play about American and
Soviet arms control negotiators in Geneva.
   Derek Jacobi, who played the brilliant British mathematican Alan
Turing in ``Breaking the Code,'' was nominated for best actor in a
play. His competition: John Lithgow, of ``M. Butterfly''; Robert
Prosky, the Soviet diplomat in ``A Walk in the Woods''; and Ron
Silver, a sleazy Hollywood producer in ``Speed-the-Plow.''
   Glenda Jackson's portrayal of Lady Macbeth captured a best
actress nomination. She will compete against Joan Allen, a tortured
dancer in Lanford Wilson's ``Burn This,'' and Blythe Danner and
Frances McDormand, who played Blanche Du Bois and Stella Kowalski
in a revival of Tennessee Williams' ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
   Patti LuPone, the ebullient Reno Sweeney in the revival of
``Anything Goes'' was nominated for best actress in a musical. Her
competition: Joanna Gleason, the practical baker's wife of ``Into
the Woods''; Judy Kuhn, the love interest in ``Chess''; and Alison
Fraser of ``Romance-Romance.''
   Michael Crawford, the title character in ``The Phantom of the
Opera,'' was the favorite to win the award for best actor in a
musical. He faces Scott Bakula of ``Romance-Romance''; David
Carroll, the Russian grandmaster in ``Chess''; and Howard McGillin,
an ambitious young stockbroker in Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes.''
   For the first time in years, more than enough nominees filled
the many categories. Among the people snubbed by the Tony
nominating committee were: Sarah Brightman, the leading lady of
``The Phantom of Opera'' and Lloyd Webber's wife; pop star Madonna,
making her Broadway debut in Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow''; John
Malkovich, the star of ``Burn This,'' which also was ignored;
Bernadette Peters of ``Into the Woods''; Christopher Plummer who
played the title role in ``Macbeth''; and Trevor Nunn who directed
``Chess'' and was last year's big Tony winner with ``Les
Miserables.''
   Besides ``Anything Goes,'' nominated for best revival were ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``Dreamgirls'' and ``Cabaret.''
   Three performers in ``Cabaret'' _ opera singer Regina Resnik,
Alyson Reed and Werner Klemperer, best known from TV's ``Hogan's
Heroes'' _ received nominations for featured actress and actor in a
musical.
   The other nominees for featured actress in a musical were Judy
Kaye of ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and Leleti Khumalo of
``Sarafina!'' Klemperer faces Robert Westenberg of ``Into the
Woods'' and two actors from ``Anything Goes,'' Bill McCutcheon and
Anthony Heald.
   Harold Prince, the director of ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' was
the top contender for best director of a musical. His competition
is Jerry Zaks, ``Anything Goes''; James Lapine, ``Into the Woods'';
and Mbongeni Ngema, ``Sarafina!''
   The battle for best director of a play pits John Dexter, ``M.
Butterfly''; Gregory Mosher, ``Speed-the-Plow''; Lloyd Richards for
``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' and Clifford Williams, ``Breaking
the Code.''
   ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' picked up three featured actress
nominations, for Kimberleigh Aarn, L. Scott Caldwell and Kimberly
Scott. Also nominated was Kate Nelligan in the scathing British
satire ``Serious Money.''
   ``Joe Turner'' got one nomination for featured actor in a play _
Delroy Lindo. The other nominees are Michael Gough, ``Breaking the
Code''; Lou Liberatore, ``Burn This''; and B.D. Wong of ``M.
Butterfly.''
   The winners, selected by some 730 members connected to the
theatrical industry, will be announced June 5 in a nationally
televised show on CBS. The Tonys are named for actress-director
Antoinette Perry, who was active in the American Theater Wing
during the 1940s.

<HEAD>Colombian Rebels Free Kidnap Victims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels led by a defrocked Roman
Catholic priest on Monday freed 11 people they kidnapped last week
to publicize guerrilla attempts to drive foreign oil companies out
of Colombia.
   The victims were a West German, three Swiss, a Frenchman, a
Mexican and five Colombians.
   All were in good shape, said a police source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   A total of 17 people were kidnapped from May 3-5 by the National
Liberation Army, a pro-Cuban guerrilla group.
   The rebels released two Colombians last Friday. A West german
and three Colombians are still held captive.
   Helmut Luecker, the West German honorary consul in Medellin,
said in an interview with the Colombian radio chain RCN that he was
kidnapped in Medellin on May 3 by men posing as construction
workers.
   ``They had blocked the street with a wooden barrier, and I had
to stop my car,'' he said. ``They showed me their guns and said
right from the first that it was a political kidnapping and that I
had no reason to fear for my life.''
   Luecker said he was well treated during his captivity.
   He said his captors talked with him about what they said was the
need to nationalize foreign oil operations and about right-wing
death squads. The death squads have been blamed for killing an
estimated 800 people in the last two years.
   Luecker was released in Medellin along with two Colombian
reporters held with him.
   The National Liberation Army said in a communique last week that
it kidnapped the people to draw attention to its campaign against
foreign oil companies.
   The government has exploration and production contracts with
more than two dozen foreign oil companies.
   Guerrillas of the Liberation Army have attacked oil company
camps and repeatedly bombed Colombia's main oil pipeline.
   The guerrilla group is run by a former priest, Manuel Perez of
Spain. He joined the rebels 10 years ago and is one of about a
dozen Catholic priests who are members of guerrilla groups.
   Those freed Monday were Luecker; two Swiss men, Richard
Aufderggen, a businessman, and Wilfried Lehner, the leader in
Colombia for the religious group Peace on Earth; a Swiss social
worker, Irene Nilsson; the press officer for the French Embassy,
Jean Christophe Rampal; a reporter for the Mexico City daily
Excelsior, Raymundo Riva Palacio, and five Colombian reporters.

   A Senate subcommittee chairman challenged the
counselor to Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Monday to detail
any inaccuracies in the panel's bipartisan report criticizing
Meese's involvement with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., sent William Bradford Reynolds a copy
of the 244-page report, urging him in a letter to ``kindly inform
us'' of any incorrect information, and pointing out that the report
was the work of five Democrats and four Republicans.
   The report accuses Meese of violating White House ethics policy.
   Reynolds on Sunday branded the report as ``sleaze,'' and said
the policy went into effect after ``the Wedtech thing was referred
over to the attorney general.''
   However, the Senate report noted that memos sent to Meese from
his longtime friend E. Robert Wallach about Wedtech came to
then-White House counselor Meese in 1982 as well as in 1981. The
White House policy barring contact by White House staff with
procurement officers about a contract in which a friend has a
financial interest took effect in October 1981.
   The report is based on ``really a very egregious, incorrect
statement of facts,'' said Reynolds, who also is assistant attorney
general in charge of the Justice Department's civil rights division.
   Reynolds made his comments in an appearance on the CBS News
program ``Face the Nation.''
   ``I don't know whether Reynolds has received the report and
letter (from Levin), but, as usual, he will respond in due
course,'' said Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland.
   Meese has acknowledged intervening on behalf of the South Bronx,
N.Y., defense contractor to ensure that the company receiving a
fair hearing from the Army in connection with a $32 million no-bid
contract that eventually, after intercession by Meese's office, was
given to Wedtech. The Army initially had opposed giving the work to
Wedtech, saying the company's price was too high.
   Meese's involvement with Wedtech triggered a criminal
investigation of the attorney general last May 11.

   More than 2,500 government troops Monday
fought a gun battle with extremists inside Sikhism's holiest shrine
and sealed off the temple. Police said at least five people were
killed and five others wounded.
   Witnesses said the fighting continued late Monday.
   Militants began shooting from the Golden Temple after they
spotted officers inspecting their positions from outside the
temple. Security forces fired back with light machine guns, said
Baldev Singh, superintendent of police in Amritsar.
   Sikh radicals have used the complex as a haven before. In June
1984, the army raided it. More than 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs,
were killed.
   Less than four months later, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was
assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards, setting off anti-Sikh
riots in which more than 2,000 people were killed.
   On Monday, Amritsar district police chief Suresh Arona said two
civilians and three suspected militants were seen lying in and near
the shrine.
   One of the civilians, a woman, identified as Dilip Kaur, an
80-year-old Sikh, later died in a hospital.
   Venod Kumar, 30, a Hindu who worked with the local Red Cross,
was killed when he was caught in the crossfire just outside the
main entrance of the temple, police said.
   Authorities imposed an indefinite curfew on the walled central
district of Amritsar to keep civilians indoors.
   Extremists have been fighting since 1982 for a separate Sikh
nation in the northern agricultural province of Punjab, and
thousands of people have been killed.Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million people but are a majority in Punjab.
   The Sikh religion was founded five centuries ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam. Sikhs claim Hindus, the vast
majority in India, discriminate against them.
   Also Monday, United News of India news agency reported that five
people were killed by Sikh extremists in overnight attacks
elsewhere in Punjab. On Saturday, Sikh gunmen killed 13 Hindu
migrant workers at a wedding party in neighboring Haryana state.
   At least 941 people have been reported slain so far this year _
more than twice the rate in 1987, when Sikh extremists killed 1,000
people. Most victims were Hindus or moderate Sikhs.
   A government statement released Monday in Chandigarh, capital of
Punjab, called the shooting from inside the Golden Temple a ``great
provocation.''
   At the shrine, troopers sealed off exits and kept people from
entering.
   ``We may have to take drastic action against the terrorists. We
are watching,'' Arora said.
   Among Monday's injured was S.S. Virk, deputy inspector-general
of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force, authorities said.
The United News of India said Virk, a Sikh, was out of danger after
surgery for a bullet wound in the chin.
   He and other senior security officers had gone to posts on
rooftops near the Golden Temple to look at a bunker Sikh militants
were building at the western end of the complex, police reported.
   They said gunfire came from at least 16 points in the temple
complex, mainly from Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifles.
   Violence has increased since Jasbir Singh Rode was made the
Golden Temple's chief priest early in March. He had been jailed
under government anti-terrorism rules but released in an effort by
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the late leader's son, to placate Sikh
extremists and encourage them to negotiate.
   Since Rode's return, there have been persistent reports that the
radicals were building bunkers and firing ports in the complex.
Amritsar residents said they heard midnight target-practice
sessions in the shrine.

<HEAD>Reagan Quoted as Calling Regan Book `Bunch of Falsehoods'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 22nd graf bgng ``Earlier, Fitzwater'' to restore dropped

<TEXT>
   President Reagan was quoted Monday as telling
a luncheon guest that Donald T. Regan's tell-all book was ``a bunch
of falsehoods'' and the White House denounced it as a ``breach of
confidence.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to say whether
astrology was used to determine the president's schedule, but said
first lady Nancy Reagan would continue to consult an astrologer and
said ``she has that right.''
   As Regan's new insider account went on sale, syndicated
columnist Carl Rowan, who had lunch with Reagan on Monday, quoted
the president as calling the book by his former chief of staff ``a
bunch of falsehoods'' and saying, ```I'll be damned if I'll just
stand by and let them railroad my wife.'''
   ``He claims, for example, that Mrs. Reagan never asked him to
fire former CIA Director (William J.) Casey,'' Rowan said of his
conversation with Reagan. ``He says Mrs. Reagan didn't fire Regan.
... He says Regan got ticked off when somebody leaked the story
that Howard Baker was going to replace him as chief of staff.''
   Regan was ousted as White House chief of staff in early 1987,
reportedly at the urging of Mrs. Reagan, among others.
   Rowan, in an interview on WUSA-TV in Washington, also said the
president told him a three-month period of inactivity following his
July 1985 colon cancer surgery ``had nothing to with astrology,''
as maintained in the book.
   He said Reagan told him Mrs. Reagan ``was only trying to get
Regan to honor what the doctors had put on paper, and said the
president could or couldn't do.
   ``He said she was very upset and had said to him that she feared
that she had brought all this down on his head, and he had told
her, `No, honey, I brought all this down on your head by taking
this job,''' Rowan quoted Reagan as saying.
   Fitzwater, meanwhile, repeatedly sidestepped requests to say
whether Mrs. Reagan's stargazing has had any connection with her
husband's public outings.
   ``Every first lady since Martha Washington has had a role in the
presidency,'' Fitzwater said, ``and I don't think anyone denies a
role of a wife and her husband. ... But I'm not going to try to
characterize any specific responsibilities.''
   ``The new book by Donald Regan is a kiss-and-tell story in the
mold of all books that seek to exploit the presidency or the first
family for personal self-interest,'' Fitzwater said.
   Regan's book, ``For the Record,'' depicted a passive president
unduly influenced by his wife on many matters, including the
scheduling of public appearances. Regan suggested that Mrs.
Reagan's interference in scheduling harmed her husband's presidency
at times.
   Fitzwater said Reagan feels ``deep personal disappointment with
this breach of confidence.'' Mrs. Reagan was quoted by her press
secretary as saying, ``I was taken aback by the vengefulness of the
attack. It comes through to me that Don Regan doesn't really like
me.''
   Asked about a weekend White House statement labeling his book as
a product of ``vindictiveness and revenge,'' Regan responded in an
NBC-TV interview, ``They ought to know it when they see it.''
   White House officials have acknowledged Mrs. Reagan's interest
in astrology, which it said was heightened in the aftermath of the
March 30, 1981, assassination attempt on Reagan.
   But the officials never have conceded that astrology was a
factor in setting Reagan's schedule _ as Regan alleges in his book.
   As some contents of the book became public late last week,
Reagan emphatically denied that astrology played any role in policy
decisions.
   At the conclusion of a Rose Garden ceremony Monday honoring
small business executives, Reagan was asked whether astrology
played any role in the making of his schedule.
   ``It can't, because it never has,'' Reagan said.
   Fitzwater quickly told reporters the president had misunderstood
the question, and had thought he was being asked the more general
question of astrology's role in policy decisions.
   Reagan's answer, the spokesman said, should be taken as a
reiteration of the president's statement of last Friday, in which
Reagan denied using stargazing in the decision-making process.
   Earlier, Fitzwater was pressed during a news briefing to say
whether astrology still plays a role in deciding the president's
schedule and public appearances.
   Both Fitzwater and Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press
secretary, said Mrs. Reagan will continue to consult with an
astrologist, who has been identified as San Francisco socialite
Joan Quiqley.
   ``She doesn't plan to stop talking to her,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
She said these conversations will take place on an ``as-needed
basis. ... It's not a daily, weekly, type of thing.''
   An administration official, discussing the atmosphere at the
White House on grounds he remain unidentified, said ``I'm not
noticing any disruptions'' as a result of the furor over the Regan
book.
   Fitzwater denied that the brouhaha was adversely affecting
Reagan's ability to perform.
   ``The president's management style and his personal methods of
leadership and management have been discussed in any number of
forums,'' the spokesman said. ``The bottom line is that they work.''
   Fitzwater's predecessor, Larry Speakes, who touched off a furor
with his earlier book acknowledging that he had fabricated quotes
in Reagan's name, said Monday he had some qualms about the newest
revelations.
   ``Who's to say his style isn't the best,'' Speakes said in a
Cable News Network interview. ``He had a good grip on the
presidency. He managed it just right and it worked well with one
notable exception _ Iran-Contra.''
   Fitzwater repeatedly suggested that reporters were blowing the
stargazing matter out of proportion.
   ``Why does every newspaper in America carry a horoscope? Does
every editor and publisher think it's unwieldy? As a personal
comfort, millions of people look to astrology,'' Fitzwater said.
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, a staunch Reagan political supporter,
expressed dismay over the allegations in the Regan book.
   ``I'm sincerely hopeful that Mr. Regan was exaggerating or
misstating the facts,'' Falwell said in a statement issued by his
office.
   ``As one who believes in God as the creator of the universe, it
is incomprehensible to me to think of consulting the stars rather
than their maker,'' he said. ``A belief in God and a belief in
astrology cannot be reconciled.''

   As the uproar over Donald T. Regan's book on
Nancy Reagan's use of astrology engulfed the White House on Monday,
the first lady passed the day ``doing business as usual,'' her
spokeswoman said.
   The first lady played hostess to Princess Chulabhorn of Thailand
over tea and coffee and held meetings with her staff, said her
spokeswoman, Elaine Crispen.
   ``She was doing business as usual,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
   The spokeswoman said she expected President Reagan and his wife
would spend ``a nice, quiet evening tonight'' in the private
quarters of the White House.
   ``You can't ask for a better support system than the one they
give to each other,'' she said.

   Argentina's most-wanted military
fugitive, cashiered Army Gen. Carlos Suarez Mason, came home in
handcuffs Monday to face 39 murder charges linked to Argentina's
``dirty war'' against leftists.
   Extradited by a U.S. District Court in California, the balding,
stocky ex-general arrived aboard a regular flight of Aerolineas
Argentinas, the Argentine airline, from New York.
   The plane was stopped 300 yards from the airport terminal and
Suarez Mason, dressed in grey slacks, a sweater and white tennis
shoes, was removed and placed aboard an armored prisoner-transport
vehicle.
   Escorted by three police cars, an armored car and an ambulance,
the ex-general was taken first to Federal Police Headquarters in
downtown Buenos Aires, then removed to a special top-security jail
and finally placed in a small cell, reserved for prisoners facing
trial, at the somber Federal Court Building.
   Federal Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo said Suarez Mason, 64,
would be held ``in isolation'' there until questioning later this
week by federal judges.
   ``We also have to wait for the official translation of the
sentence dictated by U.S. Judge Lowell Jensen,'' who ordered Suarez
Mason's extradition on April 27 after 15 months of hearings in San
Francisco, Moreno Ocampo said.
   He said, ``I am going to request a life sentence ... (the
maximum) and he will be sentenced to life.''
   Moreno Ocampo predicted the trial could begin ``in late July or
the beginning of August.''
   Jensen ruled that Suarz Mason, who fled Argentina in 1984 and
was arrested by U.S. marshals in January, 1987 in a San Francicco
suburb, could be tried in Argentina on charges of 39 murders,
allegedly conducted by troops under his command.
   Argentina, supporting its case with 1,600 pages of documents,
had sought Suarez Mason's extradition on 43 charges of murder as
well as other crimes. He had been accused in Argentina in 635
separate cases of human rights violations as well as
misappropriation of more than $2 million in government funds.
   The U.S. judge rejected four of the murder charges, ruling that
identification of the victims was inadequate, approved a charge of
forging a passport renewal, and also rejected 23 kidnapping
charges, saying the five-year legal deadline for filing the charges
had expired in 1984.
   Under extradition law, Suarez Mason can be tried only on charges
for which extradition was approved.
   Suarez Mason's trial had been personally ordered by President
Raul Alfonsin shortly after the civilian president took office in
December 1983, ending nearly eight years of rightist military rule.
   The former commander of the Buenos Aires-based 1st Army Corps,
was stripped of rank and pension in April 1984, after being
declared ``in rebellion'' for ignoring repeated summonses to appear
for questioning in connection with the abduction, torture and
murder of suspected leftists in the late 1970s.
   A government-appointed commission has reported that at least
9,000 Argentines disappeared in the ``dirty war'' against leftist
subversives waged by the armed forces regime that seized power in
1976 after ousting former President Isabel Peron.
   From 1976 to 1978, Suarez Mason commanded the 1st Corps, in
whose area more than half of the disappearances took place. Then he
was named head of the Joint Chief of Staff.
   When he retired in 1981, he was named president of the huge
state oil monopoly Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, a post he
held until 1982.
   The misappropriation of government funds charge is linked to
Suarez Mason's period as head of the oil company.
   In other trials ordered by Alfonsin, five former ruling junta
members, including two ex-presidents, were convicted in December
1985 of human rights offenses and sentenced to prison terms ranging
from life to four years. They now are serving their terms at a
military prison.
   The Argentine Congress last May approved a so-called ``law of
due obedience,'' which absolved most of the more than 300 military
officers from trial on rights abuse charges on grounds that they
were following orders from superiors. The law did not absolve
high-ranking officers who directed the anti-subversive campaign.

<HEAD>Hail Peppers Michigan, Ohio Valley</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms developed Monday over lower Michigan, Indiana and
western Ohio, producing hail in many communities, while other parts
of the Midwest had rain and gusty winds.
   One-inch-diameter hail was reported in Indiana west of
Greensburg, at Warren and north of Batesville. Hail the size of
quarters fell in parts of Madison County, in east-central Indiana,
and southwest of Muncie.
   Nickel-sized hail fell near Napoleon in northwest Ohio, and
dime-sized hail was reported near Greenville in west-central Ohio.
   Reports of pea- to marble-sized hail were received from across
much of southern Michigan. A resident of Buchanan, Mich., near
South Bend, Ind., reported his yard was covered with
half-inch-diameter hail late Monday morning.
   A thunderstorm at Haggerstown, Ind., was accompanied by 50 mph
winds, small hail and heavy rain.
   Tornado watches were in effect until Monday evening for
southeast lower Michigan, most of Ohio, southeast Indiana and
north-central Kentucky.
   On Sunday as many as 82 tornadoes swept through the Midwest.
There were few injuries, but one man was killed when high wind
collapsed a building under construction in Indiana.
   Elsewhere, Monday, showers fell from western New York across
western Pennsylvania and West Virginia to the southern Appalachians.
   Light rain was scattered over the upper Mississippi Valley.
Spotty showers were reported in western Montana and northern
California.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included three-tenths of an inch at Duluth and Hibbing, Minn., and
about a quarter-inch at Glenview Naval Air Station near Chicago;
Saginaw, Mich.; Fort Wayne, Ind.; and Rochester, Minn.
   The rain at Rochester was accompanied by wind gusting to 46 mph.
Winds were gusty Monday afternoon from the northern Plains to the
upper and middle Mississippi Valley.
   Skies were clear or partly cloudy from the Great Plains to the
West Coast, over the lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast and
along the East Coast to New England.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 42 degrees at
Yellowstone, Wyo., to 97 degrees at Junction, Texas. The morning
low was 20 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Tuesday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms along
the Gulf Coast and East Coast states and in the northern
Appalachians, scattered showers from the central Appalachians to
the eastern Great Lakes and showers and a few thunderstorms in
parts of Washington and eastern Oregon.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the 60s or 70s across
most of the nation, except 80s from the south Atlantic Coast states
across the Gulf Coast, southern Plains and Southwestern desert to
interior California and 90s in parts of southwest Texas and
southern California and Arizona deserts.

<TEXT>
   Ambassador Arthur Davis ordered his
chartered Panamanian plane to leave a civilian airport and fly to a
U.S. air base because he was concerned for his safety, the U.S.
Embassy said Monday.
   It said Davis made the decision Sunday afternoon when he saw
Panamanian security men arguing with his own security detail after
the plane landed at the small civilian Paitilla airport.
   ``It was a judgment call,'' an embassy statement said. ``The
ambassador's security detail made the judgment that the (situation
at Paitilla) was not a good environment.''
   Maj. Pascual Gonzalez, director of the Panamanian Civil
Aeronautics Board, called it a hijacking incident. He said U.S.
officials refused to provide any information about the plane after
it landed at Howard Air Base in the former Panama Canal Zone about
five miles from Panama City.
   It was the second apparent attempt by Panamanian security to
interfere with the ambassador's movements. On April 3, a military
vehicle tried to stop his limousine as he left the Vatican
ambassador's residence.
   Relations between the United States and Panama have been
difficult since the Reagan administration began supporting efforts
to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as commander of the Defense
Forces and the power behind the civilian government.
   A federal court in Florida indicted Noriega in February on drug
trafficking charges.
   After Noriega had the legislature dismiss President Eric Arturo
Delvalle on Feb. 26, the United States began imposing financial
sanctions on Panama. Delvalle had tried to fire the general as
military commander the day before. The United States still
recognizes Delvalle as president.
   Banks began cashing checks and permitting withdrawals Monday for
the first time in more than two months, with strict limits on the
amount to be taken out of an account.
   No withdrawals had been allowed since March 3, longer at some
banks, because of runs on deposits and cash shortages. New rules
limit withdrawals from checking accounts to 25 percent of the March
3 balance, to a maximum of $10,000.
   Some banks began taking deposits April 18 and performing some
other operations a week later.
   Gonzalez, director of the aeronautics board, told a news
conference ``procedures'' were required for a civilian aircraft to
land at a military base and spend the night there. He said the
plane chartered by the embassy group, a six-seat Piper, did not
follow them.
   The embassy statement said ``the ambassador considered it an
emergency,'' and ordered the pilot to take off from the civilian
airport for nearby Howard.
   Embassy officials would not say who else was on the plane. Davis
and his party were returning from a day at the Contadora resort
island.
   According to Gonzalez, others on the plane included Gabriel
Lewis Galindo Jr., son-in-law of Delvalle, who is in hiding in
Panama, and the son of an opposition leader.
   He said the incident started when airport security personnel saw
four ``armed men on the restricted grounds.'' He said airport
security questioned them and identified them as U.S. citizens.
   ``It was then that the plane landed,'' he said, adding that
embassy security men talked to the ambassador on the radio and the
plane took off.
   The embassy said Panamanian security men were armed with M-16
rifles and shotguns, demanded passports and other documents and
``their manner was considered hostile.''
   ``As far as we are concerned, until we conclude the
investigation, the plane was hijacked or stolen,'' Gonzalez said.
   The plane's owner, Hugo Giraud, attended the news conference
with the major and said the embassy had not informed him his plane
was at Howard.
   A U.S. Embassy official said the aircraft remained there because
``a new flight plan must be filed'' before it could be flown out.

<HEAD>Sailor Court-Martialed On AIDS-Assault Charge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former fiancee of a sailor carrying the
AIDS virus testified Monday that she filed an AIDS-related assault
charge against him to protect other women he might date.
   Jeannine Elmer, 28, said she learned of his test results only
one or two days after having sex with Petty Officer 2nd Class John
E. Crawford. She told the judge and jury at Crawford's
court-martial that she worried that he might have sex with someone
else without telling them about the test.
   ``What I went through _ what I'm going through _ I don't want
any female to go through,'' Elmer said in the first day of
Crawford's trial.
   The AIDS-assault trial is a first of its kind for the Navy,
officials said.
   Elmer also said that since the encounter in April, 1987, she had
tested negative three times for HIV antibodies. Crawford tested
positive in March 1987 for HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, the
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Scientists do not know if everyone infected by the virus
eventually will develop the incurable ailment, which destroys the
body's ability to fight off disease.
   Crawford has said the test result surprised him because he does
not consider himself to be in any of the high-risk groups normally
associated with AIDS.
   He could be stripped of rank, dishonorably discharged and
sentenced to up to a decade behind bars if found guilty of the
charges, which include adultery, or ``wrongfully having sexual
intercourse with a married woman, not his wife.'' Elmer was
separated from her third husband when she was dating Crawford.
   The trial at the Navy's Treasure Island facility is expected to
last three days.
   The 27-year-old sailor denies the charges, saying that he wore a
condom during sex and that Elmer knew he had tested positive for
the HIV virus. He claims her charges are based on jealousy.
   Elmer testified that she confronted Crawford about his test
results about a week after she learned about his condition from a
mutual friend.
   ``I asked him why did he take me to bed with him if he knew,''
she said. ``He said `I'm sorry. I don't know why.'''
   Elmer said that she told Crawford she loved him and wanted to
take care of him and that he then proposed to her. However, she
said, Crawford ended their engagement about two weeks later.
   Elmer was composed as she testified before the judge, Capt. R.M.
Mollison, and the seven-member jury. However, she heatedly denied a
suggestion that she brought the charge to avenge herself after
Crawford broke off their brief engagement.
   Crawford, a Magnolia, Ark., native, lives off-base with another
woman, to whom he has been engaged for six months.
   Lt. Cmdr. George Farrar, a Navy spokesman at the Treasure Island
Naval Station, where the trial is being held, said the case was the
first of its kind in the Navy. An Army private is charged in
another AIDS-related assault case, and his court-martial is set to
resume on Wednesday in Fort Huachuca, Ariz.

<HEAD>Security Council Condemns Chemical Weapons Use in Iran-Iraq War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council on Monday condemned
the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and called on the
warring parties to refrain from future use of the outlawed arms.
   The resolution was passed unanimously by the 15-member council.
   Iran has pushed for Security Council condemnation of Iraq for
using chemical weapons. Diplomats said Iran was displeased that the
resolution did not single out Iraq.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters later told a news conference
the United States has evidence that both sides are using chemical
weapons.
   He said the use of chemical weapons and the ``war of the
cities'' missile attacks on Tehran, Baghdad and other cities
complicated U.S. efforts to impose sanctions and an arms embargo
against Iran for refusing a truce.
   Walters said the horror of the recent use of chemical weapons
underscores the urgency of a negotiated settlement in the
7{-year-old war and the need to implement a U.N. cease-fire
resolution.
   The council resolution called on all countries to impose strict
controls on the export of chemical-weapons materials to both Iran
and Iraq and noted that a Geneva protocol of 1925 bans the use of
chemical arms.
   West Germany, Italy and Japan sponsored the measure.
   The meeting was called to discuss Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar's April 25 report on charges of chemical weapons use by
both sides. The U.N. chief sent a physician from Geneva to visit
both Iran and Iraq and examine victims of chemical attacks.
   Each side accused the other of using chemical weapons and Iran
claims Iraq killed 5,000 people, mostly Iraqi Kurds, in a chemical
attack on the Iranian-held Halabja territory of Iraq.
   Iraq did not deny the charge and said it would use all necessary
means to repel Iranian forces. It also accused Iran of using
chemical weapons.
   The secretary-general's report did not blame one side or the
other, but said evidence existed in both countries of the use of
chemical weapons.

   An earthquake shook Jamaica shortly
before noon Monday, rocking buildings in Kingston and sending
frightened residents fleeing into the street.
   There were no reports of deaths and police said only one injury
was reported.
   They said Natalie Thompson, 14, suffered broken ankles when she
jumped in panic from the second floor of the Rosemount School in
Linstead, St. Catherine, 40 miles northwest of the capital of
Kingston.
   Officials said they had no reports of significant structural
damage but the Office of Disaster Preparedness is conducting an
island-wide survey of bridges and buildings.
   The Seismic Research Unit at the University of the West Indies
recorded the quake at 11:24 a.m. (EDT) and said its center was in
the Caribbean Sea about 75 miles northeast of Montego Bay and 15
miles south of the Cuban communities of Pilon and Portillo.
   It said the earthquake measured 4.2 degrees on the Richter scale.
   The university said the worst earthquake recorded in Jamaica was
on Jan. 14, 1907, when Kingston was virtually destroyed. More than
1,000 people were killed and 9,000 were left homeless.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by a quake as
recored on seismographs. A tremor registering 4 is capable of
causing moderate damage and one with a magnitude of 5 can cause
considerable damage. A quake recorded at 7 is considered a major
quake.

<HEAD>Peres Talks of Larger Soviet Role in Mideast Peace Hunt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel
said Monday the Soviet Union and Soviet-bloc countries could play
an increasing role in the search for peace in the Middle East.
   He came to Madrid to attend a meeting of the council of the
Socialist International after stopping off in Italy on his flight
from Hungary on Monday.
   His weekend visit to Hungary was unexpected and was the first by
a top Israeli official to that communist state.
   Peres told reporters in Madrid the position of the Soviet bloc
``is becoming more and more important in the peace process.''
   He met in Budapest Sunday with Prime Minister Karoly Grosz,
Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi and Janos Berecz, secretary of the
Hungarian Communist Party's Central Committee.
   An official at the Israeli Embassy in Madrid, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said ``it would not be surprising'' for
Peres to hold talks with Soviet observers attending the Socialist
International meeting.
   Peres and Foreign Minister Guilo Andreotti of Italy discussed
the Mideast situation in a 50-minute meeting at the military
airport in Milan.
   The two also discussed the Arab uprising in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   They later met briefly with reporters. Andreotti said Italy
supports the idea of an international Middle East peace conference.
He also said that while Italy maintains friendly ties with Israel,
it supports the Palestinian cause.
   Yossi Beilin, director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry,
accompanied Peres to Hungary. Beilin said upon his return to
Jerusalem Monday that Hungary is interested in expanding its
economic ties with the Jewish state.
   Hungary, along with all other Soviet-bloc countries except
Romania, cut diplomatic ties with Israel following the 1967 Middle
East war. But last year, the two countries established low-level
diplomatic relations.
   Israel's Foreign Ministry said in Jerusalem without elaboration
that the Peres party and the Hungarian leaders discussed the Middle
East conflict and Hungarian-Israeli ties, including economic issues
and tourism.
   ``I think that this visit, conducted upon Hungary's initiative,
raises our bilateral ties to another level,'' Beilin said on Israel
television.
   But he did not predict a full renewal of diplomatic ties.
   Peres said in Madrid that the visit of U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz to the Middle East in June ``is positive for the
peace process'' but its significance depends on the outcome of the
May 27 summit between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev in Moscow.
   Peres, head of Israel's socialist Labor Party, is to leave
Wednesday for a working trip to Washington that will include talks
with Shultz.

   Gov. Richard Bryan formally sought
federal disaster aid Monday for a community battered by a fuel
plant explosion, while a funeral was held for one of two plant
executives killed in last week's massive blasts.
   Classes resume in 11 of the 12 schools damaged Wednesday in the
series of thunderous explosions, which are estimated to have caused
nearly $73 million in damage.
   The blasts injured 326 people and destroyed nearly 3 million
pounds of the ammonium perchlorate oxidizer manufactured for the
Air Force's Titan missile program.
   Company counsel Keith Rooker said his firm has been the sole
supplier to the Titan rocket program since its inception over 20
years ago and has been the principal supplier to the space shuttle
program.
   Bryan asked for a federal disaster declaration in a letter to
President Reagan outlining the destruction caused by explosions at
the Pacific Engineering and Production Co. ammonium perchlorate
plant.
   Bob King, the state director of emergency management, said the
estimate included $54.5 million in damage to more than 8,000 homes
surrounding the plant and $17.4 million for the two plants and
other businesses.
   Verne Paule, a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman in
San Francisco, said a disaster declaration might not be warranted
because an estimated 90 percent of the damage was covered by
private insurance.
   Seven investigators have been assigned to analyze videotapes and
still photographs taken of the explosions along with evidence from
the debris, said Clark County Fire Department spokesman Bob
Leinbach.
   ``Basically we're taking things very gingerly,'' said Leinbach.
``We're concerned about life safety. We want to make sure what we
touch and move is the right thing to do.''
   A funeral was held Monday for plant manager Bruce Halker, whose
body was found 25 yards from the front entrance to the plant.
   Another executive, company controller Roy Westerfield, was
killed, but his body has not been found.
   Company officials are scheduled to meet with Department of
Defense and NASA officials sometime this week in Washington, where
they will seek emergency help in rebuilding the plant at a site
outside the Las Vegas Valley.
   A second ammonium perchlorate plant remained closed Monday while
its owners, the Kerr-McGee Corp., wait to see what caused the
Pacific Engineering explosions. The plant, the only other in the
country to produce the chemical, is about a mile from the
demolished plant.

<HEAD>Reagan Rules Out Pardons for Iran-Contra Defendants Before Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Monday ruled out the
possibility of pardons before trial for any of the defendants in
the Iran-Contra case, according to a columnist who had lunch with
the president.
   In addition, Reagan said he may not have to ``face that issue''
at all if the trial isn't concluded before his term ends,
syndicated columnist Carl Rowan said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater has said the president
has refused to discuss the issue of pardons in the past.
   Rowan reported on the president's comments during an interview
on WUSA-TV in Washington on Monday evening.
   The president said he ``didn't believe in giving pardons before
people are convicted of anything,'' Rowan related, adding that
Reagan reasoned ``it leaves the cloud of guilt on through the
years.''
   Rowan noted that Reagan left the door open for pardons after the
trial, but given the delays in the start of the trial, Reagan said,
``I won't have to face that issue.''
   At issue is whether Reagan will consider either pretrial or
post-trial pardons of his former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, Oliver L. North, a former National Security Council
staffer, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his
business partner, Albert Hakim.
   The four are charged with conspiring to illegally divert profits
from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Fitzwater said last month: ``I have raised the issue with the
president four or five times myself. I've heard it raised by
others, and every time the president says the same thing which is,
`I'm not discussing pardons.'''
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker has said, ``I think the
president made it abundantly clear that he expects the legal
process to run its course.''

   A federal jury Monday found four members
of a polygamist clan guilty of 20 of 23 counts stemming from the
bombing of a Mormon chapel and 13-day standoff with police that
left a corrections official dead.
   The jury, deliberating 25 hours over four days, found clan
matriarch Vickie Singer innocent of one count of attempted murder
of FBI agents and two firearms charges, including possession of a
sawed-off shotgun. She was convicted on five counts.
   On the charges of attempted murder against the other three, the
jury returned guilty verdicts in the second-degree, meaning the
panel did not find the crimes premeditated.
   U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins scheduled sentencing July 1.
   The siege at the clan's farm in Marion by 100 lawmen ended in a
shootout Jan. 28 that killed state Corrections Lt. Fred House and
injured clan leader Addam Swapp.
   Swapp, 27, was found guilty of maliciously damaging the church
building; attempting to kill FBI agents; assaulting, resisting,
impeding, intimidating and interfering with federal agents; and
possession of an unregistered bomb.
   He also was found guilty of a corollary charge of use of a bomb
on the malicious damage count and two counts of use of a firearm
linked to the assault and attempted murder charges.
   The jury found Mrs. Singer, 45, guilty of the same charges, with
the exception of the attempted murder charge and the corollary
firearms charge.
   Swapp's brother, Jonathan Swapp, 21, and Mrs. Singer's son, John
Timothy Singer, 21, were found guilty of assault-resistance and
attempted murder charges and the two accompanying firearms counts.
   ``We've already won the victory!'' Addam Swapp shouted to
reporters as he was led into court. But there was little
discernible reaction when the verdicts were read.
   ``We were very pleased and satisfied,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Richard Lambert.
   The maximum penalty for attempting to kill federal agents is 20
years, 10 years for bombing the chapel. The corollary firearms and
use-of-a-bomb charges carry minimum-mandatory five-year penalties.
Assaulting federal agents and possession of a bomb each carry
maximum 10-year prison terms.
   Jury deliberations began Wednesday afternoon.
   Prosecutors called 67 witnesses, while the defense called only
three witnesses, including the buckskin-clad Addam Swapp, who
tearfully and defiantly defended the clan's actions.
   Addam Swapp admitted he bombed the Kamas Stake Center on Jan. 16
with 87 sticks of dynamite, but insisted he never fired at any of
the authorities who surrounded the 2{-acre farm in a standoff often
punctuated with gunfire.
   No charges have been filed in House's death, which authorities
have linked to the wheelchair-bound John Timothy Singer. But
Assistant Attorney General Creighton Horton III said his office
intends next week to file state murder charges against an
unspecified number of the defendants.
   The government's final word in the case came Wednesday as U.S.
Attorney Brent Ward denounced the clan as ``a band of outlaws'' who
committed the crimes in the name of religion.
   ``Trust in the Lord but pass me my M-1 rifle,'' Ward said of
Addam Swapp.
   While admitting that Mrs. Singer my not have directly
participated in crimes, prosecutors charged her with the most
counts, alleging her aiding and abetting of family members made her
just as culpable.
   ``She wasn't exactly sitting back in a rocking chair in her
bedroom crocheting and reading Scriptures,'' Ward said.
   Clan members maintained the bombing and standoff were ordered by
God as a sign of the impending collapse of church, state and
nation, but also were intended to draw attention to the 1979
slaying of polygamist patriarch John Singer, Mrs. Singer's husband
and Swapp's father-in-law.
   Singer was shot following an 18-day standoff at the same farm by
authorities trying to arrest him on warrants stemming from his
refusal to send his children to public schools and his defiance of
a court order that he relinquish the children of his second wife to
their father.
   The family contended Singer was murdered in a ``church-state
conspiracy.''
   ``I guess you could say it started back in 1973 when John Singer
took his children out of public schools,'' Addam Swapp testified.

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II began a tour of South
America's poorest country Monday with an appeal to its people ``not
to lose hope.''
   ``I will spend five days among you, sharing your aspirations,
seeing first-hand this nation stricken by poverty and a lack of
development and resources,'' he said in an arrival speech at the La
Paz airport, which is 13,150 feet above sea level and ringed by
snow-capped Andean peaks.
   President Victor Paz Estenssoro said in a welcoming speech the
visit would help bolster the flagging spirits of Bolivians.
   ``You come at a time when Bolivia is suffering bitter tests that
could weaken its spirit or perhaps sink it into a state of
desperation,'' the 80-year-old president said.
   He said technological and scientific advances had heightened
aspirations of the Third World without providing the means to
fulfill them. ``The Bolivian people have perhaps been more harshly
punished than most in this respect,'' he said,
   Thousands of people, including many peasants in colorful Indian
dress and traditional bowler hats, greeted the Roman Catholic
leader at the airport. He arrived from Uruguay on a Boeing 727 of
the state airline Lloyd Aereo Boliviano at 5:16 p.m.
   The pontiff, a skier, spoke in a strong voice and showed no
outward signs of being affected by altitude sickness, which
Bolivians call ``sorocche.'' La Paz is the world's highest capital
and the altitude makes many visitors uncomfortable, if not ill.
   However, in a meeting with Bolivia's 39 bishops at the end of
the day, the pope seemed to be wearying. Bishop Julio Terrazas,
head of the local episcopal conference, did not deliver a prepared
speech to the pontiff because ``we see that the pope is tired.''
   ``I believe these words have no place right now because of the
weariness that your first day here has caused to the Holy Father,''
Terrazas said to the pope. He instead handed the pope a copy of the
speech.
   In the text of Terrazas' speech, he told the pope Bolivia
suffers from ``a situation of injustice that consumes thousands of
brothers in degrading misery and inhumane unemployment. To this are
added other ills such as delinquency, immorality and drug
trafficking and other social calamaities that constitute a
devastating scourge to the very being of our people.''
   The pope was spending the night in the papal nuncio's residence.
   Dealers in compressed oxygen said church officials rented
several tanks and face-masks for use if needed by the papal
entourage.
   To review the military honor guard and groups of white-smocked
schoolgirls at the airport, the pope rode in a green army jeep
rather than taking the long walk.
   From the airport the papal caravan descended to La Paz, which is
11,930 feet above the sea in a mountain ravine.
   The vehicles moved down a cliffside highway that was lined by
tens of thousands of people. Crowds cheered and waved banners of
yellow and white, the Vatican colors, and the yellow, red and green
Bolivian flag.
   Peasant shacks perched precariously on the mountainsides were
brilliant white, freshly painted by their owners. The city
government offered special tax incentives to those who painted
their homes.
   John Paul, standing in the glass booth of the popemobile,
traveled 11 miles through the city center to the papal nuncio's
residence, where he is staying.
   He will spend five days in Bolivia, the second and longest stop
on his four-nation tour, which began Friday in Uruguay and will
include visits to Peru and Paraguay. He returns to Rome on May 18.
   The pontiff will visit seven Bolivian cities ranging from the
tin mining center of Oruro, devastated by mine closures, to the
lowland boom town of Santa Cruz, a center of cattle ranching,
agriculture and cocaine trafficking.
   Government austerity measures eliminated an annual inflation
rate of 20,000 percent in Bolivia, but they caused serious labor
unrest because of mass layoffs. The country is also a major source
of coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine.
   This visit is the pope's tour ninth to Latin America since he
became head of the 860-million-member Roman Catholic Church nearly
10 years ago. He has made 37 pilgrimages abroad from the Vatican.
   John Paul is scheduled to spend his 68th birthday in Paraguay on
May 18.

   A retired state Supreme Court justice
violated rules of judicial misconduct for abusing his power to help
a female friend who was then an assistant judge, a board said in a
report issued Monday.
   The state Judicial Conduct Board found Justice William Hill in
violation of codes governing conduct on five of 11 counts after
members disagreed on the nature of Hill's relationship with Jane
Wheel.
   Michael Marks, one of Hill's lawyers, said Monday that he would
ask the state Supreme Court, which is the final judge of Hill's
conduct, to overturn the findings by the seven-member conduct board.
   The board said in a report to the Supreme Court that ``serious
violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct were committed by
Justice Hill'' and found ``the entire judicial system is still
suffering from the fallout of his misconduct.''
   The board made no specific recommendation of discipline, leaving
it up to the Supreme Court to determine whether Hill should be
reprimanded or forbidden from coming out of retirement to hear
cases.
   Hill, who turns 71 on Tuesday, retired from the Supreme Court
last year, a few months after the misconduct charges were filed in
January 1987 against him and two other justices.
   The charges against Justice Ernest Gibson III were dropped and
Justice Thomas Hayes died.
   Meanwhile, the scandal worsened a backlog in the state's highest
court, as the justices refused Gov. Madeleine Kunin's request that
they step aside, and instead disqualified themselves from hundreds
of cases involving people connected with their case.
   All three justices were originally accused of improperly using
their clout on the court to advance the interests of Wheel, who was
then an assistant judge in Chittenden County.
   A court employee testified that Wheel had been seen with her
arms around Hill, but Hill and Wheel testified they were not close
and did not have an affair. Hill described the relationship as
collegial.
   The Judicial Conduct Board ruled that Hill presided over cases
involving Wheel when he should not have and that he improperly
helped her.
   The board found Hill innocent of many of the misconduct charges
dealing directly with the Wheel relationship, but two members filed
a dissent arguing that a significant relationship did exist.
   Marks said his interpretation was that the board felt there was
an appearance of wrongdoing but no real wrongdoing.
   Wheel, who lost her re-election bid in 1986, has been convicted
in a separate criminal case stemming from allegations that she
billed the state for days she did not work. She has yet to be
sentenced.

   Democrat Jesse Jackson urged West
Virginians on Monday to vote for him in Tuesday's presidential
primary, acknowledging his uphill fight and saying ``I've always
fought against the odds.''
   ``The race is tight,'' Jackson told a park rally of more than
1,500 people. ``I'm coming to the last lap. I'm running longer and
running stronger because my mind is made up. We've come too far.
We've got to go on now. Press on! Press on! Press on!''
   Jackson, whose presidential hopes have dimmed with landslide
losses in recent primaries, said he would not give up his candidacy.
   ``I've always fought againt the odds. Dukakis has 39 percent and
I have 29 percent,'' he said of cumulative popular votes won by
both candidates. An Associated Press tabulation gives front-runner
Michael Dukakis 37 percent of the primary vote won to date and
Jackson 28 percent.
   ``We're within striking distance. West Virginia, you can make a
difference. We're winning every day, and when I win, you win,'' he
said.
   At several stops in West Virginia, Jackson tailored his talk to
the economically depressed region. He called West Virginia a
``state of extremes _ good minds, reduced opportunity.''
   ``Rich soil and poor people. Brilliant minds. Something has gone
awry,'' he said. ``I call for fairness. Fair wages for workers,
fair prices for farmers. Fair taxes for the rich and the powerful.
I call for fairness.''
   After an overnight stay at the Arnett home of an unemployed coal
miner and an early morning stop at Peabody Coal Co.'s No. 7 mine to
greet miners at shift-change, Jackson took a drive along winding
one-lane roads to visit the Minden Elementary School, located not
far from an abandoned PCB dump that the federal Environmental
Protection Agency estimates will cost $21 million to clean up.
   Jackson said the dump is an example of the ``economic and
environmental violence'' that government _ particularly the Reagan
administration _ has imposed upon poorer citizens.
   ``You can understand poverty in Ethiopia ... where it hasn't
rained in 15 years,'' Jackson said. ``Here we are in West Virginia
... in the richest country in the world, with talented people, rich
soil, and yet poverty abounds.''
   ``The state is not poor; its wealth is not getting to the
people.''
   Later, Jackson flew to Nebraska, which also holds its primary on
Tuesday. At an airport news conference in Omaha, he told reporters:
``I don't take Nebraska voters for granted. This is a live race.''
   Jackson was upbeat despite polls indicating he trails Dukakis in
the state.
   ``I'm here working,'' he said. ``I'm not just here
by...commercials, I'm here in person.''
   Jackson made stops at a park in downtown Omaha and walked
through a mostly black housing project. At the housing project, he
declared: ``Every vote counts, every voter counts.''
   Monday's visit was Jackson's second to Nebraska, and his extra
time in the state could help him at the polls Tuesday. The
Democratic candidate who spends the most time in Nebraska
traditionally does well in the presidential primary in the mostly
Republican state.
   Jackson insisted he could still win the battle for the
nomination.
   ``I have the longest legs, the strongest legs ... As the days
get longer, the race gets stronger,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   ``The Phantom of the Opera'' received 10 Tony
award nominations Monday, but none for its leading lady, Sarah
Brightman, who is married to Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer and
co-producer of the show.
   It was Lloyd Webber who waged a fight with Actors Equity to
bring his wife to Broadway in the musical, which is a lavish
retelling of the Gaston Leroux novel about a deformed composer and
his love for a beautiful soprano in the Paris Opera.
   The American actors union twice refused permission for Brightman
to appear in the show in New York, but it relented after
``Phantom'' producers agreed to employ an American actor in a major
role in London within the next three years.
   Michael Crawford, Brightman's co-star, received a Tony
nomination as did Judy Kaye, who plays the actress' operatic rival
in ``Phantom.'' The production, which won a best musical
nomination, also was nominated for score, Lloyd Webber, Charles
Hart and Richard Stilgoe; director, Harold Prince; book, Stilgoe
and Lloyd Webber; scenic design, Maria Bjornson; costume design,
Maria Bjornson; lighting design, Andrew Bridge; and choreography,
Lar Lubovitch.
   Brightman was not the only musical star to be passed over for a
nomination. Bernadette Peters failed to receive a nod for her
performance in ``Into the Woods.''
   In other acting categories, several big stars were snubbed. John
Malkovich was not nominated for his performance in Lanford Wilson's
``Burn This'' and neither did Christopher Plummer for his role in
``Macbeth.'' Both their co-stars, Joan Allen in ``Burn This'' and
Glenda Jackson in ``Macbeth,'' received best actress nominations.
   Also absent from the list of nominees was Madonna, whose highly
publicized debut in David Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow'' took place
last week.
   The best actress in a musical nominations went to Patti LuPone
of ``Anything Goes''; Judy Kuhn of ``Chess''; Joanna Gleason of
``Into the Woods'' and Alison Fraser of ``Romance-Romance.''

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Roelof Botha
is to meet Angolan officials this week in a high-level follow-up to
last week's ground-breaking peace talks, the South African Press
Association reported Monday.
   The talks will be held Thursday and Friday in Brazzaville,
Congo, according to official sources quoted by the agency. It said
Defense Minister Magnus Malan may accompany Botha.
   The Foreign Ministry said arrangements for the next round of
talks with Angola were not complete, but said South Africa ``is not
opposed to Brazzaville as a venue.''
   The SAPA report said the Brazzaville talks would not involve the
United States.
   Last week, South Africa, Angola and Cuba met in London for their
first head-to-head talks on the withdrawal of foreign troops from
Angola and on the related topic of independence for South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia. One of Botha's subordinates headed
the South African delegation in the U.S.-brokered discussions.
   South African soldiers are fighting in support of the
13-year-old rebel movement against Angola's Marxist government,
which is backed by Soviet advisers and an estimated 40,000 Cuban
troops.
   Earlier Monday, the U.S.-backed Angolan rebels reported killing
64 Angolan soldiers and eight Cubans and shooting down three
Soviet-built aircraft in attacks last week. Rebel casualties were
listed as 12 killed, 10 wounded, two missing.
   The rebel organization UNITA, standing for the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, made the claims in a
statement distributed in Lisbon, Portugal. Angola is a former
Portuguese African colony.
   There was no independent confirmation of UNITA's claims.
   UNITA said it killed seven Cubans in a May 2 attack on a
wood-processing plant near Conde in the northwestern Angolan
enclave of Cabinda. It said 64 Angolan soldiers were also killed in
actions across six provinces last week.
   The rebels also said that the Cuban pilot died and and two
village children were killed by falling wreckage when rebel
anti-aircraft batteries shot down a MiG-21 plane Thursday as it
bombed Kanamba in southeastern Moxico province.
   The statement said two MI-17 helicopters were shot down on
Wednesday in the area.
   UNITA said violence in Angola would keep up and increase until
Angola's Marxist government, the Soviet Union and Cuba agreed to
negotiate an end to the civil war. The rebels were not included in
the London talks.

<TEXT>
   William J. Bennett, a scourge of school
bureaucrats, teacher unions and slipshod standards during 3{ years
as secretary of education, said Monday he will resign his Cabinet
post in mid-September to return to private life.
   The Department of Education made the announcement after Bennett
met privately with President Reagan at the White House and then
informed his senior staff of his departure plans.
   Bennett told the staff he had recommended that Linus Wright, the
undersecretary of education and a former superintendent of schools
in Dallas, succeed him.
   Bennett told education reporters last month he probably would
not stay for the final few months of the Reagan administration.
   In somewhat uncharacteristic fashion, he refused to take calls
from reporters Monday to discuss his plans, which include hitting
the lecture circuit and writing a book spelling out his vision for
improving America's schools and colleges.
   His spokesman, Loye Miller, read this terse statement:
   ``Secretary Bennett met today with the president and
subsequently with Education Department staff to say that he intends
to leave his position in mid-September. He expressed his gratitude
to President Reagan for the opportunity to serve in his Cabinet.
The secretary reiterated to his staff his intention to continue at
`full speed ahead' during the next few months.''
   Bennett plans to issue two new reports on a model elementary
school curriculum and on improving colleges before he steps down,
said Bill Kristol, his chief of staff. The college book will try
``to shed some light on the black box of higher education'' with
practical advice for parents, policy-makers and others, he said.
   Bennett made headlines throughout his tenure with acerbic
criticisms of teacher unions, the ``blob'' of school bureaucracy,
the ``greed'' of colleges raising tuitions twice as fast as
inflation, and the ``Jim Crow math and back-of-the-bus science''
meted out to black children in ghetto schools. He called Chicago's
schools the nation's worst and said that system was in an
``educational meltdown.''
   The National Education Association said in a statement Monday
that it wishes Bennett well and and expressed hope that the next
secretary of education ``will use the power of the office to be a
positive force in support of public education.''
   ``The nation needs a secretary of education who will work
cooperatively with parents, teachers, school administrators,
college faculty and the community at large,'' the NEA statement
said.
   Two weeks ago, in a report called, ``American Education: Making
It Work,'' Bennett warned that the public has little to show for
five years of school reform. The schools are ``slightly improved,''
he said, but ``we are certainly not doing well enough, and we are
not doing well enough fast enough.''
   He called for using the U.S. military to wage war against drug
traffickers, and quarreled with the surgeon general over what to
teach children about AIDS and condoms.
   His penchant for controversy was evident from his first news
conference in 1985, when he suggested that college students cope
with aid cuts through ``stereo divestiture, automobile divestiture,
three-weeks-at-the-beach divestiture.''
   The remark drew howls from outraged college administrators _ and
tongue-in-cheek ripostes from collegians on spring break in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.
   Bennett, 44, championed what he called ``the three C's'' of
education: choice, character and content.
   He failed to convince Congress to offer poor parents vouchers to
buy remedial education at either public or private schools. But his
criticism of bilingual education led Congress to ease restrictions
on aid for English-immersion programs.
   He argued strenuously that teachers had a duty to impart strong
morals to their students.
   And, as with his attack on ``Jim Crow math,'' he insisted that
tough, unyielding standards _ such as those he outlined in a model
curriculum called ``James Madison High School'' _ were essential
for all children. He said the civil rights challenge of the 1990s
was to ``ensure equal intellectual opportunity'' in school.
   He was an unapologetic defender of Reagan efforts to slash the
federal education budget, arguing that more money did not guarantee
better results and that state and local school budgets were rising
inexorably anyway.
   Bennett has been a peripatetic Cabinet officer, visiting nearly
100 elementary and secondary schools. He has also proven a big draw
as an after-dinner speaker on the Republican fund-raising circuit.
   Bennett, who switched from the Democratic to the Republican
Party two years ago, has spoken at 63 GOP functions in the past
three years, according to the trade publication Education Week.
   There has been speculation that Bennett may eventually run for
office, possibly from his adopted state of North Carolina.

<HEAD>Judge Restricts Lady Bing's Contact With Husband</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Monday ordered the wife of former
Metropolitan Opera director Sir Rudolf Bing to relinquish control
over his movements for six hours a day so he can rest and nurses
may care for him.
   State Supreme Court Justice Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick, a
trial-level judge, also directed that male nurses be hired to care
for Bing to assuage Lady Carroll Douglass Bing's apparent jealousy
of female nurses.
   Mrs. Ciparick ordered Lady Bing`to stay away from her husband
from 10 a.m. until noon for his nutrition and hygiene needs, from
3:30 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. so he can nap, and from 9 p.m. until 10
p.m. for further care.
   After 10 p.m., she may stay with Bing until 10 a.m. the next
day, the judge ruled, and if Bing has to see a doctor, his wife may
not go with him.
   ``I'm not convinced that you are such a danger that you have to
be restricted altogether,'' Mrs. Ciparick told Lady Bing.
   The judge's ruling was an interim measure taken during a hearing
on a request by Bing's lawyer, Paul Goldhamer, to bar Lady Bing
from her husband's apartment. The hearing will continue Monday.
   Goldhamer, who maintains Lady Bing is dangerous to her husband,
charges that Lady Bing has abused her husband verbally and
physically. The lawyer has also asked Mrs. Ciparick to annul the
Bings' marriage. He says the former Met impresario has Alzheimer's
disease and did not know what he was doing when he married Lady
Bing in Arlington, Va., on Jan. 9, 1987.
   Lady Bing, a former mental patient, frequently disrupted the
hearing which has been underway since Thursday. She has yelled that
witnesses were lying and she has tried to get Bing to leave the
proceedings with her.

<HEAD>Glasnost Debated At IPI Meeting Attended by Soviets</HEAD>

   Soviet journalists debated the meaning
and the future of glasnost with their Western colleagues Monday at
the International Press Institute's annual meeting.
   This was the first IPI general assembly attended by Soviet and
Chinese representatives. About 400 publishers and editors from 43
countries are taking part in the IPI assembly.
   Alexander Pumpyansky, editor in chief of the Soviet weekly Novoe
Vremia, described Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost _ or greater openness on certain issues in Soviet society
_ as realism, ``seeing the world as it is, not in ideological
dogmas.''
   Delegates laughed and applauded when he added, ``It is like in
the fairy tale when the little child says the king has no clothes .
.. or badly dressed if dressed in a Soviet suit.''
   Conor Cruise O'Brien of Dublin University in Ireland said forces
exist in the Soviet Union that want to reduce the substance of
glasnost.
   He said the policy would have a better chance for success if
confined to the Soviet Union. Developments in other Warsaw Pact
countries could prove to be the ``Achilles heel'' of glasnost,
letting loose revolutionary forces, O'Brien stated.
   ``There are ominous signs in Poland,'' he said.
   Pierro Ottone of Italy's La Repubblica said glasnost should be
viewed as the instrument of a power struggle in the Soviet Union as
a new class wants to get rid of the old mentality in search of a
pragmatic solution to Soviet problems.
   ``There could be unpredictable consequences of this struggle,''
Ottone said. He said it could let loose tensions not only in the
other Warsaw Pact countries but in the Soviet Union as well, citing
recent Armenian unrest as an example.
   In Monday's opening ceremony of the general assembly, IPI
officials demanded a lifting of restrictions on the press in Turkey.
   IPI President Peter Galliner said Turkey had made significant
progress in restoring democracy since the return to civilian rule
in 1983.
   But he said a constant threat to the news media exists from
legislation providing for prosecution and imprisonment of
journalists and hefty fines for publications deemed pornographic.
   The publishers and editors of two men's magazines, Playboy
Turkey and Bravo, were fined a total of $750,000 on Dec.10.
   The fines have not yet been paid, and the government has
announced plans for legislation to substantially reduce the fines.
   Galliner also noted that state-produced newsprint prices have
gone up 200 percent in the past 16 months.
   He and Juan Luis Cebrian, IPI board chairman, appealed for an
amnesty for political prisoners jailed during military rule in
Turkey and an end to prosecution of journalists for what they write.
   The IPI, an independent organization with offices in London and
Zurich, represents 2,000 publishers and editors in more than 60
countries and is dedicated to defending press freedom.
   The Turkish military took over in 1980, following widespread
political violence which claimed 5,000 lives in the three years
prior to the coup. The generals relinquished power after 1983
general elections won by the Motherland Party of Premier Turgut
Ozal.
   Since return to civilian rule, no journalists have been
imprisoned but several are on trial on charges of insulting the
president or the premier or dealing with taboo subjects such as the
problem of the Kurdish minority.
   Ozal defended his pricing policies, saying state subsidies,
including those on newsprint, were lifted as part of his program to
establish a free-market economy in Turkey.
   He conceded that a chief function of the press is criticism of
the government but complained that ``a pervasive pessimism'' is
spreading through the society because of too much negative news.
   Ozal, without citing specific examples, told the delegates that
in Turkey ``people are shying away from a political career''
because of invasion of privacy.
   The premier recommended a peaceful approach in covering foreign
news so not to fan hostilities among nations, especially with
neighbors.
   On the agenda for the three-day meeting are, among other topics,
problems on reporting from Islamic countries, protection of privacy
and the future of UNESCO.

   A convicted murderer who escaped from
the state prison was nabbed 25 miles away Monday after he spent
more than a month living in the woods, surviving on a diet that
included a groundhog, state police said.
   Tommie Mollohan, who was serving a life term for the robbery and
murder of a Brounland grocer in 1973, was captured in a remote
wooded area near Cameron, said state police Trooper S.P. Singleton.
   Mollohan had remained at large since he escaped with two other
murderers from the maximum security unit April 3.
   A resident had reported seeing Mollohan Sunday night and he was
spotted during a search Monday morning.
   Local police, state conservation officers and authorities with
tracking dogs joined the pursuit as searchers chased Mollohan up
one thickly wooded ridge and down another before capturing him.
   The escapee had been carrying a dismantled .22-caliber rifle in
a garbage bag but ditched it during the pursuit, Singleton said.
Mollohan was carrying only a chocolate syrup bottle, hanging from
his neck on a string, as a water canteen when he was apprehended,
the trooper said.
   Authorities said he spent the time living in the woods on
abandoned farm land.
   ``He showed us some places where he stayed _ one of them was a
lean-to. But mostly he slept under the stars. He said he caught him
a groundhog once, and he said he found some eggs that he ate,''
Singleton said.
   The prisoner weighed about 230 pounds when he escaped, and lost
between 45 and 65 pounds while on the lam, Singleton said.
   Mollohan faces administrative escape charges through the
prison's internal disciplinary system, said Jerrie Clutter,
secretary to Warden Jerry Hedrick.
   Criminal escape charges probably will be dropped in view of his
life sentence, Singleton said.
   Penitentiary officials described Mollohan, 45, as the mastermind
of the breakout by the three escapees, all of whom were serving
life sentences without chance of parole.
   Escapee Bobby Dean Stacy, 35, convicted of killing one police
officer and charged with shooting another, was arrested April 14 in
Columbus, Ohio.
   The third escapee, David Williams, 28, convicted of murder,
arson and robbery, was caught late last month in Mercer County.

   A jury began deliberating the fate of
reputed mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and eight
associates Monday after hearing the prosecutor defend her two key
witnesses in the murder case.
   The jury will return to the courtroom of Common Pleas Judge
Albert Sabo on Tuesday morning to continue deliberations.
   The 59-year-old Scarfo, who police allege ran the area's Mafia
from his home in Atlantic City, N.J., before his arrest in 1986,
and the other eight defendants are charged with the Sept. 14, 1984,
murder of rival Salvatore Testa.
   Testa's body, with two bullets in the head, was found trussed
with rope and wrapped in a blanket in a wooded area in south Jersey.
   The trial began more than two months ago. Jury selection took
more than four weeks, and the testimony phase took another month.
   Assistant District Attorney Barbara Christie's 78-minute closing
statement followed almost eight hours of defense arguments over two
days last week and an hour Monday morning.
   She acknowledged that prosecution witnesses Nicholas Caramandi
and Thomas DelGiorno were despicable men.
   ``Rats? Yes,'' Ms. Christie said. ``But when you enter a sewer
don't rats lead the way? ...
   ``DelGiorno and Caramandi told you that Nicky Scarfo was the
boss and that Scarfo' organization eliminated problems and
dissension by simple execution.''
   Caramanda and DelGiorno testified Testa was murdered in a south
Philadelphia candy store, closed for renovations, and the body was
driven in a van across the Delaware River and dumped along a road.
   Scarfo's lawyer, Robert Simone, on Monday morning continued the
attack on the two witnesses that his eight colleagues had made in
their closing arguments.
   ``When are DelGiorno and Caramandi telling the truth and when
are they lying?'' Simone asked. ``We have to guess, and you can't
convict these men on guesses. If Testa was killed in that sweet
shop, you would have evidence, blood, something.''
   He maintained that Testa actually was killed in his own home and
that the murderers were Caramandi and DelGiorno.
   Scarfo, who still faces murder charges in two other slayings,
was convicted last year of trying to extort $1 million from a
developer.

<HEAD>Abnormality in Schizophrenic Brains Pinpointed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of schizophrenics' brains suggests a
possible answer to a decades-old mystery about an abnormality
associated with the illness, a researcher said Monday.
   Brain scans of 17 living patients pinpointed a site of a
reduction in brain tissue that apparently produces enlargement of
normal brain cavities, said Richard Suddath of the National
Institute of Mental Health.
   The enlargement of the fluid-filed spaces, called ventricles,
had been observed since the 1930s, but nobody has known which part
of the brain produces it, he said.
   Failure of part of the brain to develop, or shrinkage, could
produce the enlargement, he said.
   If the new finding is confirmed, it points the way to an
anatomical target for further study of schizophrenia, he said.
   Suddath spoke to reporters at the annual meeting of the American
Psychiatric Association. He did the work with colleagues at the
mental health institute.
   The brain scans, using a technique called magnetic resonance
imaging, found an average of a 20 percent reduction in the gray
matter of the temporal lobes, compared with the volume found in 17
normal people of similar age and size.
   The temporal lobes lie beneath the temples on each side of the
head.
   The less temporal lobe gray matter a patient had, the larger his
lateral ventricles tended to be, implicating that tissue was at
least part of the explanation for enlargement of the ventricles,
Suddath said.
   Researchers do not know when the reduction in gray matter
appears in comparison to when schizophrenia appears, he said. It
may be a failure of the tisue to develop before birth or around the
time of birth, he said.
   Daniel Freedman, director of the division of adult psychiatry at
the University of California, Los Angeles, Neuropsychiatric
Institute, noted that the study included few patients.
   ``It's too soon to say'' whether it will pay off in better
diagnosis or predicting response to treatment, he said.
   But it is ``a promising start'' in using magnetic resonance
imaging to seek clues to brain abnormalities in schizophrenia, he
said.

   Fire officials said Monday that they failed
to determine how a fire ignited in California's tallest building
because 2,000-degree flames destroyed clues, but they said arson
was not suspected.
   City fire investigators and agents from the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms completed their inquiry and turned
over control of the building to First Interstate Bank on Sunday.
   ``They pretty much ruled out it being a case of arson,'' said
bank spokesman Bob Campbell.
   ``At this time, the cause has been listed as undetermined in
origin,'' said city fire Capt. Ralph Ramirez. ``The extent of the
damages prevents us from listing a ... definitive cause.''
   Further questions about the investigators' inquiry were referred
to Fire Chief Donald Manning, who scheduled a Tuesday news
conference to discuss the findings.
   Earlier, Battalion Chief Gary Bowie played down suggestions that
the bank's decision to sell its securities unit the day of
Wednesday's fire played a role in the blaze that killed one person
and injured 40 others.
   ``No one interviewed has said that there's a possibility of an
incendiary fire of any type,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, suitcase- and box-toting employees of companies with
offices in the First Interstate Bank tower retrieved documents from
the fire-scarred, 62-story tower.
   Wearing hard hats and accompanied by security officers,
employees boarded elevators for the ascent to offices above and
below gutted floors 12 through 16. Many of the employees filled
boxes, bags, suitcases and briefcases with files, computer disks
and telephone lists.
   ``They had 15 minutes to select the things they need the most,''
said bank spokesman John Popovich.
   He said the bank had gotten many of its employees back to work
either in the undamaged parts of the building or in nearby leased
space, thanks to an emergency plan designed for earthquakes. He
said it would take 10 days to four weeks to clean up smoke and
water damage, but there was no estimate on the time to rebuild the
gutted floors.
   The fire department's preliminary estimate of $450 million was
``exceedingly high,'' Popovich said.

   Former Illinois Gov. Richard Ogilvie suffered a
massive heart attack at work Monday and was in grave condition
following emergency bypass surgery, hospital officials said.
   Surgeons performed a quadruple coronary bypass in a five-hour
operation that was ``a total success,'' said Dr. Renee Hartz, who
led the surgical team.
   But she said Ogilvie was in grave condition and his prognosis
was ``totally unclear.''
   The former governor's heart was beating almost completely on its
own after the surgery, Ms. Hartz said, adding doctors would know
much more about his chances for recovery in the morning.
   His condition was described as ``quite grave, quite guarded'' by
Dr. John Sanders, Northwestern's chief of staff, at an afternoon
news conference.
   ``When we operate in the midst of a heart attack in which the
heart is unable to provide adequate pumping capability, we can't
say with any certainty if the heart will pump adequately when we're
done,'' said Sanders, a cardiac surgeon.
   The former governor had ``not to anyone's knowledge'' suffered a
previous heart attack, Sanders said. But Ogilvie did have ``a
history of risk factors,'' the doctor said, adding he did not have
the background to elaborate.
   Sanders said a triple bypass appeared likely, based on
emergency-room instrument readings, which indicated Ogilvie
suffered a massive coronary.
   The former governor's daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband were
at the hospital. Ogilvie's wife, Dorothy, was en route from Florida.
   Ogilvie was stricken at his downtown law office. He was ``awake
and able to respond'' when he arrived at the hospital, thanks to
quick action by paramedics, Sanders said. But surgery was scheduled
after his condition deteriorated in the emergency room, Sanders
said.
   Ogilvie, a Republican, ran for governor in 1968 and served until
1972, when he was defeated by Democrat Dan Walker.
   He was born Feb. 22, 1923, the son of a Kansas City, Mo.,
insurance man whose business took the family first to Evanston and
then to Port Chester, N.Y.
   Ogilvie graduated from Yale and enrolled in Chicago Kent Law
College. He became active in revitalizing the Illinois Young
Republicans, and in 1949 joined the law firm of Lord, Bissell &
Brook. The next year he married Dorothy Shriver of Oak Park.
   In 1958, he left corporate law to head a U.S. Justice Department
crime-fighting unit in Chicago. The case that put his name in
headlines was his conviction of mob leader Tony Accardo on
income-tax evasion charges.
   The conviction was subsequently reversed by the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which held that publicity might have biased
jurors.
   News reports have speculated that Mayor Eugene Sawyer was
preparing to make Ogilvie chairman of the Chicago Housing
Authority, the troubled public housing agency that provides housing
for 145,000 people.

   Gunmen fired from a passing van at
troopers guarding a television transmitter Monday, wounding at
least one soldier, the military reported.
   Officials said shooting continued for more than half an hour
because the guards were confused and fired at policemen and other
soldiers coming to their aid.
   ``The guards thought the responding troops belonged to the same
group that had attacked them,'' police Sgt. Estelito Cadag said.
   He said it took military officials about two hours to determine
what had happened at the compound housing the Kanlaon Broadcasting
System transmitter in suburban Quezon City.
   Another television station, ABS-CBN, reported that soldiers
guarding the transmitter were intoxicated and began firing their
weapons into the air. It said those soldiers then fired at police
who responded to complaints from residents.
   The military's Capital Regional Command said it could was
investigating the ABS-CBN report.
   Cadag said the lone military casualty was a corporal with a
gunshot wound in the right thigh. Officials said they did not know
if anyone body in the van was hit in the exchange.
   Military guards are posted at radio and television stations
because of at least six coup attempts against President Corazon
Aquino's 2-year-old government.
   Col. Toto Arroyo, legal officer of the army unit guarding the
Kanlaon transmitter, said: ``The guards were momentarily taken
aback because the firing was so intense and they didn't know where
it was coming from. After a few seconds they returned fire and the
van sped away.''
   Arroyo would not speculate about the identities of the attackers
or their motive, saying only that they were ``a van of armed men
who had a lot of weapons ... automatic weapons.''
   The last and most serious coup attempt occurred Aug. 28 led by
Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, who escaped from a prison ship last
month and threatened more attacks. At least 53 people were killed
and hundreds wounded in the August attacks.

   Smoggy air in the nation's cities may become
significantly cleaner than official projections indicate, new
discoveries about auto pollution suggest.
   Planned new federal regulations to make gasoline less volatile _
harder to vaporize _ may cure a problem only now being recognized,
some analysts say.
   This is the evaporation of gasoline from cars in use, called
``running loss.''
   All cars have systems designed to control evaporation while
parked. The Environmental Protection Agency has assumed the system
also prevents significant vapors from escaping when the car is
driven.
   On a hot day, it now appears, the system can be overwhelmed and
release five to 25 times more unburned gasoline than is permitted
in exhaust.
   The findings are so new that no one has had a chance to
calculate their effect. But they suggest that plans for less
volatile gasoline may significantly reduce this previously
underestimated contributor to smog.

   The pope today was to visit the orange-growing city of Salto on

   Speaking to a crowd of 50,000 gathered on a dirt field in
Uruguay's gaucho (cowboy) country, John Paul said he was directing
an appeal to ``all Catholic faithful and all Uruguayans of good

   ``Those who own land and other categories of wealth must take
into account that there is a social mortgage on all private
property,'' John Paul said in Spanish, explaining that this meant
the property must be used for the good of the entire community.

   The 12-year-old war is stalemated, and Mozambique's Marxist
leaders now appear interested in making a deal with South Africa to

Mozambique National Resistance.
   Since the amnesty law took effect in December, an estimated 500

they will be not be punished for their war activities.
   Also, Mozambique's president, Joachim Chissano, sent Cooperation

conciliatory message for President P.W. Botha. The possibility of a
summit meeting was discussed.
   A day earlier, Chissano met with Gavin Relly, chairman of South
Africa's giant Anglo American Corp., to discuss possible business
ventures.

   Vietnam veterans with post-traumatic stress
disorder were less sensitive to pain after seeing scenes from a war
movie, according to a study which gives a glimpse into the complex
biology of the disorder.
   The finding may also be a step toward new treatments, scientists
said.
   ``This may well be getting at some basic core biological aspect
of PTSD,'' said Roger Pitman of the Veterans Administration Medical

   Two years ago, in his State
of the Union message, President Reagan launched a venture to take
aviation into the 21st century.
   ``We are going forward with research on a new Orient Express
that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from Dulles
Airport (outside Washington), accelerate up to 25 times the speed
of sound, attaining low Earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within two
hours,'' he said.
   Research on an aerospace plane already had been going on for
years in the part of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration that gets little public attention _ NASA's first A,
for aeronautics, sometimes also known as the little A.

   Activists in the western Massachusetts
towns where the nuclear freeze movement was born are attacking
``Star Wars'' with the tactic they used so well eight years ago:
town meetings.
   So far, residents of 13 communities have voted to order their
town clerks to notify President Reagan of their displeasure with
the satellite-based missile-killing system also known as the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The anti-SDI article failed in two other towns and was tabled in
a third, but activists said Monday they were heartened by the
results thus far. Fifteen to 20 towns are expected to debate the
question in May and June.

   Landlords with rifles and sticks ride
motorcycles menacingly across fields where peasants work _ often
for a wage of grain, not money.
   But the hopes of many peasants are riding with communist
guerrillas whose aim is the violent overthrow of those they deem
oppressors _ the high-caste landlords of Bihar, India's poorest and
most backward state.
   Officials concede that the landlords are a law unto themselves
in Bihar and are resisting peasant demands for something better
than payments in grain, a common practice in rural India.
   ``The landlords don't give us wages,'' peasant worker Mateshwari
Devi said as she sat recently on the floor of her mud hut. ``If we
fight, they rain bullets on us. We neither have land nor grain. How
are we to survive?''
   In recent years, however, the Maoist guerrillas have been
organizing peasants and have become enforcers, meting out their own
``instant justice.'' Known as Naxalites after Naxalbari, the town
where their movement was founded, the guerrillas have been gunning
down landlords judged by them to be oppressors of the poor.
   The Naxalites' ``Red Army'' also has clashed with the landlords'
private armies, which peasant leaders and press reports say
terrorize low-caste communities.
   At least 205 people have died in 898 ``violent incidents'' in
Bihar since 1983, according to official figures. News reports and
civil libertarians put the toll at more than 450.
   The state's 85,000-member police force has tried to stop the
killings, but officials say the problem goes deeper than just
establishing law and order. They maintain it stems from the abject
poverty of the low-caste masses and alleged injustices of landlords
who are almost always from the upper castes.
   The caste system of hereditary social grouping was legally
abolished in India in 1949, after independence from Britain, but it
still fuels tensions between the haves and have-nots.
   R.N. Dash, Bihar state's home secretary, said the Naxalites do
get results.
   ``This is an economic issue, and the Naxalites provide an
aggressive forum for airing peoples' grievances,'' he said. ``When
they agitate, roads get built and things happen.''
   Bihar's 80 million people have an annual per capita income the
equivalent of $111, in contrast to a national average of $254.
   In April 1987, police opened fire on a meeting of about 300
peasants and laborers, killing 23 people. Local activists charged
that it came about at the instigation of K.D. Singh, a local
landlord.
   The rally had been called to protest Singh's claim to a tiny
piece of land the government had granted to poor families.
   The findings of an official inquiry were never made public. But
officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said the
inquiry found the police action justified on grounds of
``apprehension of breach of peace.''
   The activists claimed that Singh had arranged for the police to
open fire and that he himself joined in the shooting.
   Singh was shot to death this past Feb. 27; local people say the
Naxalites killed him.
   Shia Sharan, whose eldest son was killed in the shooting a year
ago, said he fully supports the Naxalites' tactics. He added that
he has been unsuccessful in his attempts to bring his son's killers
to justice.
   ``I have tried everything legal. I have sent telegrams to the
authorities, but no action has been taken,'' he said, showing a
neat file of documents and newspaper clippings.
   ``We won't leave this land. My son died for it, and the
government can fire on us again if it wants.''
   In nearby Haibetpur village, another story unfolds.
   Residents said supporters of Awadhesh Singh, a landlord from the
warrior Rajput caste, opened fire on Aug. 27, 1987, on farm
laborers who were demanding better wages. They were receiving about
a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of grain as a day's wages and were seeking
$1.15 a day.
   At least 26 workers were wounded. Police later filed charges
against some of the laborers, many of whom are now fugitives.
   A police post has been set up next to Awadesh Singh's house to
protect him from Naxalite attack. He said his supporters opened
fire because the laborers had attacked him.
   His workers live in mud and thatch huts and sleep on straw piled
on the dirt floors.
   He lives in a two-story, eight-room house, which has large
wooden beds, radios, glassware and china _ status symbols of rural
India.
   Some top officials in Patna, Bihar's capital, agree that reforms
are needed.
   ``The system has lost its credibility with the people and the
Naxalites. They say this system stands for vested interests,'' said
Dinesh Nandan Sahay, inspector general of police.
   Bihjar's newly elected chief minister, Bhagwat Jha Azad, said
land reforms must be implemented because many landlords own
hundreds of acres of land far in excess of government ceilings.
   But he denounced the Naxalites' instant justice.
   ``No one should take the law into his hands,'' Azad said. ``A
society has both good and bad people. The problem is that bad ones
are very well organized and we need to organize the good people.''

<HEAD>Japanese Fishermen Kept in Port by Soviet Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI TAKETA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEMURO, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a frozen peninsula on the fringe of
Soviet territory, fishing boats riding at anchor tell the story of
the plight of this small Japanese town and its people of the sea.
   At one time Numero's ships chased salmon across the Pacific soon
after the harbor ice thawed in April. Now they lie in port, victims
of shrinking fish quotas in nearby waters, shortened fishing
seasons and an off-limits zone around islands where many of
Numero's people were born _ all laid out by the Soviet Union.
   The Japanese lost its Kuril Islands to the Soviets at the end of
World War II. In the late summer of 1945, Soviet troops arrived on
the southernmost of the islands and routed their 17,000 Japanese
dwellers.
   Nemuro, in northern Hokkaido, is just two miles from Kuril
Islands now occupied by Soviet troops, weapons and warplanes.
   Nemuro's is caught in a chokehold, and its population of 39,000
is in decline because of it.
   ``This town is sinking economically,'' said Mayor Kaiji Ohya.
``For more than 100 years, fishing has been our livelihood. Now we
can't fish near the islands we pioneered.
   ``We want them back.''
   Japan maintains the Soviet occupation of the Kurils is illegal.
The Soviet Union, however, cites a wartime Allied pact giving it
control of all the Kurils. The dispute keeps the two countries from
signing a formal World War II peace treaty.
   But the worst part for Nemuro is that the harder Japan campaigns
for the islands' return, the tighter the Soviets draw the net
around Japanese fishing.
   ``If we raise our voices, they take it out on us fishermen,''
said Akimi Kubota, captain of a 90-ton ship.
   Nowadays he has to steer his vessel past the islands where he
was born to waters south of the Soviet territorial line to fill his
50-ton quota.
   Thirty years ago, before the limits began to shrink, his ship
could take on 100 tons. The salmon and trout seasons then were
twice as long as the current three-month season, and the fishable
waters were closer to home.
   Nemuro's pre-eminence in Japan's lucrative salmon market has
faded, and businesses in Nemuro are going bankrupt at an increasing
rate _ from four in 1977 to 25 eight years later.
   ``If you squeeze the fishing industry, Nemuro becomes
unlivable,'' Kubota said. ``There is that basic link. Half my
friends are gone. Many are still without work. It may be all right
to lose your job while you're young, but what do you do if you're
already getting old?''
   Nemuro's people speak hopefully of the new course set out by
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. His signing of the missile
treaty with President Reagan in December and the upcomming
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan have eased two major
obstacles to normalizing Japanese-Soviet relations.
   ``This is a golden opportunity,'' said Professor Hiroshi Kimura,
director of Hokkaido University's Slavic Research Center. ``Fish
must be sacrificed for the islands. Be patient three or four more
years.''
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno of Japan has applauded Gorbachev's
actions.
   One former islander is Sadao Nishida, a fisheries dealer who
keeps a rock in his hallway from Shikotan, the island he left as a
child.
   He remembers summers riding wild horses and swimming with them
in clear, icy waters.
   He was 10 years old on Sept. 1, 1945, two weeks after Japan lost
the war.
   ``We never thought the Russians would come,'' he said. ``Japan
lost to the Americans, after all.
   ``That night we saw the lights of a ship. Was it American? And
then around six in the morning we saw the red flag with the hammer
and sickle.''
   One-third of the island's people fled that day and eventually 60
percent of the territories' 17,385 residents resettled in Nemuro.
   Nishida said the Soviets permitted him to return to Shikotan
twice to visit graves of relatives.
   ``There wasn't a single house from the past,'' he said. ``All
the buildings were Russian. And most of the Soviets were women.
   ``They were such nice people. If you gave them something, they
absolutely had to give you something in return.
   ``I thought they might give back the islands.''

<HEAD>Loretta Swit Host of Documentary on Korean War</HEAD>

   Loretta Swit, who spent 11 years playing a
nurse in a Korean War field hospital on ``M-A-S-H,'' finally got to
Korea for a new documentary that explores America's forgotten war.
   She is the host of ``Korean War _ The Untold Story,'' a one-hour
documentary put together by Oscar winner Arnold Shapiro and Emmy
winner Carol L. Fleisher.
   The war, which claimed 54,000 lives in three years, is a
neglected chapter in U.S. history. It was the first war involving
jet fighters, the first in which American troops fought Communist
troops and the first in which the enemy attempted to ``brainwash''
American prisoners of war.
   The one-hour documentary combines historic film with new
interviews with people who participated in the United Nations
``police action.'' The nationally syndicated special will be
televised around the country from May 11 to May 31. So far, 118
stations have signed up to air the show.
   The United States keeps 40,000 troops in Korea to enforce a
cease-fire that is now 35 years old. The show notes the truce
anniversary and the Summer Olympic Games in Seoul this September.
   ``After all those years of pretending, they took me in hand and
said it's time to go,'' said Swit, who was Nurse Margaret Houlihan
in the comedy series. ``I'd never been to Korea before. We went up
to the DMZ. I was standing just a few feet away from a concrete
line that divides the country.''
   ``We were all astonished at the border,'' said producer
Fleisher. ``You don't realize we're technically still at war. It's
the longest cease-fire in history. The tension is there at all
times.''
   Swit said North Korean loudspeakers bombard the border with
propaganda urging the South Korean soldiers to defect. Not far away
is ``Propaganda Village,'' a facade to try to lure South Koreans
across the line.
   ``The flag flying over the village weighs 600 pounds, and the
day we were there it stood straight out from the flag pole,'' said
Swit. ``That's how strong the wind was. It was 20 degrees below
zero. My fingernails froze. My nose turned blue. I had to do some
narration there and I could hardly talk.''
   Swit went to the Inchon site where Gen. Douglas MacArthur's
forces landed in 1950 and turned the tide in favor of the United
Nations, until the Chinese intervened a few months later. She also
visited the new Olympic stadium in Seoul in her week-long stay in
Korea.
   Shapiro, who won an Academy Award in 1979 for ``Scared
Straight,'' was the executive producer, and Fleisher, who won an
Emmy for co-writing ``The Singing Cowboys Ride Again,'' was the
producer, writer and director.
   ``We talked to veterans who had lost arms and legs and they said
they would do it again,'' said Fleisher. ``They felt the war was
worth it.''
   ``It was an illuminating experience for me,'' said Swit. ``I
thought I knew the subject, having served my time on `M-A-S-H.' I
found out how little I really knew.''
   Asked about ``China Beach,'' the new ABC series about women in
Vietnam, Swit said, ``I'm so glad people will know that women were
in Vietnam. I'm involved in trying to get a memorial for women near
the wall in Washington.''
   Swit also works with the Audubon Society, which she calls ``my
other occupation,'' to support animal rights. She has worked with
the society on documentaries and recently teamed with Robert
Redford as hosts of a PBS series on species threatened with
extinction.
   She returns to comedy in a movie made in England with Peter
Cook, called ``Whoops! Apocalypse.''
   ``I play the president of the United States,'' she said. ``I
took a lot of kidding from people who said I had peaked as a major
in `M-A-S-H.'''

   Elsewhere in television:
   NEW CAMPAIGN: Dorothy Swanson and Viewers for Quality Television
have started a campaign to save NBC's ``A Year in the Life.''
Swanson told NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff, in a
letter, that to cancel the show would be ``a form of book burning
because `Year' is like a good novel, we `read' a chapter each week
_ and we aren't finished with this novel yet.'' The show has not
been canceled, but it has not done well in the ratings and is
currently off the air.
   HAPPY BIRTHDAY: Universal Television and Superstation WTBS are
hoping to turn Jerry Mather's 40th birthday June 2 into a world
record. They are urging people to send birthday cards to the Beav
of ``The New Leave It To Beaver'' for a record of the most cards
received by an individual. The Guinness Book of World Records has
agreed to establish a new category for the event. Send cards to the
Beav at Universal, 70 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, CA,
91608.

   So you're a television producer and you want to
get a show on the air. And once you get that show on the air, you
want it to stay on the air.
   What do you do? Hire the best talent in Hollywood? Butter up
network executives who can put you on after ``Cosby''? Hire a
detective agency to locate Nielsen families?
   Nope. Throw out all those theories about Nielsen samples and
demographics and time periods and counter-programming.
   In the prime-time game, it's all in the name.
   The right kind of punctuation will sell a show. Just look at
CBS. Put an ampersand in the title, and it's a go: ``Kate &
Allie,'' ``Eisenhower & Lutz,'' ``Cagney & Lacey,'' &, of course,
``Simon & Simon.'' ``The Law and Harry McGraw'' was canceled
precisely because it had no ampersand.
   This, of course, does not explain ``Beauty and the Beast,'' but,
hey, a prediction: by the third season, they'll open a private
detective agency and call it ``Beauty & Beast,'' or maybe just ``B
&B.''
   CBS is also partial to commas. They make shows sound more
intelligent: ``Murder (comma) She Wrote,'' ``Magnum (comma) P.I.''
You know these people didn't just drop off a dangling participle or
something.
   Those daring ABC executives eschew such mundane punctuation as
commas and periods and go more for such exotic symbols as question
marks, colons, quotations within quotations, e.e. cummings-style
lower-case and even exclamation points: ``Who's the Boss?''
``thirtysomething,'' ``Spenser: For Hire,'' ``The `Slap' Maxwell
Story,'' ``Sledge Hammer!'' ``Dolly!''
   To get a news show into prime time, it must have a number in the
title, which explains why ``Our World'' didn't make it, though a
fictional show called ``A Different World'' did. (That may have
something to do with one being opposite ``Cosby'' and the other
following it.)
   Note ``60 Minutes,'' ``48 Hours,'' ``West 57th'' and ``20@20,''
which also has the distinction of being the only network slash
show. Numbers did not help ``1986,'' but that was because it was
doomed to be out of date within the year.
   NBC doesn't care for oddball punctuation, despite having once
had one of the pioneers in oddball punctuation, ``The A-Team,'' and
settling for one all-capitals show this season, ``ALF,'' which
stands for ``Alien Life Form.'' NBC also has one all-numbers show,
``227,'' a street address. NBC goes in more for mainstream
catch-phrases: ``Facts of Life,'' ``Family Ties,'' ``Amen,''
``Cheers,'' ``A Year in the Life,'' ``Day by Day.''
   NBC also likes short titles, which may explain some executive
consternation about ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.'' Many
words, yes, but at least there's no punctuation.
   Another way to help your show with any network: give it a
one-word title _ ``MacGyver,'' ``Newhart,'' ``ALF,''
``Moonlighting,'' ``thirtysomething,'' ``Wiseguy,'' ``Matlock,''
``Hunter,'' ``Hooperman,'' ``Dynasty,'' ``The Equalizer'' (the
``the'' doesn't count), ``Cheers,'' ``Ohara,'' ``Hunter'' and
``Amen.''
   Talk show hosts have long since learned this lesson:
``Donahue,'' ``Oprah,'' ``Geraldo.'' Even ``The Tonight Show'' and
``Late Night'' are more often referred to simply as ``Carson'' and
``Letterman.''
   Who can say that ``Once a Hero,'' the first show canceled last
fall, wouldn't have been a smash hit if it was called simply
``Hero''? How about ``The Oldest Rookie'' as ``Rookie'' _ Top 10
show, no doubt about it. Who's to say ``Tour of Duty'' wouldn't
have beaten ``The Cosby Show'' (always trimmed to the more familiar
``Cosby'') if it had been called simply, say, ``War''?
   Of course, there are exceptions: ``Valerie'' became ``Valerie's
Family'' and still did OK. ``Downtown,'' ``Wizard'' and ``Starman''
didn't make it despite catchy, one-word titles.
   Surely CBS' ``Leg Work'' would have been a hit without the
space. Two-word titles are acceptable, but only for cop shows:
``Miami Vice,'' ``Crime Story,'' ``Houston Knights.'' Not private
eye shows, which must have one- or three-word titles: ``Hunter,''
``The Equalizer'' (the ``the'' doesn't count), ``Beverly Hills
Buntz,'' ``Spenser: For Hire.''
   NBC would never have had ratings problems with ``J.J. Starbuck''
if they dropped the darn initials. All right, all right, so there's
``L.A. Law.''
   Some shows will be hits no matter what they're called. ``A
Different World'' could have been called ``The Show After Cosby,''
or, in keeping with short, simple titles, ``Show,'' and it would
still be No. 2.
   It's just a theory.

   SPINNIN' `WHEEL' _ Not to worry, there will still be ``Wheel of
Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy!'' in the next decade, assures King World.
The distributor of the top two syndicated shows says stations in 50
markets have already put in renewal orders extending through the
1991-92 television season. ``No other first-run shows can command
this degree of commitment and confidence,'' says Roger King,
chairman of King World.

<HEAD>Inflation Isn't a Sure Thing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Chamber of Commerce has issued an
economic policy paper challenging the widespread fear that the
economy is expanding into a period of dangerously rapid inflation.
   It calls the growing references to inflation by economists,
bankers and investment advisers a phobia based in part on the
assumption that economic growth per se is inflationary, and partly
on misreadings of the evidence.
   It states that while the inflation rate could grow this year and
into 1989, it is unlikely that anything similar to the double digit
inflation of the 1970s lies in the future.
   In fact, says Graciela Testa-Ortiz, forecast director of the
economic policy division, the possibility exists ``that the
national economy has enough momentum to continue to grow with a
declining rate of inflation.''
   Inflation fears have intensified recently for several reasons,
including a declining unemployment rate, rising rates of factory
utilization, a lowering of the dollar's trade value, and increases
in food and housing prices.
   Among the most oft-cited evidence of an upturn in inflation was
the sharp increase in monthly consumer prices of 0.5 percent in
March, compared with a 0.2 percent rise in February, and the
graphic depiction of that increase on widely published bar charts.
   The Chamber challenged such usage of charts, however, by showing
that inflation, plotted quarterly instead of monthly, shows steady
declines from the first quarter of 1987 through the first quarter
of 1988.
   ``When the quarterly data are plotted, the real inflation trend
is revealed, and it is starkly different than the one portrayed,''
it said, adding:
   ``These numbers are not a fluke or a statistical construct; the
decline in inflationary pressures as measured by the CPI is
corroborated by the implicit deflation for gross national product,
a broader measure of inflation.''
   Many analysts posit that economic growth is inflationary because
it is assumed there are strict limits to economic growth, with
shortages and inefficiencies developing as industries reach
productive capacity.
   But, the paper contends, such reasoning assumes plant capacity
is a given and cannot be changed, whereas ``the truth is that
American firms have been expanding their capacity to produce since
the recovery began.''
   Moreover, it continues, wage increases that often accompany a
declining jobless rate have been muted by foreign competition. In
addition, output per hour per person has also risen, further
alleviating inflation pressures.
   The paper counters the argument that a rise in oil prices is
likely by arguing that lower oil prices are just as possible. ``The
reality of the oil picture is one of plentiful supplies,'' it says.
   While many forecasters say the dollar's lower value will
eventually force inflation into the system, mainly because foreign
producers may have to raise U.S. prices, the paper notes that so
far such increases have been small.
   The paper contends the major inflation concern relates to the
Federal Reserve. ``It is the rapid increases in the money supply
that causes inflation to rise, and its volatility which thwarts
growth.''
   It calls for stability and moderation in the growth of the money
supply, and a de-emphasis on month-to-month statistical evidence
and sudden reactions to them, in favor of longer-term trends.

<HEAD>Fiji Still Feeling Effects of Coup a Year Ago</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds, note May 14 anniversary date</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER O'LOUGHLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A year after a military coup ended democratic
government in Fiji, the South Pacific nation is still reeling in
the aftermath of a conflict that arose over Fijian fears of
domination by the Indian population.
   The economy is shaky, and skilled professionals and civil
servants, mostly Indians, are leaving for Canada, Australia and New
Zealand at a rate of 500 a month, double the precoup figure.
   Sugar production, the country's major cash crop is down 20.3
percent; tourism has dropped 26.9 percent, the currency has been
devalued 33 percent, inflation has tripled to 6 percent,
unemployment has reached 7.5 percent and the gross domestic product
is down 11 percent.
   The coup of May 14, 1987, was led by Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka
who claimed that a newly elected coalition government dominated by
the decendants of immigrants from India threatened the future of
ethnic Fijians.
   The Indians outnumbered Fijians 348,704 to 329,305 at the time
and controlled trade and commerce.
   The election of an Indian-controlled government led to the army
coup. Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra, a Fijian, and his Cabinet were
arrested. The Constitution was suspended and rule by decree was put
in force.
   Since then ethnic Fijian fears of Indian political supremacy
have eased.
   But the coup virtually ended organized political activities, but
the country is now seeing factional and clan rivalries among Fijian
chiefs in a feud over a Fijian king.
   It was to solve just such rivalries that King Seru Cakobau
handed over the islands, then known as the Cannibal Isles, to Queen
Victoria of Britain in 1874, after first having tried to interest
the United States.
   Ratu Sir George Cakobau, grandson of the king and a former prime
minister, now claims the royal title, which had been vacant since
the British took control.
   But other chiefs and clans are disputing Cakobau's claim to the
title.
   Bavadra, the ousted prime minister, said he feared squabbling
among the chiefs could provoke a violent reaction from Fijians
feeling the effects of the economic downturn since the coup.
   Watching the tribal feuds with interest is the 39-year-old
Rabuka, who is a commoner.
   He has become a cult figure to many ethnic Fijians who regard
him as the savior of their culture.
   He is the minister for home affairs in the interim government he
appointed to run the country until a new constitution is drafted
and elections held.
   A new book, ``Rabuka _ No Other Way,'' giving Rabuka's account
of the coup, became an instant best seller.
   Also in demand is an autographed color poster of Rabuka in an
army T-shirt and bearing the slogan, ``Fiji. In God's Hands.''
   A documentary film titled ``Operation Surprise,'' the code name
for the coup, has been showing to packed houses. Fiji has has no
television.
   One of the first acts by Rabuka, a Methodist lay preacher,
former rugby star and veteran of the United Nations Middle East
peace force was to make the religious observance of Sundays
compulsory.
   No shops are allowed to open, no sports can be played, public
transport halts and the populace is expected, but not yet
compelled, to go to church.
   But the Sunday observance law has become so unpopular that even
the Fiji Council of Churches has called for its repeal.
   In the best-selling book, written by a Fijian and an Australian,
Rabuka says the majority of Fiji's Indians are heathens and should
be converted to Christianity. Most of the Indians are Hindus.
   ``I don't think they will resent it,'' Rabuka is quoted as
saying, ``because all we are trying to do is the same thing that
missionaries did here in Fiji when we were cannibals and heathens.''
   In the year since the coup, Indian leaders have fled or taken a
low profile.
   But one Indian who remains prominent is Irene Narayan, 56,
Rabuka's minister for Indian affairs.
   She said in an interview the Indian community is now without a
political leader, but added she saw little likelihood of communal
violence between Fijians and Indians,.
   She expressed the view that while some Indians have left, the
majority will remain and probably accept their loss of political
rights.
   ``If Fijians want dominance and they are happy with it, perhaps
that's not high a price for Indians to pay,'' Mrs. Narayan said.
   Meanwhile, Fiji's relations with traditonal friends and
neighbors are taking time to mend. Australia, New Zealand and the
United States condemned Rabuka's coup. They called their
ambassadors home and suspended aid, but the envoys of all three
have since returned.
   Australia and New Zealand have resumed non-military aid, but
relations remain chilly.

   The Hi-Tide is no longer your
run-of-the-mill fish and chips shop. The American hamburger, fried
chicken and pizza have seen to that.
   Instead of the greasy, colorless decor that typifies many
British fish and chips places, the Hi-Tide is a large combination
restaurant-takeout business refurbished with ``Old English'' decor
of wood beams, exposed brick and lanterns.
   The kitchen gleams and the large staff is eager to please.
   The reason for this is just down the main shopping street of
this tidy northeast London suburb: a hamburger stand, a Kentucky
Fried Chicken outlet and a pizza parlor. McDonald's is coming soon.
   Fish and chips are still Britain's biggest-selling fast food,
but the trade is under siege and having to fight back.
   ``The competition is very, very fierce,'' said Hi-Tide's owner,
Eric Laycock. ``I'd be lying to you if I said it didn't hurt.''
   Not only is there competition, there are image problems too. The
health-conscious are shunning fried foods, and young Britons say
eating fish isn't trendy.
   Bob Kennedy, marketing director for Edinburgh-based Sea Fish
Industry, says fish and chips shops ``are maintaining their level
of sales but they are not sharing in the expansion of hot food
takeaway as a whole.''
   Said Brian Phelps, president of London's Fish Friers
Association: ``We're having to pull our socks up, obviously.''
   Fish and chips have been a national food since the 19th-century
industrial revolution, when trains and steam trawlers started
bringing it to the neighborhoods of the new working class.
   The meal usually consists of succulent cod, deep-fried in
batter, and stubby French fries called chips, all sprinkled
liberally with malt vinegar and salt. Mushy peas are optional.
   Until the advent of modern packaging, the fish and chips came
wrapped in an old newspaper to soak up the grease. A order now
costs an average of 1.25 pounds ($2.34), about half the price of a
Big Mac, fries and soft drink.
   Nicknamed ``chippies,'' fish and chips shops generally have been
small businesses run by married couples out of the front rooms of
their terraced houses.
   But gentrification of these terraces has driven out many shops,
and they are scarce even in central London today.
   As the new competition has intensified in the past 10 years,
``chippies'' are becoming larger, and chains and partnerships are
forming. Although most shops remain English-owned, Chinese, Greek
and Indian immigrants are moving in.
   Britain had 9,500 fish and chips shops in 1986, representing
52.1 percent of the multibillion-dollar fast food market, down from
10,750 shops and 55.3 percent in 1981, according to Sea Fish
Industry.
   Today, annual fish and chips sales total the equivalent of about
$935 million, the National Federation of Fish Friers said.
   The fight for survival is multi-pronged.
   More are providing seating for their customers.
   Laycock, who offers 42 seats, says: ``Takeaway is too blunt, it
is too quick. You can't converse with a customer like in a
restaurant.''
   The shops have improved flavor by using better batters and oils,
and are packaging meals in lidded cardboard boxes, Phelps said.
   Industry associations now run training courses for their members
and are countering the health issue with a low-key public relations
campaign.
   ``People say that fried food is unhealthy and too much fried
food will lead to heart disease,'' said Arthur Parrington, head of
the Leeds-based national federation. ``We say, `Moderation in all
things.'''
   Laycock, 45, says he spent 100,000 pounds ($187,000) renovating
the run-down fish and chips shop he bought in 1974. He reports
business is better, and he is considering getting a liquor license.
   As a director of Old Bylands Ltd., a 20-shop chain, Laycock
travels to outlets to teach managers how to fight the competition
from the hamburger, fried chicken and pizza.
   ``There will be less of us. The ones that are left will be
highly specialized and efficient,'' he said.
   ``This is a very dying trade, but I think we still have a place
in English society.''

<HEAD>Sudan Has Severe Problems after Two Years of Civilian Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reminiscent of the 1970s oil crisis
around the world, Sudanese wait in line these days as long as 12
hours for gasoline. Lines form as well for sugar, bread and other
necessities in short supply.
   Two years after army generals gave power to Prime Minister Sadek
el-Mahdi, his civilian government is having to contend with a
faltering economy and a costly war in the south.
   Inflation reaching 70 percent has sent prices soaring, and
strikes are commonplace as workers try to deal with it.
   The war costs the government an estimated $1 million a day in
borrowed money.
   El-Mahdi won national elections in April 1986, a year after the
military overthrew Gaafar Nimeiri, the president for 16 years.
   But el-Mahdi sees a bright side to his two years as the nation's
leader.
   ``We have moved the country from a famine-stricken, collapsed
economy to a working economy which is able to feed itself and which
has resumed its contacts with the international community on an
equitable and just basis,'' he said in an interview.
   Many Sudanese and foreign diplomats disagree.
   Sudanese joke about it: ``There's democracy, a lot of democracy,
but that's about the only commodity available.''
   Said a diplomat: ``In theory, if el-Mahdi's government continues
to drift with no firm program, that plus economic distress surely
will affect the democratic process and increase the possibility of
a military takeover. That's been the cycle historically.''
   It has taken most of el-Mahdi's time and all his political
prowess in the last two years to maintain equilibrium among the
country's 35 diverse political parties and 597 tribes.
   He fired his Cabinet on grounds of inefficiency in the spring of
1986, and the next one lasted less than a year.
   The crisis that followed remains unresolved as el-Mahdi seeks to
put together and effective coalition of the five largest political
parties _ a mixture of center-right, Moslem fundamentalists and
non-Moslem southerners.
   The major stumbling block is finding alternatives to Islamic law
that Nimeiri implemented in 1983. Although ignored since the 1985
coup, the law of Islam remain officially as Sudan's basic law.
   Nimeiri avoided economic problems by securing foreign loans. The
Transitional Military Council that replaced him froze interest
payments on those loans.
   El-Mahdi, whose government must deal with a $12-billion foreign
debt, says his government can't be responsible for the mistakes of
past leaders.
   That position enticed countries like Canada, Sweden and Norway
to write off Sudan's debts to them.
   But Sudan is not likely to hold out much longer on the foreign
aid it is now getting and foreign lenders are expected to extend
more loans without some form of economic reform.
   Saudi Arabia, Libya, Kuwait, Britain, Japan, the United States
and other foreign donors pour in $700 million to $800 million
annually in cash, oil and other commodities. A Western economist
estimated that Sudan needs $1 billion to $1.5 billion a year for
the next four years ``just to keep up its present position.''
   The civil war in southern Sudan is a constant financial drain,
as is the huge public sector.
   For example, the government's railway corporation, which moves
less than 10 percent of Sudan's freight, employs 370,000 people. It
moved more than 80 percent of the freight 30 years ago with fewer
than half as many people.
   Government sugar factories produce 600,000 tons of sugar a year,
which should satisfy local annual consumption needs of 560,000
tons. Nevertheless, the government imports 200,000 tons a year
because 250,000 tons of domestic sugar are smuggled to neighboring
countries for higher prices.
   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders are calling
Sudan to cut back on such costly ways.
   The Oxford-educated el-Mahdi said in the interview that one of
the first tasks once the new government is formed will be to adopt
a four-year economic reform plan. It will include rehabilitation of
agricultural, industrial and service institutions and the
construction of new roads and dams, he said.
   Closely linked to the economic morass is the civil war in
southern Sudan, where the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army has
held the upper hand for almost a year, its first sustained success
since the conflict began in 1983.
   The Ethiopian-backed rebels, mainly Christians and animists
fighting the Moslem-dominated government in Khartoum, demand
autonomy and a larger share of Sudan's assets for the southern
zone. They also want Islamic law abrogated.
   The country is thought to have extensive oil reserves, mostly in
the south, but the war prevents exploitation. Southern farms can't
till their fertile fields because of the fighting and work has been
halted on a major canal project, which if completed would divert
Nile River water throughout Sudan.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Despite being regarded as second-class citizens
in most of South Asia, women in the past three decades have emerged
as powerful political leaders in several countries in the region.
As one political scientist put it, ``I think there is a very strong
substrata of matriarchy in the society.''

<TEXT>
   Time after time, the scenario has been
replayed in the Asian Subcontinent: the powerful leader falls,
sometimes to an assassin's bullet, and beside the body is the
grieving wife or daughter.
   Then, tears brushed away and replaced by determination, she
picks up the mantle of power in a part of the world where many
women still are sold into marriages or brothels, cast aside for
failing to produce sons or consigned to lives of serving men.
   In the past three decades, several women have emerged as
powerful political leaders in this way. They include:
   _The late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India, rivaled by few
men anywhere in the world for iron will and ability to leave an
indelible stamp on the fabric of a nation.
   _Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, the world's first woman
prime minister and a strong contender to govern her nation once
again.
   _Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, head of the most visible opposition
force confronting President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
   _Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh, leaders of the
longest sustained opposition protests against any leader of their
coup-prone country.
   Each of them has handled power skillfully, although Mrs. Gandhi
and Mrs. Bandaranaike were doomed by their excesses. Not one of
them could be considered a feminist.
   Each pledged, at least in the beginning, to uphold the ideals of
her late father or husband.
   ``The people feel that the wife is the best to carry on,'' Mrs.
Bandaranaike says during an interview in the colonnaded home in
Colombo where Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was gunned down
by a Buddhist monk in 1959.
   ``They trust the wife to carry on the husband's policies more
than anyone else.''
   The 72-year-old Mrs. Bandaranaike pauses for a moment, then
adds: ``There is a certain amount of sympathy for the widow. You
can't deny that also helps.''
   In Mrs. Bandaranaike's case, her husband's Sri Lanka Freedom
Party was in shambles after his death. The party's men squabbled
for nearly a year, then enlisted her to restore unity. She served
as prime minister from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1977,
when voters rebelled against tight economic controls that banned
most imports and saw people standing in line for bread.
   Older and wiser, Mrs. Bandaranaike is ready for office again,
and is said to have a good chance of winning elections scheduled
for 1989.
   President Junius R. Jayewardene, who defeated Mrs. Bandaranaike
in 1977, replaced the parliamentary system with a presidential one
and is barred from seeking another term. His United National Party
is under attack for failing to end a four-year war by Tamil
guerrillas against the Sinhalese ethnic majority.
   Mrs. Bandaranaike, like the region's other powerful women, said
her sex has not been an issue.
   Despite being second-class citizens in most South Asian
societies, women have a ``market value in the political arena,''
says Ashis Nandy of New Delhi's Center for the Study of Developing
Societies.
   ``I think there is a very strong substrata of matriarchy in the
society,'' he says. It's a cultural phenomenon that transcends the
region's dominant religions: Hinduism in India, Buddhism in Sri
Lanka and Islam in Pakistan and Bangladesh.
   ``Traditionally, in all these societies, femininity has been
associated with activism and power,'' says Nandy, who trained as a
clinical psychologist before entering political science.
   He noted that Hinduism's female deities invoke greater fear than
male deities. Paintings of Krishna and other gods have a gentle,
almost androgynous quality, while Kali, goddess of destruction, is
drenched in blood with human heads hanging from her waist _ and is
unmistakably female.
   ``The king of the gods is a man, but the crucial, powerful gods
relevant to everyday life are women,'' Nandy says. ``Pestilence,
health, child care, fertility: These are goddesses.''
   Indira Gandhi, daughter of India's first prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru, was known as ``Bharat Mhata,'' Mother of India.
She was loved, hated, feared, but above all respected. She
abolished the princely estates of the maharajahs, intervened in
Pakistan's civil war to create the new nation of Bangladesh in 1971
and led India into the nuclear age.

   Mrs. Gandhi was installed as prime minister in 1966 by men who
thought she would be pliable. She soon proved them wrong and stayed
in office until a crushing election defeat in 1977 when democracy
was restored after 20 months of heavy-handed emergency rule. But
she rebounded back into office in 1980 and served four more years
before she was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards.
   ``I think being a woman in politics is an asset in India,'' says
Maneka Gandhi, widow of Indira's younger son, Sanjay, and political
foe of the older son, current Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   ``We treat our country as very feminine, Mother Earth. Of
course, I do tend to be patronized. But it's not because I'm a
woman but because I'm 31.
   ``I think most women in this part of the world come up in
politics because of family,'' Maneka says. ``But whether they are
successful or not really depends on their own qualities.''
   In Bangladesh, the two major opposition parties trying to force
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad to resign are headed by women,
Sheik Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party.
   Hasina, daughter of assassinated President Sheik Mujibur Rahman,
was tutored in politics from childhood, but Mrs. Zia sought a
political role only after her husband, President Ziaur Rahman, was
assassinated.
   Both Hasina and Mrs. Zia were installed as party leaders by male
politicians who needed someone who could unite the ranks by
invoking memories of once-popular presidents.
   Hasina, in an interview in the house where her father, mother
and three brothers were gunned down in 1975, said she believed
women leaders have strengths sometimes lacking in men.
   ``They don't corrupt very quickly. They can sacrifice more. They
are very organized. Women are mothers. They preserve. They nurse,''
says Hasina, 40-year-old mother of two teen-agers and wife of
atomic scientist Wazed Miah.
   The 43-year-old Mrs. Zia, whose husband was killed in 1981,
professed to see ``no difference between men and women.'' But she
added that if her husband had lived, ``there would have been no
need for me to be involved in politics.''
   Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto had brothers who also
were active in politics, but Benazir emerged as the foremost heir
of the Pakistan People's Party after the 1977 overthrow and
subsequent execution of her father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto.
   Returning home from self-imposed exile in 1986, Benazir was
hailed by adoring masses who thought Bhutto's daughter would lead a
``people's power'' revolution, like the one ignited in the
Philippines by President Corazon Aquino, widow of a slain
opposition leader.
   Two years later, Ms. Bhutto _ recently married to wealthy
businessman-polo player Asif Zardari _ heads a party wracked by
infighting among functionaries who accuse her of being dictatorial
and abrasive.
   ``It may be my personality overshadows many events,'' Ms.
Bhutto, 34, told one of India's national newspapers, the Indian
Express.
   She also said that before she returned home, someone told her
that politics was ``a very dirty game'' for a woman.
   She said she replied, ``Don't you worry, I will face
everything.''
   Although women have reached the top echelons of power in the
Subcontinent, only India routinely places some women in the lower
and middle levels of government.
   Krishna Sahi, one of seven women in India's 63-member Council of
Ministers, a sort of expanded cabinet, believes women always played
a big role in decision-making in India, but often it was ``from
behind the curtain.''
   Now, she says, ``awareness has come into women...They are
getting rid of the oppression.''
   In south India, the death last January of movie star-politician
M.G. Ramachandran, the leader of Tamil Nadu state, sparked a fierce
battle for succession between two women: his 64-year-old widow and
his 39-year-old close companion of the last decade.
   The squabble between Janaki Ramachandran, the widow, and
Jayalalitha, who co-starred with Ramachandran in 25 movies, is
still going on.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Two questions. What was the first human
transplant, and which is the most successful? The answer to both is
the cornea, which gives sight to 35,000 people a year. The irony is
that the very success of America's eye banks has caused their
biggest frustration, a lack of donors.

   Their battle cry could properly be ``an eye for
an eye.'' But there is no vengeance in the hearts of these
crusaders, only mercy.
   They work in a small, quiet lab high above Manhattan's blare and
glare, and, with dawn-to-midnight effort, seem to be gaining on
their quest: the gift of sight for all who can have it _ without
delay.
   ``We're providing more corneas for transplant every year,'' says
Patricia Dahl. ``Dramatically more in recent years, but still not
enough.
   ``When I came here seven years ago the waiting period was four
months. Now it's down to five weeks. The pity is that there
shouldn't have to be any waiting time at all. The eyes are there,
the donors are not.''
   Ms. Dahl is the lab director for New York's Eye-Bank for Sight
Restoration, Inc. It is the nation's first and largest eye bank
among the more than 100 throughout the nation. Last year it
provided 1,400 corneas for transplant, all it could obtain, but, as
Ms. Dahl said, not enough.
   The irony is that the very success of corneal transplants, the
first human tissue transplanted successfully, is the eye bank's
biggest problem.
   ``The large organ transplants, the hearts, the kidneys, the
lungs, are the ones that get all the publicity and national appeals
for donors,'' says Mary Jane O'Neill, the eye bank's executive
director. ``Corneal transplants have become so commonplace people
assume one will be available every time one is needed. That, of
course, is far from the case.''
   Since its beginning two generations ago, New York's eye bank has
provided corneas for 30,000 transplants. And, yes, the procedure
has become so routine that that number now equals almost as many as
are done in America every year. On an average day in America, one
heart, 20 kidneys and 65 corneas are transplanted _ one cornea
every 22 minutes, more corneas than all other transplants combined.
   The New York eye bank was established in 1944 by a pioneering
physician, the late Richard Townley Paton. He used eyes donated by
consenting convicts on death row at Sing Sing Prison, just up the
Hudson River, and lost a housekeeper in the process when she opened
the fridge one morning, saw two eyes in a saucer of liquid, and
left. Paton, who died four years ago, wrote the first textbook
published in the United States on corneal transplants, forerunner
of all organ transplants.
   The cornea is not an organ. The eye is the organ, the cornea a
tissue. At least at this stage doctors see no way the eye, once
severed from the optic nerve, can ever be transplanted.
   The cornea is the transparent front surface of the eye, about
the size and thickness of a dime. It is the window through which
light passes to the lens and onto the retina. The brain completes
the job; the result, vision. For it all to work, the cornea must be
crystal clear.
   ``It's an amazing thing, the cornea,'' said Ms. Dahl, the lab
director.
   ``It's the most sensitive tissue in the body, which is why the
tiniest grain of sand on it will hurt. Yet it also is very
resilient, and the fact that it contains no blood vessels makes it
easily passed on. Rejection by the recipient is extremely rare. The
success rate is better than 90 percent.
   ``Some recipients who received a transplant when they were
young, from a middle-aged or even elderly donor, are looking
through corneas perhaps 100 years old.''
   Ms. Dahl's education was in biology and chemistry, not medicine.
She got her job at the eye bank through a help-wanted ad and
trained on the job. She was certified by the Eye Bank Association
of America, sort of a national clearinghouse which sets the
standards for technicians.

   Her lab is a simply furnished room: no microscopes or bubbling
beakers or any of the exotic paraphernalia you might expect in a
place where medical miracles are wrought.
   It contains only a table, brightly lit, where the corneas are
removed, and a single instrument called a split-light, a device
like one an eye doctor uses for examinations, except less
complicated.
   Ms. Dahl's eyes (20-20, hazel) brighten with enthusiasm when she
explains what goes on there.
   ``We have four people in the lab and four in the field
collecting eyes from donors. As soon as we hear of a donor we
dispatch someone to the hospital to collect the eyes. We cover 138
hospitals in an 11-county area. Unlike other organs, the eye can be
taken six to eight hours after death. It's a simple job and leaves
no disfiguration. Takes about 20 minutes.
   ``We receive the eyes in the lab and examine the cornea through
the split-light. If it is acceptable, we remove it and send it
right away to the next recipient on the list. If not, it is used in
research. None is wasted. Our procedure takes about 20 minutes as
well.
   ``We maintain the recipient list by computer. The corneas go out
first come, first served, unless there's a priority, such as
someone being in danger of losing the entire eye because of an
accident.
   ``The doctor removes the damaged portion of the patient's eye
with an instrument called a trephine, sort of a cookie cutter. He
cuts out the donor cornea with the same instrument, so the
replacement fits exactly. He works through a high-powered
microscope and stitches it in with nylon thread finer than a human
hair. He can do the operation in his office using local anesthesia
if he chooses.
   ``Some patients can see when the bandages come off the next day.
With others it's more gradual.
   ``What we do here is the easy part. The hard part is getting the
donors.''
   Even many doctors, well aware of the need, are often reluctant
to approach a family at the moment of their grief to ask permission
to remove their loved one's organs.
   The result is the loss in America each year of an estimated
18,000 to 20,000 potential kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs and other
organs, but especially eyes. Since the eyes do not have to be
removed as urgently, the brain-dead body does not have to be
maintained artificially, and the cornea may wait four or five days
before transplanting.
   To prevent this loss, two years ago New York, California and
Oregon enacted laws not simply encouraging but requiring that
hospitals, where 80 percent of Americans die, make that painful
request of the bereaved. Since then all except eight states (Idaho,
Wyoming, South Dakota, Vermont, South Carolina, Iowa, Alabama and
Utah) have passed similar ``required request'' laws.
   New York, among other states, sends out counselors _ including
the energetic Ms. Dahl _ to teach nurses and other hospital workers
how to make the delicate request.
   They have discovered that in many cases the request actually
comforts a family since they can feel the relative lives on through
someone else.
   ``There is one final act of love you can do for your beloved,''
one hospital chaplain tells sorrowing relatives. Others approach a
relative with a gentle question: ``Do you know whether the person
was an eye donor?''
   ``Two-thirds of those asked say yes,'' says Ms. Dahl, ``Since
the law's enactment, donations to the New York eye bank increased
78 percent.''
   Still not enough.
   A decade ago, only 7,000 corneal transplants were performed in
the United States. But eyes judged beyond repair back then can now
be restored. Last year 35,000 Americans received corneal
transplants and another 5,000 who needed them lacked donors.
Doctors say that technology continues to develop and today's demand
could double in the next decade.
   ``I don't know whether we ever will have a cornea immediately
for everybody who needs one, but that's the goal,'' Ms. Dahl says.
   ``Until it happens, we'll continue to be a bank in name only. No
deposits here, only withdrawals.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In a program that began under President Lyndon
Johnson, more than 300 White House Fellows have spent a year
working in various federal departments and agencies, learning the
ways of government from within. Some have stayed, and now occupy
high posts in the government. Others have gone home, but with a
different outlook.

   In the Old Executive Office Building next door
to the White House, James L. Nuzzo scans column after column of
numbers in a budget book and prepares a memorandum for Vice
President George Bush.
   Nuzzo is a neurologist from Boston.
   Over at the Agriculture Department, George M. Drysdale makes his
way through the intricacies of farm price supports, soil
conservation and consumer services.
   Drysdale is a venture capitalist from San Francisco.
   In the office of the U.S. trade representative, Karen S.
Kellerhouse fields inquiries from mayors and governors about U.S.
foreign trade policy.
   Ms. Kellerhouse is a financial executive on leave from the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   Nuzzo, Drysdale and Ms. Kellerhouse are among a dozen Americans
in their early or middle 30s who are working as White House Fellows
in a program that has survived from Lyndon Johnson's Great Society
to Ronald Reagan's New American Revolution.
   Since 1965, more than 300 of them have passed through
Washington, spending 12 months working in federal departments and
agencies to learn the ways of government. Some have stayed, and
occupy high posts in the government. Others have gone home.
   White House Fellows work at the National Aeronautics and Space
Agency, the Department of Energy, the Pentagon, the Office of
Management and Budget, the Justice Department, the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency and in the White House.
   Of the current crop, one is a newspaper marketing executive,
three are attorneys, one is vice president of a scientific products
firm. Three are Army majors, one a captain in the Marine Corps.
   During their September-through-August stint, for which they were
chosen from among about 800 applicants, they receive a salary of up
to $55,000 a year. Officials say most of them, successful in their
own careers, absorb a pay cut. Anyone is eligible except federal
civil servants.
   Some of the program's graduates have big offices in Washington.
Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, who worked as a fellow under then-Budget
Director Caspar Weinberger in 1971-72, is now President Reagan's
national security adviser. Another alumnus, Michael H. Armacost, is
undersecretary of state for political affairs.
   Another, David Karnes, says, ``I wouldn't be United States
senator today if it weren't for the White House Fellows program.''
The Nebraska Republican is one of two who have made it to the
Senate. Tim Wirth, a fellow in the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare in 1967-68, is a Democratic senator from Colorado.
   Henry G. Cisneros of the class of 1971-72 is mayor of San
Antonio; Joe Barton, '81-82, is a representative from Texas; Garry
Carruthers, '74-'75, is governor of New Mexico. Tom Johnson,
'65-66, is publisher of the Los Angeles Times; James K. Stewart,
'81-82, is director of the National Institute of Justice; Robert
Haas, '68-69, is president of Levi Strauss & Company; Doris Kearns
met Lyndon Johnson when she was a fellow, and became his biographer.
   Several former fellows are generals or admirals.
   It all started in 1957 with John Gardner, then president of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
   ``I had been doing quite a bit of reading about the founding
fathers and I was struck with the fact that just about every single
one of them had very early opportunity to observe government,''
Gardner recalls. ``It was right across the street, so to speak, the
government of their colony.'' He also found, he says, ``that the
ablest kids in the country today never saw anybody governing.''
   ``I wrote a memo proposing the idea of a group of White House
fellows and had the idea that it could be financed by
foundations,'' he said. ``The only problem was the bill was very
high and there wasn't any foundation interested in it.''
   Seven years later, Gardner was having lunch with Eric Goldman, a
Princeton University historian, then an aide to President Johnson.
Goldman said Johnson was concerned that too few young people were
interested in government.
   ``Look, I've got a memo,'' says Gardner, who would later become
Johnson's secretary of health, education and welfare. Goldman
showed the memo to the president and first lady Lady Bird Johnson
and the program was launched.
   Today it has a budget of slightly less than $500,000 a year,
supplemented by private funds raised by a foundation set up by
former fellows.
   In its early years, the program was limited to applicants
between the ages of 24 and 36, but the age requirement was
abandoned in response to an anti-discrimination suit. All of the
current fellows, however, would have qualified under the original
limits.

   The youngest fellow in history, David Neuman, was 23 when he
served in the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs. Neuman says
the experience has been ``very useful and helpful'' in his present
job _ vice president for current comedy programs at NBC.
   ``Relationships between the White House and the departments and
agencies are much like that between a television network and the
various studies and production companies,'' he says. ``The
political dynamic is very similar.''
   Neuman says the program needs to be better publicized.
``Everybody knows what the Rhodes scholarship is and very few
people know what the White House fellowship is.''
   Applications are first reviewed at a January reunion of alumni,
who cut them to about 130. Those applicants are invited to travel
at their own expense to 11 cities to be interviewed by panels of
prominent citizens.
   This cuts the field to 33, who come to Washington at government
expense for a weekend for more interviews by members of the
presidentially appointed Commission on White House Fellowships.
   For some, like Karnes, the interview will be their first trip to
Washington. For others, the capital is familiar ground. Nuzzo, for
instance, had been a House page and attended Georgetown University
Medical School.
   Nuzzo, 31, said he heard about the program while in college.
After completing medical school and residency, he applied so he
could ``decide whether I'm going to be a practicing clinician or
whether I wanted to get involved with policy full time.''
   He says he reached his decision on his third day in the job: he
chose a life of public service.
   On one recent day, Nuzzo sat in on a meeting of the subcabinet
Interagency Trade Policy Review Group from 8:30 until sometime
after 9:30 a.m., came back to the office and did some reading in
the budget and the annual economic report to the president, ``sort
of summarized some of the key kernels of material that were
necessary from that,'' analyzed some taxation and civil rights
issues and ``looked at the whole notion of banking deregulation.''
That was in the morning. In the afternoon, he had a meeting about
AIDs financing.
   Not everybody's cup of tea, but for Nuzzo it's heady stuff.
``Here I am, I'm a doc from Massachusetts,'' he said. ``A couple of
months ago my big thing was figuring out whether I ought to give
somebody a high colonic, and now I'm writing memoranda for the vice
president.''
   In addition to their regular duties, the fellows spend at least
a day on Capitol Hill following a member of Congress around.
   ``That, from the fellows' point of view, is a real eye opener,''
says Ann Lavin, assistant director of the program. ``I think up
until then a lot of them have really believed in their government
textooks on how it works.''
   Drysdale, 32, a general partner in Hambrecht & Quist Venture
Partners of San Francisco, for instance, was assigned to track Rep.
E. (Kika) de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee.
   ``There are parts of it that are very, very different from the
way decisions are made in the business world,'' Drysdale says.
``Often in business one or two people make a decision; in the
political process it's much more open.''
   The fellows also attend meetings, about once a week, at which
big names in government and journalism speak.
   They also make trips abroad, which come out of the budget of the
agency they work for. This year's group went to the Soviet Union in
April. When President Reagan met with the fellows on Jan. 5,
according to Nuzzo, he asked them, ``Please let me know what you
find out.''
   Although one out of three of the current fellows are from the
armed services, officials deny there is any tilt in favor of the
military.
   Whatever their background, said Nuzzo, ``There is almost a White
House fellows Mafia of both old and new fellows, people from
outside and inside the government who talk to each other a great
deal.''
   One alumnus of the program, Elaine Chao, recently named chairman
of the Federal Maritime Commission, came to the fellowship from a
career in banking, to which she expects to return.
   ``Being an immigrant to this country, I was personally
interested in how the government works,'' the Taiwanese native
said. But she added, ``It was only through my business dealings
that I began to understand that business and government really
didn't understand each other.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Before Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis surged
far ahead of the pack, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo was the most
talked-about non-candidate for president of this primary season.
Here's a look at the statehouse record of Cuomo, who's keeping the
door slightly ajar for another ``Mario scenario.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mario Cuomo, one of the Democratic Party's
most eloquent voices, has toiled for 5{ years as chief executive of
the nation's second-largest state, much of the time at the center
of waxing and waning speculation about a possible run for the White
House.
   From his base in Albany, Cuomo has tackled national issues such
as the federal deficit; international issues such as Third World
debt, and the most basic issue of all _ life and death.
   ``We do innovation so casually that we don't even get credit for
it,'' says Cuomo, who with one 1984 speech became an instant
national celebrity and kept people talking about him as a likely
presidential candidate even while he insisted he had no intention
of being one.
   Until recently, Cuomo's avowed non-candidacy was regarded with
much skepticism. Now the march toward the Democratic nomination by
a fellow governor, Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, seems to have
all but obliterated lingering thoughts of a ``Mario scenario.''
   Whatever Cuomo might have wrought as a candidate, in New York
State his handiwork has accumulated and is plain to see _ though
not, as usual in matters political, uncontested.
   A list of administration accomplishments compiled in Cuomo's
office includes the mandatory seat belt law, the nation's first;
the start of the largest tax cut in the state's history, and
raising the drinking age from 18 to 21.
   The seat belt bill originated in the Legislature, and the
governor at first expressed reservations about its effect on
``short people'' who might find wearing the belts uncomfortable.
   Reminded of this recently, Cuomo said, ``I signed it.''
   In 1984, Cuomo fought hard to raise the state's drinking age,
but members of the state Assembly's majority, complaining of the
administration's strong-arm lobbying, voted it down. It passed the
following year after the federal government threatened to withhold
federal highway money from any state that failed to raise its
drinking age to 21.
   The tax cut approved last year was on the Legislature's
initiative, says state Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, a Brooklyn
Democrat. After initial opposition to the tax-cut proposals, first
championed by the Senate's Republican majority, Cuomo came on board
and signed the measure into law.
   In March, a television reporter noted in a broadcast the critics
were saying the governor hadn't come up with many new ideas. It's
an accusation Cuomo has heard repeatedly, and it makes him bristle.
   The official keeper of the Cuomo administration's scorecard,
first assistant to the governor Elaine Ryan, sent the reporter a
three-page list titled, ``Highlights of Cuomo Administration
Innovations.''
   Said the governor himself, when asked about initiatives: ``It
would probably be difficult to find a five-year period in the
history of the state where you had more innovation.'' He cited a
string of them.
   One such was his fight for creation of the National Economic
Commission to study the national deficit, Third World debt and
productivity. With a strong push from Congress, President Reagan
signed legislation in December creating the commission.
   ``The governor of a state gets an idea. The vice president
doesn't want it. The president doesn't want it. And we get it. The
president signs it. I think that was kind of innovative,'' says
Cuomo.
   ``That certainly has the sound, if not '88, then 1992,'' says
Cuomo's chief Albany antagonist, Warren Anderson, the Republican
majority leader of the state Senate, suggesting that Cuomo has his
sights set on the White House.
   The commission, derisively labeled ``the Cuomo Commission'' by
Vice President George Bush, this year's expected GOP presidential
nominee, is composed of luminaries such as New York financial
expert Felix Rohatyn and Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca. Co-chaired
by former Democratic Party Chairman Robert Strauss and Republican
Drew Lewis, a former secretary of transportation, the commission
will report after the November election.
   A real Cuomo Commission is the governor's Commission on Trade
and Competitiveness, a group of nationally known executives, labor
leaders and economists brought together by the governor to study
the same problems as they affect New York.

   Among other things, Cuomo's commission has recommended the
creation of industry task forces to adjust to new technologies and
foreign competition. Worker participation would be expanded to
increase productivity and corporations would be granted trade
relief, but only if they produced plans to revitalize their
production. The commission has also suggested consideration of a 5
percent value-added tax to reduce imports, stimulate exports and
cut the deficit.
   Other initiatives that Cuomo alone can take credit for include:
   _At his insistence, New York became the first state in the
nation to create a Task Force on Life and the Law. The group of
theologians, lawyers, physicians, scientists and civil rights
activists has come up with a legally acceptable definition of death
_ the absence of brain activity _ and legislation that permits
people to refuse intrusive medical efforts that might prolong their
lives. The task force is also studying surrogate parent contracts
and policies for organ transplants.
   _Cuomo has begun a program using schools as community centers
that provide care for students after regular school hours and he's
proposed Liberty Scholarships, a plan that would guarantee poor
seventh graders a public college education if they stay in school
and get accepted into a college.
   _He has secured passage of major bond issues for environmental
work and for rebuilding the state's decaying roads and bridges.
   _Cuomo persuaded the Legislature to establish a state-subsidized
prescription drug program for the elderly, to adopt a fiscal
strategy that will gradually reduce the state's recurring
short-term debt, and to approve legislation that would allow
victims of long-ago exposure to toxic substances to sue for damages.
   _Cuomo has used his executive powers to create an inspector
general's office to ferret out corruption in state agencies; to
adopt regulations that insure against race, sex or
sexual-preference discrimination by the state, and to improve
productivity in state government.
   _In the wake of corruption scandals in New York City and
allegations of wrongdoing by state legislators, he also battled
bitterly with the leaders of the Legislature last year to win new
laws to police the conduct of elected and appointed officials.
   A Newsweek poll of the nation's governors, conducted two years
ago, rated Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, as the ``most effective''
governor. Cuomo was eighth.
   ``It's a question of communication,'' Cuomo says. ``If I had
said for five years what George Bush is now saying. If I had said
for five years, `I want to be known as the education governor' and
just done all the things we've done for five years, I would now be
nationally regarded as an education governor. I didn't do that. The
programs and substance are there, but I never identified it as the
thing we wished to be known for.''
   Fellow Democrat Miller, who has not always been on good
relations with Cuomo, suggests another theory. New York State's
economy has been healthy and ``the money has flowed in,'' he says.
``Your ultimate test is always in emergencies; you can be great if
there are no emergencies.''
   He doesn't think Cuomo's has been ``a peculiarly innovative
administration.'' But he says Cuomo has borrowed ideas freely from
the Legislature and other states and ``somebody who takes the best
of what's around is smart.''
   Ultimately, Miller says, the governor ``is result-minded and
compromise-minded'' _ a real strength but also a weakness ``because
sometimes you let a lot of stuff go.''
   But getting things done is what counts, Cuomo argues: ``The
governor is the quarterback. He has to get you across the goal
line.''
   Miller says the governor has yet ``to get ahead of the game'' in
dealing with the mentally ill, the retarded, the homeless, housing.
And, Democrat Miller and Republican Anderson say, he hasn't
consistently appointed top-flight officials. Both praise his
ability as a communicator.
   As for the 55-year-old governor, he says he loves his job and is
making plans to run for a third four-year term in 1990. He is
careful nonetheless not to commit himself to seek re-election, or
to close the door completely on a presidential bid in 1992 should
the Democrats lose this year.
   ``Only God knows what's going to happen,'' he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They were early exiles of the Atomic Age,
removed from their rich fishing grounds at Bikini Atoll so the
United States could test its nuclear bombs. Today, 42 years later,
some 1,500 Bikinians are scattered across the Marshall Islands,
living on U.S. aid and waiting for America to fulfill its promise
and clean up their homeland.

<DATELINE>BIKINI ATOLL, Marshall Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kilon Bauno looks out on
the lagoon that once provided his people an abundant life and
recalls those better days, before U.S. atomic bomb tests poisoned
this remote, coral atoll with radiation.
   ``When I was here, life was great. We had fish, we had turtles,
we had coconuts. We lived together and we took care of each
other,'' Bauno, the ceremonial chief of the Bikini Islanders, says
through an interpreter.
   ``You always felt you were getting a big gift from God,'' adds
Bauno, who is believed to be in his late 80s, although elderly
Bikinians don't keep track of their ages.
   Today, 42 years after 167 Bikinians left so their atoll could
become a laboratory for the bomb tests, they see a glimmer of hope
that their ``nuclear exile'' will be coming to an end.
   Under an out-of-court settlement to a lawsuit in 1985, the
United States agreed to pay for Bikini's cleanup and the eventual
resettlement of the atoll.
   Scientists are still trying to determine how best to get rid of
the lingering radiation. However, it's no longer a question of
``if'' the exiles can return home, but when.
   An estimated 1,500 Bikinians are scattered throughout the
Marshall Islands, living off aid from the U.S. government and
longing for the day when America fulfills its promise.
   ``When we left, they promised us we would be the children of
America,'' Bauno says. ``The only thing we can do now is look to
America and wait for them to do something.''
   So far, the United States has spent $123 million on the
Bikinians, including $95 million in trust funds to resettle, house
and feed them. America also has paid for studies of the radiation
problem in the atoll, site of 23 atomic blasts between 1946 and
1958.
   With each passing day the elder Bikinians believe the chances of
resuming their traditional way of life become slimmer.
   ``There are only a few elders left who know our traditional
customs and it will not be long until they are gone also,'' says
Tomaki Juda, mayor of Kili Island, which has the largest population
of Bikinians. ``We hope it will not be long before we can restore
our traditions.''
   The Bikinians, described in 1946 as a primitive fishing people,
now enjoy a lifestyle they couldn't have imagined 42 years ago.
With American dollars they have bought Western-style clothes, TV
sets, videotape recorders and even cars. But Bauno and his fellow
elders say those comforts are only sedatives to ease the pain of
their exile.
   Some 700 of the Bikinians now live on Kili, a 200-acre island
500 miles south of Bikini which was uninhabited when they arrived.
Unlike Bikini, whose 23 remaining islands enclose a 240-square-mile
lagoon teeming with fish, Kili is an isolated coconut island
pounded by heavy surf.
   A $6 million trust fund provides each Bikinian about $30 a
month, giving them a higher standard of living than most
Marshallese. The Bikinians depend on canned meat and surplus food
provided by the U.S. government to supplement the coconuts and
breadfruit grown on Kili.
   U.S. aid has provided the Bikinians plywood houses, electricity
and medical care. The Bikinians also have built what local pilots
call the best airstrip in the Marshalls outside of Majuro, the
capital.

   ``Some people call them rich, but a Toyota and a plywood house
isn't rich,'' says Jack Niedenthal, an American who is an adviser
and interpreter for the Bikinians.
   While the Bikini elders try to keep tradition alive on Kili, the
American influence is strong. Some of the 100 children attending
Kili's three-building school have first names such as Rambo, George
Bush, Kennedy and Chuck Norris.
   A popular activity on Kili is to drive one of the island's
30-odd Japanese cars at midday with the air conditioner running _
an event they call ``jumbo.''
   ``The cars are a way of taking away the burden of living on
Kili,'' says Mayor Juda. ``Getting in a car and riding around gives
you a feeling of not being so stuck, even though driving from one
end of Kili to the other takes only a couple of minutes.''
   Twenty police officers take turns patrolling Kili's two miles of
dirt road in a pickup truck equipped with a $15 dollar siren.
Police hand out tickets of up to $25 for offenses ranging from
running one of the island's dozen stop signs to exceeding the 5 mph
speed limit established in the island's living area.
   The greatest thrill for the Bikinians is when the elders return
to check the progress of work at Bikini. The latest trip was made
in early April, when 50 joined U.S. officials to mark the start of
construction of a $30 million base camp once the method of cleaning
Bikini is agreed upon.
   The Bikinians and their Washington attorney, Jonathan Weisgall,
continue to lobby the U.S. government for money for the cleanup and
resettlement, which is expected to cost between $120 million and
$215 million. So far, the government has appropriated a few hundred
thousand dollars to begin construction of the base camp, Weisgall
says.
   Weisgall has proposed that the U.S. government establish another
trust fund that would allow the Bikinians pay for the resettlement
themselves. The plan, which Weisgall said would involve a
commitment of about $100 million, has received support from some
congressional leaders and from Larry Morgan of the Department of
the Interior, the Bikini project officer.
   ``I think all our problems can be addressed and resolved by a
trust fund,'' Morgan says. ``The trust fund we think puts the
responsibility on the Bikinians themselves rather than bureaucrats
in Washington.''
   For the past 10 years, American scientists have studied the
radiation problem on the main island of Bikini, whose soil is laced
with radioactive cesium-137 from the explosion of America's most
powerful hydrogen bomb in 1954. The researchers say it will take
between five and 10 years to clean Bikini Island, where most of the
Bikinians will live.
   Scientists say that without treatment locally grown food won't
be safe until well into the 21st century.
   They are considering three cleanup alternatives: removing the
topsoil in which the radioactive material is concentrated, treating
the soil with potassium to prevent the uptake of radioactivity by
plants and irrigation with sea water.
   For now, the Bikinians remain at the mercy of America.
   ``They give us a little money and we buy our food,'' Bauno says.
``Then we stare at them again and they give us a little more.
   ``That's all we can do. We just look to these Americans, saying,
`Continue helping us because we're still away from where we want to
be.'''

<DATELINE>BIKINI ATOLL, Marshall Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have once again
descended upon Bikini Atoll, this time to find a way to remove
radiation that lingers from atomic bomb tests and bring the Bikini
Islanders home to stay.
   Twenty-three atomic tests between 1946 and 1958 turned Bikini
Atoll into a radioactive no-man's land. Three of Bikini's 26
islands were vaporized.
   The enemy on Bikini Island, where most of the resettled
Bikinians would live, is radioactive cesium-137. The isotope fouled
Bikini's soil after the explosion of America's most powerful
hydrogen bomb in 1954.
   The cesium has made its way into the island's food plants, and
scientists say that without treatment locally grown food won't be
safe until well into the 21st century.
   ``If we solve the cesium-uptake problem, we've essentially
solved the whole problem of rehabilitating Bikini,'' according to
Dr. William Robison, a scientist at California's Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory who has been heading field tests here.
   Robison says researchers have come up with three alternatives
for making Bikini safe: scraping up the topsoil in which the
radioactive material is concentrated, treating the soil with
potassium to prevent the uptake of radioactivity by plants, and
irrigation with sea water.
   Removing the topsoil on the 500-acre island is the most
straightforward approach, and also is the most expensive
alternative, Robison says. The Bikini Atoll Rehabilitation
Committee, set up by Congress to study the radiation problem,
determined that removing the topsoil would cost as much as $96
million.
   To be effective, the removal would have to take the top 16
inches of soil off Bikini Island, Robison says. Such a procedure
would be ``a serious environmental insult,'' removing all Bikini's
plants and devastating the island's ability to grow vegetation.
   ``In addition to all the cesium, it's going to remove all the
topsoil that contains all the nutrients that carry all the organic
material it's taken decades to build up,'' Robison says.
   Workers removed plutonium from Enewetak Atoll, another nuclear
test site in the Marshall Islands, by scraping the topsoil.
   Drenching topsoil with sea water has drastically reduced cesium
uptake in test plants, Robison says, but scientists are unsure of
its long-term effectiveness. There also is some question about how
much damage the salt water would inflict upon plants.
   Researchers believe the sea water treatment works in one of two
ways: either electrically charged sodium particles block the cesium
from entering plant roots or the water filters the cesium further
into the soil and out of the reach of plants.
   Robison favors a third approach, which involves saturating the
soil with potassium. Cesium is closely related to potassium, which
plants crave. Scientists believe plants mistake the cesium for
potassium, which is rare in Bikini's coral soil.
   Robison says plants prefer potassium to cesium and will absorb
potassium if given a choice between the two.
   The salt water and potassium treatments control the radioactive
cesium, leaving it in the soil until natural decay renders it
harmless. The cost of both options is estimated at between $57
million and $80 million.
   The scaping option, although frowned upon by scientists, has won
wide support among Bikini's leaders, even though it means staying
away from their home longer. The Bikinians like the fact that soil
removal gets rid of the cesium, instead of simply controlling it
until it loses its potency.
   ``It's the position of the Bikinian people that the radioactive
soil be scraped up,'' says Henchi Balos, a senator representing the
Bikinians. ``As laymen, it's the only way we can have our peace of
mind.''
   A small group of Bikinians returned in the early 1970s when
radiation levels were thought to be safe. But tests in 1978 found
they were ingesting dangerous amounts of cesium and they were
evacuated.
   Tomaki Juda, mayor of Kili Island where some 700 Bikinians now
live, says Bikini's leaders favor the scraping method in part
because of the experience in the 1970s.
   ``President Johnson said it was safe to come back after they
supposedly did a cleanup,'' Juda says. ``We came back here and 10
years later we got moved off again. That makes it hard for us to
believe them now.''
   Jonathan Weisgall, a Washington attorney representing the
Bikinians, says the United States should abide by the Bikinians'
wishes.
   ``There's a very strong psychological factor at work here, and
if the Bikinians are not convinced Bikini is safe, I'm not
convinced they're going to go back,'' he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A want ad for a cook at the Mississippi
Governor's Mansion might read: Only convicted killers need apply.
The first family recruits its household servants from the state

   Convicted murderer Frank Gholar owes his
freedom and a well-paying job to Mississippi's resumption of an old
Southern tradition, using prison inmates as servants in the
antebellum Governor's Mansion.
   Only prisoners convicted of violent crimes qualify to serve the
state's first family and inmates facing life sentences are
preferred, says Joseph Nix, director of executive security at the
mansion.
   ``They tend to make the best workers,'' Nix says, explaining
that the ``lifers'' have the most to gain if they don't betray the
governor's trust.
   For four years, Gholar whipped up everything from gourmet French
sauces to down-home cornbread in the kitchen of the white-pillored
Governor's Mansion, built in 1842. When Gov. Bill Allain left
office last January, he kept the tradition of commuting the
sentences of his faithful servants, and Gholar is now on the
payroll of a Hazlehurst oil company owner he met while at the
mansion.
   Gholar, a 42-year-old former oil field worker, recalls serving
time at the isolated state penitentiary at Parchman in the
Mississippi Delta.``I've been behind those walls and fences,'' he
says. ``You go to Parchman and you think that that's it. But it
isn't if you try to improve yourself.''
   He's now working as a general repairman at Hood Petroleum Co.
Inc. offices in Hazlehurst, but Gholar's employer says he plans to
train him to become a manager of one of the Hood convenience stores.
   ``The program at the mansion gives you a chance to prove
yourself,'' Gholar says. ``Everybody ain't against you. They'll
trust you.''
   Gholar was sentenced to life in prison for the 1981 fatal
shooting of the woman he lived with in the small southern
Mississippi town of Prentiss. He claimed he shot her in self
defense.
   Gholar had no previous criminal record. But no matter how good
his behavior at Parchman, Gholar probably would have stayed behind
bars much longer than the minimum 10 years before he became
eligible for parole if he hadn't been selected for the mansion
post, says his new employer, Carroll Hood.
   Hood is good friend of Allain's and visited the mansion often.
He's also on the state Parole Board.
   Gholar was among the four mansion servants whose sentences were
commuted in January: Two for murder and two for manslaughter. Nix,
who has been at the mansion since 1965, says some previous
governors had as many as eight inmates. Newly inaugurated Gov. Ray
Mabus has four inmates cooking, cleaning and doing other odd jobs.
   The inmates live in a trailer behind the mansion. Because of the
housing situation, only male inmates qualify for the program, Nix
says.
   Gov. Bill Waller was the only Mississippi governor in recent
years to decline to use prison trusties.
   A 1977 book co-authored by Waller's wife, Carroll, and
University of Mississippi history professor David Sansing, ``A
History of the Mississippi Governor's Mansion,'' explains how the
tradition of commuting the sentences of the mansion trusties began.
   In 1912, Mississippi voters elected Earl Leroy Brewer governor
and Theodore Bilbo, who later became governor and kingpin of state
politics for many years, lieutenant governor. The administration
was rife with political intrigue and Bilbo was indicted.
   According to the book: ``During the sensational bribery trial
stemming from charges against Theodore Bilbo and his law partner,
G.A. Hobbs, a series of anonymous threats against Gov. Brewer and
his family forced the governor to take special precautions to
protect his family.''
   Henry Trott, one of the trusties on duty at the mansion, was
assigned to guard Brewer's 6-year-old daughter, Claudia, against
the possibility of kidnapping. For several weeks Henry accompanied
the small child whenever she left the mansion.
   ``Sometime later,'' the book says, ``Gov. Brewer discovered a
note under his dinner plate. In his young daughter's scribbled hand
the note read simply: `Please set Henry free.'''
   Although inmates had been used as servants at the Governor's
Mansion throughout Mississippi's history, the Legislature passed a
resolution in 1912 allowing the governor a small allowance for the
prisoners' food and clothing.
   ``Customarily, only Negro prisoners who had been convicted of
murder committed in passion were selected...'' Waller and Sansing
wrote. ``Beginning with Gov. Brewer and continuing through his
successors, the inmates received an executive pardon following
their service at the mansion. Partly due to the new pattern of race
relations in Mississippi and in part due to general prison reform,
and in spite of its record of success, the practice was
discontinued in the Waller administration.''
   The practice was resumed when Gov. William Winter succeeded
Waller in 1980.
   Several Southern states have used inmates in their governors'
mansions in the past. But Anthony Travisono, executive director of
the American Correctional Association, says he doubts more than a
few governors have convicted murderers as servants today.
   As Hood notes, recent governors see no racial problem with the
mansion program. The majority of the Parchman prisoners are black,
so it's only logical that most of the mansion inmates also are
black, he says.
   Gholar is black, but feels anything but a racial slight for
being selected as a mansion servant. He's just glad it has removed
the stigma of being an inmate.
   ``That's not me,'' Gholar says. ``I ain't Parchman material.''

   JoBeth Williams says that playing the role of
surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead in a new TV miniseries altered
her views about the controversial ``Baby M'' case.
   The miniseries ``Baby M,'' which ABC will televise Sunday and
Monday, tells the story of what turned into a historic custody
battle between Whitehead and William and Elizabeth Stern.
   Whitehead, a New Jersey homemaker, signed a contract three years
ago to bear a child for the Sterns. When the baby was born she
could not give the child away, and fought to keep her daughter. The
Sterns were awarded custody, but a New Jersey Superior Court
recently granted broad visitation rights to Mary Beth, who in the
meantime was divorced and remarried and uses the name Mary Beth
Whitehead Gould. She is also pregnant again.
   The four-hour miniseries is an unauthorized show done without
any input from Whitehead or the Sterns.
   ``You would have to get all the rights or you'd have to tell it
from one viewpoint,'' Williams says.
   She said Whitehead declined to cooperate if the Sterns
participated.
   ``Before I became involved my sympathy more or less was with the
Sterns,'' Williams says. ``But as I played Mary Beth I began to see
her point of view. I found myself more torn. When I began to see
the kind of pain both sides went through it became less easy for me
to make a judgment.
   ``In the beginning, from what I had seen in the media, Mary Beth
had done some very extreme things. I couldn't understand some of
her behavior. The more I got into it the more I began to see the
kind of stress she was under and how she could do these things.''
   Eight months of preparation and research went into the making of
the series.
   ``There is an enormous amount of material available on the
case,'' Williams says. ``I had followed the story in the papers and
on TV, but I didn't know any details. But like everyone else in the
country, I was fascinated by it.''
   ``Baby M'' also stars Bruce Weitz as Rick Whitehead, Mary Beth's
husband; John Shea and Robin Strasser as the Sterns; Anne Jackson
as Lorraine Abraham, the legal guardian appointed to protect the
baby's interests; Dabney Coleman as Gary Skoloff, Stern's attorney;
Bruce McGill as Harold Cassiday, Whitehead's attorney; and Dakin
Matthews as the trial judge, Harvey R. Sorkow. James Sadwith wrote
and directed.
   ``I think people are not aware of the number of people in this
country with fertility problems,'' Williams says. ``I was
sympathetic to the Sterns because of that.''
   Later, she says, ``I'm a woman who very much wants a child. I
think Mary Beth subconsciously really wanted the baby...Running
away with the baby is something I can relate to. Her maternal
feelings were very strong.''
   The Sterns signed a contract in January 1985 to pay Whitehead
$10,000 to become pregnant with semen from Stern by artificial
insemination. She agreed to carry the child to full term and turn
it over to the Sterns at birth.
   Mrs. Stern suffers from multiple sclerosis and pregnancy would
have been too great a risk for her. Whitehead at the time was the
mother of two children.
   This is the fourth time Williams has played a real person. She
was Reve Walsh in ``Adam'' and again in ``Adam: His Song
Continues'' _ as the mother of the child who was kidnapped and
murdered in Florida. In ``Murder Ordained,'' she was Lorna
Anderson, who is now serving a prison sentence for her involvement
in the deaths of her husband and the wife of her lover, who was a
minister in Kansas.
   ``It's different when you play a real person,'' she says. ``You
sort of work in a different way. When you play a fictional
character you can let your imagination run free. You can find your
own parameters.
   ``When you play a real person you start with the physical things
and look for the emotional links. Then you have to find the things
that support those emotions. You work backward. It's more
challenging. I would certainly never do an imitation, but you do
try to capture the essence.''
   Before ``Baby M,'' Williams completed ``Memories of Me'' with
Billy Crystal and Alan King. She describes it as a serious story,
but adds, ``When you get Billy and Alan together you're going to
have a comedy.''
   Williams, a native of Houston, is best noted for such movies as
``The Big Chill,'' ``Stir Crazy,'' ``Kramer vs. Kramer,''
``Poltergeist'' and ``Teachers.''
   This September, she and Kris Kristofferson will star in
``Passage,'' to be directed by Franklin Schaffner. She plays a
woman who has long believed her husband was killed in Vietnam _
until the day he comes home.
   Williams' husband is John Pasquin, who specializes in directing
pilots. Williams says she would do a series herself if the right
script came along. She has turned down a few that have gone on to
become very successful.

   When Clarence Fountain was 9 years old, he
joined a gospel troupe called the Happyland Jubilee Singers. Nearly
50 years later, he is still praising the Lord in song.
   He and the group, now called Clarence Fountain and the Five
Blind Boys of Alabama, are appearing in the musical ``The Gospel at
Colonus.'' The show sets Sophocles' tale of Oedipus the King within
the framework of a black Pentecostal church service and its rousing
gospel music.
   ``I learned most of my gospel singing in school,'' says
Fountain, sitting backstage at Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theater
where ``Colonus'' is playing. His school, which went from grades
one through 12, was the Talladega Institute for the Deaf and Blind
in Talladega, Ala.
   Fountain, who has been blind since he was 2, sang in the school
choir, but gospel music was a part of his life even before that.
His father was a steward in a Methodist church in Selma, Ala.
   ``I was the only one in the family who sang, though,'' he says.
``It became something that grows on you.''
   The Happyland Jubilee Singers continued to perform after
Fountain and the other members left school early to perform during
the mid-1940s. In 1947, they moved to Chattanooga, Tenn., where
they had a 15-minute gospel broadcast each weekday at 6:45 a.m.
   The name ``Five Blind Boys of Alabama'' was born the following
year, courtesy of a Newark, N.J., promoter who began to manage the
troupe. The Blind Boys would play one-night stands, all over the
country, appearing in schools, churches and auditoriums. They
eventually worked their way up to such places as the Apollo Theater
and Carnegie Hall in New York, and made a lot of records.
   One of their songs, ``Precious Lord, Take My Hand,'' was a best
seller in 1953. ``It was a touching song,'' Fountain recalls.
``People responded.''
   ``We always sang gospel,'' Fountain says. ``That was the big
thing. You couldn't sing rock 'n' roll and then turn around and
sing gospel. People wouldn't follow you.
   ``A lot of those people singing rock 'n' roll, started by
singing gospel in church. People like Sam Cooke and Aretha
Franklin. There were a lot of them. That's why they can sing it so
good.''
   Today, Fountain says, there is a contemporary gospel sound,
religious music that has a rock 'n' roll beat. The Five Blind Boys
have adapted to it.
   ``You have to keep up with the style,'' Fountain says. ``If you
don't keep up with the style, you're automatically behind the
times.''
   Fountain writes some of the group's songs with Sam Butler, who
plays guitar for the troupe.
   ``Writing songs is just like writing a poem,'' Fountain says.
``As long as it rhymes and comes out right, you can take any poem
and turn it into a song.''
   If Fountain gets an idea for a song, he turns it over in his
head, memorizes it and then tells Butler who writes it down.
   It was through Butler that Fountain and the Blind Boys met
composer Bob Telson and director Lee Breuer, the creators of ``The
Gospel at Colonus.''
   ``They had the lyrics and the tunes but they didn't have the
ingredients to go along with it,'' Fountain says. ``It's just like
cookin' bread. You got the bread but you don't have the salt, so it
don't taste like bread. We put the salt in.''
   The show has played at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and
in 1983 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as well as all over Europe
before tackling Broadway.
   ``The Gospel at Colonus'' stars actor Morgan Freeman who
narrates the church service, and it features several other gospel
groups, such as J.J. Farley and the Soul Stirrers and the J.D.
Steele Singers.
   But the Blind Boys get to sing in the evening's two
show-stopping numbers, ``No Never'' and ``Lift Me Up.'' They bring
down the house.
   ``It's easier to do than a concert,'' Fountain says. ``With a
concert, you don't rest. You have to really get down. In the
musical, we get a chance to breathe a little.''
   Today, Fountain, who has been married three times, makes his
home in Detroit. The rest of the Blind Boys live all over the
country, from North Carolina to Minnesota. Before a concert tour
starts, they all meet to rehearse their material and then hit the
road. Fountain and the Rev. Olice Thomas are the only original
members of the group still performing.
   ``We all have good ears,'' he says. ``If it doesn't sound right,
we just leave it alone. We all agree on one thing. If it sounds
good to us, we cut a record.
   ``My dream was to sing to the masses of people and when this
play came along that was my dream. And it's happening just like I
dreamed it would. We've come a long way. From the sticks to
Broadway.''

   Thirteen years after the Vietnam War,
non-communist Southeast Asia is taking in the welcome mat for
Vietnamese boat people, casting them off into a sea of uncertainty.
   A recent rise in the wave of fleeing Vietnamese is largely
responsible for the new get-tough policies and brings to a boil the
long-simmering problem: what to do with people nobody, including
Vietnam itself, seems to want?
   Southeast Asians maintain that many Vietnamese are fleeing these
days not because of political persecution but because of
deteriorating economic conditions at home.
   The solution, some officials believe, might be to send them back.
   People found to have fled because of political persecution do
qualify for asylum and eventual resettlement elsewhere.
   Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, neighboring nations
have offered temporary asylum to fleeing Vietnamese with the
understanding they would be accepted by the United States, Canada,
Britain and other Western countries.
   About 600,000 boat people have found new homes since the war,
according to United Nations statistics.
   But officials in the region now talk of ``compassion fatigue''
throughout the world so that resettlement does not keep up with the
tide of new boat people entering cramped refugee camps.
   ``What we're finding now is that horrifying phrase, `compassion
fatigue,' is all too true,'' Sir David Wilson, the governor of Hong
Kong, told a recent news conference. ``Whereas we have a continuous
flow of Vietnamese refugees coming here, the resettlement countries
are not prepared to take so many.''
   Under that pressure, the policy of offering temporary asylum to
all boat people is crumbling in Thailand and Malaysia and being
re-evaluted in the British colony of Hong Kong.
   Earlier this year, Thailand pushed back to sea Vietnamese boats
attempting to land, and several deaths were reported. The new
policy brought sharp international criticism. The Thais backed off
and reopened its doors but insisted the new arrivals would no
longer be eligible for resettlement.
   Malaysia recently announced it will begin turning away boat
people at some unspecified future date.
   ``Nobody wants to be hard-hearted about the issue, turning away
helpless people to take their chances again with the elements and
pirates, but Malaysia cannot afford to provide indefinite shelter
for thousands of refugees,'' The New Straits Times newspaper of
Malaysia said in a recent editorial.
   In Hong Kong, legislators angrily demand the colony no longer
offer asylum, while the government seeks elusive alternatives to
the current policy that will not result in turning away boat people
in unseaworthy craft.
   Vietnamese boat people began appearing in 1975 but not until
four years later did they turn into a human tide.
   Southeast Asian nations agreed on the temporary asylum policy in
1979, when more than 200,000 boat people poured out of Vietnam and
were presumed to be fleeing political persecution in their
homeland, which now was under a Communist regime. The world opened
its arms and most of refugees were resettled within a few years.
   According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees,
Vietnamese boat people arrivals in the region declined annually
from nearly 75,000 in 1981 to about 20,000 in 1986. The number of
refugees resettled also declined during that period but always
exceeded the number of newcomers.
   Last year, however, boat people arrivals shot up 30 percent to
about 28,000 while resettlement totals declined slightly to about
21,000, the High Commission said.
   Some countries reported a sharp increase in arrivals this year.
As of May 2, more than 2,400 boat people sailed into Hong Kong,
more than five times the total from the same period a year earlier.
   About 40,000 boat people were languishing in the region's
refugee camps by the end of March, a 27 percent increase from the
year earlier, according to U.N. statistics. Nearly 34,000 were in
Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
   Resettlement also was up in the first quarter from the same
period last year, but still was not keeping pace with new arrivals,
the U.N. statistics showed.
   One reason why boat people now receive frosty receptions is the
widely held view that many are fleeing Vietnam not for fear of
persecution but to improve their economic conditions.
   ``Those now coming are not the traditional boat people,'' said
one official in Bangkok, Thailand's capital. ``Most are looking for
better economic opportunity.''
   Many officials in the region believe the only long-term solution
is repatriation for such people.
   ``I think everybody would agree that a solution that provides
for repatriation would be the answer,'' said Fazlul Karim, the
leading U.N. refugee official in Hong Kong. ``The problem is we do
not have any workable solution yet.''
   The main hurdle, officials say, lies in getting the Vietnamese
government in Hanoi to take its boat people back. So far, they say,
Vietnam has agreed on a case-by-case basis to take back the limited
number of people who had volunteered to return.
   Vietnamese officials maintain that boat people are leaving
because they are disaffected and that there is no point in taking
them back because they wuld only try to leave again because of
Vietnam's economic conditions.
   While Vietnam says its inability to recover from the war and the
paucity of Western economic help may be responsible for these
conditions, Wilson, the Hong Kong governor, places the blame on
Hanoi.
   ``The government of Vietnam bears a very heavy responsibility
for the appalling situation in which thousands of people continue
to risk their lives at sea to get away,'' he said.
   Even if Vietnam were to allow the return of boat people, says
the U.N. High Commission's Karim, a system would be needed to
screen the economic migrants to be repatriated from genuine
political refugees.
   The Southeast Asian nations also would have to decide what to do
about the boat people who have received temporary asylum but remain
in refugee camps pending resettlement.
   The next likely step for the Southeast Asian nations is to seek
a long-term regional solution.
   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, made up of Thailand,
Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines and Singapore, will
discuss the refugee situation in June at a meeting also to be
attended by Hong Kong.

   They are not soldiers but
they live in military barracks; they are not prisoners, but guards
watch over them.
   Soldiers and prisoners usually know when their terms are up, but
the 2,000 or so Vietnamese boat people at this camp have little
idea when they will find a home.
   They are not allowed to leave the prison-like camp in Hong
Kong's rural New Territories, about 500 miles northeast of the
homeland they fled, until the United Nations arranges for their
permanent resettlement elsewhere.
   For some refugees, the wait already has lasted a decade and the
effects of lengthy confinement are reflected on their blank faces.
   A woman sitting on the top deck of a three-tiered bunk bed
stares into space; a man stands motionless outside his barracks.
Children who have known no other life run and play.
   For all the refugees, the matless wooden bunks are the center of
their lives. Family pictures, calendars, clothes and other
belongings are packed nearby.
   No one knows how long they will remain. Some meticulously count
the days they've been here.
   ``Nine months and 19 days,'' said Pham My Linh, 29.
   ``You don't understand what it's like in Vietnam,'' she said in
explaining why she's doing it. ``There are wars in Cambodia and all
17-year-olds have to join the army.''
   She was happy this day because she had an interview with a U.S.
delegation the day before, although she received no promises of
going to the United States.
   Another refugee, 17-year-old Le Thi Luyen, left North Vietnam
five years ago. Her mother and brothers had planned to leave with
her but could not find space on the boat.
   ``I don't know why I'm here,'' she said. ``I was only 12 (when I
left). Everybody left so I left.''
   Miss Le said she is willing to return to Vietnam to rejoin her
family but dares not ask about doing so.
   ``Some people have applied to go back in 1984 but were
refused,'' she said.
   Despair also is widespread in the many other camps dotting
Southeast Asia.
   Two Vietnamese refugees recently hanged themselves, one in a
Thailand camp and another in Malaysia. One had complained of being
in the camp too long and going nowhere; the other reportedly missed
his family in Vietnam.

<HEAD>Ethiopia: Again Drought, Again War, Again Starvation</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fierce fighting is overwhelming
foreign relief efforts in Ethiopia's drought-stricken north, where
more than 3 million people are threatened with starvation.
   The government expelled foreign aid workers and withdrew from
much of the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre, where rebels
are waging war against Ethiopia's Marxist-led government in Addis
Ababa.
   The government now forbids food distribution to the regions,
leaving as many as 2 million people beyond the reach of the foreign
emergency aid.
   A limited emergency operation continues through the government's
Relief and Rehabilitation Commission and a consortium of Christian
and indigenous groups organized under the Joint Relief Project.
   After intervention by a special United Nations envoy, the
government allowed U.N. personnel to return to the area where they
coordinate the relief effort's trucking and airlift operations.
   But officials say that, at most, only 1.5 million people can be
reached under current conditions and of that number, just 1 million
now are being fed.
   Overall, an estimated 3.2 million people are in danger of
starvation and depend on food aid following near-total crop
failures last year.
   ``We've got a lot of people who are not going to get food,''
said Patrick Johns of Catholic Relief Services, the primary
coordinator of the Joint Relief Project's food distribution efforts.
   Relief officials and diplomats are expecting hungry peasants to
migrate from the cut-off areas.
   All aid officials interviewed in Addis Ababa said such a mass
movement almost certainly would create huge hunger camps like those
of Ethiopia's famine of 1984-86, when diseases caused by
overcrowding and unsanitary conditions accounted for many of the
estimated 1 million deaths then.
   This time, people arriving at food distribution centers still
looked relatively healthy when the foreign aid workers were
expelled, said Vincent Bernard of the International Committee of
the Red Cross, which has employed about half of the foreigners
working in the northern relief effort.
   However, he and others said the peasants' health could
deteriorate rapidly unless they get food.
   ``We're talking about people who can't wait days or weeks 'til
their next meal,'' said James Cheek, the U.S. charge d'affaires in
Addis Ababa. ``I think we're going to see people moving pretty
soon. ... The future looks pretty grim right now.''
   An added complication is the thousands of local government
officials and leaders of the Marxist Workers Party of Ethiopia who
are fleeing rebel retaliation in the contested areas. They now are
gathered in Asmara, Eritrea's capital, and in Mekele in Tigre.
   The government's chief relief official in Addis Ababa, Berhanu
Jembere, said in an interview that full relief operations would be
resumed and foreign aid workers would be allowed to return to the
north only after the area is ``cleansed of bandit activity.'' He
could not say when that might be.
   Secessionist rebels in Eritrea have been fighting for 27 years
in Africa's longest civil war. In Tigre, guerrillas seeking greater
autonomy and a say in the government took up arms in 1974.
   Relief officials fear the foreign aid workers were withdrawn
from the northern provices to keep them from seeing what is
happening in the war zone. They say the government's exemption of
U.N. personnel from the expulsion order weakened its argument that
the foreigners were removed from Eritrea and Tigre for their own
safety.
   At best, they say, the government hopes to avoid the
embarrassment of foreigners becoming war casualties or the
inconvenience of dealing with relief convoys while it tries to
fight the rebels.
   The worst case offered is that the governemnt wants to conceal a
scorched-earth policy in the embattled territories, or to hide a
policy of genocide by starvation.
   Despite the limited access, Western diplomats and relief
officials said they had been able to confirm a government air
strike on an important food distribution center in the Tigrean town
of Wukro, which in recent weeks had fallen into rebel hands.
   These sources, citing accounts of eyewitnesses, said the bombing
April 8 killed at least 50 people and wounded many more, minutes
after several thousand peasants were given emergency food rations.
   Berhanu said he could not confirm an air attack, but added that
the government's policy against the rebels would be ``an eye for an
eye, if not more.''
   He also said the safety of the drought-sticken peasants depended
on their own patriotism.
   ``They are expected to join hands with the military so that the
enemies can be wiped out,'' he said. ``The people themselves, I
think, should decide _ and that decision is just to cleanse
themselves of bandits.''
   The military priorities also are impinging on relief efforts in
other provinces less severely affected by the drought but still in
need of aid.
   Relief workers in Hararghe province, east of Addis Ababa, and
Northern Shoa, north of the capital, say some peasants have been
afraid to leave their homes _ either to plow their fields or
receive food rations _ for fear of being picked up by local
officials and taken to the war zone.
   Sources say an emergency conscription is reaching into all
corners of this North African nation to bring tens of thousands of
able-bodied young men into military ranks to fight in the north.
   The military difficulties inhibit a well-prepared relief
operation, in contrast to the food disaster three years ago, when
foreign assistance arrived too late to save many of those who died.
   With the drought this time, food distribution began early,
before malnourishment reached desperate levels, and enough grain
was pledged to fulfill the projected need, estimated at 1.23
million metric tons by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.
   But even before the expulsion of foreigners from the north and
rebel offensives in March, the war already was hindering the relief
effort. Rebel attacks and land mines destroyed more than 100 trucks
used in the relief effort and often forced the closing of roads
over which food moved. Now, hundreds of governent-controlled trucks
that had been hauling relief food have been diverted to the war
effort.
   The transportation shortage exacerbates problems at Ethiopia's
two Red Sea ports, Massawa and Assab, where food is piling up
without sufficient storage facilities, said David Morton of the
U.N. World Food Program.
   ``We're particularly concerned it could be diverted to the
military,'' said Ambassador David MacDonald of Canada.
   Cheek, the U.S. diplomat, said the United States would not allow
its relief assistance to be administered by indigenous
organizations whose operations were not subject to on-the-scene
monitoring by foreign aid officials.
   ``We now have a war disaster imposed on a drought disaster,'' he
said. ``We have yet to solve that, to figure out how, in the
context of the double disaster, to perform our humanitarian
function.''

<TEXT>
   In the mean terrain of northern
Ethiopia, secessionist rebels and black Africa's biggest and
best-armed military force are fighting one of the world's longest
and most obscure wars.
   Every so often, the conflict pops to the world's attention, only
to fade like a smothered flare.
   It has gained attention once again because a spate of recent
rebel victories, drought and a cut-off of routes for food aid have
combined to raise the threat of famine for 3.2 million people in
the area.
   Eritrea's civil war began in 1961 against the feudal rule of
Emperor Haile Selassie. Today it is against the Marxist,
Soviet-backed government that ousted Selassie in 1973.
   The original rebel group, the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF),
broke up into four groups over religious and ideological
differences. The largest and most powerful of the splinter groups
is the Marxist but anti-Soviet Eritrean People's Liberation Front
(EPLF), with 30,000 fighters.
   The ELF, which is predominantly Moslem and conservative, now
numbers about 5,000 fighters and has not been effective since its
clash with the EPLF in 1972-74.
   The East and the West, particularly the Soviet Union and the
United States, have a stake in the outcome of the conflict because
of Ethiopia's place on the strategic Horn of Africa.
   Conservative Arab states like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt and
Sudan, fearful of the Soviet Union's current influence in Ethiopia,
openly support the EPLF, even though it is mainly Christian,
because it opposes the Soviet presence in Ethiopia.
   Syria and Iraq back the ELF.
   Black Africa generally has remained aloof from the conflict.
   While the Ethiopian government receives weapons from the Soviet
Union and troops from Cuba, the West does not provide any similar
support to the rebels. Most of their weapons and supplies are
captured from the government.
   Cuba, one of the first countries to back the rebels at the start
of their campaign against Selassie's pro-Western government nearly
three decades ago, now sides with the central government. Libya
followed in Cuba's path.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel both train the
rebels.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam has said his Ethiopian forces
soon will launch a major offensive against the rebels. A dozen
previous ``major offensives'' failed in the past.
   The rebels have Eritrea's rugged terrain as their chief ally and
they have been able to stand off 120,000 Ethiopian soldiers, 20,000
Cubans and hundreds of Soviet advisers.
   The rebels main tactics are hit-and-run attacks and ambushes of
government troops as they move through narrow, mountainous passes.
   For most of its 3,000-year history, Eritrea has been coveted by
foreign powers and neighbors.
   It is about the size of Pennsylvania and has mineral resources,
including gold, iron and copper, none of which is exploited because
of the war. Its 3.5 million people are mostly peasant farmers.
   Eritrea's allure is its geographical position.
   The province sits strategically at the crossroads of the Horn of
Africa and the Middle East, commanding the gateway to the Bab el
Mandab Strait from the Indian Ocean, nowadays one of the main
routes for Middle Eastern oil.
   It's 625-mile Red Sea coastline includes the ports of Assab and
Massawa.
   It has the only non-Arab access to the Red Sea.
   Without Eritrea, Ethiopia would be landlocked.

   ``COLORS''
   
   ``Colors'' marks the return of Dennis Hopper to directing, and
that should have been news in itself.
   His 1969 ``Easy Rider'' changed the face of the Hollywood film
industry forever, then Hopper fell from grace. After two decades of
drugs and booze, he turned his life around and returned as an actor
of remarkable depth.
   Reportedly the insistence of Sean Penn resulted in Hopper's
chance to direct again. A good thing. ``Colors'' reveals Hopper as
a filmmaker of great skill, though a glimmer remains of the
indulgences that contributed to his downfall.
   As a director of action, Hopper is superlative. Just when you
think you had seen every kind of car chase, he provides one through
the streets and back alleys of Los Angeles that is truly
breathtaking. And a fugitive's rampage through a crowded
restaurant, pursued by Penn, is a kinetic wonder.
   On the downside, Hopper betrays his existential tendencies,
staging confrontational scenes that have no real motivation or
payoff. This partly may be due to Michael Schiffer's rather
formless script.
   Penn and Duvall are unlikely partners on the gang war scene.
Duvall is nearing retirement, a cool head who tries to establish a
rapport with gang members. Penn is hotheaded and himself prone to
violence. Both try to act as U.N. peacemakers in the growing war
between the ``Bloods'' and the ``Cripps.''
   ``Colors'' manages to portray the gang members as human beings
not senseless criminals. Penn, who may be the Brando of his
generation, continues his string of impressive performances, and
Duvall performs with his usual authority. Maria Conchita Alonso is
wasted as the obligatory love interest.
   The Orion release was produced by Robert H. Solo and scored with
fine, thumping style by Herbie Hancock. The R rating is well
deserved because of the street language, violence, nudity and sex
scenes. Running time: 2 hours.

   ``WHITE MISCHIEF''
   
   While Europe broiled with the ravages of World War II, British
colonists frolicked at Happy Valley near Nairobi, Kenya. The war
for them was a distant thunder: Theirs was a life of sex, drugs and
endless perversions _ mirroring the downside and downfall of the
British Empire.
   Michael Radford captures that aristocratic decadence in Columbia
Picture's ``White Mischief,'' a Nelson Entertainment and Goldcrest
release, starring Sarah Miles, Charles Dance and Greta Scacchi.
   The arrogant and carefree Earl of Erroll (Dance) leads the pack
in a round of parties, costume balls, group sex, club romps, polo
matches and horse races. He has had affairs with every white woman
in the area and possibly some black African women as well.
   Into his seedy sphere steps the ever-so-straight Sir Jock Delves
Broughton (Joss Ackland), a reserved 57-year-old, and his sensual
27-year-old bride, Diana (Scacchi). With one smoldering glance,
Erroll and Diana soon find their way to bed and a tumultuous affair
that leads to his murder.
   Jock is put on trial for the homicide and acquitted. But in the
aftermath, his colder, more vicious side is revealed, and the Happy
Valley community realizes its last gasp.
   One would think that decadence and death would be good fodder
for a fast-paced flick. But ``White Mischief'' is like a
puritanical stripteaser: It promises more than it delivers.
   Still, there are some outstanding performances and delicious
dialogue, especially from Sarah Miles as the kinky Alice de Janze.
Alice, who bed hops with the best of them, is said to have murdered
her first husband. During the trial reference is made to this,
without naming her. Later, reporters ask Alice if she's the woman
in question. Her response: ``Which one?'' The woman who killed her
husband, the reporter says. ``Which one?'' she deadpans.
   Her straight-faced equal is John Hurt, who has a much too small
role as the rancher who also sets his sights on Diana.
   Ackland's cuckolded Broughton is perfect in his restraint.
Dance, however, seems almost miscast: He is not a looker nor
particularly sensual. But he makes his character full of
indifference with unbridled decadence, and that is the mood we are
to feel throughout.
   There is excellent photography by Roger Deakins of the splendid
Kenyan landscape, and spritely costuming by Marit Allen.
   The Michael White-Umbrella Films Production runs 100 minutes and
is rated R for language, drug use and adult themes.

   Staley Continental Inc., seeking to
thwart a $1.42 billion takeover bid by British sugar refiner Tate &
Lyle PLC, said Monday it was negotiating with at least one other
party interested in acquiring part or all of the company.
   Staley, the nation's second-largest refiner of corn syrup and a
leading producer of food-service supplies, said last week it had
discussed selling all or part of the company to third parties and
expected to enter into such negotiations.
   David Satterfield, a spokesman for Staley, would not identify
the parties.
   ``The significance here is that we've commenced negotiations,''
he said. ``There is a significant difference between discussions
and negotiations.''
   The company also said it would continue to explore other options
to enhance shareholder value, including a financial restructuring
or recapitalization, a joint venture or a leveraged buyout. In a
leveraged buyout, the acquirer finances the purchase of the target
company with sales of assets of the target or from its cash flow.
   Also Monday, Staley officials said the Delaware Chancery Court
had upheld the validity of the company's shareholder-rights plan
and other measures taken to defend against the Tate & Lyle takeover
bid.
   Company officials also said a U.S. District Court in Delaware
upheld the constitutionality of the Delaware anti-takeover statute
as it applied to Staley.
   Industry analysts have mentioned Chicago-based Kraft Inc. as a
company that may have an interest in acquiring Staley's CFS
Continental Inc. food-service division. Staley defeated Kraft in a
bidding war for CFS Continental in October 1984.
   But several analysts refused to speculate Monday on which
companies might be talking with Staley.
   ``Everything that can be said has been said,'' said Richard Elam
of Blunt Ellis & Loewi Inc. ``I'm just waiting for something to
occur that's concrete and palpable, and I don't know what it's
going to be.''
   Staley's board of directors last week advised the company's
shareholders to reject Tate & Lyle's second cash tender offer,
which totals about $1.42 billion, or $35 a share.
   Analysts have said Staley has a market value of about $40 a
share.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Staley
closed up 50 cents to $38.75 Monday.
   London-based Tate & Lyle, Britain's second-largest sugar
refiner, owns about 5 percent of Staley's stock and wants to
acquire the entire company for its A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.
subsidiary, which produces corn sweeteners.
   Staley was based in Decatur, Ill., until about three years ago,
when it moved its headquarters to Rolling Meadows in suburban
Chicago.
   Tate & Lyle has promised to move Staley's headquarters back to
Decatur, in central Illinois, if its takeover attempt succeeds.

   Export subsidies, liberal credit and food aid
have become increasingly important parts of U.S. agricultural
trade, efforts the Agriculture Department says are needed to help
the American farmer meet foreign competition.
   The Export Enhancement Program is the hottest program at
present, and is being used in a virtual head-to-head confrontation
with the European Economic Community over trade policy.
   ``U.S. exporters operate in a competitive trade environment
influenced by other exporters' subsidies and importers' barriers,''
says analyst Mark Smith of the department's Economic Research
Service.
   For example, the EEC operates a system of export subsidies which
enables high-priced wheat from the 12-nation trading bloc to be
sold on world markets at competitive prices, he said. Since 1978,
the EEC has joined the traditional big four _ Argentina, Australia,
Canada and the United States _ as a wheat exporter.
   It was the use of export subsidies, to reduce high internal
prices, that enabled the EEC to change from a net importer of wheat
to a net exporter.
   The United States had used some kinds of export subsidies in the
past, but it was the advent of the Export Enhancement Program, or
EEP, in 1985 that caught the attention of world traders.
   Under the program, U.S. exporters are given bonuses, or
subsidies, of government-owned commodities to compensate for
reduced prices paid by a foreign buyer. The USDA does this only for
the sale of certain commodities to designated countries.
   As of April 28, exporters had sold more than $4.81 billion worth
of commodities to foreign buyers. That is the amount paid by the
overseas customers.
   The exporters then collected bonuses of surplus commodities
owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. Those bonuses, or
subsidies, had a CCC book value of $2.86 billion _ the amount the
CCC had paid for them under its domestic price support operations.
   But the actual market value of the bonus commodities was less
than $2.05 billion, reflecting their estimated worth on the U.S.
domestic market at the time.
   Thus, according to the figures supplied by the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, the commodities sold by exporters for
$4.81 billion would have cost the foreign buyers at least $6.86
billion if it had not been for the $2.05 billion in the market
value of the bonuses.
   In other words, the bonuses reduced the purchase prices of the
EEP commodities by about 30 percent.
   Since the program began three years ago, more than 40 million
metric tons of U.S. wheat have been sold at subsidized prices, the
agency said. Although wheat is by far the largest EEP commodity,
other items include barley, sorghum, rice, poultry feed, vegetable
oil, frozen poultry, live dairy cattle, and eggs.
   In his report, Smith said the chief markets for wheat under EEP
have been the Soviet Union, China, Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.
Saudi Arabia has been the main barley purchaser.
   Smith's analysis in the May issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine refers to other export programs as well as EEP. Those
include programs for short-term export credit financing; Targeted
Export Assistance, or TEA, in which producer groups are helped to
carry out overseas promotional activities; and Food for Peace, or
P.L. 480 assistance for needy countries.
   Although the impact of TEA is difficult to measure, Smith said
the other programs account for ``a significant share'' of U.S.
commodity exports. In the case of wheat, for example, 60 percent to
70 percent of the exports in the 1986-87 fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30 were covered by USDA programs.
   ``Four of the top five markets for U.S. wheat in 1987 were chief
markets for wheat under the EEP, CCC credit guarantees, or food
aid,'' he said. ``Japan, the top market in value terms for U.S.
wheat, was the exception, purchasing its wheat outside U.S. export
programs.''
   But the Soviet Union, the second-largest buyer, used the EEP
program extensively. Egypt and Algeria, which were third and fifth
last year, bought U.S. wheat under a combination of EEP and the
export credit program. South Korea, which was the fourth-largest
market, also bought significant amounts through credit arrangements.
   Smith said that more than half of the 1987 exports of vegetable
oils involved U.S. programs, primarily credit and food aid. Rice
also benefited, including credit sales to Iraq, and food aid
shipments to the Dominican Republic and Sierra Leone.
   The United States holds about 60 percent of the world feed grain
trade, up from a low of 45 percent two years ago, he said. Most
export sales are without the use of U.S. export programs. Cotton is
another major commodity that is not involved in the programs in a
major way.

<HEAD>Analysis: U.S. Makers' Share of Auto Market Heading Downward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese automakers will claim a larger share of
the U.S. automobile market without having to boost exports because
they will build more cars in this country, according to a new study.
   Japan's market share will grow as that of General Motors Corp.,
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. shrinks, according to Booz, Allen
& Hamilton Inc., a New York-based management firm.
   The analysis was released last week in Washington during a
meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers' Government and
Industry panel and reported in Sunday editions of The Detroit News.
   The analysis predicted that by 1990:
   _New plants will add about 30,000 jobs, but not all will be
unionized.
   _U.S. automakers' share of the domestic market will fall to 56
percent, compared with 68 percent in 1987.
   _Japanese automakers' U.S. market share will pass 30 percent as
production at North American factories increases while import
levels stay at 2.2 million a year.
   In the late 1970s, as imported Japanese cars zoomed in
popularity, cries of trade protectionism were heard. In turn, the
Japanese instituted voluntary restraints on the number of cars
exported to the United States every year.
   But since Honda North America Inc. opened an auto assembly plant
in December 1982 in Marysville, Ohio, Japanese companies have been
building increasing numbers of cars in the United States, sometimes
in joint ventures with one of the Big Three automakers.
   ``It's going to be more and more difficult to define what is a
U.S. company'' in the near future, said James Mateyka, a vice
president with the management firm's office in Bethesda, Md.
   ``After Honda adds its engine and transmission plants (in the
United States), will it be less American than Ford or GM?'' he
asked.
   By 1990, Japanese production in the United States will reach
about 2.2 million cars a year, about the same as import
restrictions allow, said the analysis.

<HEAD>Central Bank Intervenes As Pound Rises On Lawson Resignation
Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bank of England intervened in the foreign
exchange market to stem a surge in the pound, as rumors flew Monday
that Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was planning to
resign, dealers said.
   The intervention was light to moderate, dealers said.
   A Bank of England official declined to comment on the reports of
intervention. A Treasury official denied the rumors about Lawson.
Neither official was identified, in accordance with British custom.
   The pound rose to $1.8785 by midday local time from $1.8730 in
London on Friday. It was quoted well above 3.1300 West German marks
at 3.1587 marks.
   Dealers said sterling began to climb in overnight trading, in
the wake of a bullish report by the investment firm Goldman Sachs
International Corp., which was highlighted in The Sunday Times.
   In the report, Goldman Sachs chief international economist David
Morrison said the pound was significantly undervalued against the
Deutsche mark and could climb over the next few months.
   The report contended that British industry would still be
competitive if the pound rose as high as 3.27 marks.
   Dealers said the report served as an excuse to buy pounds.
   Rumors that Lawson would resign sent sterling surging in the
early afternoon before the intervention took place, dealers said.
Lawson favors intervention to stem the pound's rise.
   When Lawson stated on March 10 that any further rise in the
pound's rise could not be sustained, the pound stood at 3.08 marks.
   Lawson clashed at that time with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who said the pound should be allowed to rise in foreign
exchange markets to contain inflation.
   Morrison's report argued that fears that the pound's rise could
lead to the devastation of British industry were totally unfounded
and he said Lawson's quest for stability was ill-founded.
   Morrison said the British economy's growth rate this year will
be double West Germany's and that while Britain has a budget
surplus, West Germany is facing an ``exploding budget deficit'' _
higher even than America's as a percentage of national income.''
   At the same time the American economy is on course for higher
inflation than Britain by the end of this year, and is saddled with
huge trade and budget deficits for the forseeable future, Morrison
said.
   He said the pound could surge over the next few months, perhaps
to 3.20 marks and $2.
   ``People don't appreciate how dynamic the British economy has
become,'' Morrison said.
   He said that because of Britain's lack of political worries and
its budget surplus, foreign investors see Britain as a more
attractive country in which to invest than the United States or
West Germany.
   The Sunday Times said the Goldman Sachs report ``contradicts a
widely held view in the City (of London financial district) that
sterling will slide in response to a rising balance of payments
deficit.''
   Morrison said the balance of payments deficit in prospect for
this year, which he expects to be between 5 billion and 6 billion
pounds _ or $9.35 and $11.22 billion _ can be readily financed
without any increase in interest rates.
   He said Britain has no fundamental balance of payments problem.

<HEAD>Accounting Firm Pays $15 Million to Settle Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laventhol & Horwath has paid $15 million in an
out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit charging the accounting firm
with racketeering.
   The firm made the settlement last Friday with attorneys for
2,850 investors who lost a total of more than $20 million in a
failed tax-shelter program audited by Laventhol.
   The settlement must be approved by a judge in the U.S. District
Court in Sacramento, Calif., Laventhol General Counsel Barry S.
Augenbraun told The Associated Press Monday.
   Laventhol, based in Philadelphia, is the nation's ninth-largest
accounting firm.
   A jury found in favor of the investors in February, making
Laventhol the first big accounting firm to lose a jury trial under
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Under the
federal law, known as RICO, plaintiffs are automatically eligible
for triple damages.
   Under the racketeering charge, Laventhol was accused of
complicity in the tax-shelter scheme. The shelters were offered by
Dairy World Genetics Partnerships, a series of limited
partnerships, in 1970, 1980 and 1981.
   The settlement of the class-action suit is entirely covered by
Laventhol's liability insurance, Augenbraun said.
   Some attorneys believe the magnitude of the Laventhol settlement
could have negative implications for the accounting profession.
   ``As long as the plaintiffs allege that accountants are in
cahoots with the company in defrauding investors, any accounting
firm can get caught up in RICO,'' Victor Earle, former general
counsel of accounting firm Peat Marwick, told the Wall Street
Journal.

   Global economic upheavals such as the October
stock market collapse show that the world urgently needs a new
monetary system, according to a study released today.
   The study, sponsored by the Institute for International
Economics, concludes that the international agreements by which the
Reagan administration has tried to manage the dollar over the past
three years have proven ``agonizingly fragile.''
   The agreements did not go far enough because of political
obstacles in the United States, Japan and West Germany, the study
says.
   ``The possibility of backsliding, over-committing or reneging
has continually threatened the credibility of these deals,'' said
Yoichi Funabashi, the study's author.
   The study is titled ``Managing the Dollar: From the Plaza to the
Louvre.'' It traces the effort beginning in September 1985 to
weaken the dollar as a way of lowering the huge U.S. trade deficits.
   The administration reached an agreement with Japan, West
Germany, Britain and France at the Plaza Hotel in New York in which
the five nations pledged to force the dollar lower through a
process known as intervention, by which governments buy and sell
currencies in the open market to influence their value.
   The administration, which for years had boasted about the
dollar's upward surge, abruptly reversed course after James A.
Baker III took over as treasury secretary from Donald T. Regan.
   Baker believed a weaker dollar was needed to fight growing
protectionist sentiment in a Congress alarmed by the soaring trade
deficit.
   A weaker dollar makes American products more competitive on
overseas markets while making imports more expensive in the United
States.
   The United States and its allies switched course again in
February 1987 with the Louvre agreement which said that the dollar
had declined far enough. The nations pledged to intervene in
currency markets to defend the dollar against continued downward
pressure.
   Despite that pledge, the U.S. currency has come under repeated
selling pressure because of the stubbornly high U.S. trade deficit,
which last year hit a record $171.2 billion. The downward pressure
on the dollar and efforts by the Federal Reserve to prop up its
value by raising U.S. interest rates last fall were two of the
factors cited in the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   Financial markets remain convinced that the dollar will have to
fall farther to correct the trade deficits.
   The United States has become the world's largest debtor nation
as Americans have transferred billions of dollars into the hands of
foreigners to pay for Japanese cars, Korean television sets and
French wines.
   America's new status as a net debtor makes it imperative for the
new administration to intensify efforts at international
cooperation, the study said.
   The study recommended building on the approach established by
the Louvre agreement, by which each nation's currency is placed in
a so-called target zone and any time the currency moves outside the
agreed-upon zone, nations launch actions including intervention to
bring it back into line.
   The study said the United States bargaining position would be
strengthened if the administration made a greater effort to include
Congress in the economic decision-making process since such needed
changes as reducing the federal budget deficit can only be
accomplished through congressional action.
   The study, based on interviews with many of the officials
involved, reveals some key details of the secret negotiations over
the past three years.
   The administration's changed position from a hands-off approach
to the dollar to actively trying to push it lower was engineered by
then-Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, a key Baker aide who
has been behind many of the administration's most successful
economic initiatives. Darman detailed the proposed change in a
secret memo to Baker in the spring of 1985, soon after Baker, the
White House chief of staff in Reagan's first term, swapped jobs
with Regan.
   Funabashi says the original goal of the Plaza accord was to
drive down the dollar's value by between 10 percent and 12 percent
through an intensive six-week intervention effort with a price tag
of $18 billion. This goal was realized.
   The Louvre accord, signed in Paris in February 1987, sought to
stabilize exchange rates, keeping the dollar from falling by more
than 5 percent from a base of 153.5 yen to the dollar.
   The dollar has continued to fall, however, and now stands around
125 yen, down almost 50 percent from its peak of 263.7 yen in
February 1985.
   Funabashi, who has covered economics for 20 years, is the deputy
editor of economic affairs for the Japanese newspaper the Asahi
Shimbun. He wrote the dollar study during a year in which he was a
visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a
seven-year-old Washington think tank funded by grants from various
foundations including the German Marshall Fund and the Ford
Foundation.

turnover of 22.6 million shares.
   Analysts cited trading strategies keyed to the electric utility
holding company's impending quarterly dividend.
   Otherwise, brokers said the mood of the marketplace remained
wary and subdued. Widespread talk continued of the possibility of
further increases in interest rates, given the recent strength of
the economy and fears of reviving inflation.
   Interest rates were little changed in early activity today in

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
unchanged at 145.88. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index fell .48 to 301.33.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 12.77 to
2,007.46, bringing its loss for the week to 24.87 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 3 to 2 on the

   Saudi Arabia is drafting a new charter
for Arabian-American Oil Co., cutting its legal ties to the United
States but seeking joint ventures with the four U.S. oil companies
that formerly owned the oil giant, an oil newsletter reported.
   The Middle East Economic Survey said Monday that Aramco will
probably be called Saudi National Oil Co.-Aramco.
   Aramco is the largest oil-producing company in the non-communist
world. It is currently incorporated in Delaware.
   The restructured company will be ``the vehicle for the kingdom's
drive to establish a substantial presence in the downstream
(refining and marketing) industry overseas by means of joint
ventures with the former Aramco parents as well as with others,''
editor Ian Seymour wrote in the authoritative newsletter.
   He said the new Aramco will retain its technical and managerial
assistance contracts with the four former Aramco parents _ Exxon
Corp., Mobil Corp., Texaco Inc. and Chevron Corp. _ but not
necessarily with the same contracts or the same terms.
   There could also be scope for similar assistance agreements with
other companies, Seymour said.
   He mentioned press reports of a deal under which Saudi Arabia
would acquire 50 percent of Texaco's major refining amd marketing
assets.
   The effort to establish joint ventures in refining and marketing
in oil-consuming countries is designed to counter oil price
instability by ``providing secure outlets for Saudi crude, secure
supplies for the non-Saudi partners and good profits for both
parties,'' Seymour wrote.
   ``The presence of a foreign partner to provide local know-how in
the market concerned is regarded as an absolute prerequisite for
the Saudi newcomer,'' he said. ``The objective is to have an
integrated national oil company controlled, managed and operated by
Saudis.''
   For years Aramco, founded in 1933, controlled the production and
sale of Saudi crude oil, paying royalties to the Saudi government.
   In 1973 Saudi Arabia bought a 25 percent share in Aramco and a
year later raised its stake to 60 percent. In 1980 it acquired full
control.
   As recently as 1986, Aramco still had nearly 4,000 U.S.
employees, including many top executives.
   This year Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer was appointed chairman
and another Saudi, Ali Naimi, president since 1984, was named chief
executive.
   Seymour said the charter for the restructured Aramco was being
discussed by a ministerial committee set up by Saudi King Fahd.
   Aramco now produces around 4 million barrels of Saudi oil a day.
It refines 450,000 barrels a day at Ras Tanura on Saudi Arabia's
Gulf coast. A barrel is the equivalent of 42 gallons.
   The company markets crude through its offices at Dhahran, Saudi
Arabia, and through an international affiliate with offices in New
York, Houston and Tokyo.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Mixed To Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed to lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade but prices steadied when it
appeared soybean prices could not be pushed more than about 5 cents
lower per bushel.
   The opening drop in the soybean and corn pits was linked to
weekend rains over much of the Midwest, analysts said.
   But the rains were not heavy and the latest forecasts _ calling
for dry conditions to prevail until this weekend _ lent support to
the markets, said Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research
Department Inc.
   ``Once values were able to hold at certain levels, that was
enough to encourage a little buying,'' he said.
   Wheat futures were slightly higher in response to dry-weather
forecasts for the northern Plains states. Position-evening ahead of
Tuesday's winter wheat production report from the Agriculture
Department also helped boost prices, Karlin said.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to 2\ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $3 a bushel; corn was } cent to
1 cent lower with May at $2.01 a bushel; oats were unchanged to }
cent lower with May at $1.60\ a bushel; soybeans were 3\ cents to
4{ cents lower with May at $6.89 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .28 cent higher with June at 72.92
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .23 cent higher with
May at 80 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .50 cent higher
with June at 51.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .18 cent
lower to .18 cent higher with May at 51.82 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Friday while pork futures
retreated.

<HEAD>MHS Holdings Agrees on Mohasco Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mohasco Corp., a manufacturer and
distributor of commercial and residential furnishings, has agreed
to be taken over by MHS Holdings Corp. in a deal worth more than
$456 million, the companies said today.
   MHS, a newly organized group of investors, will submit a tender
offer by May 13 of $36.50 for each of 12.5 million shares of
Mohasco common stock, which is just over 93 percent of the
company's outstanding shares.
   The tender offer is to be followed by a merger in which each of
the remaining shares of stock will be exchanged for a new issue of
notes, which will be worth $36.50, in the opinion of the financial
advisers to both parties.
   The offer is subject to the approval of two-thirds of the
outstanding Mohasco shares and the obtaining of financing for the
transaction.
   Wall Street reacted to the announcement by sending Mohasco's

   Kleinwort Benson Ltd. said it has been negotiating
with Fuji Bank Ltd. over the past several months to sell a large
portion of Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., its
Chicago-based primary dealership.
   The proposal to sell a 24.9 percent stake has been discussed
with regulators in the United States, Japan and Britain, but a
formal application has not yet been filed, Kleinwort said in a
statement.
   Kleinwort refused to comment further, except to say a further
statement would be made ``in due course.''
   A U.S. primary dealership is a government securities firm to
which the Federal Reserve trades directly in an attempt to control
monetary policy.
   Published reports in Tokyo have said the Fed is showing
opposition to Fuji's purchase or capital participation in
Kleinworth's government securities unit.

<HEAD>Pound Surges on Rumors of Lawson's Resignation, Other Factors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British pound surged Monday in European
trading, partly on rumors that Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson was resigning. The rumors were denied later.
   The sharp rise in the British currency prompted the Bank of
England to intervene by selling pounds in the foreign-exchange
market, dealers said.
   The dollar turned mixed and gold prices rose.
   The pound was supported early in the day by a forecast from
investment bank Goldman Sachs International Corp., highlighted in
the Sunday Times, suggesting that the pound could rise to $2 and
3.20 marks.
   It was further boosted by rumors of huge sterling buy order,
dealers said. Estimates of the size of the order ranged from $500
million to $1.5 billion, and dealers said the buyer was a U.S.
investment bank, a U.S. investment management firm, or a major New
York bank.
   The British currency was given a push by rumors, later firmly
denied by the Treasury, that Lawson was resigning.
   Lawson is seen as the major government official most opposed to
allowing the pound to rise. Dealers said the Lawson rumor is
frequent usually disregarded, but that in this instance it gave the
currency an extra boost.
   The pound was quoted late in London at $1.8790, up from $1.8730
late Friday, and at 3.1606 marks, up from 3.1300 marks.
   The Bank of England intervened around midday to hold down the
pound's rise, dealers said. The bank sold pounds when the currency
broke above $1.88, dealers said.
   The French franc was strong following the resounding victory by
Francois Mitterrand in the presidential election. The dollar fell
to 5.7075 francs from 5.7230 francs.
   Other late dollar rates compared with late Friday included:
1.6820 marks, up from 1.6805; 1.4010 Swiss francs, down from
1.4015; 1.8805 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8860; 1,250.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,254.00; 1.2396 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2375.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar slipped 0.01 yen to a closing 124.87 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted slightly lower at 124.82 yen.
   Gold sold in London at a late bid price of $444.00 a troy ounce,
up from late Friday's $442.10.
   In Zurich, the late bid price was $445.00, up from $443 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 79 cents to close at a bid
$446.66.
   Silver was quoted in London at a late bid price of $6.43 a troy
ounce, up from Friday's $6.36.

<HEAD>Better Office Absorption Forecast For Next Four Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The worst is over for Houston's ailing office
market, and a long-term recovery is gaining momentum that should
increase occupancy over the next four years, researchers said.
   Most economic indicators point to a bottoming of the market in
the first half of last year, said Rice Center vice president James
P. Gaines, who oversees the organization's Houston Real Estate
Forecasting System.
   ``Since then, we've had positive absorption, positive job growth
and generally positive economic indices,'' Gaines said. ``We are
forecasting a good year for office absorption, with just over 2
million square feet absorbed in 1988.''
   By 1991 or 1992, the city should not only see marked
improvements in employment, but office absorption should increase
to between 3.7 million and 6 million square feet, Gaines said.
   If a national economic downturn occurs in late 1989 or early
1990, however, about 40 percent less space will be absorbed, Gaines
said.
   Yet even during the recession that is predicted by Rice Center's
computer models, office space absorption _ the difference between
the amount of space at the beginning of a certain period and the
amount at the end _ will remain positive, albeit less robust.
   ``Assuming that no more buildings are constructed, the overall
occupancy rate in 1992 is projected to be approximately 81 percent,
which is halfway between the current rate of 70 percent and a
`marginally healthy' rate of 90 percent,'' Gaines said. ``For Class
A office space, however, the occupancy rate is expected to be
slightly above 88 percent by 1992.''
   A Class A building is generally of a high-quality finish, is new
or competitive with new structures, and has a excellent location.
   The largest office market in terms of square footage if
Houston's central business district. Rice Center forecasts an
overall occupancy rate this year in the central district of 80.1
percent, with Class A buildings having more tenants and a better
occupancy rate of 84 percent.
   By 1992, the overall occupancy rate is projected to be 88
percent, with the occupancy level of Class A space pegged at 90
percent.
   Rice Center's Houston Real Estate Forecasting System was two
years in the making.

<HEAD>News-Gazette To Switch To Soy Ink</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette
announced Monday it will begin printing its newspaper June 1 with
ink made from soybean oil.
   Editor John Foreman said a ``commitment to the farm economy''
was the main factor in the decision to become the first Illinois
newspaper to use soy ink full time.
   ``It's an acknowledgement that we can use a product that's
produced in Champaign County and do something to boost prospects
for the east-central Illinois economy,'' Foreman said. ``If we can
do that and if enough papers do it, it's going to make a
difference.''
   The newspaper conducted a trial in March, printing its annual
farm edition with soy ink, and decided the new product worked at
least as well as conventional newspaper ink.
   The most recent estimates indicate soy ink will cost about
one-third more than conventional low-rub ink, but as the demand for
it increases, the price could decrease.
   ``It should come down as more people use it,'' said Bill
Stodola, pressroom manager at the Cedar Rapids (Iowa) Gazette.
``And with the oil situation the way it is abroad, who knows?
Someday, soy ink may end up being cheaper than petroleum ink.''
   The Cedar Rapids newspaper began using soy ink last year, and
Stodola said said the soy oil makes colors brighter and helps
prevent the ink from rubbing off on readers' hands.
   Bill Tiberend of the Land of Lincoln Soybean Association in
Bloomington praised the News-Gazette's decision. He said he would
try to persuade other newspapers to do the same.
   ``You're going to be using the soybeans that would be grown by a
farmer on about 200 acres if he had 50-bushel yields,''Tiberend
said. ``And if every daily in the state ... (the size of the
News-Gazette) changed, it would use up 15,438 acres of beans a
year.''
   Tiberend said the Land of Lincoln Soybean Association will
declare the week of June 26 as Soybean Ink Week in the state in its
efforts to get every newspaper to try the new product.

   Stock prices sagged today in a session dominated
by dividend-related trading and takeover news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 24.87 points last
week, dropped 11.44 to 1,996.02 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 9 to 5 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 499 up, 933
down and 457 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 127.43 million shares with two
hours to go.
   More than a third of that total, however, was concentrated in a
single issue _ Houston Industries, which was unchanged at 30} on
turnover of 48.4 million shares.
   Analysts cited trading strategies keyed to the electric utility
holding company's impending quarterly dividend.
   Otherwise, brokers said the mood of the marketplace remained
wary and subdued. Widespread talk continued of the possibility of
further increases in interest rates, given the recent strength of
the economy and fears of reviving inflation.
   Interest rates were mostly higher in early activity today in the
government securities market.
   Murray Ohio Manufacturing jumped 16| to 52]. The company said
its directors rejected a $48-a-share takeover offer from AB
Electrolux of Sweden.
   Mohasco gained 1{ to 35|. The company agreed to be acquired by

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange closed
lower on Monday on nervousness about the stronger pound, which
could hurt British exports and corporate profits.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 6.2
points, or 0.3 percent, lower at 1,794.9 at the close.
   The index hit a low of 7.8 points off and a high of 4.1 points
up during the session.
   Volume was a low 368 million shares, compared with Friday's
609.4 million shares.
   Participants played it cautiously after sterling began its rise
Monday on currency markets. The pound continued to gain against the
West German mark on the widespread belief that the West German
central bank won't raise short-term interest rates, throwing the
focus back onto sterling, traders said.
   Activity continued to cluster around the takeover stocks,
dealers said, although less than in previous sessions.
   ``The only feature of this market is takeover chatter, but we
didn't see that much of it,'' said one dealer.
   Market watchers said activity may pick up later in the week when
various companies are scheduled to release earnings figures.
   The Financial Times 30-share index finished off 2.1 points at
1,438.0 at the close.
   The Financial Times 500-share index fell 2.0 points to close at
1,019.49.

<TEXT>
   Diamond-Star Motors will begin production of
its new sports coupe the first week of September, two months ahead
of schedule, officials said Monday.
   Construction at the new $650 million Diamond-Star plant _ a
joint venture of Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors _ finished
several months early, the company said.
   ``We're very pleased with the progress of the plant construction
and have been able to remain ahead of schedule throughout the
start-up process,'' Diamond-Star Chairman G. Glenn Garder said in a
statement.
   The plant will build a two-door, front-wheel-drive coupe for the
1989 model year. The car will be sold at prices starting at less
than $10,000.
   Chrysler will market the vehicle as the Plymouth Laser.
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, which has 205 dealerships in the
United States, also will distribute the car but has not announced
its name.
   Eventually, the 2 million-square-foot assembly plant will
produce 240,000 cars annually and employ 2,900. Plans call for
Diamond-Star to build a compact sedan at its Normal plant beginning
in 1989.
   On March 30, Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca visited the assembly
plant and told employees the project was running about eight weeks
ahead of schedule.
   The state-of-the-art auto plant features high-technology
machinery and equipment including robotics on the final assmbly
line. Supervisors and workers have received intense training
courses, including trips to Japan to study new methods and
management techniques.
   Chrysler and Mitsubishi have exchanged parts, engines and cars
for nearly 20 years, but the Diamond-Star project marks the first
production partnership.

<TEXT>
   The number of working domestic oil and gas rigs
rose by 17 to 897 this week, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   The rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling
activity, dipped the week before by 28 to total 880. A year ago,
the count totaled 767, Baker Hughes said.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 in December 1981, the
height of the oil boom. When oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 the rig count declined
to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana gained nine rigs
this week, while Wyoming added four, Michigan, three, and Oklahoma
two.
   Kansas saw its rig activity drop by three, Colorado and New
Mexico each dropped by two and North Dakota, one.
   California, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas had neither gains nor
losses for the week.

   Soybean futures ended sharply higher Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, boosting the near-month contract to $7
a bushel for the first time since mid-1984.
   Wheat also finished higher while corn futures retreated.
   Speculative and large-fund buyers led the soybean rally, which
ran its first leg early in the session and accelerated near the
close after prices surpassed contract highs set last week, analysts
said.
   Despite weekend rains that dampened the soybean-producing areas
of the Midwest, weather forecasts provided much of the impetus for
the rally, said Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research
Department Inc.
   ``The bulls can point to the fact that rain coverage over the
weekend was pretty spotty and no additional rain is forecast until
this weekend, perhaps. And that's an important point, that
`perhaps,''' Karlin said.
   Wheat futures advanced moderately ahead of Tuesday's winter
wheat production report from the Agriculture Department, he said.
Corn retreated slightly amid a lack of export demand.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 4 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.01} a bushel; corn was \ cent to
1 cent lower with May at $2.00\ a bushel; oats were 1} cents lower
to 1} cents higher with May at $1.59\ a bushel; soybeans were 7\

   Steel production fell to 2.028 million tons in

   The industry's production amounted to 94.6 percent of capacity

   Estimated figures for the year to date showed production at
35.681 million net tons, an increase of 26.7 percent from the
28.157 million net tons in the previous year. The steel operations
of USX Corp., the nation's largest steel producer, were shut down

   Production so far this year used 90.9 percent of capacity,
compared with 72.1 percent a year earlier.
   Net tonnage by district for the week ended May 7: Northeast
Coast, 277,000; Pittsburgh, 214,000; Youngstown, 130,000; Lake

   Separately, the institute said steel shipments during the first
quarter of 1988 rose 20.8 percent to 21.006 tons, compared with
17.387 tons in the 1987 quarter.
   It was the best performance since 1981's first quarter of 23.415

   Maxtor Corp. said Monday it had built the
fastest compact disk recorder yet and would bring the data-storage
device to the market by September.
   The Tahiti I gives Maxtor an edge over other companies such as
Tandy Corp., Sony Corp., Sharp Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co.'s
Verbatim Corp. that are trying to use the laser technology of
compact disks for storing computerized information, analysts said.
   ``They have the most advanced product that's yet been
announced,'' said Robert Katzive, vice president of Disk Trend
Inc., a market research firm based in Mountain View, Calif.
   A high-capacity, erasable compact disk that works with the
Maxtor player was announced by Philips and Du Pont Optical, a joint
venture of Du Pont Co. and NV Philips of the Netherlands. Other
companies will also supply disks.
   The system was demonstrated Monday at the Comdex spring computer
trade show in Atlanta.
   Compact disks, although popular for music, have had trouble
catching on in data storage because they could not be rewritten and
it took much longer to find pieces of data stored on them.
   Maxtor said its Tahiti I, which uses 5\-inch disks, could find a
piece of data on a disk in an average of less than 30 thousandths
of a second. That makes it more than three times as fast as most
other compact disk drives and competitive with all but the fastest
magnetic hard-disk drives.
   The Tahiti I can also erase and rewrite a disk many times
without causing deterioration.
   Maxtor, based in San Jose, Calif., is a leader in the
traditional kind of data-storage devices, which use magnetic heads
instead of lasers to read and write information on disks. Compact
disks have the advantage of much greater storage capacity.
   ``The whole industry is going to watch to see if in fact they
are on time on that (September delivery date),'' Katzive said.
``But people who have discounted Maxtor in the past have eventually
regretted it.''
   Maxtor said its Tahiti I would sell wholesale for about $2,500.
A smaller and slower model, the Fiji I, uses 3{-inch disks and will
sell wholesale for under $1,000, Maxtor said.
   Maxtor said the technology for the Fiji I was jointly developed
with another company, which it did not name. Disks for that device
will be supplied by Seiko-Epson and other companies.
   More than 50 computer companies planned product announcements
during the four-day Comdex trade show that opened in Atlanta
Monday. The event will draw about 60,000 visitors to the massive
Georgia World Congress Center and the nearby Atlanta Apparel Mart,
where more than 850 manufacturers will be pushing their wares _
hard and soft.
   Attention at the show was expected to focus on clones of
International Business Machine Corp.'s Personal System-2 computer.
   Tandy Corp. and Dell Computer Corp. already have announced their
PS-2 clones, and those and others were expected to be on display.

<HEAD>RJR Nabisco Shifts Advertising Assignments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. announced Monday a consolidation
of its advertising business, shifting some major assignments from
three agencies to others who already handle much of the tobacco and
food giant's accounts.
   RJR Nabisco said it had awarded contracts for several Nabisco
cookie products to FCB-Leber Katz Partners, a division of
Chicago-based Foote, Cone & Belding Communications Inc. FCB-Leber
Katz also will split responsibility for advertising for Planters
LifeSavers products with other agencies.
   Both those accounts, estimated at about $80 million, had been
handled by Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Inc. RJR fired Saatchi recently
after the agency created a no-smoking campaign for Northwest
Airlines.
   In addition to its food business, RJR is a major cigarette maker.
   FCB-Leber Katz already handles Salem and Vantage cigarettes,
Nabisco cereals, pet snacks and Royal desserts for RJR.
   Other agencies losing business in the consolidation were
Tatham-Laird & Kudner of Chicago and Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &
Eckhardt, based in New York.
   FCB-Leber Katz was awarded the assignment of making ads for
Fleischmann's margarine and Egg Beaters, formerly assigned to
Tatham-Laird.
   The ad agency Lowe Marschalk, one of the Interpublic Group of
Companies' agencies which already has some RJR food assignments,
got Ortega Mexican foods, formerly handled by Tatham-Laird.
   Another Interpublic agency, Lintas USA, was assigned Planters
nuts and snacks, and Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy bars. Those
assignments had formerly been handled by Bozell, Jacobs.

   Top computer industry executives prefer George
Bush over Michael Dukakis or Jesse Jackson for president, according
to a poll conducted by the Gallup Organization Inc. for Computer
Systems News.
   Bush outdistanced Dukakis 80 percent to 18 percent in a
one-to-one faceoff and outpolled Jackson 93 percent to 4 percent,
the weekly newspaper reported Monday.
   The poll included responses from 100 chairmen, presidents or

   Stock prices posted their fourth straight loss
Monday in a session dominated by dividend-related trading and
takeover news.
   Analysts said fears of a continued increase in interest rates
kept the market on the defensive.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.11 to
1,997.35, extending its loss over the past four sessions to 61.01
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 5 in New
York Stock Exchange-listed trading, with 527 up, 975 down and 481
unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 166.32 million shares, up from 129.08
million in the previous session.
   Nearly one-third of Monday's total, however, was concentrated in
a single issue _ Houston Industries, which was unchanged at 30} on
turnover of 48.5 million shares. Analysts cited trading strategies
keyed to the electric utility holding company's impending quarterly
dividend.
   Otherwise, brokers said the mood of the marketplace remained
wary and subdued. Widespread talk continued of the possibility of
further increases in interest rates, given the recent strength of
the economy and fears of reviving inflation.
   Interest rates were mostly higher in the government securities
market Monday. Over the next three days, the Treasury will auction
$26 billion in new bonds and notes, and uncertainty has been
running high about what effect that new supply will have on the
credit markets.
   Murray Ohio Manufacturing jumped 18 to 53}. The company, which
makes bicycles and lawnmowers, said its directors rejected a
$48-a-share takeover offer from AB Electrolux of Sweden.
   It also issued a projection of sharply higher earnings this
year, in part because of strong mower sales.
   Toro, another producer of lawn equipment, gained 1 to 19{.
   Mohasco gained 1{ to 35|. The company agreed to be acquired by
an investor group for $36.50 a share.
   Western Publishing tumbled 3 to 19 in the over-the-counter
market. The company and Gulf & Western Industries said they had
ended merger talks.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Motors, down | at
73}; Procter & Gamble, down { at 74\; Bethlehem Steel, down } at
18|, and McDonald's, down ] at 42}.
   Japanese stocks ran into some selling following a down day in
the Tokyo market. Honda Motor dropped 5 to 141\ and Matsushita
Electrical 5\ to 215}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .60 to 145.28.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $11.90 billion, or 0.46
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 184.69 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.43 to 298.58, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.94 at 256.54.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 3.15 to 376.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 299.99, down 1.82.

   Britain's pound rose sharply Monday on unfounded
rumors the government's key advocate of currency weakness was
preparing to quit, reinforcing predictions of a $2 exchange rate
for sterling in the near future.
   Elsewhere in foreign-exchange dealings, the dollar was
relatively stable, while gold prices rose. Republic National Bank
of New York quoted bullion at $447.30 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m.
EDT, up from $443.25 late Friday.
   Money traders said action focused on the pound largely because
of rumors, later denied by the British government, that Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was about to resign.
   As the top British treasury official, Lawson is seen as an
important opponent of an expensive pound. In his view, the rising
currency could hurt Britain's economy by making exports less
competitive, similar to what happened in the United States earlier
this decade when the dollar's value rose.
   Unconfirmed rumors also circulated Monday of a large commercial
order for pounds, which forced dealers who had sold borrowed pounds
to buy them back, a price-boosting market influence known as
short-covering.
   Traders also were influenced by a forecast from the investment
bank Goldman Sachs International Corp., quoted in the Sunday Times,
suggesting that the pound could rise to $2 and 3.20 West German
marks. The pound is now worth about 3.16 marks.
   With the dollar's recent stability, the market has become
preoccupied with the pound because of the relatively high interest
rates offered in Britain, which make that currency more attractive
to foreign investors.
   ``If I tell you exchange rates will be relatively stable, then
what do you want to do with your wealth? Throw it to the country
with the highest interest rates,'' said Varick Martin, vice
president of foreign exchange at the Union Bank of Switzerland's
New York branch.
   In London, the pound rose to $1.8790, up from $1.8730 late
Friday. Later in New York, the pound was worth $1.8815, vs. $1.8630
late Friday.
   Arthur Liming, a currency analyst at the commodities futures
firm LNS Financial Group in Chicago, said many traders believed the
pound would hit $1.92 in the near future.
   Zlatko Glamuzina, a trader at the New York branch of Banco di
Sicilia, said he believed the pound would rise significantly after
it passes $1.90. ``Once we go over that we'll go to $2 a pound,''
he said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar slipped 0.01 yen to close at 124.87 yen.
Later in London, it fetched 124.82 yen. By the time trading
concluded in New York, the dollar fetched 124.80 yen, lower than
the London price but slightly higher than the Friday closing price
in New York of 124.77 yen.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with levels late
Friday included: 1.6815 marks, up from 1.6793; 1.4000 Swiss francs,
up from 1.3995; 1.2385 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2373; 5.7060
French francs, down from 5.7090; and 1,249.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,252.375.
   Late dollar rates in London compared with late Friday: 1.6820
marks, up from 1.6805; 1.4010 Swiss francs, down from 1.4015;
1.8805 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8860; 1,250.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,254.00; 1.2396 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2375; 5.7075
French francs, down from 5.7230.
   Gold sold in London at a late bid price of $444.00 a troy ounce,
up from $442.10 late Friday. In Zurich, the late bid price was
$445.00 an ounce, vs. $443 late Friday, and in Hong Kong it was
$446.66 an ounce vs. $445.87.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery was quoted at $447.30, up $3.60 from Friday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a late bid price of $6.43 a troy
ounce, up from $6.36 Friday. The New York Comex price was $6.47 an
ounce, up 8.9 cents.

<HEAD>Fears About South Africa Boost Precious Metals Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures prices rallied Monday on fears that
South Africa would react to further U.S. economic sanctions by
reducing its exports of platinum and gold, analysts said.
   On other markets, copper futures also posted sharp gains;
soybeans surged to four-year highs while the grains were mixed;
cotton futures rallied strongly; livestock and meat were mixed;
energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Platinum futures led the precious-metals rally, which analysts
linked to rumors that passage of a bill in Congress to tighten the
economic screws on South Africa would be met with a retaliatory
decrease in exports of strategic metals to the United States.
   John Norris, chief metals trader for Citibank in New York, said
the rumored retaliation would be ``a tit-for-tat type thing, where
if we would tighten sanctions, South Africa would cut off platinum
supplies. And any time you have some concerns about South Africa,
it benefits gold, too.''
   Platinum settled $12.90 to $13.10 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for delivery in July at
$539.50 a troy ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $3.50 to
$4.10 higher with June at $448.80 a troy ounce; silver was 8.9
cents to 9.2 cents higher with May at $6.47 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures rallied to their highest levels in about four
weeks on the Commodity Exchange in reaction to a report showing a
drop in warehouse supplies at the London Metal Exchange, analysts
said.
   Copper settled 60 cents to $2.80 higher with May at $1.0065 a
pound.
   Soybean futures surged near the close on the Chicago Board of
Trade, boosting the near-month contract to $7 a bushel for the
first time since mid-1984. Wheat also finished higher while corn
futures retreated.
   Despite weekend rains that dampened the Midwest, dry-weather
fears provided much of the impetus for the soybean rally, said Joel
Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research Department Inc.
   Wheat futures advanced moderately ahead of Tuesday's
winter-wheat production report from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Karlin said. Corn retreated slightly amid a lack of
export demand.
   The USDA reported after Monday's close that soybean planting in
the 19 major soybean states was 14 percent complete as of Sunday.
Corn planting in the 17 major corn states was 70 percent finished,
the report said.
   Wheat settled 2} cents to 4 cents higher with May at $3.01} a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent lower with May at $2.00\ a
bushel; oats were 1} cents lower to 1} cents higher with May at
$1.59\ a bushel; soybeans were 7\ cents to 9{ cents higher with May
at $7 a bushel.
   Dry-weather fears also sparked a rally in cotton futures on the
New York Cotton Exchange, said Ernest Simon, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Cotton settled 1.42 cents to 1.74 cents higher with July at
63.15 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
as traders sold the deferred-month contracts and bought contracts
for near-term delivery, analysts said.
   Hog futures settled higher on technical factors while pork
bellies were lower on fears of a continuing glut of bellies in cold
storage.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June
at 72.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .35
cent higher with May at 80.05 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to
.70 cent higher with June at 51.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .25 cent to 1 cent lower with May at 51.55 cents a
pound.
   Energy futures were mixed in featureless trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 20 cents
lower with June at $17.54 a barrel; heating oil was .50 cent lower
to .25 cent higher with June at 47.67 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .07 cent to .25 cent higher with June at 51.59 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated modestly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 1.05 points lower at 257.10.

   Gulf & Western Inc. and Western Publishing Group
Inc. said Monday they had ended talks about a possible takeover of
Western Publishing, a children's book publisher and commercial
printer.
   Western Publishing's stock tumbled after the announcement,
closing down $3 a share to $19 in over-the-counter trading. Gulf &
Western was off 50 cents a share at $36.87{ on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   In a statement, the companies said they had ``mutually agreed to
terminate their preliminary discussions with respect to the
possible acquisition of Western Publishing by Gulf & Western.''
   The statement provided no reason for the decision. A spokesmen
for Gulf & Western declined to elaborate, while a spokesman for
Western Publishing failed to return three telephone calls.
   Western, which publishes the Golden Book children's series, had
indicated two weeks ago that it was in talks about a possible
merger. Last week, it identified Gulf & Western as the other party
in the talks.
   But in doing so, both companies noted there were a number of
unresolved issues and there were no assurances that an agreement
would be reached.
   Western Publishing has about 20 million shares of common stock
outstanding.
   In addition to its Golden Book series for children, Western has
an extensive distibution system for its books, puzzles, games and
crayons and is a major commercial printer.
   Gulf & Western, which has extensive interests in entertainment
and financial servicves, has spent heavily to expand its publishing
business in recent years. It owns Simon & Schuster, which publishes
books for mass circulation, and Prentice-Hall Inc., an educational
and professional publisher.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co., which earned industry-record
profits in 1987 and in the first quarter of 1988, is hiring new
workers for the first time since the layoffs of the early 1980s, a
trade journal reported Monday.
   In addition, Ford is using hiring techniques learned from
foreign automakers who have U.S. factories _ methods that include
intense testing, screening and interviewing, Automotive News
reported.
   The so-called transplants _ Mazda Motor Co., Nissan Motor Corp.,
Toyota Motor Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. factories in the
United States _ take as many as 100,000 applications to fill 2,000
openings.
   Ford, which laid off about 69,000 workers at the beginning of
the decade, has only about 2,000 remaining on indefinite layoff.
The others were recalled or dropped off the recall rolls after
several years.
   ``In recent months we have in certain locations been able to
hire new people because even these 2,000 people with recall rights
are limited by certain restrictions to plants in their area,'' Ford
spokesman Tom Foote told The Associated Press.
   ``It's on a small scale, just a smattering here and there,'' he
said. ``It's been going on for a few months.''
   The latest hiring process takes about a month, a big change from
practices of the past, when a worker hired Friday was put on the
assembly line Monday. New workers are put up in a hotel and given a
week of orientation by the company and the union.
   William Novotny, time standards representative at United Auto
Workers Local 879 at Ford's Twin Cities truck plant in St. Paul,
Minn., said it represents ``a totally new way of hiring.''
   At the Twin Cities plant, about 50 workers will be chosen from
among 2,000 applicants, Novotny said. About 150 workers already
have been hired at the plant, most of whom have never worked in an
auto plant, said Local 879 Chairman Doug Knight.
   The new workers include former teachers and members of the
military.
   Some of the applicants not selected were children of current
workers who failed drug tests, Novotny said. Drug use is one of the
biggest problems in auto plants, although few union officials want
to discuss it publicly.
   ``That has caused some heartbreak,'' Novotny said, ``but it will
make a better work place in the long run.''
   In addition to Twin Cities, Ford also has been hiring at its
Wixom assembly plant, which builds the Lincoln Town Car and
Continental, at its Climate Control Division plant in Plymouth, and
at its Plastic Products Division plant in Milan. Those three plants
are outside Detroit.
   The hiring has been prompted by new UAW contract rules that
allow workers who took jobs at other plants to return to their home
plants as openings occur. When they leave, Ford often has to hire
new workers to replace them.
   By comparison, General Motors Corp., the nation's largest
automaker, is doing no new hiring because it still has 60,000
workers on indefinite layoff and is shrinking some of its
operations.
   Chrysler Corp. has at least 8,000 workers on indefinite layoff.

   Lucky Stores Inc. said Monday it has
provided confidential information to rival American Stores Inc. in
exchange for an agreement that it will sweeten or end its hostile
takeover bid by May 17.
   Lucky said it continues to recommend that its shareholders
accept the leveraged buyout offer of $61 a share, or $2.35 billion,
made on April 28 by the New York investment firm Gibbons, Green,
van Amerongen Ltd.
   But analysts said Salt Lake City-based American Stores remains a
strong contender under the new agreement, which Lucky said also
provides a number of protections to its stockholders.
   ``My continuing belief is that American Stores will acquire
Lucky,'' said Edward Comeau of Wood Gundy Corp. in New York. ``From
the beginning, it was apparent that American badly wanted Lucky,
needed Lucky and can afford to pay more for it than anyone else.''
   Lucky closed down 37.5 cents a share at $61.37{ on the New York
Stock Exchange. American Stores stock fell 50 cents a share to
$59.75.
   American Stores, which initiated the bidding with a $45-a-share
offer that Lucky rejected in March, is the owner of the Alpha Beta
grocery chain. With an acquisition of Lucky, the nation's
sixth-largest supermarket chain, American Stores would surpass No.
1 Kroger Co. of Cincinnati to become the industry leader.
   The Lucky transaction would be by far the biggest ever for the
Gibbons-led buyout group, which specializes in leveraged buyouts.
If Lucky breaks the merger agreement, the New York investment firm
must be paid a $20 million fee plus expenses.
   Comeau said a supermarket chain can afford to pay more than
anyone making a leveraged buyout.
   ``When you put supermarket chains together, one plus one equals
three'' because of ``synergistic and strategic benefits,'' he said.
   Ron Rotter, an analyst with Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy and
Gardner in Los Angeles, said he would not be surprised if American
Stores makes a new offer even though the pending bid is fairly
valued.
   ``If this operation is worth $61 to an independent party, it
should be worth more to American Stores, which could reap many
benefits by integrating Lucky's operations into their operations,''
Rotter said.

   International Business Machines Corp. said
Monday it had produced the first fully functioning computer chips
to have features measuring just a half micron across.
   The microscopically compact chips were made for the Defense
Department by IBM's Federal Systems facility in Manassas, Va., the
company said. They will be used for such things as capturing and
processing radar and sonar signals.
   ``This is a significant technological milestone for IBM and the
U.S. Department of Defense,'' William Gianopulos, laboratory
director of IBM in Manassas, said in a news release.
   ``IBM is leading the pack,'' Sonny Maynard, the director of the
Defense Department's Very High Speed Integrated Circuit program,
said in the release.
   Honeywell Inc. and TRW Inc., the other two companies that have
defense contracts to develop half-micron chips, have not completed
theirs yet. TRW spokesman Timothy Dolan said the company was on
schedule toward a September 1989 deadline on its self-healing
``super chip,'' which will have about 4 million transistors,
compared to about 100,000 for IBM's chip.
   Honeywell spokeswoman Susan Eich said her company was also on
schedule.
   Compact chips run faster because the electricity has less
distance to travel. A micron is one-millionth of a meter, or about
one-hundredth the thickness of a sheet of typing paper.
   IBM's contract with the Pentagon restricts how IBM can use the
half-micron technology for its commercial products, spokesman Mark
Root said.
   Chip companies such as Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. are planning new fabrication lines for half-micron chips,
according to Scott Hudson, a market research analyst for Integrated
Circuit Engineering Corp. in Scottsdale, Ariz.
   ``This is what all the semiconductor makers are shooting for,''
Hudson said.

   Chrysler Corp. announced a buyer incentive
campaign on Monday, offering rebates of up to $1,500 on several
models and cut-rate financing.
   Chrysler has used aggressive incentive campaigns and pricing
strategies throughout the year in an attempt to increase its sales.
   The incentives announced Monday include $400 rebates on the 1987
and 1988 Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries, the K-cars which already
are being marketed as low-priced America series models.
   Instead of rebates, buyers may choose financing ranging from 5.8
percent annually on 48-month loans and 9.8 percent on 60-month
loans. On Eagle Premier, Chrysler offered 8.8 percent financing for
up to 72 months.
   Chrysler is offering a $500 rebate on 1987 and 1988 Plymouth
Sundance-Dodge Shadow subcompacts, imported Dodge and Plymouth Colt
subcompacts and the sporty Dodge Daytona.
   Trucks covered by the $500 rebate include the 1987 and 1988
imported two-wheel-drive Ram 50 compact pickup, imported Dodge
Raider sport-utility vehicle, Dodge Dakota mid-size pickup,
standard Ram B150, 250 and 350 vans and wagons, Jeep Wagoneer,
two-door Jeep Cherokee, and two-wheel-drive short-bed Jeep Comanche
pickup.
   Chrysler is offering a $750 rebate on the 1988 Eagle Premier
sedan and on 1987 and 1988 cars including Dodge Lancer-Chrysler
LeBaron GTS and the imported Dodge and Plymouth Colt Vista.
   On trucks, buyers can get a $750 rebate on 1987 and 1988
four-wheel-drive Ram 50, two-wheel-drive long-bed Jeep Comanche and
the four-wheel-drive Comanche.
   Rebates of $1,000 are available on 1988 Eagle Medallion compact
and 1987 and 1988 Chrysler LeBaron coupe, except for convertible
models, 1988 Dodge Daytona Shelby Z, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and
standard Ram 100, 150, 250 and 350 pickups.
   Chrysler is offering $1,500 rebates on 1987 and 1988 Dodge
Daytona Pacifica and Chrysler Conquest.

<HEAD>Top Black Companies Are Restructuring to Compete, Survey Says</HEAD>

   The nation's largest black-owned companies are
restructuring to face competition and an uncertain economy,
according to a new survey released Monday by Black Enterprise
magazine.
   The magazine's latest annual survey of the top 100 black
industrial and service companies shows that, like many U.S.
companies in general, leading black businesses are exploring new
approaches in order to be competitive.
   Many black companies have grown recently through mergers and
acquisitions, joint ventures, new technology and marketing
approaches, and branching out into new industries, said the survey
in the magazine's June issue.
   Taken together, the top 100 companies ranked in the survey had
gross revenues of $4.1 billion in 1987. All but one of them are
privately owned.
   The competition was fierce enough last year to force into
bankruptcy three companies formerly on the list: United Chem-Con,
an electronics manufacturer and defense contractor; hair-care
products maker American Beauty Products; and oil products
distributor J.R. Son Inc.
   The survey points to black-owned computer and information
services companies, construction firms, hair-care products makers
and car dealerships as especially successful categories.
   The biggest and fastest-growing black company is TLC Beatrice
International Holdings Inc., a food manufacturer and distributor
formed from the $985 million leveraged buyout of Beatrice
International. In a leveraged buyout, the acquirer finances the
purchase of the target company with sales of its assets or the cash
flow of the target company.
   New York-based TLC Beatrice, headed by Wall Street attorney
Reginald F. Lewis, was the first black company to make more than $1
billion in annual sales and reported revenue of $1.8 billion in
1987. The company's 61 businesses include Butterball turkeys and
Good Humor ice cream.
   The buyout of Beatrice ``places Lewis on the cutting edge of
corporate finance and gives him access to Europe, Latin America and
Asia, three of the world's fastest-growing markets,'' the Black
Enterprise survey says.
   Other black entrepreneurs _ such as Gary L. White of Trans Jones
Inc.-Jones Transfer Co. and C. Everett Wallace of City & Suburban
Distributors Inc. _ have used leveraged buyouts to propel their
companies into the top 100.
   The second-ranked company on the list, Johnson Publishing Co.
Inc., saw its growth boosted by its cosmetics and hair-care
products and its syndicated television show, according to the
report.
   The Chicago-based company, which had $201.6 million in sales
last year, markets Fashion Fair products and publishes Ebony, Jet
and Ebony Man.
   Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Inc., No. 3 on the list, has
grown by purchasing several profitable companies and bottling
franchises through joint ventures with other black businesses. The
company rang up 1987 sales of $166 million.
   Construction firm H.J. Russell & Co. continues to show its
strength in competitive bidding for contracts and has aggressively
branched out into real estate development with Gibraltar Land Inc.,
the survey says. Fourth-ranked Russell, based in Atlanta, posted
sales of $141.9 million.
   No. 5 Motown Industries has sought to restructure its
operations, infusing $38 million into its records subsidiary for
the development and promotion of new artists. Los Angeles-based
Motown managed to record $100 million in sales last year.
   Hair-care maker Johnson Products Co. Inc., the only publicly
held company on the list at No. 19, was hit hardest by the stock
market collapse on Oct. 19: its stock dropped from $4 a share to
just under $3. The Chicago-based company, like other black
hair-care specialists, continues to battle white-owned giants like
Alberto-Culver and Revlon for market share.
   Johnson Products' 1987 sales were $33.9 million.
