   Seven past or present detectives went on trial
Thursday on charges of extorting money and favors from nightclubs
and restaurants, with the defense arguing they did little more than
accept gifts from friends.
   In return for the alleged payoffs, the officers are accused of
having fixed citations, overlooked violations, protected
establishments from inspections and and received money for details
that were never performed.
   Prosecutor Diane Kottmyer, in opening arguments in U.S. District
Court, called the detectives greedy and shameless in their
shakedowns and were almost flamboyant in the favors they provided
for powerful friends.
   Kottmyer said former Detective Thomas J. Connolly arranged for
employees of Cafe Budapest to be taken to make their nightly bank
deposits in police vehicles free of charge.
   In return, Kottmyer said, Connolly dined with friends at Cafe
Budapest and ``at the conclusion of his meal, no bill would be
paid.'' Connolly ``would be seen just strolling out of the
restaurant,'' she said.
   Attorney Robert Muse, representing retired Detective Francis X.
Sheehan, described his client as a ``damn fine cop'' whose
``deeply-rooted'' friendships with some club owners resulted in
gifts, not payoffs.
   The detectives are charged with 50 counts of conspiracy, bribery
and extortion. They are accused of extorting favors and $18,000 in
money from 1975 to 1986.
   Besides Sheehan and Connolly, the defendants are former
Detectives John E. Carey and Peter Boylan and Detectives John F.
McCormick, Kenneth J. Nave and Matthew A. Kilroe.

   Gil Evans, composer and arranger, who died
earlier this year, at 75, did not remain stuck in the past. His
17-piece band, kept together by his son Miles Evans, played at the
JVC Jazz Festival in Kaufman Hall at the 92nd Street Y and sounded
as modern and exciting as something put together by a young leader.
   The set on Wednesday night was unpredictable and loose, with
much passing the word about the next number. If anybody wanted to
watch something besides musicians play _ rock concerts show videos
now _ there were high hand signals from first trumpeter Lew Soloff
about coming in in unison.
   The guitarist, who usually stood in front of the band, climbed
the bleachers which held musicians' chairs to boogie during other
people's solos. While he sang a coolly confident ``Moon Dance,''
there was some smiling and laughing behind him, presumably at his
expense.
   The first, 25-minute number began with as much cacophany as
though everybody was tuning up, became so loud the sound echoed
back from the hall's walls, held a beat that could be danced to in
a disco, went into a long alto saxophone solo, then a brief French
horn solo, both tasty, and tapered gradually to an ending. It held
interest throughout, as did the whole set.
   There were exciting tenor saxophone, trombone and trumpet solos,
loud and soft. The electric bassist improvised ``The Star Spangled
Banner.''
   No tunes or musicians were introduced.
   The first half of the evening was played by the Courtney Pine
Quartet from Great Britain. Pine, who played soprano and tenor
saxophone, began with a shower of notes and no melodic line. Then
he played a noisy, exhilarating, swinging ``Come Back to Me,''
which was another shower of notes.
   Just when one thought that was his only style, he played a
tender, melodic ``Misty.'' When he improvised on that, the
departure from the tune became another pleasing melody. Julian
Joseph took a ruminating piano solo then turned it back to Pine,
who found some quarter tones between tones.
   The final tune was ``Zaire.'' Our only criticism is that pieces
would find an ending then meander for a bit before the music
stopped.
   In general, it's an emphatic group and one we'd like to hear
again.

   Teamsters union President Jackie Presser,
battling cancer, was described as alert and breathing on his own as
he underwent tests in a hospital's cardiac care unit.
   Presser, 61, was listed in serious condition Wednesday night at
Lakewood Hospital in suburban Cleveland, said hospital spokesman
David Hopcraft. He was admitted Tuesday after complaining of
weakness and dizziness.
   ``Further treatment will be determined after the conclusion and
interpretation of the tests,'' Hopcraft said. Presser has been able
to communicate with doctors, nurses and his family, the spokesman
said.
   Presser had a brain tumor removed May 17 at the Barrow
Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Ariz., and later was treated for
a smaller tumor affecting his pituitary gland.
   Three weeks ago, a federal judge, citing Presser's health,
delayed the union leader's July 12 embezzlement and racketeering
trial in U.S. District Court here.
   The charges allege that Presser took $700,000 from his Cleveland
local's union office and paid it to ``ghost'' employees who
performed no work.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is
believed to be paving the way to resign as Panama's military
commander in possible preparation for a presidential campaign,
according to sources here.
   Noriega, the de facto ruler of the country as chief of the
Defense Forces, never has denied he wouldn't mind being president.
   The reports circulating here are that Noriega could step down as
early as August.
   But first, these reports say, he wants to make sure he leaves
someone he can trust in charge of the military.
   The new military chief likely would come from the group of young
officers Noriega has rallied around him after purging several older
members of the military high command.
   The purge swept away those involved in an attempted coup March
16 as well as any others who Noriega believes were at least hoping
it would succeed.
   Noriega has survived economic sanctions by the Reagan
administration and feeble attempts by a U.S.-supported local
opposition to overthrow him.
   In August, Noriega will have served 25 years in the military,
generally the mandatory time for retirement but it can be extended
to 28 years. His official biography lists him as being 50 years
old, although his high school yearbook indicates he might be 54.
   Some of his closest political allies in the government's
Revolutionary Democratic Party are already calling him the
``logical candidate'' for presidential elections in May, 1989, and
are pushing for removal of some of the older leaders who may not go
along with a Noriega candidacy.
   Panamanian sources point to Aquilino Sieiro, Noriega's
brother-in-law, as the the most-likely successor, to ensure the
Defense Forces remain loyal to the general.
   The Defense Forces number about 15,000 personnel with absolute
military and police powers.
   They are a tightly knit and closed-mouth group and even general
information about high-ranking officers is withheld _ ``because our
officers are too modest,'' according to a bureaucrat.
   According to the scenario discussed here, Sieiro will become
commander of the Defense Forces sometime in August.
   Sieiro was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel in April
and, the sources said, will be made a full colonel in July.
   Sieiro's sister Felicidad is married to Noriega. His brother
Ramon Sieiro is president of Labor Party, which is part of the
pro-governemnt political alliance.
   Sieiro, believed to be in his late 30s, is now a member of the
military high command. He has been coordinator of joint maneuvers
with the U.S. military and was traffic director and chief of the
Colon Military District, the second most important after Panama
City.
   At one time he commanded the Battalion 2000, an elite force
named after the year Panama is due to take over full control of the
Panama Canal under the 1977 treaties with the United States.
   Sieiro has a brother, Manuel, who, sources said, also is
scheduled to be promoted to lieutenant colonel in August.
   The two Sieiro brothers and Lt. Col. Nivaldo Madrinan are among
Noriega's most trusted associates. Madrinan, director of the
powerful National Investigation Department was promoted to his
present rank in April.
   Another officer believed to be a close ally is Maj. Luis Del
Cid, commander of the Chiriqui Military District.
   The military high command was practically dismantled when
Noriega frustrated the March coup led by the police chief, Col.
Leonidas Macias.
   Seven lieutenant colonels and colonels have been dismissed or
retired since. Others are scheduled to retire in August, including
Col. Marcos Justines, chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Noriega has surrounded himself with 20 younger officers grouped
under what was called the Strategic Military Council that meets
with him regularly to discuss national problems and propose
solutions.
   The group includes the commanders of the air force and the two
largest military districts as well as the chiefs of police and
other key military officers.
   Most prominent among them are Lt. Col. Hilario Trujillo, chief
of the air force; Maj. Pascual Gonzalez, chief of civil
aeronautics; Maj. Armando Palacio Gondola, chief of San Miguelito's
military district; Maj. Francisco Porras, director of the Officers'
School; as well as Madrinan, Lt. Col. Aristides Hassn, the
inspector general, and Lt. Col. Moises Correa, the personnel
director.
   Noriega and the United States have been at odds since February,
when two federal grand juries in Florida indicted the general on
drug trafficking charges.
   He ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, still recognized by
Washington as Panama's leader, on Feb. 26 after the president tried
to fire Noriega.

   Like millions of other Soviets touched by the
terror of Josef Stalin, Dmitri A. Volkogonov still remembers the
day his father disappeared.
   More than 50 years later, that personal tragedy is foremost in
Volkogonov's mind as he finishes the first comprehensive Soviet
biography of Stalin, the man he blames for the death of his father
and those of millions of others.
   Volkogonov, a military historian, said he has spent 10 years
culling Soviet archives and talking to people who knew Stalin for a
two-volume biography, ``Triumph and Tragedy,'' scheduled to appear
next year.
   There is no thorough Soviet biography of Stalin, who killed
millions of people through his forced collectivizaton of
agriculture that began in 1929 and the political purges that
followed in the next decade.
   Volkogonov told reporters Wednesday his book will give an
unofficial estimate of the number killed, but he declined to reveal
what it was.
   As director of the Defense Ministry's Institute of Military
History and earlier as deputy chief of the Defense Ministry's
political directorate Volkogonov, a colonel-general, has had
unusual access to long-suppressed official information about Stalin.
   ``Nobody in this country has as many documents on this man as I
do,'' said Volkogonov, wearing an army uniform emblazoned with rows
of multicolored military decorations.
   The documents, as well as interviews with people who knew him,
show Stalin to be ``one of the most terrible figures in mankind,''
said Volkogonov.
   ``My father was a direct victim of Stalin's purges,'' the
historian said. ``He was an agronomist, and somebody didn't like
him. Once he was summoned to a certain meeting, and he never
returned. He was 36 years old.''
   That was 1937, when Volkogonov was 8 years old.
   Volkogonov said the disappearance of his father haunted him for
years.
   ``When I was already an old man, people would deal with me with
suspicion because I was the son of an `enemy of the people,''' he
recalled, referring to the label Stalin used to brand those he
considered his opponents.
   Volkogonov is among those tapped to correct the record as the
country's reform-minded leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, tries to
re-examine the whitewashing of Stalin's crimes in history books and
the official press.
   The issue is at the forefront this week as the party holds its
first nationwide conference since the last one Stalin called in
1941. Volkogonov is a delegate to the conference, which is
reviewing proposals to correct ``deformations'' Stalin caused in
the party and society.
   Nikita S. Khrushchev was the first Soviet leader to shake the
world with the enormity of Stalin's crimes in 1956. His charges
against Stalin were made in secret to a party congress and
disclosed only unofficially.
   More than 31 years later, at a public forum Nov. 2 marking the
70th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, Gorbachev accused
Stalin of ``enormous and unforgiveable'' crimes and dismissed any
notion that the former dictator didn't know about those who died
because of his excesses.
   Gorbachev's criticism sparked a wave of Soviet press reports,
including ones by Volkogonov, about Stalin's crimes. Writing in
December in the literary weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta, Volkogonov
said Stalin's repressions were a result of ``the tragic triumph of
evil force. And who knows: was there, together with cruelty, a
never-recognized spiritual illness of Stalin?''
   Last week, the party newspaper Pravda published excerpts from
Volkogonov's biography in which the author denounced the dictator
for signing a friendship treaty with Nazi Germany and crippling his
own army by purging its officer corps before World War II.
   Some conservatives have suggested Stalin was not aware of the
extent of repression under him. But at a news conference Wednesday,
Volkogonov said he had found evidence to the contrary.
   ``There were personal orders about terrorism and the elimination
of people,'' he said. ``But there was also inertia which he caused.
He couldn't predict what the volume of this inertia would be.''
   In several cases, Volkogonov said, he found papers accusing
people of crimes and Stalin's writing in the margins that he agreed
with the charges.
   Asked if he agreed with Western historians that Stalin was
behind the assassinations of political rivals Sergei Kirov in 1934
and Leon Trotsky in Mexico in 1937, Volkogonov said he found no
evidence Stalin directly ordered the killings, but that he had made
it clear his aides were to ``remove all potential opposition.''

<HEAD>Polls Suggest Bush Closing The Gap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One new poll suggests Vice President George Bush
is running neck-and-neck with Gov. Michael Dukakis, while another
survey indicates the Republican nominee-to-be is only slightly
behind his Democratic rival.
   The new results contrast with a series of surveys in recent
weeks indicating Bush trailed Dukakis in double digits.
   A telephone survey of 1,013 adults last week by ABC News and
Money Magazine, released Wednesday, found 45 percent support for
Dukakis and 42 percent for Bush. That amounts to a tie, given the
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   And a Gallup poll of 1,210 voters, also out Wednesday, suggested
Dukakis had the support of 46 percent, to 41 percent for Bush. The
margin of error was 3 percentage points.
   By contrast, Gallup, NBC News-Wall Street Journal and Washington
Post polls conducted since June 9 have found double-digit leads for
Dukakis. The Post survey, done June 15-19, found a 51-39 percent
Dukakis margin.
   The ABC-Money Magazine poll, conducted June 22-25, found support
for Dukakis down 7 points from an ABC-Post poll in mid-May that
used the same methodology. Bush rose only from 41 to 42 percent
support; those who didn't know grew from 2 percent to 6 percent.
The rest said they wouldn't vote or would support someone else.
   Poll analysts have said they expected the race to tighten as
Dukakis came off the crest of his Democratic primary victories. A
Harris survey early this month found a dead heat _ 49-44, with a
3-point margin of error _ and a USA Today-CNN poll gave Dukakis a
single-digit lead.
   The ABC-Money Magazine poll had Dukakis leading among women,
respondents earning less than $25,000 a year and adults aged 35 to
54. Bush led among men, respondents earning more than $50,000 and
those in the 55-64 age group.

   A jury Wednesday convicted of woman of
gouging out a teen-ager's eye with her finger during an exorcism a
year ago.
   The jury took 20 minutes to find 26-year-old Andrea Cowan guilty
of cruelty to a juvenile, Darnell Washington, now 17.
   The former state clerical worker who told police she conducted
at least six exorcisms at her Baptist church could receive up to 10
years in prison at sentencing Sept. 9.
   According to testimony, a houseful of people prayed for
Washington as he writhed on the floor, spitting, foaming at the
mouth and speaking in strange voices.
   Cowan, her husband and her brother-in-law, a Baptist pastor,
were summoned to help rid the boy of the supposed demons after he
uttered what he said were ``vile things ... against God.''
   Washington, who now has a glass eye, testified that he
remembered everyone praying over him, then being alone in the
living room with Cowan as she beat on the back of his head, bit his
ear and ``plucked my eye.''
   Defense attorney John Calmes had argued that Washington was in a
psychotic state and plucked his own eye out.
   Ms. Cowan ``prayed on him, she laid hands on him and that's all
she did,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Labor Committee Clears Minimum Wage Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats are poised to act on
compromise legislation to increase the federal minimum wage of
$3.35 per hour by $1.20 over the next three years.
   The task will not be easy, though, if Republicans are able to
anything about it.
   The Senate Labor Committee voted 11-5 Wednesday to approve
legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $4.55 per hour by
1991.
   But floor action on the bill is not expected until after the
Democratic National Convention, which takes place the week of July
17. The House Labor Committee passed a wage increase in March.
   Senate Labor Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
sponsor of the compromise, said the panel's vote ``brings us a
major step closer to our goal of raising the minimum wage for the
first time since 1981.''
   Five million men and women will gain by the increase ``and they
deserve it,'' Kennedy said. ``They're the working poor. They'd
rather work than live on welfare, and they deserve a living wage.
   ``For 50 years, the minimum wage has been a promise by America
that if you work for a living, you won't have to live in poverty.
Reaganomics broke that promise and it's time for Congress to fix
it.''
   Kennedy did not waste time in getting the committee vote to send
the measure to the floor. As soon as a quorum was formed at a
hastily-called meeting in the Capitol, the vote was taken.
   Although Republicans indicated a week ago that they would offer
amendments in committee, none was introduced.
   ``There was no reason to take on those issues in committee,''
said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah. ``There will be amendments when
the bill gets to the floor. I am sure we can conjure up some.''
   He predicted that floor action ``will be a donnybrook. There is
a lot of irritation on this bill. They (Democrats) haven't had the
intestinal fortitude to bring up the bill before now.''
   Hatch said the increase in the minimum wage ``could cost up to a
million jobs, especially those that need them - black youths and
(Hispanic) youths. We just can't write them off.''
   Republicans in both the House and Senate are expected to offer
amendments that would cap the increase at $4 an hour, provide a
training wage and exempt all small companies from the wage
requirement.
   The 11-5 committee vote was mainly along party lines, with
Republicans Robert T. Stafford of Vermont and Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
of Connecticut joining the nine-Democrat majority.
   The Kennedy compromise was worked out between Democratic
congressional leaders and organized labor after it became clear
that the initial proposal approved by the House Labor Committee was
going nowhere.
   The Kennedy bill would raise the current $3.35 an hour minimum
wage to $3.75 in 1989, $4.15 in 1990 and $4.55 in 1991.
   The exemption for small businesses would be raised to cover
companies with annual sales of $500,000 or less. The exemption
currently applies to companies with sales of $362,000 or less.
   In addition, the bill would increase the so-called tip credit
for restaurant workers from 40 percent to 50 percent by Jan. 1,
1990.
   Employers are currently allowed to count 40 percent of an
employee's tips toward payment of the minimum wage.
   Kennedy and Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Labor Committee, initially sponsored legislation that would
have raised the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour over a three-year
period, then ``index'' all future increases by tying them to the
inflation rate.
   Opposition to the indexing provision by a number of Democrats on
the House committee forced the leadership to abandon it before the
bill could get out of subcommittee. In place of indexing, the House
committee voted to increase the minimum wage to $5.05 over four
years.
   When the bill reaches the House floor, after the Senate acts,
Reps. Tommy Robinson, D-Ark., and Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa., will
substitute the Kennedy version of $4.55 an hour for the one passed
by the House committee.

<TEXT>
   By declining to disavow recent
bombings of civilian targets, the African National Congress has
provided the government with fresh ammunition for its campaign to
brand the guerrillas as terrorists.
   The attacks, and the prospect of retaliation by the state,
prompted the country's only daily newspaper for blacks, The
Sowetan, to plead: ``This descent into hell must be stopped.''
   Last week, a mine shattered the interior of a seaside
restaurant, moments after nearly 100 diners were evacuated. Two
days earlier, a blast in a video game arcade injured 10 people,
including a 20-year-old mixed-race woman pregnant with twins who
failed to survive an emergency delivery.
   Seven civilians, six of them black, died in two bombings earlier
this year, part of the most sustained campaign of attacks yet on
civilian targets.
   The ANC's hierarchy in exile has not claimed responsibility for
specific attacks but it has not repudiated them. ANC officials, in
recent interviews in Lusaka, Zambia, said they sought to escalate
urban violence in hopes of undermining white morale.
   South Africa's white authorities have responded predictably to
recent bombings, vowing to use an ``iron fist'' against the
guerrillas and urging Western countries to shun the ANC.
   In addition, the attacks have provoked outrage from white
commentators who normally differ with the government. White
liberals who advocate unconditional negotiations with the ANC are
on the defensive.
   ``It is impossible to imagine two more innocent victims than the
unborn twin girls killed by the blast,'' said an editorial in The
Star, an independent newspaper and the country's largest daily.
``No cause, however just, can be served by such evil means.''
   The government, in its condemnations of terrorism, does not
mention the political factors that motivate the ANC guerrillas.
Anti-apartheid activists who opt for non-violent tactics to gain
black political rights have been detained by the thousands. Many
blacks, as well as some whites, perceive the security forces as
initiators of violence and occasionally as perpetrators of
terrorism.
   Restrictions on major anti-apartheid groups and laws forbidding
favorable comment about the ANC make it difficult to gauge black
opinion about the bombings. Some prominent moderates have spoken
out harshly against the ANC's use of violence, while many
militants, although barred by law from saying so publicly, endorse
the strategy.
   Dr. Nthato Motlana, a veteran activist who belonged to the ANC
before it was banned in 1960, sought to distance jailed ANC leader
Nelson Mandela from the latest bombings.
   ``He does not like violence, nor are people acting in his
name,'' he told a university audience last week.
   The Sowetan described the bombings as ``horrific acts'' and
said, ``It is surely desperation that drives men and women to such
violence.'' City Press, another major black paper, made conspicuous
mention of the fact that the video game arcade's clientele was
``almost exclusively black.''
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok says the ANC fears it is
losing public support and ``is now trying to intimidate the people
with violence.''
   The ANC contends most blacks generally approve of the guerrilla
campaign, accept the fact that some blacks will become casualties,
and are heartened by news of bombings.
   A middle-aged activist from the black township of Alexandra,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said guerrilla operations
sometimes do boost morale among blacks, even those who do not
condone civilian casualties.
   ``At least you know they (the ANC) still exist,'' the woman
said. ``With anti-apartheid organizations restricted and banned,
how else is the people's voice going to be heard?''
   For more 20 years after it adopted violence as a tactic in 1961,
the ANC's official policy was to attack only targets connected in
some way to the government or the security forces. At his trial for
sabotage in 1964, Mandela said guerrillas were given strict
instructions to avoid killings.
   At a conference in 1985, ANC officials said increased civilian
casualties were inevitable in the struggle to end white-minority
domination. Attacks on civilians gradually have increased since
then, and an interview given last month by ANC chief of staff Chris
Hani indicated this reflects official policy.
   ``We want to make apartheid costly, and very painful and bitter
for whites,'' said Hani, suggesting that frightened whites
eventually would turn against their leaders.
   In South Africa there are doubts about the wisdom of this
strategy.
   ``There's no sign of any fear or trepidation as a result of
what's happened so far,'' said Helen Suzman, long-serving
Parliament member for the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party.
   ``They (the ANC) underestimate the determination of the white
minority to stay in power. They underestimate the ferocity of the
reprisals the government will take.''

<HEAD>Proposed New Rules Deal With Farmworker Exposure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   New rules proposed by the Environmental
Protection Agency to protect farmworkers from pesticides are
satisfying neither farm owners nor labor groups concerned about
when sprayed fields can be re-entered safely.
   Shelly Davis, an attorney for the Migrant Legal Action Program,
said Wednesday she will submit comments so critical of the plan
they will ``burn up the page.''
   Mark Maslyn, pesticide specialist for the American Farm Bureau
Federation, said the new rules still had ``problem areas that
hopefully will be addressed'' in the 90-day public comment period
starting with publication sometime next week.
   The new regulations, 55 pages accompanied by 220 pages of
explanation, would replace a one-page regulation in effect since
1974. They cover pesticides that have not yet been the subject of
specific worker regulations in EPA's review of all 650 active
pesticide ingredients.
   Compliance by farmers and manufacturers could cost $170 million
in the first year and less after that, EPA said. The average grain
farm would have to spend an estimated $167 in the first year, the
average vegetable farm $611 and the average greenhouse $3,515.
   Louis True, head of program management and support in EPA's
pesticide program, told reporters Wednesday that a reduction of
one-half percent to 1 percent in poisonings would make the cost
worthwhile. He did not explain the calculation.
   Estimates of poisonings have ranged from 12,000 up to 300,000.
   Some 2.5 million farmworkers could be affected by the proposals
if they take effect as expected next year, including about 300,000
not now covered in commercial forestry, greenhouses and nurseries.
Exemptions would apply for home use, non-commercial forest use, as
by a park agency, use on rights of way, use in research and for
chemicals injected directly into plant tissue.
   Major provisions of the new regulations establish general
re-entry intervals during which no one normally may enter fields
after spraying.
   For the most toxic pesticides, the field would be closed for 48
hours, warning placards would have to be posted and oral warnings
would be required for any workers on that farm.
   Other provisions deal with the legal responsibility for
accidents and require the farmer to see to it that any contractors
hired are aware of the rules. Still others specify warnings that
must be given, emergency equipment that must be kept on hand,
protective clothing that must be worn and when blood tests for
professional pesticide applicators must be undertaken.
   Ms. Davis faulted the agency for using only acute toxicity to
set re-entry levels, ignoring chronic effects such as cancer. ``I
would establish a long interval for anything that's an actual or
suspected carcinogen in animals _ like a week,'' she said.
   A requirement that the oral warnings contain information on the
medical effects of exposure would sharpen workers' and farmers'
concern about their own health, she said.
   Maslyn said he feared that the re-entry intervals could not be
enforced against farmers anxious to get their crops to market.
   Some provisions of the regulations appear to hold the farmer
responsible for accidents even if a worker has refused to use
safety equipment, he said.
   ``I don't know what you do'' about a provision forbidding
farmers to require workers to work in chemical-resistant suits when
it is too hot, he said. ``There's a potential for abuse there.''
   ``It's been our concern all through this that they don't have
specific hard information that shows we have a problem with
re-entry levels and it needs to be fixed in this way,'' Maslyn said.

   The hot, dry weather plaguing America is
likely to shift East and South in the next month, and forecasters
offer little hope that the widespread drought will be broken.
   The 90-day outlook issued by the National Weather Service on
Wednesday does indicate a chance of more rain than normal in some
western sections of the Great Plains by the end of September.
   But in the nearer term, the watchwords were for more of the same
weather that has been parching fields and reservoirs, stalling
river traffic and baking crops and livestock.
   The 6- to 10-day outlook is ``very close to holding stationary
the pattern of the last few weeks,'' Donald L. Gilman, head of the
Long Range Predictions Group at the National Weather Service, said
at a news conference.
   And the 30-day prediction shows ``only subtle changes,'' Gilman
added.
   ``Unfortunately, reliable predictions of the drought's end, its
geographic spread, or changes in severity, cannot be made today,''
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cautioned in an
accompanying statement.
   The agency noted that while the current drought is severe, it is
not yet comparable to the damaging dry spells of the 1950s and
1930s. This dry period is ``neither unprecedented nor unexpected
from a climatological perspective,'' the agency said.
   Nonetheless, Dr. Michael Hudlow, director of hydrology for the
weather service, said: ``It's likely to get worse before it gets
better.''
   The river level at Memphis, Tenn., where Mississippi barge
traffic is already stalled, could drop another foot in the next 10
days, he warned.
   High-altitude jet stream winds that normally sweep across the
northern tier of states have split, to the north and south, Gilman
said, holding the drought conditions in place between them.
   Gilman's 6- to 10-day outlook calls for much above normal
temperatures in Montana, Wyoming, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Wisconsin
and Iowa.
   In addition, above normal readings are expected in much of the
rest of the nation except the Columbia River valley, West Texas and
along the Atlantic Coast from North Carolina through Georgia and
northern Florida.
   In the short range the rain forecast is ``patchy'' said Gilman.
He said no precipitation is likely in Oregon, California, Nevada,
southern Idaho, western Utah, western Arizona and Texas.
   There is a chance of some scattered moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico causing rain here and there in the Midwest, but only Kansas,
South Carolina and Georgia seem likely to have more rain than
normal for the period.
   In July, above normal heat is expected throughout most of the
northern Plains and upper Midwest, Gilman said, while the outlook
for rain is ``very uncertain.''
   The greatest chance of hot weather is in Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, Gilman said. He gave that region a 65
percent chance of being hotter than normal for July, an unusually
high ranking for a summer forecast. Typically, the 30-day outlooks
are considered only 55 percent likely in summer.
   In addition, July has a chance of warmer than normal weather
from Pennsylvania west through the Great Lakes states to Montana,
south to Oklahoma and Arkansas and east to the Appalachian
Mountains.
   The rest of the country should expect near normal readings in
July except the Puget Sound region, where is it expected to be
cooler than normal.
   The outlook for rain in July shows below normal precipitation
expected for California, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and
Kentucky. Above normal is expected only in Puget Sound and along
the Arizona-New Mexico border.
   Other regions are likely to be close to normal, Gilman said,
with the added warning that the below normal region could expand
back into the plains.
   If this were earlier in the year, he would have predicted a
larger dry area, Gilman said, but there may be breaks in the jet
stream which could allow some rain to move north from the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Finally, he issued a long-range 90-day forecast for July, August
and September.
   That outlook anticipates above normal temperatures along the
Pacific Coast, in southern Arizona and in Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas,
Louisiana, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, the Carolinas,
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida.
   Below normal temperatures are expected in Idaho, Montana,
Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico, with near normal readings
elsewhere.
   The three-month rain outlook is for below normal in California,
Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia and parts of West
Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky.
   The lone bit of good news may be the chance of above normal
precipitation for Montana, Wyoming, southern South Dakota,
Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, West Texas and western
Oklahoma over the 90 days.
   For the rest of the nation, the chances are too close to call
over such a long period.

   The Supreme Court's resounding endorsement of
the special prosecutor law dispels any doubt about the authority of
independent counsels investigating alleged wrongdoing by past and
present Reagan administration officials.
   The high court's 7-1 decision Wednesday removes a cloud from the
Iran-Contra conspiracy case, and it clears the way for the
sentencing of former White House aide Michael K. Deaver for lying
under oath about the lobbying business he formed after leaving
President Reagan's staff.
   The ruling also removes the special prosecutor issue from former
White House political director Lyn Nofziger's challenge to his
90-day sentence and conviction for illegally lobbying former
administration colleagues.
   And the court's decision revives independent counsel Alexia
Morrison's long dormant investigation of allegations that former
Assistant Attorney General Theodore B. Olson lied to a
congressional committee investigating the Superfund scandal at the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Challenges by Olson and two other former high-ranking Justice
Department officials to grand jury subpoenas obtained by Morrison
led to the high court's ruling on the independent counsel
provisions of the Ethics in Government Act.
   ``Obviously we are very pleased with the opinion and
particularly at the fact that it was reached nearly unanimously by
the court,'' said Morrison, whose investigation has been stymied
for nearly a year.
   The high court, in a decision written by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, rejected arguments that appointment of independent
counsels by a special court violated the Constitution's doctrine of
separation of powers.
   Rehnquist wrote that the special prosecutors did not encroach on
the power of the executive branch to investigate crimes.
   The decision drew an impassioned dissent from Justice Antonin
Scalia, who wrote that ``by its short-sighted action today, I fear
the court has permanently encumbered the Republic with an
institution that will do it great harm.''
   Ruling as it did, the court further validated the authority of
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to prosecute former White
House aide Oliver North, former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter and others on charges stemming from the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Walsh accepted a parallel appointment offered by the Justice
Department last year to blunt constitutional challenges to the law.
   But if the high court had ruled the other way, North, Poindexter
and their co-defendants might have been able to challenge evidence
Walsh gathered before he was given the second appointment.
   Harvard University law professor Laurence H. Tribe, who
represented Walsh, said the court found that ``vague notions of
separations of powers are not enough to justify invalidating''
Congress' solution to ``a serious problem that would otherwise
would have undermined credible law enforcement.''
   James C. McKay, the independent counsel who prosecuted Nofziger,
also accepted a backup appointment five weeks after he began his
investigation.
   If the law had been invalidated, Nofziger would have challenged
the use of evidence obtained by McKay before he was given the
parallel authority.
   Morrison and Deaver's prosecutor, independent counsel Whitney
North Seymour Jr., refused to accept the Justice Department's
offer, choosing instead to set the stage for the constitutional
battle.
   Deaver's conviction was put in jeopardy in Jan. 22 when the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled 2-1 that the special prosecutor
law was unconstitutional.
   Following that decision, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson stayed further proceedings in the Deaver case pending final
resolution of the issue by the high court.
   Seymour called the decision ``a major victory for the public
interest'' and said he would for ask Jackson to set sentencing ``at
an early date.''
   Deaver could be sentenced up to five years for each of three
felony convictions for lying to a House subcommittee and a grand
jury that investigated his lobbying activities for possible
conflict-of-interest violations.
   Deaver himself requested appointment of an independent counsel
when questions were raised in 1986 about the propriety of his
lobbying contacts with former Reagan administration colleagues.
   But his lawyers later tried to stop his indictment and trial by
challenging Seymour's authority to bring the charges.
   Defense lawyer Randall J. Turk acknowledged the importance of
the independent counsel challenge, but said, ``We have a number of
issues still pending before the trial court and if we don't prevail
there, we plan to pursue an appeal.''
   E. Lawrence Barcella, one of Nofziger's lawyers, said the high
court's decision is not a serious setback.
   ``Our challenge has always been focused on the post-employment
sections of he Ethics in Government Act, the vagueness of that
statute and the application of the facts to that statute,''
Barcella said.
   Nofziger remains free pending appeal of the conviction.
   ``This office has believed that there is an appropriate place
within the framework of the Constitution for the establishment of a
process which eliminates the inherent conflict of interest which
arises when a high official of the executive branch is investigated
by the Department of Justice,'' said McKay, who is also concluding
a lengthy probe of Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   McKay is not expected to bring criminal charges against Meese
but is preparing a lengthy report that could raise questions about
the ethical propriety of some of his financial dealings.

<HEAD>Delegates Appear Content To Let Dukakis Call The Shots On Running
Mate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Jesse Jackson's contention that he deserves to
be offered the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket is supported by
few Democratic National Convention delegates other than those
pledged to support him for president, an Associated Press survey
found.
   Other delegates appear content to let Michael Dukakis pick his
own running mate.
   ``Dukakis won fair and square, and it's his call,'' said Joseph
Courtney, a Dukakis delegate from Connecticut.
   Roughly half the delegates surveyed said they had no preference
for the No. 2 spot on the party's ticket, while the other half
scattered their support among nearly three dozen potential
candidates, mostly favorite sons.
   Many of those responding to the survey said they were willing to
go along with whomever Dukakis asks to join him on the ticket.
   ``It's entirely up to Michael Dukakis to make those choices,''
said Laura Past, a delegate and Democratic National Committee
member from Nevada.
   The delegates will be asked to ratify Dukakis' choice on the
final night of the four-day convention.
   Nearly all of Jackson's vice presidential support is coming from
delegates pledged to support him for president, according to the AP
survey.
   Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn and Jackson drew the most support in the
survey, followed by Sens. John Glenn of Ohio and Albert J. Gore Jr.
of Tennessee. Further back were Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey,
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   AP bureaus throughout the United States are polling all 4,161
delegates to the Democratic National Convention, which opens July
18 in Atlanta. With replies tabulated from more than 1,300 of those
delegates thus far, the trend was clear: The delegates are not
looking at anyone in particular.
   ``Dukakis, by winning more delegates than Jackson, has earned
the right to select whomever he wants, regardless of how any of the
other candidates did in the process,'' said Maine delegate John
Diamond, who backs Glenn.
   Of those tabulated, 611 said they had no preference when asked
whom they supported for the vice presidential nomination, and 174
supported Nunn, who said Wednesday he told Dukakis he is not
interested in the job.
   Jackson was named as vice presidential choice by 148 delegates,
132 of whom already were supporting him for president.
   Jackson has said that because of his second-place finish in the
race for the presidential nomination, he deserves to be offered the
No. 2 spot on the ticket. He has not said whether he would accept
the post if it is offered.
   But Jackson's argument found little support outside his own
delegates.
   ``I think that Dukakis needs someone who has foreign policy or
national experience and I don't think Jackson has either,'' Maine
delegate Dana Trattner said.
   However, Lawrence Lewis, a Jackson delegate from Vermont, said
the vice presidential spot on the ticket should be offered to
Jackson ``because in the last 10 years, Jackson has done more to
bring back enthusiasm ... than any other candidate _ the small
person with little or no voice.''
   But support for Jackson is not universal, even among his own
delegates.
   Barbara Maddox, a Jackson delegate from Michigan, said she is
still undecided about who should fill the second spot on the
Democratic ticket but is sure that it should not be offered
automatically to Jackson.
   ``Tradition has been that the presidential nominee of the party
selects his running mate,'' Ms. Maddox said. ``I think it should
continue that way at least for this convention. If they want to
change the rules, they should do it at the beginning of the game,
but they've got to start a new game next year.''
   ``I don't think he should be the vice presidential nominee,''
Tom Mason, a Dukakis delegate from Oregon, said of Jackson. ``I
think we would lose the South.''
   And Lawrence Katz, a Dukakis delegate from Arizona, said Jackson
should be denied the spot on the ticket because of a Jewish
backlash over a 1984 remark in which he referred to New York as
``Hymietown'' and his past association with Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan.
   Dukakis spent Wednesday on Capitol Hill, talking to senators,
some of whom are potential running mates.
   Among the tabulated delegate replies, Glenn was supported for
the vice presidential spot by 114 delegates, while 94 backed Gore.
Bumpers and Bradley were supported by 28 and 31, respectively, and
Bentsen had 25.
   Dukakis himself was listed as the vice presidential choice of 28
delegates. Twenty-seven of them were Jackson supporters.

<HEAD>Republican Keynote Speaker Better Known For His Politics Than
Oratory</HEAD>

   The keynote speaker for the Republican
National Convention isn't known as a fiery orator. He stuttered so
badly as a child that he used to break into a cold sweat when he
was called on in class. And he has a hybrid New Jersey-New England
accent that earns him a good deal of ribbing.
   But New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean will be in the spotlight
nonetheless at the GOP convention Aug. 15 in New Orleans, selected
from among hundred of other prominent Republicans.
   ``I am flattered by the honor, excited about the opportunity,
and a bit humbled,'' Kean said during a news conference to announce
he was accepting the offer from Vice President George Bush, the
expected Republican presidential nominee.
   ``I am going to go back home, I guess, sit for awhile and think
about what I am going to say,'' the governor said.
   Republican Party sources had told The Associated Press on
Tuesday that Kean had been picked to give the leadoff speech at the
convention. Kean said he was told of his selection on Tuesday, and
that Bush called him Wednesday to thank him for accepting.
   Bush called the governor ``one of the nation's most respected
leaders of either party.''
   ``We are extremely excited that the same voice of leadership
that has inspired the people of New Jersey will be in New Orleans
to send our troops out into battle,'' said Bush, in a statement
released by Kean's office.
   Kean's selection provoked at least one Republican, however. New
Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey, the Senate's leading opponent of
legalized abortion, threatened to stage a convention walkout if a
right-to-life partisan doesn't get equal time.
   Humphrey said Kean is ``an outspoken advocate of abortion.''
Aides to the New Jersey governor say Kean is personally opposed to
abortion, but does not support a constitutional ban, something
Humphrey has long sought.
   Kean spokesman John Samerjan said the governor would not comment
on Humphrey's complaint.
   Kean gained national prominence after his lopsided re-election
gubernatorial victory in 1985. He captured nearly 60 percent of the
black vote and two-thirds of the blue-collar vote.
   When asked the reason for the landslide victory in an industrial
northeastern state, Kean uttered the four-word dogma for which his
political autobiography is named _ ``the politics of inclusion.''
   Kean has long urged the Republican Party to expand its appeal
beyond its traditional bloc of supporters _ the affluent, and
middle-class whites _ to groups normally aligned with Democrats
such as blacks, Hispanics, other minorities, the poor and the
blue-collar community.
   Kean said that over the next several weeks he will be developing
themes and ideas for his speech and will draw upon the expertise of
close aides and other Republicans.
   But he got a bit of encouragement from someone on the other side
of the political aisle _ New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who delivered a
much-acclaimed keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National
Convention. Kean said he received a congratulatory call from Cuomo
on Wednesday.
   Kean noted, however, that he felt no pressure to measure up to
Cuomo's rousing speech to Democrats in 1984, a monumental address
that brought Cuomo into the national spotlight.
   ``Mario Cuomo is a better speaker than I am,'' said Kean. ``But
I'll do my best. What I want to do, obviously, is present a message
and do what I can to help George Bush and the party. ... You've got
to do your own speech.''
   Born into one of New Jersey's most distinguished families, Kean
wrote in his autobiography of a lonely childhood and a stuttering
problem so bad that it was an ordeal to speak up when he was called
on in school.
   He graduated from Princeton University and holds a graduate
degree from Columbia University. He taught prep school, served as a
camp director and was president of a real estate company before
entering political life in 1968, when he served the first of 10
consecutive years in the state assembly. Kean was speaker of the
House in 1972 and 1973 and was elected governor in 1981.

   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, protesting the selection
of New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean as keynote speaker at the Republican
National Convention, is threatening to stage a walkout unless a
right-to-life partisan gets equal time.
   Humphrey, the Senate's leading opponent of legalized abortion,
said the selection of Kean to give the high-profile,
convention-opening address was ``a terrible mistake, a blunder, an
affront to the right-to-life movement.''
   Humphrey said Kean is ``an outspoken advocate of abortion.''
Aides to the New Jersey governor say Kean is personally opposed to
abortion, but does not support a constitutional ban, something
Humphrey has long sought.
   Kean spokesman John Samerjan said the governor would not comment
on Humphrey's complaint.
   Humphrey said Vice President George Bush, the Republican
nominee-apparent, also needs to ``assure us that his vice
presidential running mate will be someone who shares George Bush's
opposition to abortion.''
   The New Hampshire senator said it was up to the Bush campaign to
settle the dispute before the convention, which opens Aug. 15 in
New Orleans.
   ``I'm going to try to organize a walkout from the convention
during the governor's speech unless between now and then the Bush
campaign seeks to make amends for this affront,'' said Humphrey,
who is a delegate to the convention.
   Humphrey said he wasn't opposed to Kean being allowed to speak
at the convention, but objected to his giving the major address.
``He's done an outstanding job as governor,'' Humphrey said, but
``it's a colossal blunder to have him give the keynote speech.''
   ``I think this decision is just another further indication of
the inability of the Bush campaign to understand the kind of
coalition it must put together if it hopes to have the support of
conservative Republicans and Democrats,'' Humphrey said.
   ``I've spoken to about a dozen members of the Senate and the
House who are very upset,'' Humphrey said.
   ``There is incredulity that George Bush would choose an even ...
more-blueblood figure than he is,'' Humphrey added, noting Kean's
aristocratic background.
   Kean, the son of a congressman and grandson of a senator,
attended prep school and graduated from Princeton University before
becoming a banker and teacher.

<HEAD>Report: Sexual Harassment `Pervasive' In Federal Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Over half the female State Department
employees in a survey said they were harassed sexually at work,
giving the department the worst record in a study of the problem in
the federal workplace.
   But the department is by no means alone in having a dismal
record. The survey by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board said
sexual harassment is ``pervasive, costly and systemic'' in the
federal workplace.
   In a report issued Wednesday, the board said 42 percent of women
and 14 percent of men who responded to its survey of federal
employees experienced some form of sexual harassment from May 1985
to May 1987. That figure was virtually identical to findings in the
board's 1980 survey.
   The board, an independent, quasi-judicial agency that decides
federal employee appeals from personnel actions, found that the
problem cost the United States an estimated $267 million over the
two-year period in paying sick leave to employees who missed work,
replacing employees who left their jobs and in reduced individual
and group productivity.
   However, the report noted that the respondents generally did not
consider the problem any worse in the federal government than in
the private sector.
   ``I don't think the federal government is somehow a hotbed of
sexual harassment that stands out from the rest of the country. ...
This is a problem in the rest of the country,'' John M. Palguta,
the project supervisor, said in an interview.
   The survey was sent in March 1987 to a representative sample of
about 13,000 full-time permanent federal workers, and 8,523
employees responded.
   Palguta said the survey was checked carefully to make sure those
who responded were representative, and did not, for example,
represent a high percentage of people who had reported problems.
   The survey found that the State Department had the highest
percentage _ 52 percent _ of women respondents who said they
experienced some form of uninvited sexual attention. The Veterans
Administration had the highest percentage of men respondents _ 21
percent _ claiming sexual harassment.
   The Department of Health and Human Services had the lowest
percentage of women respondents who claimed harassment, 29 percent,
and NASA had the lowest percentage of men who said they were
harassed, 10 percent.
   A wide range of behavior was considered to be sexual harassment.
It was generally viewed as uninvited and unwanted attention,
including: letters, telephone calls or materials of a sexual
nature; touching; sexually suggestive looks or gestures; pressure
for sexual favors or dates; sexual jokes or questions; actual or
attempted assault or rape.
   The most frequently experienced type of uninvited attention is
``unwanted sexual teasing, jokes, remarks or questions,'' the
report said.
   Women were more likely than men to be victims. They were likely
to be working in a non-traditional job in a predominantly male
environment, have some college education, be single or divorced and
between the ages of 20 and 44. Male victims were more likely to be
divorced or separated, age 20 to 44, in clerical or trainee
positions in a predominantly female work group.
   The board said victims are most often harassed by co-workers and
by people of the opposite sex. Twenty-two percent of male victims,
however, reported in the 1980 survey that they were harassed by one
or more men. The question was not asked in the 1987 survey.
   Only 5 percent of both female and male victims said they took
some kind of formal action, usually in the form of requesting an
investigation by the employing agency.
   The report recommended that federal agencies and departments
provide training on sexual harassment to all employees, quickly and
thoroughly investigate allegations, and exercise strong sanctions
against offenders. Existing guidelines detailing specific
prohibited practices and penalties should be updated annually, the
report said.

   Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haire
Mariam has renewed a call for improved relations with the United
States, but U.S. diplomats are skeptical of the offer.
   Mengistu, who transformed pro-Western Ethiopia into a Marxist
state after the military toppled Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974,
told a May news conference: ``We are not really pleased with our
relations with the United States. We will do everything of our best
to improve relations. I am sincere ... about this.''
   But U.S. Charge d'Affaires James Cheek, referring to a series of
such overtures in the past three years, said, ``It's been a history
of occasional words and no action.''
   ``Words are always welcome. But they don't get you far if they
are not accompanied by actions.''
   U.S. officials said that Mengistu, at short notice, canceled
planned meetings three times in the past six months with Chester
Crocker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs.
   In the latest incident, Crocker was at Frankfurt airport in
January, awaiting a flight for Addis Ababa, when the Ethiopians
said the meeting was off.
   An angry Crocker told Voice of America: ``President Mengistu and
his Politburo are not interested in pursuing the possibilities of
broadening their international options and are quite comfortable
where they are _ out of step with the rest of Africa, but in a cozy
relationship with the Soviets and the Cubans.''
   Some diplomats based in Addis Ababa believe Mengistu may face
opposition from hard-liners in his government who prefer to see
even greater distance between Addis Ababa and Washington.
   Ethiopia has close ties with the Soviet Union, and receives
substantial military aid from Moscow in the government's battles
against separatist guerrillas. It is the only African nation with
Soviet combat troops. It also has 2,500 Cuban soldiers.
   Under Haile Selassie's rule, the United States was Ethiopia's
firmest foreign friend.
   Today, the United States is a vocal critic of Mengistu's Marxist
reforms and his failure effectively to come to terms with rebel
uprisings and persistent food shortages.
   ``We are not saying (for them to) give up relations with the
Soviet Union,'' said Cheek in an interview, ``but we are saying
pursue a truly nationalist and non-aligned policy.''
   Ethiopian leaders resent the branding of their country as a
client state of Moscow. Neutral diplomats contend Mengistu is
fiercely independent-minded, but grudgingly forced to embrace the
Soviets to fight off guerrilla armies seeking autonomy or
independence in Eritrea and Tigre provinces.
   In his news conference last month, Mengistu's tone toward the
United States wavered from anger to admiration.
   ``Simple hatred,'' he asserted at one point, might have prompted
Washington to label Ethiopia a communist country.
   But he also declared: ``We have respect and admiration for the
American people ... Once upon a time, we were close friends.''
   The once-warm relations between Washington and Addis Ababa
deteriorated when the Soviet Union became Ethiopia's biggest patron
in 1977.
   Washington suspended development aid and downgraded its
diplomatic representative from ambassador to a charge d'affaires.
   There was little contact until the 1984-1985 famine, when the
United States was the biggest donor of emergency food to the
nation. This year, Washington again is the biggest donor, as a
drought threatens more than 7 million Ethiopians, nearly half of
them in the war-torn north.
   There has been friction over the delivery of food supplies,
however, with Washington accusing Mengistu of trying to keep food
from reaching the northern rebels, and the United States diverting
some supplies for Ethiopia to Sudan, for distribution by rebel
organizations.
   Cheek believes that despite the acrimony, the two countries
could begin a rapprochement.
   ``At least we could talk about getting the legal obstacles out
of the way, though the policy obstacles would stick,'' said Cheek.
``The Angolans are trying, the South Africans are trying, but these
people have not tried.''
   In 1985, Ethiopia resolved one of several legal problems by
paying $7 million in compensation to U.S. companies for
nationalized property.
   U.S. economic assistance still is restricted by laws that deny
development aid to countries accused of human rights abuses and
which owe money for arms.

   Tribesmen supporting rival
candidates in provincial elections fought with bows and arrows and
axes, leaving 10 hospitalized with serious arrow wounds, national
radio said today.
   The fighting in Timbu province, 150 miles north of the capital,
followed the announcement of election results this week, the Papua
New Guinea National Broadcasting Commission said.
   It said supporters of victorious and defeated candidates fought
with traditional weapons along tribal lines.
   The commission said the violence was worst in the town of
Gumine, where houses, a hospital and police station were damaged by
rampaging groups. There was no indication of how many people were
involved.
   Papua New Guinea, north of Australia, is one of the most
primitive countries on earth. About 89 percent of of the population
of 3.2 million lives in rural areas without road access.

<HEAD>Fair Housing Legislation Goes To Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A compromise bill aimed at putting teeth into
the nation's basic fair housing law goes to the Senate after
winning overwhelming approval in the Democratic-controlled House.
   The House voted 376-23 Wednesday evening in favor of the
legislation to broaden protections against housing bias and speed
review of complaints. All the ``nays'' were cast by Republicans.
   The Senate is expected to take quick action on the measure,
which amends the 1968 Fair Housing Act. The act barred
discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin
in the sale or rental of housing. A 1974 law prohibits housing
discrimination on the basis of sex.
   President Reagan has said he supports the legislation, which
broadens the power of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to enforce discrimination complaints.
   As part of the political compromises necessary to get the
original law enacted, HUD was given the power to resolve disputes
only through mediation.
   The new proposal would empower HUD officials to institute legal
proceedings against parties they believe are guilty of
discrimination. But in a major concession to real estate interests,
those accused of discrimination would have the choice of taking
their cases before an administrative law judge or a trial court.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a civil rights leader in the South in
the 1960s, said the legislation ``breaks another link in the chains
that have bound our society in the ravages of discrimination.''
   ``What we do here today will be a meaningful and significant
step on the long and continued journey on the road to an open
society,'' Lewis said in a floor speech. ``We are saying to the
American people that we must look out for the common good, that we
are one nation, one community, one house, the American house.''
   The legislation represents a compromise between the civil rights
groups and realtors' associations, whose bitter dispute over
enforcement of housing discrimination laws had stalled
congressional action for nearly 11 years. The two sides finally
reached an agreement last week.
   The House also approved, 241-159, an amendment by Rep. Robert K.
Dornan, R-Calif., to ban discrimination against women who are
pregnant.
   Those voting against the overall fair housing bill were:
   Reps. Bill Archer, R-Tex., Richard K. Armey, R-Tex., Steve
Bartlett, R-Tex., Joe Barton, R-Tex., Beau Boulter, R-Tex., Dan
Burton, R-Ind., Larry Combest, R-Tex., Philip M. Crane, R-Ill.,

<HEAD>Black-Footed Ferret, Near Extinction, Believed Found in Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATERTON LAKES NATIONAL PARK, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small number of
black-footed ferret, one of the rarest animals in North America,
may be living in the Canadian portion of the Waterton-Glacier
International Peace Park, a naturalist says.
   If verified, the find ``may have all the significance of the
return of the whooping crane,'' Duane Barrus, the park's chief
naturalist, said this week.
   The only known population of the weasel-like animals is in a
captive breeding program at the Sybille Wildlife Center near
Wheatland, Wyo. The ferrets, believed extinct for years, were
discovered near Meteetse, Wyo., in 1981, and now number 62.
   ``We believe among ourselves that we have a small wild
population, not too small, we hope, to reproduce,'' Barrus said of
the Waterton ferrets.
   Information about the sightings was relayed to park officials
this spring by Frank Goble, a retired Waterton businessman who
lives in Cardston, Alberta, Barrus said.
   Goble said his son, David, a physics professor at a Nova Scotia
university who summers in Cardston, first saw a ferret in 1983 but
did not know what it was until he returned to school and saw a
photograph in a National Geographic magazine.
   ``It was about six feet from him,'' the elder Goble said. ``He
thought it was a funny-looking weasel.''
   ``They're out there,'' he said. ``My wife saw one last night.
I'm inclined to think that there's a fair population, but they're
scattered.''
   Barrus said researchers had not looked for black-footed ferrets
inside the park because they were believed to live only alongside
prairie dogs, their primary food source, and Waterton has no
prairie dogs.
   Barrus said the animals may have adapted to feed on Columbian
ground squirrels, which are plentiful in the park, and perhaps on
the Richardson's ground squirrel or common gopher.
   Park officials have persuaded the Canadian Wildlife Service to
begin a study inside the park, across southern Alberta and into
Saskatchewan, to get photos and determine the population and range
of the ferrets, Barrus said.

   A juvenile court has sentenced
two British soccer fans to two weeks in jail for a drunken attack
on four Italian fans during the European Soccer Championships.
   But a court spokesman, who asked not to be identified further,
said the men were freed after Wednesday's sentencing because they
had already spent 19 days in jail awaiting trial.
   Court officials identified the men as Gary Webb, 19, and Steven
Peckham, 18, both of Kent.
   According to testimony in the case, the men were among 10
British fans who attacked four Italian fans in downtown Stuttgart.
   Witnesses said one Italian was knocked unconscious, another
struck with a beer mug and a third thrown into a flower bed.
   Several hundred English soccer fans were arrested in six West
German cities during the two-week championships.
   The violence prompted British government officials to ask West
Germany to punish rowdies severely with jail terms.
   Fifteen other British soccer fans are still awaiting trial in
Stuttgart on a variety of charges ranging from assault to
disorderly conduct.

   Singer Michael Jackson will go ahead with a
planned British tour despite quarantine laws banning his pet
chimpanzee Bubbles, his record company says.
   Jackson was allowed to take the ape into Japan last year and he
would have liked to bring him to Britain, Jonathan Morrish of CBS
records said Wednesday.
   ``Michael enjoys Bubbles' companionship but he is a consummate
professional and knows the show must go on,'' Morrish said.
   ``He is obviously disappointed but he understands the quarantine
laws here.''
   The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said it insisted
there could be no exception to its rules _ ``not even for important
show business stars'' _ that animals entering the country must be
caged for six months to prove them disease-free.
   Jackson's British tour begins July 14.

<HEAD>Air Force Looking for New Power After Scrubbing Local Nukes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force says it is looking for other
emergency power sources after scrubbing a program that would have
placed small nuclear reactors at bases around the country.
   ``We continue to be concerned about secure power and secure
energy for our Air Force bases,'' Gary S. Flora, associate director
of Air Force engineering and services, told a House Government
Operations subcommittee Wednesday.
   His testimony came after an official of the General Accounting
Office criticized the four-year reactor development program, which
cost about $3.75 million, as ill-conceived and poorly managed. The
program was terminated in May 1987.
   Flora said the Air Force is pursuing other options including
additional feeder cables from the commercial power grid and
installation of more auxiliary power generators at bases.
   ``Key facilities currently have backup generators,'' he said,
but in most cases they can supply only a fraction of total power
needs.
   The local reactor project was prompted by the need to provide
Air Force bases with auxiliary power supplies that would be more
secure against disruption in the event of natural disasters,
sabotage, terrorism or wartime attack.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of the subcommittee on the
environment, energy and natural resources, said that while such
concern was understandable, ``the logical approach would seem to
call for assessing all the options and choosing the one best suited
to each individual base.''
   ``Instead, DOE (the Department of Energy) pressed ahead with a
plan to put cloned `mini-nukes' at bases around the country at a
cost which could ultimately approach $20 billion,'' he said.
   As a start, the program envisioned locating 10-megawatt reactors
at seven bases: Tinker Air Force Base, Okla.; McClellan AFB,
Calif.; Kelly AFB, Texas; Robbins AFB, Ga.; Hill AFB, Utah;
Mountain AFB, Idaho, and Shemya AFB, Alaska.
   Initial work on the project was done at Los Alamos National
Laboratory for DOE's Office of Defense Programs. Then, before the
Los Alamos feasibility study was complete, the project was
reassigned to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy and the work was
transferred to the department's Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory.
   Air Force responsibility for the project also was shifted, from
an office at Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., to another at Bolling
AFB in Washington, D.C., before the plan was dropped.
   Keith O. Fultz, senior associate director of the GAO's
resources, community and economic development division, told the
subcommittee that despite the time and money spent, the program
``made little progress toward its intended goal.''
   He said the GAO, a congressional watchdog agency, viewed the
project as ill-conceived because ``the choice and feasibility of
using nuclear power was never clearly established and documented
prior to the decision to proceed.''
   Flora emphasized in his testimony that the service had decided
to kill the small reactors project before it proceeded beyond an
early stage.
   ``Phase One of the project was a feasibility study only,'' he
said. ``We decided the concept to be too costly. It may have turned
out that cost would have been outweighed by environmental concerns,
even if nuclear plants would have proved cost-effective.''

<TEXT>
   Hollywood actors and directors are coming up
short in their efforts to win congressional approval of an outright
ban on computer colorization of black-and-white movies.
   In the first Capitol Hill floor vote on the issue, the House on
Wednesday approved legislation that would merely discourage
colorization of classics such as ``Casablanca'' and ``The Maltese
Falcon.''
   The vote came on an amendment tacked by Rep. Sidney Yates,
D-Ill., onto an Interior Department spending bill. The amendment
would establish a 13-member National Film Preservation Board
composed of film-related officials such as heads of the actors,
writers and directors guilds and of the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences.
   Operating with a $100,000-a-year budget in the Interior
Department, the board would recommend movies for inclusion in a
National Film Registry, with up to 25 movies to selected for the
registry each year by the interior secretary
   A registered film would be given a special seal to denote its
status, and the seal could be used to promote any version of the
movie that has not been materially altered, a term that includes
colorization and heavy editing.
   Materially altered versions of registered films would have to
carry labels to that effect in their advertising and on boxes
containing videocassette versions.
   The bill containing the film board amendment was sent to the
Senate by a 361-45 vote, with Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., objecting
to the amendment on constitutional free-speech grounds.
   ``Establishing a national film commission to pass on the merits
or values of films is an unprecedented and unwarranted extension of
federal power over privately produced works of art,'' Edwards said.
``This is content-based government regulation of speech. In simple
terms, that is censorship.
   ``We should not have a government body deciding that some films
are worthy and some are not. Politics will enter into the
decisions.''
   Hollywood figures such as actor James Stewart and director Fred
Zinneman have been lobbying Congress for months, objecting to
increasing numbers of movies colorized for television through a
computer process.

   The White House is making veto threats against
a House-passed spending bill that President Reagan's budget
director says threatens U.S. promises to Canada to combat acid rain
pollution.
   James Miller, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
is criticizing the $9.69 billion package to finance the Interior
Department, U.S. Forest Service and key energy research programs in
fiscal 1989.
   Miller says unless changes are made, he will recommend a veto of
the bill, which was sent to the Senate on Wednesday by a 361-45
vote _ a margin far larger than what would be needed in the House
to override any veto.
   Miller said the House bill would jeopardize the commitment
Reagan made to Canada to combat acid rain from U.S. sources by
developing technology to reduce pollution from coal-burning plants.
   He said Congress is backtracking on its agreement last year to
spend $525 million on clean coal research in fiscal 1989, which
begins Oct. 1. Instead, the House plan would spend only $100
million in 1989, with $225 million earmarked for 1990 and $200
million for 1991.
   Although Miller blamed Congress exclusively, the $425 million
cut in fiscal 1989 resulted from an agreement between the White
House and Congress to reduce the massive federal budget deficit.
   Miller also complained about the continuation of moratoria on
leasing federal oil tracts off the coasts of northern California
and Massachusetts and the resumption of such a ban off southwestern
Florida. The moratoria are for a year.
   He said the administration strongly opposes a related provision
that would require at least 50 percent U.S. labor and materials to
be used for petroleum facilities in other parts of the outer
continental shelf.
   Miller contends that the buy-U.S. language would delay needed
exploration, drive up its costs and violate international trade
agreements, inviting retaliation by other nations.
   The veto-threat message delivered to lawmakers also cited
opposition to giving states $157 million for energy conservation
programs, which Miller says states should finance themselves;
spending $156 million on discretionary construction; and earmarking
$64 million for Indian health facilities when existing facilities
have a 50 percent vacancy rate.
   The House was unmoved by the warning, and the administration got
no help from Republicans. Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, called the
legislation a ``peoples' bill,'' and ranking Appropriations
Committee Republican Silvio Conte of Rhode Island urged colleagues
to vote for the measure, calling it a ``good bill.''
   Because of the tight money situation, the legislation is
proposing no major new initiatives and would grant mainly modest
spending increases.
   The National Park Service, for example, would get $960 million,
up from $900 million but well above the $780 million proposed by
the White House. The service and other interior agencies would get
$167 million for land acquisition, more than eight times what
Reagan proposed.
   Overall, the Interior Department would get $4.484 billion next
year, compared to $4.427 billion this year and the administration's
request of $3.973 billion.
   The Forest Service would get $1.81 billion, $200 million above
the administration's proposal and about $56 million more than in
fiscal 1988. The House approved the service's plan to harvest more
than 11 billion board feet of lumber on public land, but it cut $5
million from the current $166.8 million road-building budget.

   America faces ``a time of reckoning'' when
foreign sources will no longer be willing to loan the money
necessary for the nation to sustain its deficit-ridden trade
habits, says a congressional report.
   The report, prepared by the Office of Technology Assessment and
released Wednesday by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., says, ``No nation,
not even one as rich as the United States, can go on forever paying
its current account deficit with foreign capital.''
   The current account is the most important of all the government
trade statistics because it covers not only trade in merchandise,
but also trade in the so-called services category, which reflects
primarily the flow of investment earnings between nations.
   The account has showed a deficit since 1981, as Americans have
handed over billions of dollars to foreigners in exchange for
imported goods. The U.S. deficit has been sustained by loans and
investments from abroad.
   ``As the United States sinks further into debt, foreign
investors and creditors _ central banks, individuals and firms _
will be less inclined to commit ever-increasing amounts of capital
to a $4 trillion economy on a spending spree,'' OTA said.
   When that happens, it said, the United States will be forced to
decrease government spending, business investment or consumption _
or all three. One way that could happen is through a recession.
   But OTA said the nation could minimize its economic woes by
getting better at manufacturing, with the government's help.
   ``That is the most constructive way to recapture some of our own
markets and raise exports,'' the report said.
   Another way to boost exports is through a devalued dollar, but
that also increases the cost of imported cars, video cassette
recorders and other imported goods, the report noted.
   OTA did not predict when the ``time of reckoning'' would occur.
It said the trade patterns of the 1980s ``are a significant
departure from any past experience.''
   The report rejected the notion that service industries such as
banking, engineering or software design can replace manufacturing
industries, or cut the deficit on their own.
   ``To speak of services as taking the place of manufacturing is
to overlook the strong interdependence of the two kinds of
activities and the blurring of distinctions between them,'' OTA
said.
   ``Many service industries depend heavily on manufacturers for
business. And some manufacturing industries could hardly exist
without allied services _ for example, the manufacture of computers
and design of software, often by an independent firm,'' it said.
   Of the $161 billion trade deficit in 1987, 85 percent was in
manufacturing such as motor vehicles and parts, textiles, shoes and
electronics, OTA said.
   The report was released at a news conference by Heinz, who said
it demonstrated that ``manufacturing is the key'' and that bringing
down the dollar to make American exports more attractive ``will not
be enough.''

   When dawn breaks in the pale blue prairie
sky, the pickup trucks arrive at the Fryin' Pan Restaurant with
farmers hungry for breakfast and thirsty for rain.
   Their day starts anytime after 5 a.m. at the Fryin' Pan, a place
to catch up on farm news and trade ideas. Somehow, the farmbelt's
worst drought since the Dust Bowl seems easier to digest over
coffee, eggs and sausage with friends facing the same troubles.
   ``I'm an old bachelor. I can take quite a beating,'' said cattle
rancher Walt Engsetter, 54, his meaty hand wrapped around a mug of
black coffee.
   ``If I had a wife and kids, I'd be jumping out of my socks. I've
never seen it this dry.''
   Engsetter has 120 Hereford cows with calves on a 1,200-acre
spread in Spring Prairie Township on Minnesota's western edge. A
22-acre plot of oats to feed the cattle is doing poorly, the
pastures are worn down and the watering holes are getting low.
   ``They're the sorriest oats I've ever seen. It's close to a game
of shutout,'' said the blue-eyed, wiry-haired Engsetter, born of
tough Norwegian stock. ``The pasture is pretty well worked. And I
am nervous about the water.
   ``There ain't much you can do about it though,'' he said.
   This is the heart of America's upper breadbasket.
   Breakfast attire can consist of Big Mac bib overalls, dungarees,
blue work shirts, clodhopper work shoes, Caterpillar belt buckles
and baseball-style mesh caps that advertise everything from seeds
to tractors to fertilizers.
   The restaurant's wallpaper is a pattern with spears of wheat.
Farm sales and auctions are posted on a bulletin board near the
cash register.
   The men speak in measured tones about how their crop is faring
and ask their colleagues how they're doing.
   ``You can talk to your neighbors and exchange ideas, maybe pick
up something that you can give a whirl,'' said Jim Regstad, 46, of
Georgetown.
   Regstad has 100 acres of sugar beets that seem to be weathering
the hot, dry weather so far. His wheat and barley crops aren't
doing as well.
   ``We're hoping for more rain. The grain is pretty much shot,''
said Regstad. ``We're looking to next year already. To be a good
farmer, you got to be an optimist.''
   Regular customers show up almost everyday, and bodies fill the
counter seats and cushioned booths when the weather isn't so dry.
   ``You can tell when it rains. A lot of our business is
weather-related,'' said Scott Christenson, manager of the 24-hour
restaurant.
   Melvin Nyberg of Arthur, N.D., stopped for a bite to eat while
seeking repairs on a cultivator that had blown a cylinder. He
figures the wheat yield on his 1,120-acre farm will be half of
normal.
   ``I think we've lost a crop,'' said Nyberg, 62, wearing a
digital watch with the Case tractor logo on it. ``There's always
adversity in farming. But if you sit here and worry about it, it
will drive you crazy.''
   One extra headache he has is grasshoppers. The insects don't
have enough plants to munch on, so they've been settling in his
crops. He's paying $17 an acre to have them sprayed by air.
   ``They're eating what little's out there. There's so darn many,
you have to control them or you'll have more next year if you
don't,'' Nyberg said.
   ``You hate to spend that kind of money, but we have to do it.
It's survival.''
   Nyberg does some plumbing on the side to make extra money. His
son, Rand, also works the farm and does some accounting.
   ``We'll survive. It won't kill us,'' said Nyberg. ``We're not in
debt and we don't vacation in the winter in Arizona. Anybody that's
borrowing money to put into crops is in tough shape.''
   Waitress Mary Ward hears a lot of the farmers' gripes and
marvels at their pluck and independence.
   ``You got to be crazy to do anything that depends on the
weather,'' she said while carrying a tray of food. ``Even though
farming's a nice life, it would give me ulcers.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Reagan's Drug Task Force Going Nowhere</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

   President Reagan misread the hourglass when he
challenged Congress to take politics out of the national drug
policy debate.
   Whatever sands of goodwill that existed had already slipped away
by the time Reagan used a mid-May Coast Guard Academy address to
urge creation of a joint executive-legislative branch task force.
   ``As I finish my final year in office and look ahead, I worry
that drug politics might undermine effective drug policy,'' Reagan
said in the speech. ``That's why today, I'm calling on both houses
of the Congress, both sides of the aisle, to join with my
representatives in a special executive-legislative task force to
advance America's unified response to the problem of illegal drug
use.''
   A month and a half later, Reagan has only two-thirds of the task
force _ the executive branch members and the representatives
selected by Republican congressional leaders.
   The Democrats have never sent the White House their task force
lineup. And this will not happen, say those close to House Speaker
Jim Wright of Texas, House Majority Leader Tom Foley of Washington
and Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia.
   Simply put, Reagan had an idea whose time had passed. There's
the ongoing presidential campaign, not to speak of the separate
task forces already set up by the House and Senate when Reagan
proposed the joint effort. Finally, there's the reality that
precious little time remains for lawmaking before Congress goes
into recess.
   The clear confluence of politics and this city's great political
debates is rarely out of sight, and it's seldom been more stark
than in the drug issue during this presidential election year.
   Reagan violates the spirit of his own proposal when he puts in a
plug for Vice President George Bush's anti-drug efforts _ as he has
done on more than one occasion. In fact, the presidential campaign
crossfire between Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis makes
bipartisan approaches even less likely.
   Jeff Biggs, a spokesman for Foley, said, ``We already have a
task force. My guess is that there's not going to be any
appointments.''
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said, ``I would sure
hope they would because they can give a sense of direction to it.
But in the absence of that, I think we in the legislative branch
have got to move ahead as aggressively as we can.''
   The unwillingness of Democrats to name members to Reagan's task
force has left White House officials grousing about political
motives, with tongue-in-cheek expressions of shock.
   ``Gee, I know Jim Wright's a partisan but I certainly would
never suggest that Congressman Wright would want to be playing
politics on the drug issue. There must be some other explanation,''
said domestic policy adviser Gary Bauer.
   Reagan may have been hoping to find the same kind of bipartisan
cooperation that marked the joint executive-legislative agreement
on a congressional budget-reducing package in the wake of the Oct.
19 Wall Street collapse, when investors sent a vote of
no-confidence to Washington political leaders.
   Or maybe he was looking for the kind of pull-together consensus
the administration enjoyed in Congress when it decided to bomb
Libya in mid-April 1986 in reprisal for a surge of terrorism that
U.S. officials laid at the feet of strongman Moammar Gadhafi.
   What the drug task force fiasco likely proves is that only
perceived emergencies slice through the partisanship of Washington
politics, and that the drug problem did not fit that criterion, its
perils notwithstanding.
   The drug issue will still be here after Election Day.

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church has suffered ruptures for
centuries. Here, at a glance, is a look at the major schisms:
   _The Old Catholics, led by German clergy and laymen, split from
the Holy See in 1870 when they rejected the decrees of the First
Vatican Council, particularly the dogma of papal infallibility. By
1874, they set up a new church which, among other things, allowed
priests to marry and made confession optional.
   _The Great Schism, or the Schism of the West, occurred from 1378
to 1417. It involved not a dispute over faith or practice but a
conflict between two parties each claiming to support the true pope.
   The schism began with the death of Pope Gregory XI in 1378.
Under pressure from Romans who feared that the papacy might move
back to Avignon, France, the cardinals elected Urban VI as the new
pope. A few months later, the cardinals declared the election
invalid and elected Cardinal Robert of Geneva as Pope Clement VII,
and he moved to Avignon. Urban retorted by naming 28 new cardinals.
The schism lasted through two lines of popes, ending in 1417 with
the election of Martin V. Today, it is generally agreed that the
Urbanist popes were the true ones.
   _The East-West Schism marked the split between the Holy See and
the Orthodox Eastern Church after centuries of doctrinal disputes
and diverging traditions. The break began in 1054 when Michael
Cerularius, the patriarch of Constantinople, split with Pope Leo
IX. The breach gradually widened, becoming definitive in 1472.
   In a recent split with Rome, China cut ties with the Vatican in
1957 and established its own breakaway Catholic church, which now
claims 3 million members. An unknown number of other Chinese
Catholics remain secretly loyal to the pope.
   Cardinal Rosalio Jose Castillo Lara, the Vatican's leading canon
law expert, said Tuesday that the Chinese split is not considered
schismatic because it is assumed the Catholics were not acting on
their own free will.
   The Catholic Encyclopaedic Dictionary defines schism as ``the
refusal to submit to the authority of the pope or to hold communion
with members of the church subject to him.'' The sacraments may not
be administered to schismatics, even those in good faith, according
to the dictionary.
   The case of Martin Luther (1483-1546), German leader of the
Protestant Reformation, was not one of schism but of heresy, in
that he was seen as rejecting a truth that the Catholic Church
proposed as revealed by God.

   Members of Congress will have to cut short
their July 4th campaign plans because of a struggle for political
one-upmanship on the issue of giving workers advance notice of
plant closings and layoffs.
   Democrats had hoped to win passage of a mandatory notice bill in
both the Senate and House before the Independence Day break so they
could vote on overriding an expected veto from President Reagan
before the party's national convention in three weeks.
   Republicans thwarted those ambitions Wednesday, stalling final
action this week by saying they would make Democrats vote first on
a Massachusetts voluntary notice law touted by Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
   With Dukakis at the Capitol most of the day Wednesday, Democrats
balked at allowing a vote that would have enabled Republicans to
claim victory either way: as a rejection of Dukakis or as a
rejection of mandatory notices.
   Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd pulled the bill from the floor
saying, ``We're not going to sit around here and fiddle-faddle with
these little amendments that don't mean anything.''
   Byrd had promised lawmakers earlier that they could spend all of
next week campaigning for re-election in their home states if the
Senate could get final passage of the bill Wednesday and allow
House action on it today.
   Instead, he and House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, agreed to
reconvene Congress July 6 in another attempt to win passage of the
plant-closing measure next week.
   Still, the delay effectively precludes any chance of Congress
overriding a veto before the Democratic convention opens July 18 in
Atlanta, assuming Reagan will use all 10 working days he has under
the Constitution to exercise it.
   With polls showing more than 80 percent of Americans in favor of
advance layoff notices, opposition to the mandatory 60-day notice
proposal from Reagan and Vice President George Bush has become a
top campaign issue for Democrats.
   Dukakis boasted through the primaries that because of his
efforts Massachusetts is ``the one state that has a comprehensive
plant closing law'' even though labor leaders and other critics say
that it is toothless.
   The 1984 Massachusetts statute requests but does not require
employers to give 90 days advance notice of a plant closings, which
is defined as a layoff involving at least 90 percent of a
facility's work force.
   And the only sanction that it provides the denial of state
economic aid to troubled companies that decline to sign a
non-binding pledge to provide the notices.
   ``Let's vote on the Dukakis plan; let's see how many votes he
has,'' Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, D-Kan., said Wednesday.
``He's for giving notice in his state, but he wants to give it
voluntarily.''
   Dole said Reagan would sign a substitute bill modeled on the
Massachusetts plan that seeks only voluntary rather than mandatory
notices and offers incentives rather than fines as an inducement.
   Vice President George Bush also has endorsed voluntary notices
and conditioning federal contracts and tax incentives on pledges by
companies to provide them.

   Sister Carmela Cristiano helps
Trump's Castle Hotel & Casino find employees. Trump's Castle helps
Sister Carmela get people off welfare. All parties agree it's a
heavenly relationship.
   The 62-year-old member of the Sisters of Charity was driving
recently, thinking of ways to get jobs for the poor. That's when
she heard a radio advertisement for Trump's Castle.
   She wrote to multi-millionaire developer Donald Trump with an
idea: Why not take people off the welfare lines and see if they
want to work in his casino?
   Trump did not write back, but his staff at Trump's Castle
responded to her request.
   ``She's phenomenal,'' said Judy Ruchser, the casino's personnel
manager. ``She does not take `no' for an answer. ... She's a person
with an astute business sense who just happened to devote her life
to Christ.
   ``She'd be a hell of an executive,'' Ms. Ruchser said. ``She
sets her sights on something and nothing will stop her.''
   Sister Carmela said she was ``troubled by reading about all
these welfare recipients living in the motels.''
   ``It's a terrible waste of taxpayers' money to pay $1,500 a
month for a room. They can't cook meals and many of them are run
down. This is making them dependent and many of them could get
jobs,'' she said.
   All Sister Carmela had to do was find potential workers. She
headed to the Pemberton Township welfare office, about 30 miles
north of here, at the beginning of June to interview recipients as
they picked up their welfare checks. Of the first 45 people she
talked to, she referred 15 to the casino.
   With her own money, Sister Carmela bought a van to get the 15
casino employees from Burlington County to Atlantic City. Each
contributes a small fee to help with the vehicle's monthly
payments, Ms. Ruchser said. The nun is also helping some of the new
employees by finding day care for their children.
   In a sense, Sister Carmela is a one-person REACH program _ doing
work similar to the state's Realizing Economic Achievement program
that is designed to remove people from welfare rolls.
   ``Just knowing you have a job automatically makes you feel
better,'' said one of the nun's beneficiaries, Amanda Banks. ``I'm
56 years old and I'm making more money than I ever made in my
life.''
   Larry Edwards, who hopes to be promoted from housekeeper to
limousine driver, said, ``I was out of work since August, and I was
at the end of my rope. I hate welfare. I want to earn my own money,
my own self-respect.''
   The Trump employees _ mostly hired as housekeepers _ previously
made about $140 a month on general assistance but are now grossing
$292 a week in Atlantic City, with benefits and free meals.
   An employment specialist at Trump's Castle, Margaret Wilcockson,
said the casino is willing to hire 30 more of Sister Carmela's
``find.''
   After 43 years in the religious community, Sister Carmela said,
she was tempted to retire two months ago. Instead, she decided to
begin a personal ministry to help the poor.
   ``The main thing is restoring their dignity,'' Sister Carmela
said. ``Once they can get a job and buy their own clothes and pay
their own rent, then they realize they are a person.''

   This isn't Gotham City, and Scott
Chinery isn't the caped crusader, but that's the Batmobile he's
been cruising around town in.
   Chinery, a 27-year-old entrepreneur who collects expensive and
unusual cars, bought the car for $180,000 from Fantasy Cars, a
California company that deals mainly in vehicles used in movies and
TV shows. It was delivered Monday.
   ``I started my car collection with Matchbox cars when I was 5
years old,'' he said. ``As my income grew, so did my car
collection.''
   Chinery, who founded a sports nutrition company based in Brick
Township, is about to open a stereo store. The Batmobile will be
used to promote that store and various charities, he said.
   The Batmobile that Chinery bought is actually one of two
functioning all-metal versions built in 1964 for stunts and driving
sequences in the television program ``Batman.'' The car has a
2,000-pound body.
   ``It doesn't really go that fast, maybe 100 (mph) tops,'' said
Chinery, who also bought the Batcycle, the original motorcycle and
motorized sidecar used by Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder.
   But he says that compared to the rest of his car collection, the
Batmobile ``is a piece of history that is the most famous car in
the world.''

   The lover's pop-lyric lament that all
he has to do is dream may have some basis in scientific fact,
according to research presented at an international conference on
dreamwork.
   The vast landscape of dreams is in fact a form of thinking that
could be used to diagnose illness, change neurotic behavior and
enhance artistic creativity, according to scientists meeting
Wednesday at the Fifth Annual Conference for the Study of Dreams.
   Researchers, including a world authority on nightmares, are
investigating topics that include women's dreams, and why some
people recall dreams and others don't.
   The dreamworkers are collecting thousands of dreams from
classrooms, clinics, tribes and diaries into a library that will be
used to study how dreams vary, or don't vary, from decade to decade.
   ``They will become a vast `dreams archive,''' said Bill Domhoff,
professor of psychology at the University of California at Santa
Cruz, where the conference will continue through Saturday.
   ``People 100 years from now will know what we were dreaming in
the '50s and the '80s,'' he said.

   It took an emergency order from Mayor Joe
Smitherman to save Whitey the cat from a steamy death in the trunk
of a locked car.
   The cat on Tuesday jumped unnoticed into the trunk of the car,
spending six hours trapped in the locked trunk. As mid-day
temperatures soared, the cat's cries grew weaker as frantic
passersby gathered around the car and searched for the car's owner.
   Unable to locate the owner, the president of the local humane
society called the mayor's office with word of the predicament.
Smitherman contacted police and empowered an officer to break into
the car to rescue the cat.
   Drenched in sweat, its body limp, the white female cat was taken
to Selma Animal Hospital, where a veterinarian treated it for heat
stroke. Whitey was later listed in serious but stable condition and
doctors expected it to recover.

neurological problems, according to a study published today.
   The research concludes that contrary to common medical belief,
people can suffer these nervous system symptoms from vitamin B-12
deficiency even if they don't show signs of anemia or enlarged red
blood cells.
   ``It's not real oddball and rare, but it's also not found in the
majority of patients,'' said Dr. John Lindenbaum.
   He said doctors see five or six such cases each year at New
York's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and Harlem Hospital
Centers, where the research was conducted.
   In an editorial published with the study in the New England
Journal of Medicine, Dr. William S. Beck of Massachusetts General
Hospital called the finding ``provacative and encouraging.'' But he
said they need to be confirmed by other researchers.
   Among the symptoms attributed to vitamin B-12 deficiency were
tingling and numbness of the fingers and toes, walking
difficulties, memory loss, dementia and fatigue.
   The doctors found blood to be normal in 34 of 141 patients with
the deficiency. Some had been incorrectly diagnosed as having other
problems, including strokes. All of the patients responded to
injections of the vitamin.
   They recommended that physicians check patients' vitamin B-12
levels when trying to diagnose unexplainable neurological problems.
   ``The approach to this problem is not to give everybody and
their mother-in-law vitamin B-12 shots at the drop of a symptom but
to document that they are vitamin B-12 deficient and then treat
them,'' Lindenbaum said.
   Vitamin B-12 is available as pills, but injections are more
effective, he said. He also cautioned against people taking the
vitamin without being advised by a physician.

   The Communist Party's first conference in 47
years, though far from the wide-open battles of Western
conventions, is exposing discord rarely seen since the turbulent
decade after the Bolshevik Revolution.
   For two nights in a row, Soviet television viewers have seen
members of their nation's only political party disagree with one
another and with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Only selected segments of the conference are being shown on
television and foreign and most Soviet reporters are barred from
the conference hall.
   But accounts in the state-run media and comments from delegates
make clear this is not a routine Kremlin gathering of tame,
stone-faced delegates applauding and voting in unison.
   The squabbles and splits over everything from the economy and
ethnic issues to the press and politics signal the kind of break
with vestiges of the Stalinist past that Gorbachev advocated in his
keynote address Tuesday.
   In the early 1920s, internal party battles were fierce and
obvious. But Josef Stalin took the fighting behind tightly shut
doors, then eliminated it in a gruesome wave of show trials and
executions.
   When Nikita S. Khrushchev denounced Stalin in 1956, he did so in
a ``secret speech'' that still has not been published in the Soviet
Union.
   Even the new Soviet openness has not fully penetrated the
infighting in the party leadership. In November, Boris N. Yeltsin
was fired from his job as Moscow party chief for attacking the slow
pace of reform.
   His speech remains unpublished.
   Gorbachev made it clear Tuesday that his drive for ``glasnost,''
or openness, should not become weighted in favor of liberals.
   When actor Mikhail Ulyanov complained to the conference on
Wednesday that the state-run media have become a combative force,
Gorbachev peered over from his perch on the dais to interrupt.
   ``In the past, there was a monopoly on the media by one group of
people, and we know what that has brought about,'' the Soviet
leader said.
   ``Now we see another group, acting very gradually, wants to use
the press as a national rostrum ... We want the pluralism of
views.''
   In a 3{-hour keynote speech, Gorbachev lambasted conservative
apparatchiks for blocking change and outlined plans for
redistributing political power so the party is no longer involved
in the day-to-day business of governing.
   But he made clear it was not too late for opponents to climb on
the bandwagon of reform.
   In the 15 minutes allotted to them, delegates have taken a much
more strident stance for or against economic reform, political
change and the increasing outspokenness of the Soviet press.
   There has been no hint of a split in the Politburo or criticism
by name of the party leadership. But Gorbachev's proposals came
under fire right after they were unveiled.
   Economist Leonid Abalkin, a noted reformer, labeled as
undemocratic the suggestion that local Communist chiefs should head
local governing councils.
   Abalkin even uttered the once-unthinkable phrase ``multi-party
system'' as he asked whether one-party rule could guarantee
unfettered political debate.
   That passage of his speech was not televised. But word of it got
to reporters, prompting party officials to read the relevant
passage to reporters.
   Western reporters treated to numerous briefings with delegates
have gleaned more about the debates than Soviet citizens restricted
to reading their newspapers or watching television.
   As in the West, pre-conference battles presaged the sniping now
seen in debate as reformers battled conservatives over the delegate
slate.
   In Leningrad, Moscow, Yaroslavl and Omsk, angry citizens took to
the streets to protest conservatives maneuvering against reformers.
   ``Sometimes, really it was turbulent,'' said author and
Leningrad delegate Daniil Granin of the battles in his city. In two
cases, popular protests even led to the disqualification of
delegates.
   On Wednesday, there was a hint that more delegates may be barred
when F.V. Popov, party chief in the Siberian Altai region, pointed
to allegations that some Uzbek delegates had taken bribes. An
investigation was promised.
   The bribery charges were first published in the weekly Ogonyok,
a forthright advocates of openness that was itself criticized by
some delegates.
   Vladimir Karpov, head of the Soviet Writers' Union, complained
that some writers are filling in the blank spots in Soviet history
by painting them totally black.
   Karpov's deputy, Yuri Bondarev, charged that nihilistic
criticism is becoming a commanding force in the press: ``The
immorality of the press cannot teach morality.''
   Grigory Baklanov, chief editor of the literary magazine Znamya,
called Karpov's and Bondarev's comments a disgrace.
   ``If I'm given the floor, I'll certainly say what I think,'' he
told a news conference, holding out promise of more delegate
battles before the gathering ends.

<HEAD>Agency Decides Against Regulating Oil Wastes As Hazardous</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has
decided against regulating oil and gas drilling wastes as hazardous
material, saying another layer of regulation is impractical for the
hundreds of thousands of wells across the country.
   But the agency is promising to get tough on states that fail to
enforce existing regulations governing the disposal of such wastes
as brine and drilling muds, and ensuring abandoned wells are capped.
   ``It was a tough decision but I think we made the right
decision,'' said J. Winston Porter, EPA's assistant administrator
for solid waste and emergency response. ``We were concerned about
layering on another level of regulations.''
   The biggest problem found by the EPA at the nation's wells was
the disposal of brine _ salt water that is extracted from wells in
the drilling process. Porter said regulations already exist to
cover that problem.
   An environmental group criticized the decision as contrary to
the public interest.
   ``These substances ... do contain hazardous wastes with names 14
syllables long,'' said Mike Matz, Alaska representative of the
Sierra Club. ``Clearly the EPA once again is favoring big oil and
big business and is shunning its responsibility to protect the
public health and the environment.''
   Congress in 1976 gave EPA authority to decide what waste needs
to be covered by the strict handling and disposal regulations that
apply to hazardous wastes, but it required a study before decisions
could be made about oil and gas production wastes.
   EPA in December completed the study and then allowed public
comment before drafting its recommendations. The final report was
to be presented to Congress today.
   EPA estimated in its report that oil and gas production would be
cut up to 12 percent if drilling wastes were treated as hazardous.
The cost of the program would have been at least $1 billion and
could have ranged up to $6 billion, Porter said.
   The American Petroleum Institute had put those costs much higher
_ up to $37 billion the first year and $7 billion annually
thereafter.
   EPA said stripper wells _ those that generally produce less than
10 barrels a day _ could not have easily absorbed the additional
costs for hazardous waste management.
   Oil-state lawmakers such as Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas, opposed
any new treatment requirements. He said compliance would have been
virtually impossible from an economic standpoint and in many
instances unnecessary.
   Laws dealing with hazardous wastes are ``not very flexible and
just didn't seem to fit this industry very well,'' Porter said.

<HEAD>Capitol Hill Deluged with Drought-Fighting Proposals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blazing sun may be baking the midcontinent,
but proposals for fighting the drought are raining down on Capitol
Hill.
   ``This is certainly the worst drought that this country has
suffered since the droughts of the 30s,'' Sen. John Melcher,
D-Mont., said Wednesday in calling for stepped-up federal aid.
``Our farmers are staggering.''
   Proposals ranged from cancellation of a 50-cent cut in dairy
price supports to an evangelist's ``haylift'' of livestock feed to
South Dakota.
   Democratic presidential nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis huddled
with farm Democrats at the Capitol on Wednesday to discuss the
plight of farmers.
   ``I think the governor's attitude was very reassuring to all of
us,'' said Rep. Thomas Foley, D-Wash., after the session. ``He
doesn't come with a lot of preconceived technical proposals. He's
there to get our counsel and advice.''
   Meanwhile, Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and David Pryor, D-Ark.,
lent their support to a ``haylift'' designed to feed 2,000 to 3,000
head of cattle in South Dakota for a month.
   The Rev. Larry Jones, an Oklahoma City evangelist, developed the
plan to load hay onto 15 railroad cars for transport to South
Dakota, where livestock producers are desperate to replace feed
burned away by the sun.
   A lottery might be needed to determine who gets the feed, said
Dallas Tonsager, president of the South Dakota Farmers Union, since
3,000 head represent only a small fraction of the South Dakota
herd. He expressed gratitude, though, to Jones for his effort.
   ``They say that a rising tide raises all boats,'' Jones
declared. ``But everybody does not have a boat and those who do not
have a boat when the tide rises drown. Rural America is drowning.''
   Livestock producers are being forced to sell their herds for
lack of feed, creating a buyer's market and thus driving down
prices.
   ``The situation is going from bad to worse,'' Daschle said.
``Each day additional herds are shipped south and out of state.''
   An hour later in the same Senate committee room, Melcher
unveiled a wide-ranging drought relief bill at another news
conference.
   It would guarantee income-support payments to farm program
participants whose crops fail, and provide payments for growers of
crops not covered by a USDA program. It also would authorize the
secretary of agriculture to make irrigation grants.
   Federal officials would be directed to transport cattle out of
drought-stricken areas hit by shortages of livestock feed. The bill
also would cancel an expected 50-cent cut in dairy prices supports
set for next year.
   Melcher's plan received support from Sens. Howell Heflin,
D-Ala.; Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Kent
Conrad, D-N.D.
   Elsewhere, Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich met with lawmakers on
drought-fighting strategy and then headed down Independence Avenue
to the Agriculture Department to try the plan on Secretary Richard
E. Lyng.
   It was Perpich's second trip to Washington in recent weeks. Last
time, he urged Lyng to allow hay cutting and grazing on
Conservation Reserve Program acreage. The secretary balked but a
few days later relented under heavy pressure from Congress.
   ``We have to send a signal that we are going to keep farmers on
the land over this difficult period,'' Perpich said.
   His latest proposal would delay the 50 cent dairy price-support
reduction and allow farmers to keep government payments they have
received in advance, even if the effect of the drought would
otherwise shrink the amount.
   It also would provide special benefits for farmers who donate
hay from Conservation Reserve Program acreage and assure
income-support payments later in the season even if crops are wiped
out.

   Fights broke out at the county jail as
four captured escapees were being placed in isolation, injuring 10
deputies and seven inmates, authorities said.
   The trouble began about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, when guards
attempted to move three of the escapees from a large room, where
several inmates are housed, according to guards who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The other inmates protested and a fight ensued with prisoners
breaking off furniture and using the broken parts as weapons,
authorities said.
   The riot was put down in 30 minutes and inmates at the Bexar
County Adult Detention Center were locked in cells, authorities
said.
   Guards said at least seven prisoners were injured. Officials at
Santa Rosa Hospital, who declined to give their names, said many of
the guards and prisoners being treated suffered injuries such as
broken fingers and broken hands.
   County Sheriff Harlon Copeland declined to comment about the
disorder.
   The four had escaped from the new $40 million on May 10, using
toenail clippers to cut through a wire fence.

<HEAD>Poll: Reagan Good with Soviets but Bungled Iran, Central America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national poll shows public support for
President Reagan's dealings with the Soviet Union but disapproval
of his policies in Central America and the Mideast.
   Three-quarters of Americans surveyed approve of Reagan's
handling of Soviet relations, but only 46 percent like his overall
foreign policy, according to the nonpartisan ``Americans Talk
Security'' poll released Wednesday.
   Sixty-two percent think he mishandled Iran; 63 percent disagree
with his Central America policies, and 63 percent think he has done
too little to solve conflicts in the Mideast, according to the
survey.
   The poll results also reflect heightened concern over
international trade and drug trafficking. For example, 63 percent
of those surveyed said Reagan should do more to combat
international drug dealing.
   Improved U.S.-Soviet relations probably have helped those issues
come to the fore, one pollster said.
   ``Reagan has sapped political concern on the issue'' of
U.S.-Soviet relations, said John Martilla, who conducted the survey
as part of a bipartisan series. Martilla also conducts polls for
Michael Dukakis, the apparent Democratic presidential nominee.
   Another pollster taking part in the series, Fred Steeper, said
Reagan's success in dealing with Moscow ``has removed from the
Republican bag of tricks the ability to run against the Soviets.''
Steeper also conducts polls for Republican presidential candidate
George Bush.
   The survey was based on interviews with 1,003 voters before the
Moscow summit, May 29-June 2, and had a margin of error of 3.1
percentage points, according to Martilla and Steeper, who presented
it at a news conference.
   The survey also showed disagreement with the U.S. policy to use
nuclear weapons if the conventional armies of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization are not able to stop a Soviet invasion of
Western Europe.
   Only 8 percent of those surveyed said nuclear weapons should be
used if the ``Soviets have successfully invaded Western Europe
without nuclear weapons.''
   The poll also showed that the public holds some contradictory
attitudes about foreign affairs.
   For example, even though 57 percent of the public agreed that
``it's only a matter of time before Japan becomes the number one
economic power in the world,'' 56 percent said `the U.S. will
continue to be the greatest economic power well into the next
century.''
   The U.S. gross national product is far larger than that of
Japan, although the Japanese GNP is slightly higher on a per capita
basis.
   Americans thought Reagan has done a good job on traditional
national security issues: 75 percent liked him for ``standing up to
the Soviets;'' 73 percent thought he has kept America out of war;
75 percent liked his arms control policies; 71 percent thought he
had developed a sound national defense; 61 percent commended him
for an ``appropriate use of military power;'' 59 percent thought he
had promoted the spread of democracy; 58 percent thought he had
prevented the spread of communism; 61 percent liked his policy in
the Persian Gulf; and 54 percent thought he had won respect for the
United States.
   ``Yet, despite these truly impressive ratings, only 46 percent
of the American people ``approve of the way Ronald Reagan is
handling foreign policy,'' while 47 percent disapprove, according
to the survey.
   Also, 48 percent approved and 48 percent did not approve of his
efforts in fighting terrorism; 51 percent thought he had not helped
make the United States a strong competitor on the international
market, versus 48 percent who thought he had; and 29 percent did
not approve of his handling of relations with Panamanian leader
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.

   Here are some of the major developments in the
investigation of Defense Department procurement practicies.
   
   HALTING CONTRACTS=
   
   The Pentagon's top purchasing official, Robert B. Costello, said
he would talk with Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci today about
a suggestion to halt contracts with companies involved in the
criminal investigation. Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Carlucci
should order ``absolutely no contracts signed for 60 days (or) six
weeks'' with those companies.
   
   DESTROYED DOCUMENTS?=
   
   In Brooklyn, court papers filed by the U.S. attorney heading the
investigation said he has learned of several instances of documents
being destroyed by people implicated in the probe.
   Henry Hudson provided no details on who destroyed documents, how
they were destroyed or how they might have been related to the
investigation.
   
   CHANGE OF VIEW=
   
   Costello, the Defense Department undersecretary for acquisition
policy, told the House Armed Services Committee he no longer backs
the position he took in a May 5 memo that Pentagon officials should
be empowered to block fraud investigators from searching defense
contractor facilities.
   Costello repeatedly defended the Defense Department procurement
policies of the Reagan administration. Congress can enact new laws
and the Pentagon can pass new regulations, but there is no way to
ensure against greed, Costello said.
   
   LEVIN-PAISLEY=
   
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., asked the FBI to give Congress its
file on Melvyn Paisley, a former Pentagon procurement official
under investigation in connection with alleged fraud and bribery in
defense purchasing.
   
   INSPECTOR GENERAL=
   
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said the Pentagon inspector
general's office has reopened its investigation into a disputed
contract in the wake of the separate criminal investigation of
bribery and fraud in Defense Department weapons purchases.
   
   CONGRESS-MONEY=
   
   Leading defense contractors contributed more than two-thirds of
the honoraria received by members of the House and Senate
committees responsible for defense-related legislation, said Common
Cause, a liberal lobby organization.

<HEAD>Miniskirts Banned At Regatta, Thigh-Spotters On Duty</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   HENLEY-ON-THAMES, England (AP) _ Miniskirts may be high fashion,
but if they're more than two inches above the knee they will keep
you out of the exclusive enclosure for ticket-holders at the Henley
Royal Regatta.
   ``Henley has retained its Victorian-Edwardian style in almost
every respect, including its standards of dress and adherence to
the rule book,'' a spokesman said Wednesday, the first day of the
149th annual rowing event.
   Stewards, or race organizers, will not examine all of the
250,000 people who attend the prestigious four-day regatta on the
Thames River, a highlight of Britain's summer social season.
   But they will inform women who enter the stewards' enclosure
with ``inappropriate'' hem height of their objections, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The enclosure, with bar and dining facilities, is reserved for
stewards and their guests.
   Regatta officials said ``a number'' of women were turned away
from the enclosure for wearing short skirts Wednesday, but did not
specify how many.
   ``If you go with women's fashion you end up with middle-aged
women displaying thighs they should have kept secret for years,''
said Peter Coni, chairman of the Regatta Committee.
   ``You have got to have strict rules which don't place a burden
on people at the gates having to make judgments on whether someone
is sexy or not.''
   The regatta's strict dress code also requires men entering the
enclosure to wear suits or a jacket and pants and a tie. Women are
not permitted to wear short skirts, slacks or culottes.
   No one is admitted to the enclosure wearing shorts, jeans or
anything made of denim.

   Here are excerpts of the Supreme Court
decision upholding the law that allows independent counsels to
investigate alleged wrongdoing by high-ranking government
officials, and of the dissent to that ruling.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.
   This case presents us with a challenge to the independent
counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. ... We
hold today that these provisions of the Act do not violate the
Appointments Clause of the Constitution ... nor do they
impermissibly interfere with the president's authority under
Article II in violation of the constitutional principle of
separation of powers.
   We do not mean to say that Congress' power to provide for
interbranch appointments of ``inferior officers'' is unlimited. ...
   In this case, however, we do not think it impermissible for
Congress to vest the power to appoint independent counsels in a
specially created federal court. We thus disagree with the court of
appeals' conclusion that there is an inherent incongruity about a
court having the power to appoint prosecutorial officers.
   Congress of course was concerned when it created the office of
independent counsel with the conflicts of interest that could arise
in situations when the executive branch is called upon to
investigate its own high-ranking officers. If it were to remove the
appointing authority from the executive branch, the most logical
place to put it was in the judicial branch. In the light of the
Act's provision making the judges of the special division
ineligible to participate in any matters relating to an independent
counsel they have appointed, we do not think that appointment of
the independent counsels by the court runs afoul of the
constitutional limitation on ``incongruous'' interbranch
appointments.
   Most importantly, the Act vests in the special division the
power to choose who will serve as independent counsel and the power
to define his or her jurisdiction. Clearly, once it is accepted
that the appointments clause gives Congress the power to vest the
appointment of officials such as the independent counsel in the
``courts of law,'' there can be no Article III objection to the
special division's exercise of that power, as the power itself
derives from the appointments clause, a source of authority for
judicial action that is independent of Article III. Appellees
contend, however, that the division's appointments clause powers do
not encompass the power to define the independent counsel's
jurisdiction. We disagree. In our view, Congress' power under the
clause to vest the ``appointment'' of inferior officers in the
courts may, in certain circumstances, allow Congress to give the
courts some discretion in defining the nature and scope of the
appointed official's authority.
   We think that the court of appeals overstated the matter when it
described the power to terminate as a ``broadsword and ... rapier''
that enables the court to ``control the pace and depth of the
independent counsel's activities.'' The provision has not been
tested in practice, and we do not mean to say that an adventurous
special court could not reasonably construe the provision as did
the court of appeals; but it is the duty of federal courts to
construe a statute in order to save it from constitutional
infirmities, and to that end we think a narrow construction is
appropriate here. The termination provisions of the Act do not give
the special division anything approaching the power to remove the
counsel while an investigation or court proceeding is still under
way _ this power is vested solely in the attorney general. ... It
is basically a device for removing from the public payroll an
independent counsel who has served her purpose, but is unwilling to
acknowledge the fact.
   We now turn to consider whether the Act is valid under the
constitutional principle of separation of powers. Two related
issues must be addressed: The first is whether the provision of the
Act restricting the attorney general's power to remove the
independent counsel to only those instances in which he can show
``good cause,'' taken by itself, impermissibly interferes with the
president's exercise of his constitutionally appointed functions.
The second is whether, taken as a whole, the Act violates the
separation of powers by reducing the president's ability to control
the prosecutorial powers wielded by the independent counsel.
   Considering for the moment the ``good cause'' removal provision
in isolation from the other parts of the Act at issue in this case,
we cannot say that the imposition of a ``good cause'' standard for
removal by itself unduly trammels on executive authority. There is
no real dispute that the functions performed by the independent
counsel are ``executive'' in the sense that they are law
enforcement functions that typically have been undertaken by
officials within the executive branch. As we noted above, however,
the independent counsel is an inferior officer under the
appointments clause, with limited jurisdiction and tenure and
lacking policymaking or significant administrative authority.
Although the counsel exercises no small amount of discretion and
judgment in deciding how to carry out her duties under the Act, we
simply do not see how the president's need to control the exercise
of that discretion is so central to the functioning of the
executive branch as to require as a matter of constitutional law
that the counsel be terminable at will by the president.
   Nor do we think that the ``good cause'' removal provision at
issue here impermissibly burdens the president's power to control
or supervise the independent counsel, as an executive official, in
the execution of her duties under the Act. This is not a case in
which the power to remove an executive official has been completely
stripped from the president, thus providing no means for the
president to ensure the ``faithful execution'' of the laws.
   The final question to be addressed is whether the Act, taken as
a whole, violates the principle of separation of powers by unduly
interfering with the role of the executive branch.

<TEXT>
   We observe first that this case does not involve an attempt by
Congress to increase its own powers at the expense of the executive
branch. Unlike some of our previous cases, most recently Bowsher v.
Synar, this case simply does not pose a ``danger of congressional
usurpation of executive branch functions. Indeed, with the
exception of the power of impeachment _ which applies to all
officers of the United States _ Congress retained for itself no
powers of control or supervision over an independent counsel.
   Similarly, we do not think that the Act works any judicial
usurpation of properly executive functions. ...
   Finally, we do not think that the Act ``impermisssibly
undermines the powers of the executive branch, or ``disrupts the
proper balance between the coordinate branches (by) prevent(ing)
the executive branch from accomplishing its constitutionally
assigned functions. ...
   The attorney general is not allowed to appoint the individual of
his choice; he does not determine the counsel's jurisdiction; and
his power to remove a counsel is limited. Nonetheless, the Act does
give the attorney general several means of supervising or
controlling the prosecutorial powers that may be wielded by an
independent counsel. Most importantly, the attorney general retains
the power to remove the counsel of ``good cause,'' a power that we
have already concluded provides the executive with substantial
ability to ensure that the laws are ``faithfuly executed'' by
independent counsel.
   In sum, we conclude today that it does not violate the
appointments clause for Congress to vest the appointment of
independent counsels in the special division; that the powers
exercised by the special division under the Act do not violate
Article III; and tht the Act does not violate the separation of
powers principle by impermissibly interfering with the functions of
the executive branch. The decision of the court of appeals is
therefore reversed.

   Dissent by Judge Antonin Scalia:
   The framers of the federal Constitution ... viewed the principle
of separation of powers as the absolutely central guarantee of a
just government. ... Without a secure structure of separated
powers, our Bill of Rights would be worthless, as the bills of
rights of many nations of the world that have adopted, or even
improved upon, the mere words of ours.
   That is what this suit is about. Power. The allocation of power
among Congress, the president and the courts in such fashion as to
preserve the equilibrium the Constitution sought to establish _ so
that ``a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same
department can effectively be resisted. Frequently an issue of this
sort will come before the court clad, so to speak, in sheep's
clothing: the potential of the asserted principle to effect
important change in the equilibrium of power is not immediately
evident, and must be discerned by a careful and perceptive
analysis. But this wolf comes as a wolf.
   The context of this statute is acrid with the smell of
threatened impeachment. Where, as here, a request for appointment
of an independent counsel has come from the Judiciary Committee of
either house of Congress, the attorney general must, if he decides
not to seek appointment, explain to that committee why.
   Thus, by the application of this statute in the present case,
Congress has effectively compelled a criminal investigation of a
high-level appointee of the president in connection with his
actions arising out of a bitter power dispute between the president
and the legislative branch.
   The court devotes most of its attention to such relatively
technical details as the appointments clause and the removal power,
addressing briefly and only at the end of its opinion the
separation of powers. As my prologue suggests, I think that has it
backwards.
   In sum, this statute does deprive the president of substantial
control over the prosecutory functions performed by the independent
counsel, and it does substantially affect the balance of powers.
That the court could possibly conclude otherwise demonstrates both
the wisdom of our former constitutional system, in which the degree
of reduced control and political impairment were irrelevant, since
all purely executive power had to be in the president; and the
folly of the new system of standardless judicial allocation of
powers we adopt today.
   The notion that every violation of law should be prosecuted,
including _ indeed, especially _ every violation by those in high
places, is an attracive one, and it would be risky to argue in an
election campaign that that is not an absolutely overriding value.
Fiat justitia, ruat coelum. Let justice be done, though the heavens
may fall. ... By its short-sighted action today, I fear the court
has permanently encumbered the Republic with an institution that
will do it great harm.
   Worse than what it has done, however, is the manner in which it
has done it. A government of laws means a government of rules.
Today's decision on the basic issue of fragmentation of executive
powers is ungoverned by rule, and hence ungoverned by law.

<HEAD>Bakker Joins Gang Of Four Hoping To Buy PTL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker presented a $100 million offer
for the failing PTL ministry during a bankruptcy court session in
which his wife, Tammy, sobbed when the judge ordered the sale of
the Bakkers' former parsonage.
   PTL trustee M.C. Benton, who said he has received four offers,
one for $200 million, to buy the ministry, promised that the former
television evangelist's proposal ``will be considered along with
everyone else'' if he can back it up.
   ``We are ready to go forward with earnest negotiations,'' Bakker
told reporters Tuesday outside U.S. Bankruptcy Court. But he
refused to identify who provided him with the $100 million line of
credit to buy PTL.
   The appearance of the Bakkers sensationalized an otherwise
routine, 2{-hour bankruptcy hearing. They received a standing
ovation when they entered the courtroom, Tammy wearing a linen
dress studded with pearls and Bakker with a crisp, double-breasted
gray suit.
   ``Look how pretty she looks,'' whispered Bee Huffman, who said
she supports the return of the Bakkers to PTL.
   Judge Rufus Reynolds gave initial approval to PTL's
reorganization plan, which calls for sale of the 2,300-acre
Heritage USA religious theme park in Fort Mill. He ordered the plan
sent to creditors for a vote next month.
   Mrs. Bakker broke into tears and sobbed for several minutes
after Reynolds initially agreed to sell the PTL parsonage where the
Bakkers lived while running the ministry.
   Reynolds later rescinded the order and said PTL could auction
the mansion to one of two proposed bidders _ neither of them
connected to the Bakkers _ on Tuesday.
   Bakker, with the letter of credit in his uplifted hand, said he
was ``committed to the restoration (of PTL) as a Christian retreat
center, to pay all creditors 100 percent on the dollar, to restore
all lifetime partner benefits ... everything restored and all the
people back happy and caring and ministering one to another.''
   Benton said he hopes to decide which proposed buyer to present
to the court by mid-August. Informed of the $200 million offer from
a group Benton would not identify, Bakker told reporters he doubted
its legitimacy.
   ``So far all we see is smoke,'' he said, adding that his lender
was ``prepared to go higher'' than his $100 million offer.
   Asked why he was not willing to provide more details of his
financial backing, Bakker's attorney, James Toms, interjected,
``That's all we're prepared to say at this time.''
   The reorganization plan outlines the sale of Heritage USA to pay
creditors and the formation of a debt-free, non-profit ministry.
   The plan would give lifetime partners, major contributors who
were promised free lodging and other benefits for every $1,000
donation, the option of relinquishing their claims. If they did,
they would become voting members of the new Heritage Ministries Inc.
   Reynolds ordered ballots sent to creditors July 15 and set an
Aug. 24 deadline to confirm or reject the plan. PTL, with debts of
up to $130 million and assets of $160 million, filed for bankruptcy
reorganization in June 1987.
   Reynolds also granted PTL permission to use $800,000 of the
proceeds from property sales, normally frozen by the court during
bankruptcy proceedings, to cover a shortfall at the ministry.
   Benton said contributions to the ministry hit an all-time low
this month. ``We are at the end of the rope in cutting operational
activities,'' he told Reynolds. ``We are hanging by a thread.''
   In Charlotte, N.C., meanwhile, the federal grand jury
investigating possible mail, wire and tax fraud by Bakker and
former associates has been given six more months to complete its
probe into how the ministry raised and spent millions of dollars.
   Prosecutors are trying to find out whether Bakker and his aides
raised money for one purpose and used it for another.
   Bakker, who moved back to the Fort Mill area earlier this month,
resigned in March 1987 from the ministry he built after admitting
that he had a sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn and that cash
payments were made to silence her.

<HEAD>Dry Weather Has Forest Officials Worried About Devastating Fire
Year</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Drought-Diner, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A year after one of the worst summer fire seasons
this century for the nation's forests, government and timber
industry officials are worried the drought may be bringing even
more devastating conditions.
   In some parts, ``the conditions we are experiencing now are very
similar to what we would expect to be experiencing in August, at
the height of the fire season,'' said Paul Weeden, a U.S. Forest
Service emergency operations specialist in Washington, D.C.
   Although there are ``pockets of wetness'' in some forests,
Weeden said Wednesday, most of the nation has a high fire danger,
with some areas facing very high or extreme risks. Many areas are
in their second year or more of drought, he said, with the
hardest-hit areas in the Pacific Northwest, California and parts of
the Southeast, particularly North Carolina.
   The dry weather also wilts tree seedlings, slows growth and
makes trees more susceptible to insects, especially bark beetles,
Weeden said.
   If dry conditions continue for another month, an estimated 5.7
billion board feet of timber could be lost to the quarter-inch
beetles, which eat the cambium between the tree's bark and wood, he
said.
   ``That's a pretty significant number because the average annual
allowable cut for the Forest Service is about 11 billion board
feet,'' he said.
   Weyerhaeuser Co. expects to lose 15 percent of its 38 million
seedlings in the South because of the drought, said John McMahon,
vice president of timberlands. Last year, McMahon told The Wall
Street Journal in an article published Wednesday, Weyerhaeuser had
to replant 4 percent of its seedlings nationwide.
   Fire is the most immediate threat to the nation's dry forests.
   Last year, fires burned almost 5 million acres of government and
private timber, worth $1.2 billion, Weeden said. It was the worst
fire year for federal lands since 1919.
   One of the largest fires so far this year burned 58,300 acres of
parched timber and grasslands in and near the Custer National
Forest along the Montana-South Dakota border. Firefighters brought
it under control Wednesday.
   In Wyoming, erratic winds hindered 389 firefighters trying to
control a 1,150-acre fire that was sparked by lightning and
threatened critical grizzly bear and bald eagle habitat in the
Shoshone National Forest.
   And Southern California firefighters battled two Riverside
County brush fires that charred 1,125 acres. Authorities hoped to
encircle the largest blaze, 1,000 acres, by tonight.
   Nearly 800,000 acres of California timberland were lost to fire
last year, and officials are edgy. Even though the state's forests
got some rain recently, ``We're still in extreme danger,'' said
Roberta Andersen, vice president of the Timber Association of
California in Sacramento.
   ``The fire season started real early,'' said Brian Barrette,
staff chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection. ``It was running at least six weeks ahead of normal.''
   Temperatures cooled in May, but not enough to affect the
dried-out trees in many California forests, Barrette said. With a
30- to 60-day outlook for above-normal temperatures, ``it's a
pretty good indication that we'll have some real problems,'' he
said.
   In the Northwest, the Cascade Mountains divide the fire danger:
On the wetter west side, conditions are about normal, but to the
east, forests are facing a fourth consecutive dry year.
   ``There was no significant rain this spring. The little bit of
rain we did get gave us good growths of grasses and brush that are
beginning to dry out,'' said Marty Ames, spokeswoman for the
Wenatchee National Forest in central Washington. ``It doesn't look
like the weather is going to bring any relief.''

<HEAD>Journal To Investigate `Unbelievable' Experimental Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prestigious journal announced today it will
launch an independent investigation of a series of experimental
findings that have been confirmed around the world yet defy any
conceivable scientific explanation.
   Researchers at five separate laboratories in France, Canada,
Israel and Italy reported today they have identified a curious
antibody reaction involving human blood cells that should, by any
imaginable theory, be impossible.
   ``It's unbelievable and it breaks all the rules,'' said one of
the researchers, Patricia Fortner, an immunology research associate
at the University of Toronto.
   The researchers have found that antibodies that react with
certain blood cells will continue to react when diluted far beyond
the point where they should theoretically be able to.
   The reaction occurs even at extreme dilutions where there are
theoretically no antibody molecules left in the solution, said
Fortner.
   ``We've all assumed that where there are no molecules present,
nothing will happen,'' Fortner said in an interview Wednesday. But
something does.
   ``This has really shaken up our world,'' she said. ``Even people
who have seen this phenomenon find it hard to believe, because it's
hard to conceive what could be happening here.''
   The report appears in Nature, an influential British medical
journal.
   Nature's editors were as perplexed by the research as were the
researchers. Its referees _ scientific experts chosen to affirm the
soundness of research before it is published _ didn't believe the
result, but couldn't find anything wrong with the conduct of the
experiments, the magazine said.
   ``Readers of this article may share the incredulity of the many
referees who have commented on several versions of it during the
past several months,'' Nature said in an unusual comment, entitled
``Editorial reservation.''
   The scientist principally responsible for the inexplicable
results is Dr. Jacques Benveniste of INSERM, the French medical
research institute.
   The findings are an outgrowth of his efforts to develop a new
blood test to identify allergies.
   Fortner, Bruce Pomeranz and others at the University of Toronto
have independently duplicated Benveniste's findings, as have two
research groups in Israel and one in Milan, Fortner said.
Benveniste was not in his laboratory Wednesday afternoon and could
not be reached for comment.
   In its statement, Nature said of the findings, ``There is no
physical basis for such an activity. With the kind collaboration of
Professor Benveniste, Nature has therefore arranged for independent
investigators to observe repetitions of the experiments.''
   The magazine said a report of the investigation would appear
shortly.
   Other findings by Benveniste have added further mystery. For
example, the phenomenon occurs only when the extremely diluted
solutions are mixed violently in the laboratory, said Fortner.
Without this violent shaking, called succussion, nothing happens.
   Why? Unknown, Fortner said.
   Furthermore, if the extremely diluted solutions are heated or
frozen, which would destroy any antibodies in them, the reaction
doesn't occur, Fortner said.
   Yet there aren't supposed to be any antibodies present, so the
question is: What is being changed?
   Researchers have tried the experiment with chemical agents that
react with the blood cells. They, too, exert their effect at
extreme dilutions, far beyond anything that should be possible.
   Benveniste's findings fuel a long-standing dispute over the
effectiveness of a controversial school of disease treatment called
homeopathy.
   ``Homeopathy basically says that the same substance that can
cause a problem _ if you can identify that element and dilute it
into very small doses, infinitesimal doses, it can cure or
ameliorate those symptoms,'' said Robert Matsuk, a pharmacist at
Boiron-Borneman, a homeopathic pharmaceutical company in Norwood,
Pa.
   Benveniste's findings, if correct, lend support to the claims of
homeopathy.
   Homeopathic practitioners don't claim to understand precisely
how their treatments work, Matsuk said.
   Conventional medical wisdom says that there is no scientific
evidence to support the claims of homeopaths, Fortner said.
   Among Benveniste's collaborators were Elisabeth Davenas, an
adherent of homeopathy and Bernard Poitevin, a homeopathic
physician, Fortner said.
   She said that the researchers speculate that perhaps the water
molecules in the dilute solutions somehow are altered during the
process of successive dilutions to produce the observed reaction.
   ``We have a few theoretical physicists working with us,'' she
said, ``and there are a lot of theories but nothing concrete.''

<HEAD>John Demjanjuk Appeals His Death Sentence For War Crimes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs of background.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired U.S. autoworker John Demjanjuk on
Thursday appealed his conviction and death sentence for Nazi war
crimes, Israel army radio reported.
   The 68-year-old Demjanjuk was sentenced to death on April 25, a
week after being found guilty of being the sadistic guard ``Ivan
the Terrible'' who operated gas chambers at the Treblinka death
camp in Nazi-held Poland.
   About 850,000 Jews were murdered at the camp from 1942-1943,
when Demjanjuk was allegedly at the camp.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk has claimed he is a victim of
mistaken identity and was in two German prisoner-of-war camps
during the period in question.
   In the 100-page appeal, Demjanjuk insists his version is correct
and that he should not be sentenced to death, the radio said.
   Shmaryahu Cohen, a spokesman for Israel's Supreme Court, said
the court will hear the case beginning Dec. 5.
   The appeal will be heard by five justices for three consecutive
days, and then for another three days between Dec. 12 and 15, Cohen
said.
   The Israeli prosecutors are scheduled to reply from Dec. 19 to
Dec. 29.
   Demjanjuk moved to the United States after World War II,
settling in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. He was stripped of his
U.S. citizenship after a court ruled that he had lied on his
application to become an American.
   If the court rejects the appeal, Demjanjuk may become the first
man to be executed in Israel since Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann
was hanged in 1962 after a trial in Jerusalem.
   Eichmann, a high-ranking Nazi official who promoted the use of
gas chambers for mass extermination of Jews and oversaw the murder
of millions of Jews in World War II, was kidnapped by the Israelis
in Argentina in 1960.

   Vladimir P. Kabaidze is no Eddie Murphy, but the
balding factory manager had them chuckling in the Kremlin.
   Kabaidze, a delegate from the city of Ivanovo, provided 15
minutes of comic relief Wednesday during his speech to the the
country's first Communist Party conference in 47 years.
   His one-liners even pierced the stoic armor of President Andrei
Gromyko, who cracked a grim grin.
   Under Kabaidze's earthy language and punchy delivery lurked a
serious critique of Soviet problems, including the unwieldy
bureaucracy and inefficient economy about which Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev so often complains.
   At one point in his speech, Kabaidze waved a fist and said a
factory that has been under construction at Ivanovo for eight years
could have been built in nine months by a South Korean construction
company.
   ``I'm afraid when I'm being carried out feet first, they'll
still be building that factory,'' Kabaidze said.
   In complaining of red tape, the delegate said: ``It's hopeless
to fight paper. We must kill the authors.''
   That's when the smile lit Gromyko's dour visage. The 5,000
delegates from across the vast country laughed and applauded.
   Soviet television broadcast Kabaidze's remarks at least twice,
once during an afternoon newsbreak and again on the evening news
program Vremya. The conference is closed to foreign journalists.
   Kabaidze, a balding man of late middle years, wore a gray suit
adorned with medals in the fashion popular among Soviet officials.
He runs a machine-tool factory in Ivanovo, a city of 500,000 about
150 miles northeast of Moscow.
   Speaking from the podium of the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses
with Gorbachev, Gromyko and the other leaders on the dais behind
him, Kabaidze regaled the hall with his standup routine.
   ``No country has as many ministers as we do, but business
stinks,'' he said at one point.
   ``If a minister catches a mouse, then we will feed him. If he
doesn't, we won't,'' he said at another.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations and the PLO hailed a
federal court decision that blocks a congressional attempt to ban
the PLO's U.N. Mission from the United States.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Wednesday he was
``gratified by this judgment, which demonstrates the respect of the
U.S. courts for the international obligations of the country.''
   Zehdi Labib Terzi, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
ambassador to the U.N., called the ruling a victory for
international law.
   ``The United Nations now has no fear that the host country, or
any host country, can violate its legal obligations and get out
scot-free,'' he said.
   U.S. District Judge Edmund Palmieri ruled that the 1947
agreement that brought the United Nations to the United States
prohibits the government from closing the Palestine Liberation
Organization's observer mission.
   He also said the Anti-Terrorism Act passed by Congress does not
supersede U.S. obligations under the 1947 Headquarters Agreement.
   Palmieri said the language of the Anti-Terrorism Act, which
branded the PLO a terrorist group, does not indicate Congress meant
to abandon America's obligations to the U.N.
   The U.S. Mission to the United Nations said it would have no
comment on the ruling.
   Judge Palmieri dismissed the government's suit with prejudice,
meaning it can't be brought again. It can be appealed to a higher
court.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who argued the government's case
before Palmieri earlier this month, said the decision was being
studied ``and we will make a decision as to further proceedings as
soon as possible.''
   State Department spokesman Dennis Harter in Washington said his
department also was reading the decision and consulting with the
Justice Department. The State Department had opposed the attempt to
close the PLO mission.
   The Justice Department filed suit in March seeking to close the
PLO mission, citing the Anti-Terrorism Act passed by Congress and
reluctantly signed by President Reagan last year.
   The law, which took effect March 21, labeled the PLO and its
affiliates ``a terrorist organization and a threat to interests of
the United States.''
   The law barred the PLO from operating its U.N. Mission or any
other office in the United States and also barred the PLO from
funding any activities in this country to further its aims.
   Dr. Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League's permanent observer to the
United Nations, said his organization considered the ruling ``a
victory for the United States over the recklessness of the Israeli
lobby and their unquestioning supporters.''
   ``We welcome this decision and believe that this will facilitate
the work of the U.N. (General) Assembly,'' he said. ``It shows
judicial respect for United States' treaty obligations and the
healthy independence of the judiciary.''

<HEAD>Swedish-Born Trapper Dies After Six Decades In The Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE PAS, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ragnar Jonsson, a Swedish-born trapper
who lived in a tent in northern Manitoba and spent more than 60
years in the Canadian bush, has died at the age of 88.
   Jonsson, who died last Saturday, will have his ashes scattered
over an island that bears his name in the middle of Neultin Lake
after a funeral today, Manitoba, the Canadian Press news agency
reported. It did not say how he died.
   The Swede came to Canada in 1923 and made his living cutting
wood and fishing around Big River, Saskatchewan, before starting
his trapping career in the 1930s.
   For more than 40 years he lived off the land near Neultin Lake.
His shelter was a small tepee, just big enough for an oil drum
converted into a stove, an oil lamp and sleeping bags.
   He once praised the benefits of sleeping in cold weather. ``It
keeps you healthy. I haven't had a headache in 50 years.''
   Jonsson occasionally met Cree and Chipewyan Indian trappers or
sport fishermen and hunters at a nearby lodge, but his only steady
companions were his husky sled dogs.
   Mail reached him once or twice a year and every decade or so, he
ventured into a city.
   In 1982 he went to Winnipeg after an absence of 59 years to have
a cataract removed.
   ``Now I could see a moose or a caribou moving 50 miles away,''
he said before heading back into the bush, where his favorite foods
included lake trout, ptarmigan and pancakes made with the blood of
a caribou or moose.
   ``If you've ever tasted it, you'll never ever want any other
kind of pancake,'' he said.

<HEAD>Spaniards Set Sail For New Zealand In Reed Boat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CALLAO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Spanish adventurers boarded an
anciently styled reed boat and pushed off for New Zealand in a
voyage aimed at showing how pre-Columbian Peruvians could have
crossed the Pacific.
   Famed Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl, whose theories and
expeditions sparked the adventure, bid farewell to the sailors
Wednesday as they departed Lima's port Callao.
   ``The Uru is built correctly,'' the 73-year-old anthroplogist
said during an inspection of the 70-foot ship made from reeds. He
said it is crafted along the lines of pre-Columbian boat builders.
   The Spaniards, headed by 29-year-old Kitin Munoz, plan to follow
a course charted by Heyerdahl, who sailed the primitive balsa raft
Kon Tiki from Peru to Polynesia in 1947.
   Heyerdahl and five others made the voyage, which he wrote about
in the book ``Kon Tiki,'' to support his thesis that the first
settlers of Polynesia were of South American descent. In 1970, he
sailed a papyrus boat from Morocco to Barbados in an attempt to
prove that the ancient inhabitants of the Mediterranean region
could have sailed to America.
   Paulino Esteban, a Lake Titicaca Indian who built the Uru and
other reed boats used by Heyerdahl, also met with the Spanish crew
and Heyerdahl aboard the 12-ton craft.
   Esteban said the Uru is a huge version of the reed boats that
Indians on Titicaca, the world's highest navigable lake at 12,700
feet, have used for centuries and still use today. The lake is 600
miles southeast of Lima.
   The Uru, named after an ancient Titicaca tribe, has no motor and
depends on its two sails for propulsion. A compass and a radio for
emergencies are the only modern tools aboard the rough-hewn craft.
   Although reed boats rot after about a year in fresh water, Munoz
said the Uru would remain buoyant during the five-month voyage to
New Zealand, 7,200 miles southwest of Lima.
   The expedition plans stops on several South Pacific islands
including Raroia, where Heyerdahl concluded his Kon Tiki cruise.
   ``This is not sport,'' Munoz said. ``We are contributing to
scientific study, the proof of primitive navigation.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle of the afternoon talk-show hosts
ended in a draw at the daytime Emmy awards, with Phil Donahue
taking honors as best host and Oprah Winfrey for best show.
   It was the ninth daytime Emmy for Donahue, the master of
ceremonies of Wednesday's awards ceremonies. Last year, Donahue was
shut out by Miss Winfrey.
   For Susan Lucci, star of ABC's ``All My Children,'' it was
another year of disappointment. She was nominated for best actress
for the ninth time, and for the ninth time she saw someone else win.
   This time it was Helen Gallagher of ABC's ``Ryan's Hope.''
   ``Santa Barbara'' from NBC won as best daytime drama.
   David Canary, who plays the double role of Adam Chandler and
Stuart Chandler on ``All My Children,'' was honored as best daytime
dramatic actor.
   ``I am painfully aware that this belongs to my brother Stuart,''
he joked.
   Ellen Wheeler of ``All My Children'' won as best supporting
actress, and her gasping acceptance speech marked her as the most
excited winner as well.
   ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' repeated as the best daytime talk
show, but Donahue won for best host for the ninth time. Ms. Winfrey
won that award last year.
   Several winners didn't show up at the Waldorf Hotel ceremonies,
including Miss Gallagher, best game-show host Bob Barker of ``The
Price is Right,'' best ingenue Julianne Moore ``As the World
Turns'' and best supporting actor Justin Deas of ``Santa Barbara.''
   ``I'm flabbergasted,'' Deas said in a statement read after his
award was announced.
   ``The Price is Right,'' now completing its 25th year, also won
as best game show.
   ``Sesame Street'' of PBS won as best children's program, and
``Jim Henson's Muppet Babies'' of CBS was the best animated
program. Both won last year.
   The writing award went to the striking writers of ``All My
Children,'' including creater Agnes Nixon and head writer Lorraine
Broderick.

<HEAD>Panel Suggests Fewer Blood Transfusions May Be Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A National Institutes of Health panel,
concerned about the spread of AIDS through donated blood, is
recommending that doctors keep blood transfusions ``to a minimum.''
   The panel of experts says doctors should also reevaluate
traditional uses of blood in surgery in light of AIDS and improved
surgical techniques.
   The chances of contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome
from donated blood is still considered ``miniscule,'' said Tibor
Greenwalt, a University of Cincinnati researcher and chairman of
the NIH committee. But he warned Wednesday that blood transfusions
do carry ``documented risks of infection and immune changes.''
   He and other committee members issued a report that said,
``Blood transfusions were once believed to be relatively safe, but
more recently many physicians and patients have come to regard them
as potentially dangerous.''

<HEAD>Club Born Of Suffrage Movement Gives Men Right To Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Born 66 years ago of the women's suffrage
movement, the Woman's National Democratic Club has made men equal
members of the organization.
   The club voted Wednesday to grant its male members the right to
vote in what outgoing club President Jean R. Jensen called an
ironic turn for an organization founded to give women a say in what
once was the male world of politics.
   ``Perhaps it is a measure of our success that women's clubs are
being asked to include men,'' she said.
   The organization has nearly 2,000 members, of whom 85 are men.
As associate members, the men could participate in all ways except
that they could not head committees, become officers or vote.
   The club's decision to grant men full membership status comes on
the heels of votes by Washington's exclusive Metropolitan and
Cosmos clubs to end their men-only policies.

<HEAD>Kids At Loose Ends Over Dads' Failure To Buckle Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mothers are more likely to buckle up than
fathers, and a new survey says the behavior of parents can have a
strong influence on whether their children use seat belts.
   The survey of 1,118 children, released Wednesday, showed 58
percent said they wear seat belts all or most of the time, while 57
percent said their mothers regularly wear seat belts and only 38
percent said their fathers buckle up.
   The children were interviewed by Louis Harris and Associates for
the American Coalition of Traffic Safety, which was set up by the
U.S. auto industry in 1986 to support safety belt use.
   Results of the survey, which has a margin of error or 3
percentage points, were released at a news conference that included
37 children who survived accidents because of seat belts.
   Susan Akin, Miss America for 1986, accompanied the children, and
recounted that a seat belt saved her life in a 1987 Mississippi
crash involving her car and an 18-wheel truck.

<TEXT>
   Nostradamus' disaster warning date has
passed, but now Californians are all shaken up about a series of
earthquakes and an ominous official warning of worse jolts ahead.
   ``A lot of people are spooked,'' says Paul Preston, who runs an
earthquake preparedness business in Marin County.
   Northern California residents began buying up survival supplies
and swamping quake experts with phone calls after the state issued
a rare official warning about an increased chance for a severe
earthquake this week south of San Jose, where a quake rocked the
region Monday.
   The temblor, estimated as high as 5.7 on the Richter scale of
ground motion, shifted tectonic plates along the San Andreas Fault
and has been followed by a surprising lack of aftershocks,
seismologist Robert Uhrhammer said Wednesday.
   Uhrhammer, of the University of California Seismographic
Stations at Berkeley, said the area in the Santa Cruz Mountains is
40 times more likely than normal to be hit by another temblor of at
least the same magnitude by Sunday because the quake put additional
stress on the San Andreas.
   The American Red Cross on Wednesday put its Northern California
chapters on alert through Tuesday. The action came a day after the
state Office of Emergency Services suggested that Santa Clara,
Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Benito counties notify local officials
of the increased earthquake risk.
   ``We certainly don't want to panic people, but if there is an
increased chance _ even a little one _ we have to let people
know,'' said Tom Mullins, an agency spokesman in Sacramento.
   ``If we had this information and didn't go out with it and a
quake occurred and someone was injured or even worse, I think we
would bear responsibility,'' he said. ``And from what I've heard,
people are not panicking.''
   Some Californians had been on edge over predictions by 16th
century astrologer Nostradamus that a disaster would destroy the
``new city'' during a planetary alignment in May 1988.
   Many interpreted this as meaning Los Angeles would be leveled by
an earthquake, and thousands of worried residents called
planetariums, stocked up on supplies and planned out-of-state
summer vacations.
   In addition, about 1,000 or more Cambodian refugees fled town,
apparently heeding dire predictions from astrologers and
self-proclaimed psychics, but there was no planetary alignment and
no major temblor.
   This week's official advisory was only the fourth such warning
ever made.
   ``We don't want to send people running and screaming into the
streets, because the increased likelihood is low,'' said Rick
Lester, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist. ``But it is a
responsible step to take to alert people.''
   All the earthquake talk has boosted business at a San Jose
hardware store, where custoers have been ``buying batteries like
you wouldn't believe,'' assistant manager Woody Smith said. Bottled
water sales also have been brisk.
   The months since last October's big earthquake in the Southern
California community of Whittier have been the busiest time ever
for Preston's company, Earthquake Preparedness Consultants.
   The company is one of several in the area that conduct home
inspections and give advice on how to reduce potential earthquake
damage. It also sells a device that automatically shuts off natural
gas pipes in the event of seismic activity.
   ``I have had a lot of calls in the last couple of days, but it
really started with Whittier and continued this year with the
Nostradamus prediction and the other quakes,'' Preston said.
   ``Most people hadn't given it any thought. Now almost everybody
in Southern California has felt a good jolt, and people in Northern
California are getting worried, too.''

<HEAD>Vietnamese Military Command Pull Out From Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vietnamese said they
withdrew their top military command from Cambodia today, turning a
nine-year-old guerrilla war over to Cambodian officers.
   For the first time, Vietnamese officials also disclosed their
casualties in the war. They said 55,000 Vietnamese soldiers have
been killed since 1977, when Vietnam began clashing with the Khmer
Rouge regime, which then ruled Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia the next year, replacing the
pro-Beijing Khmer Rouge with a pro-Hanoi government.
   The top Vietnamese commander in Cambodia, Gen. Le Ngoc Hien, and
about 300 other top officers and their staffs returned to Ho Chi
Minh City from Cambodia's capital of Phnom Penh aboard Soviet-made
military helicopters and airplanes.
   They are among 50,000 Vietnamese troops Hanoi says it will bring
home by the end of the year in the largest of seven annual pullouts
from Cambodia. Anti-Vietnamese guerrilla groups claim the
withdrawals are nothing but troop rotations.
   Vietnamese officials said the latest move completes the transfer
of the military command to the Phnom Penh government.
   ``We think the Cambodian armed forces can shoulder their
responsibility themselves,'' Lt. Gen. Le Kha Phieu, deputy
commander of Vietnamese forces in Cambodia, told a news conference
in Ho Chi Minh City.
   About 100,000 Vietnamese soldiers are helping the Cambodian
government fight a three-party guerrilla group backed by many
Western nations and China.
   Phieu said about 13,000 Vietnamese soldiers have already
returned home this year. Hanoi says 50,000 are being withdrawn this
year and the remaining 50,000 will come home by 1990.
   He also disclosed Vietnamese casualties in the war, saying
30,000 Vietnamese died in border clashes in 1977-78 with the Khmer
Rouge, who killed more than a million Cambodians during their
bloody rule from 1975 to 1978.
   Another 25,000 Vietnamese troops have died in Cambodia since the
1978 invasion, Phieu said.
   Vietnamese forces in Cambodia have been taking fewer casualties
in recent years, indicating that the guerrilla forces were becoming
weaker, Phieu said. He said that this year and last, only 500
Vietnamese soldiers were killed in Cambodia and another 2,500 were
wounded.
   The ultra-radical Khmer Rouge ``remain a force in Cambodia but
are in decline because they receive no support from the Kampuchean
(Cambodian) people,'' Phieu said.
   Thousands of Vietnamese crowded into the international airport
of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, to greet the returning
officers and advisers. They arrived after a sendoff in Phnom Penh
by thousands of Cambodians waving Vietnamese and Cambodian flags
and saffron-robed monks offering blessings for a safe journey home.
   Cambodian Defense Minister Koy Buntha pledged to strengthen his
forces to replace the Vietnamese, whom he thanked at an airport
ceremony for ``your blood and sacrifice.''
   United Nations special envoy Rafee Uddin Ahmed was to arrive in
Phnom Penh later today for talks with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen on settling the Cambodian issue. It would be the first time for
a U.N. envoy to hold formal talks on the issue with the Cambodian
government, which the United Nations does not recognize.
   Instead, the U.N. recognizes the tripartite coalition made up of
the communist Khmer Rouge, non-communist Khmer People's National
Liberation Front and forces loyal to Prince Norodum Sihanouk.
   In Bangkok, Thailand, meanwhile, a U.S. official appeared on a
television broadcast and said the United States will not accept the
return to power of the Khmer Rouge.
   Gaston Sigur, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia
and Pacific Affairs, said today that the United States supports
efforts by Sihanouk to resolve the Cambodian conflict.
   The telecast from Washington was organized by the United States
Information Agency as a preview to a July visit to Asia by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.

<HEAD>Admiral Recommends Courts-Martial For Two Sailors, Punishes Four</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy admiral has recommended a
court-martial for the former commander of a rescue swimming school
and demoted or fined four other sailors implicated in the death of
a 19-year-old recruit.
   Rear Adm. David Morris on Wednesday refused to drop a charge of
dereliction of duty against Lt. Thomas Torchia, who commanded
Pensacola Naval Air Station's rescue swimmer school when Airman
Recruit Lee Mirecki died March 2.
   Last week, Morris, chief of Naval Air Training in Corpus
Christi, Texas, also recommended a court-martial for Petty Officer
2nd Class Michael Combe, Mirecki's instructor.
   Mirecki, of Appleton, Wis., died during a rescue drill after he
allegedly was forced back into a training pool when he tried to
drop the course. The Navy charged that Combe repeatedly forced
Mirecki's head under water, causing him to panic, suffer heart
failure and drown.
   Mirecki's classmates said they were ordered to turn away from
the pool and sing the national anthem to drown out his screams.
   Petty Officers 1st Class Richard Blevins and David Smith were
reduced in rank one pay grade to petty officer 2nd class and
restricted to the base for 30 days, Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Dennis
Hessler said.
   Petty Officers 2nd Class Frankie Deaton and John Zelenock will
lose half of their basic pay for two months, Hessler said.
   The four disciplined instructors initially were charged with
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy, but the manslaughter
charges were dropped. They can appeal the penalties, imposed after
a non-judicial hearing.
   Vice Adm. Ron Thunman, chief of naval education and training in
Pensacola, is reviewing the court-martial recommendations, Hessler
said.
   Torchia earlier rejected an option for non-judicial punishment,
but the four instructors accepted the offer.
   A court-martial offers a chance for acquittal, but a conviction
results in more serious penalties than those arising from
non-judicial hearings.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen with a grenade launcher and
automatic rifles attacked a leftist university president today,
killing three aides and wounding the educator and five other aides,
police said.
   A pedestrian was slightly injured in the ambush, the second in
seven months on Dr. Nemesio Prudente, president of the
government-run Polytechnic University of the Philippines.
   No group claimed responsibility. The first attack, in 1987, was
blamed on right-wing extremists.
   ``This second attempt on the life of Dr. Prudente is brutal,
brazen and contemptible,'' President Corazon Aquino said in a
statement read by spokesman Teodoro Benigno. She ordered a ``speedy
solution.''
   Police said Prudente and his aides, including several
bodyguards, were approaching the university campus at 8:45 a.m.
when they were ambushed. His party was traveling in a van followed
by a security car.
   Prudente suffered shrapnel wounds in the left arm and both legs,
police said, adding that none of the other six wounded were in
critical condition.
   Reporters looking through a hospital's emergency room windows
said they saw Prudente, both arms and left shoulder bandaged,
sitting on a bed and talking to investigators.
   Roger Pureza, a university security guard in the van with
Prudente, said the gunmen sprayed it with bullets, then hurled a
grenade. He suffered shrapnel wounds in the left arm and face.
   Jejomar Binay, a nephew of Prudente and mayor of the Manila
suburb of Makati, told reporters police believe there were at least
six gunmen.
   He said the gunmen could be the same who wounded Prudente and
killed a university lawyer in an unsolved Nov. 11, 1987 ambush.
   Human rights groups blamed right-wing death squads for the first
ambush, which occurred a week after soldiers and policemen chanted
``Kill Prudente'' during a funeral for a police captain and three
other people killed by communist assassins.
   The military and police had accused Prudente, an outspoken human
rights activist, of using his school to shelter communist urban
guerrillas. Prudente denied the charge.
   Students from the university and other colleges said they would
protest today's ambush.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate's defense committee,
condemned the attack and criticized police for failing to keep
peace and order in the Manila area.
   The capital has been rocked during the past few years by
killings attributed to leftist and right-wing extremists.

   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis has his first formal union endorsement, from the
59,000-member National Treasury Employees Union.
   The group, which represents mostly federal Internal Revenue
Service and Customs Service workers, said the backing was on
Dukakis' commitment to beef up the Customs Service's drug
interdiction programs and revenue agencies such as the IRS as a way
to reduce the federal deficit.
   ``The Reagan administration has been long on empty words and
false perceptions but very, very short on good deeds,'' the union's
president, Robert Tobias, said Wednesday.
   Tobias also praised what he called Dukakis' commitment to
collective bargaining as evidenced by his relations with
Massachusetts state employees over the past decade.

<TEXT>
   Plans are underway to strip the
Illinois Democratic Party's platform of a controversial plank
backed by supporters of Jesse Jackson which advocates an
independent Palestinian homeland.
   State party Chairman Vince Demuzio, a senator from Carlinville,
said Wednesday that the position taken by delegates at the recent
state convention here was wrong and will be changed.
   ``I've polled the state party and they support our traditional
position on the Middle East,'' Demuzio said. ``The position taken
at the convention is not supported by Michael Dukakis and it will
not be in the national platform.''
   Demuzio said he found no support for the position when he polled
the 44 members of the Democratic state central committee last week.
   Delegates to the Democratic state convention June 18 adopted a
plank calling for self-determination for the Palestinian people and
establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The plank also
defended Israel's right to exist.
   It is supported by Jesse Jackson, who had bus loads of
supporters at the convention.

<HEAD>Jackson Plans Week Off Campaign Trail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson says he plans to leave the
campaign trail for most of the next week to resume personal efforts
to free U.S. hostages held in Lebanon and map out his strategy for
the Democratic National Convention.
   Jackson said Wednesday he will also use the time to deliberate
``in great detail'' with his family about whether to seek the vice
presidential nomination.
   There are no meetings scheduled between Jackson and certain
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, but Jackson said
the attitude of those closest to him might be the most important
factor in his own decision to seek the vice presidential nomination.
   Dukakis was meeting in Washington this week with congressional
leaders considered potential running mates.
   ``Unlike other persons who are under consideration, I have taken
every test that Dukakis has taken,'' said Jackson.
   Jackson declined to provide many specifics on his efforts to
free U.S. hostages, but said he plans to make several audio and
videotapes for distribution in the Middle East over the next few
days, appealing to the hostages' captors for their safe release.
   He said he has kept in contact with unnamed people in the Middle
East and ``instincts and certain conversations'' convinced him the
timing was right to again seek the hostages' release.
   ``We must not give the impression that we have given up on the
Americans who are there,'' Jackson said. ``And we need to exhaust
all efforts to get them out.''
   He said he was prepared to make another personal trip to the
region if necessary, but added, ``We've got no timetable.''
   Jackson also announced the filing in Washington of a political
action committee, ``Keep Hope Alive,'' to advance the themes of
fairness and economic justice that were the centerpieces of his own
presidential campaign.
   ``There are some targeted areas in congressional campaigns and
state legislative campaigns where we can help elect officials who
believe the future of this party is in integrated slate-making,''
he said.

<HEAD>Army Mobilizing for Offensive, Truce Expiring Today</HEAD>

   The army said it was mobilizing to
launch a massive offensive against U.S.-backed rebels after a
cease-fire scheduled to expire today.
   But Col. Hugo Torres, political director of the Sandinista Army,
said Wednesday that President Daniel Ortega, due back from Cuba
today, might prolong the truce.
   He also said Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, the president's
brother, would meet with his commanders today, then announce ``the
army's position on the expiration of the unilateral cease fire.''
   A truce that went into effect on March 21 and expired at the end
of May was unilaterally extended for 30 days by the leftist
Sandinista government. Today is the end of the 30 days.
   Negotiators for the government and for the rebels, known as
Contras, have made proposals and counterproposals since talks broke
down June 9. But they have been unable to agree on how to resume
negotiations to end the 6{-year-old war.
   Torres said that if there is an offensive, it will be bigger
than the one in March that preceded the first round of peace talks.
   Sandinista troops reportedly were positioning artillery at
strategic sites in the provinces of Boaco, Chontales, Rio San Juan
and Zelaya Sur.
   Meanwhile, Nicaragua's bishops urged the government and rebels
to resume peace talks and not to give in to ``hate or the desire
for vengance.''
   The bishops said in a pastoral letter issued Wednesday that
their ``hearts have resounded with the heartbreaking clamor that is
rising from the countryside and in the cities of Nicaragua for ...
an end to war and to the violent deaths of the young, the peasants,
the Indians.''
   They said the Sandinista government was putting war before the
well-being of the people and said many people ``now feel defrauded
by their leaders, by corruption and by the bureaucracy.''
   The bishops also complained about an ``atheistic'' educational
system that ``imposes the ideology of a few,'' the recent
legalization of divorce and the ``promotion'' of abortion.
   They said the economy has deteriorated so badly that familiies
``feel the effects of hunger'' while the government pours money
into defense spending.

<HEAD>Farmers, Armed Police Clash Over Release of Contaminated Water</HEAD>

   More than 1,500 peasants protesting the dumping
of polluted water clashed near Beijing with armed police who beat
them with clubs and electric batons, witnesses said.
   They said more than 150 people were arrested.
   The farmers from the village of Guce, 37 miles southwest of
Beijing, were trying to stop a petrochemical plant from releasing
contaminated water that would poison their wells when they clashed
with thousands of armed police on June 21, villagers said.
   Villagers told Western reporters earlier in the week that three
people died, but were unable today to confirm the deaths.
   About 150 people, including some high school students, were
arrested during the protest. Most were released later the same day
or the following day, but at least 10 remain in custody, their
whereabouts unknown.
   ``We don't even know if they are dead or alive,'' one woman said.
   Between 60 and 70 people were seriously injured in the melee
with police wielding electric batons and nightsticks, witnesses
said.
   Estimates of the number of armed police ranged from 2,000 to
6,000. Villagers said police surrounded the village and occupied
the village square for two days.
   The district Communist Party Secretary's office today refused to
answer any questions relating to the incident, saying that all
inquiries had to be handled by the Beijing Foreign Affairs Office.
   The Foreign Affairs Office said it had just heard about the
incident and was unable to give any details or answer questions.
   The incident has not been reported by the Chinese state-run news
media.
   Villagers said they were told by authorities that water from a
reservoir 1.2 miles north of Guce, used to store chemical waste
from the state-owned Yanshan Petrochemical Co., would have to be
released to avoid flooding during the wet season.
   ``We asked them not to release the water because it would harm
everyone in the village,'' one woman said.
   Witnesses said the trouble started at about 1 a.m. on June 21
when villagers learned that the water was to be released that day,
three days earlier than they had been told.
   Through the night, around 1,500 Guce residents gathered at the
reservoir to protest. Armed police arrived at about 3 a.m. and
began indiscriminately beating the peasants, eyewitnesses said.
   Villagers said Beijing Vice Mayor Zhang Jianming was at the
scene.
   One villager said protesters standing in or near the creek into
which the reservoir's water was to be released were shocked by
police who stuck their electric batons in the water.
   Many of those seriously hurt sustained head injuries. One high
school student was reported to have been hit nearly 200 times with
an electric baton.
   ``Just about everyone who was there was injured in some way,''
one old man said.
   Water was released from the reservoir at about 4:40 a.m., and by
5 a.m. the protestors disbanded, ``beaten into submission by the
armed police,'' one villager said.
   Today, the main village road was blocked to traffic as workers
began digging trenches to install water pipes. Villagers said their
well water has been contaminated by the chemical waste.
   Temporary pipes were installed to bring clean water to some
outdoor spigots, but farmers said there was not enough to water
their crops, which also have been contaminated.
   ``We can't plant anything now. Everything's dried up,'' and
there's no water for the fields, one farmer said.
   Those who live in the village of 4,700 complained that the
contaminated water brought on a variety of ailments including
headaches and nosebleeds.
   One young man pointed to itchy, red spots all over his shoulders
and chest, which he claimed were caused by the water.
   A woman carrying a baby said, ``We all were affected. The
children were coughing all night long.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Picks Up Endorsement from Union of IRS and Customs Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis has his first formal union endorsement, from the
59,000-member National Treasury Employees Union.
   The group, which represents mostly federal Internal Revenue
Service and Customs Service workers, said the backing was on
Dukakis' commitment to beef up the Customs Service's drug
interdiction programs and revenue agencies such as the IRS as a way
to reduce the federal deficit.
   ``The Reagan administration has been long on empty words and
false perceptions but very, very short on good deeds,'' the union's
president, Robert Tobias, said Wednesday.
   Tobias also praised what he called Dukakis' commitment to
collective bargaining as evidenced by his relations with
Massachusetts state employees over the past decade.

<HEAD>Illinois Dems Chief Targets Jackson-backed Platform Plank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans are underway to strip the
Illinois Democratic Party's platform of a controversial plank
backed by supporters of Jesse Jackson which advocates an
independent Palestinian homeland.
   State party Chairman Vince Demuzio, a senator from Carlinville,
said Wednesday that the position taken by delegates at the recent
state convention here was wrong and will be changed.
   ``I've polled the state party and they support our traditional
position on the Middle East,'' Demuzio said. ``The position taken
at the convention is not supported by Michael Dukakis and it will
not be in the national platform.''
   Demuzio said he found no support for the position when he polled
the 44 members of the Democratic state central committee last week.
   Delegates to the Democratic state convention June 18 adopted a
plank calling for self-determination for the Palestinian people and
establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The plank also
defended Israel's right to exist.
   It is supported by Jesse Jackson, who had bus loads of
supporters at the convention.

   Colorado voters, who have a strong record of
voting Republican in national elections, favor likely Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis over George Bush by nearly a double-digit
margin, a new poll shows.
   The telephone poll, conducted by The Denver Post and KCNC-TV,
shows Dukakis with the support of 45 percent of the 553 people
randomly surveyed across the state. Bush, the all-but-certain GOP
choice, has the backing of 36 percent of the voters, while 19
percent remain uncommitted.
   Colorado voters have not supported a Democratic candidate in 24
years.
   The poll was conducted June 5-7 by Talmey Research & Strategy of
Boulder. It has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Stocks Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a slight fall, the dollar held its ground
against the Japanese yen today, and share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange added to its previous day's gain.
   After opening at 132.90 yen, up from Wednesday's close of 132.40
yen, the dollar crawled up further to peak at 133.00 yen before it
dropping to finish the day at 132.20 yen, down 0.20 yen from the
previous day.
   The dollar fell because ``market participants are closing their
positions prior to the Fourth of July holiday in the United
States,'' said a dealer a major local securities firm, speaking on
condition of anonymity. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for
Independence Day.
   ``Those who were buying the currency at the 133-yen level at the
start of trading moved down to 132 yen because of the upcoming
holiday,'' he added.
   King Ogino, a dealer at Goldman Sachs, said local city banks at
one point tried to push the dollar above the 133-yen level, but had
to fall back after meeting market resistance.
   But buying pressure is still intact and the dollar will soon
consolidate its position, Ogino said. He added however that
``people are cautious.''
   The securities dealer said ``the dollar will be bought up in the
upcoming week,'' adding that ``there is a rumor of it reaching even
the 135-yen level.''
   He said however that the movement depended on the nation's
central bank, which since last week refrained from intervening in
the market to stem the dollar's rise.
   This lack of intervention has been primarily responsible for the
dollar's appreciation against the yen. Monetary authorities have
ruled out stepping into the market, and Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa earlier this week said the market changes were ordinary
fluctuations.
   In September 1985, the dollar was trading as high as 242 yen
when the seven major industrialized nations agreed to push the
currency down to help reduce the massive U.S. trade deficit. A
lower dollar theoretically makes U.S. goods cheaper and more
competitive abroad.
   Meanwhile, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the main market
barometer added another 162.07 points, or 0.58 percent, to close at
27,769.40 points. The index had gained 209.24 points, or 0.76
percent, on Wednesday.
   Traders said the rise in the Nikkei index was led mainly by
heavy electricals and automakers.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at a heavy 2.5 billion
shares, unchanged from Wednesday.

<HEAD>British Plan To Reform Tight Security Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government proposed a relaxation of its
stringent secrecy laws by decriminalizing trivial leaks, giving
journalists more legal protection and confining secrecy to defense,
intelligence and foreign affairs.
   Plans by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government to
liberalize the laws were welcomed by conservative newspapers today,
but left-leaning papers said they would do little to help democracy.
   The proposals, outlined in a government policy document, were
presented to Parliament Wednesday. They would reinforce the
lifetime gag on intelligence agents and make them automatically
liable for criminal prosecution for any disclosure.
   The independent Times of London said in an editorial that Home
Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet member responsible for law and
order, ``deserves to win a wide measure of praise for the reform of
the Official Secrets Act which he proposed yesterday.''
   But the liberal newspaper The Guardian, which has repeatedly
accused Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government of being obsessed
with secrecy, said the proposed changes portended ``nothing good''
for the press and democracy.
   Another critic of government secrecy, The Independent, wrote:
``Mr. Hurd has produced ideas which are more liberal than had been
anticipated. But they are so circumscribed by exemptions and
special designations that the bill's effect is still likely to be
unacceptably restrictive.''
   The Labor Party denounced the plans as ``draconian and
unacceptable.''
   Hurd told the House of Commons on Wednesday when he presented
the proposal that the government aimed to ``clip the wings of any
possible abuse of the criminal law by the Executive.''
   He called it the most radical plan yet to reform the Official
Secrets Act, which makes it a criminal offense to reveal any
official information, however trivial, without formal authorization.
   The act, passed hastily during a 1911 German spy scare, has
helped give Britain a reputation as the most secretive of the
Western democracies.
   The new proposals restricted secrecy to six categories _
defense; security and intelligence; international relations;
information obtained in confidence from other governments;
information useful to criminals; and information about bugging,
mail- and phone-tapping.
   But officials would face internal disciplinary measures for
disclosing confidential material such as Cabinet documents and the
proposal made no provision for a U.S.-style Freedom of Information
Act.
   The proposals also stipulated that people charged under the
Official Secrets Act cannot plead in their defense that the leak
was in the public interest or that the material had been already
published elsewhere.
   The Daily Telegraph, which supports the Conservatives, wrote:
``There will be some unease about ... the ... rejection of the
defense of public interest.''
   But it generally welcomed the proposal.
   Des Wilson, chairman of the Campaign for Freedom of Information
pressure group, said the proposed law would give ``no greater
access to information.''
   ``It simply narrows the number of categories in which disclosure
is a criminal offense,'' he said.
   The proposals followed a series of secrecy-related
controversies. These included a 1986 police raid on British
Broadcasting Corp. studios to seize tapes of a documentary about a
spy satellite, and the government's losing two-year court battle to
ban publication of ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of retired
intelligence officer Peter Wright.
   Under the new proposals, Wright, who now lives in Australia,
could be charged if he returned to Britain.

<HEAD>China Says Soviet Union Faces Big Hurdles In Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's official news agency today said the
Soviet Union faces major hurdles in its attempt to revamp its
economic and political systems.
   The Soviet Communist Party conference taking place in Moscow
``is entrusted with the formidable task of seeking ways to deepen
reforms,'' Xinhua News Agency said in a signed commentary from
Moscow.
   ``But big hurdles have to be overcome before the process can
become irreversible.''
   The commentary did not mention the many obstacles China has
faced since pioneering market-oriented economic reforms in 1979 and
more recently tackling political restructuring.
   But it spoke from experience in cautioning that the Soviet road
to reform will not be easy.
   It noted that ``practices are lagging behind theory'' in the
Soviet Union and quoted Valentin Falin, head of the Novosti Press
Agency, as saying old practices must be done away with for economic
and social reforms to succeed.
   Xinhua said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is calling for
solutions to chronic food shortages and that well-stocked markets
``will help strengthen the hand of the Soviet leader in convincing
people of the correctness of reforms.''
   Xinhua also noted that Gorbachev had stressed political reform,
particularly the clear separation of party and government functions
and an enhanced role for legislative assemblies. China too is now
striving to end Communist Party interference in government and
economic affairs and make its legislatures more democratic.
   The report said many at the conference agreed that
``self-criticism of mistakes will prove more important than
legislation because laws may be violated or annulled by rulers if
no one stands up to raise an objection.''
   The commentary concluded: ``People here now are wondering how
far the conference will go in its efforts to make reforms
irreversible. One thing is almost certain: the task requires more
time and unremitting endeavor.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, asked about the
conference at a weekly briefing today, said: ``The holding of such
a conference by the Soviet Communist Party under the current
circumstances has naturally drawn people's attention and we are
also following the developments of the conference.
   ``We have noted that a major topic of the current conference is
reform and we hope that the reform in the Soviet Union will be a
success.''
   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological differences in
1960 and political relations remain strained.
   But economic ties between the two countries have grown steadily,
and it is believed that the Soviet Union has watched closely
China's experiments in reducing the role of central planning,
allowing the value of goods to be determined by market forces and
encouraging private enterprise.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies of a protein linked to the most serious
form of muscular dystrophy suggest the disease may kill muscle by
weakening muscle cell walls, an idea that may help lead to
treatments.
   The protein is absent from muscles of people with Duchenne
dystrophy, and the studies suggest that may result in abnormally
weak cell walls.
   Scientists are trying to determine the function of the protein,
called dystrophin, so they can tell just why its absence is so
destructive in Duchenne. That knowledge is expected to guide
development of treatments.
   The studies do not directly demonstrate dystrophin's function,
but hint at it by showing where the protein appears within the
muscle cell. The results support the cell-wall hypothesis, proposed
before dystrophin was discovered last year.
   Today's British journal Nature published one of the studies,
co-authored by Louis Kunkel of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
at Children's Hospital in Boston, with colleagues at the hospital
and Harvard Medical School.
   Similar conclusions were published this month by Canadian
researchers, including Elizabeth Zubrzycka-Gaarn and Ronald Worton
of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and the University of
Toronto.
   Duchenne muscular dystrophy appears in about one in 3,500 male
births in the United States. It causes progressive weakness and
wasting of voluntary muscles, requiring patients to use wheelchairs
by age 12 and killing most in their early 20s. No cure is known.
   When Kunkel and collaborators announced the discovery of
dystrophin last December, they suggested it may play a role in
regulating muscle contraction. But the new work makes that
hypothesis less likely, Kunkel said this week in a telephone
interview.
   His team's research, which involved examining extremely thin
slices of muscle tissue under an electron microscope, found that
dystrophin appeared just inside the flimsy, fatty membrane that
makes up the cell walls.
   It appears to be part of the cytoskeleton, a mesh of proteins
that maintains the structure of the cell, he said. That fits in
with previous work showing that it resembles other proteins in the
cytoskeleton, he said.
   If dystrophin is part of the cell's structural support, muscle
cells that lack dystrophin may be unusually susceptible to being
torn and destroyed as the muscle works, he said.
   Zubryzycka-Gaarn, senior author of the other paper, said her
team found a similar location for dystrophin and reached the same
hypothesis about what its absence might do. But scientists are
still a long way from knowing dystrophin's function in detail, she
said.
   Similar caution was voiced by Donald Wood of the Muscular
Dystrophy Association.
   The studies show dystrophin is ``in some way associated with the
(cell wall) membrane. We don't know what that way is now,'' he
said. ``I think we're at the point where it's best to keep an open
mind'' about what dystrophin does.
   In a separate report in Nature, Japanese researchers said they
have found another protein absent in muscle from patients with
Duchenne and other forms of muscular dystrophy. Its location in
normal cells resembles that of dystrophin, they said.

   Evelyn Cameron, who nurtured her vegetable
garden through the drought, has her shotgun cocked in case the
bandits who raided her patch last week come back looking for more.
   ``If they come back ... I'll be ready for them,'' she said
Wednesday. ``I'm not scared of anything.''
   The first harvest had just ripened when about 1{ bushels of
butter beans, cucumbers and purple hull peas were stolen, said Mrs.
Cameron, who has lived in this central Louisiana town 29 years.
   That's not much, but it was all that was ripe, she said.
   ``They took everything, right down to the little bitty ones,''
said Mrs. Cameron. ``It's really disheartening because you plant a
garden and take care of it through the drought and then they steal
your vegetables.''
   More vegetables have begun to ripen. And until they're
harvested, she's not going anywhere. Her shotgun is at the ready in
case anyone gets a late-night urge for corn on the cob, okra or
cucumbers.
   ``I guarantee you I'll shoot it,'' she said. ``I'll scare the
daylights out of 'em, if nothing else.''
   Mrs. Cameron said she did not call the Grant Parish Sheriff's
Office about the theft because there's not much deputies can do
unless the thieves are caught in the act.
   Even if the booty isn't cooked and eaten, it would be hard to
prove the vegetables were Mrs. Cameron's.
   It's not that Mrs. Cameron is unwilling to share her bounty. Her
three garden plots and dozen chickens provide more than enough
vegetables and eggs for her.
   ``If they want something, why don't they come and ask? I'd have
given them eggs, too, if they needed 'em,'' she said. ``They were
just out to steal something. People do some strange things.''

<HEAD>Four Israelis Sentenced To Prison For Meeting PLO Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAMLE, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a landmark decision, a magistrate court
today sentenced four Israeli left-wing activists to six-month
prison terms for violating a law that bars contacts with the PLO.
   They were the first Israelis to be jailed on the basis of the
1986 law barring ``unauthorized'' contacts with members of
terrorist groups. Israel views the PLO as a terrorist group.
   A judge in this city near Tel Aviv also gave each of the four a
one-year suspended sentence and ruled that each should pay $2,500
in fines and court expenses. The law carries a sentence of up to
three years imprisonment.
   ``They seemed thunderstruck when they heard the ruling,'' one
witness told The Associated Press.
   The leftists were convicted on June 2 for violating the law by
meeting with a 15-member Palestine Liberation Organization group in
Costinesti, Romania, in November 1986.
   Israel army radio quoted Judge Avraham Baiser as acknowledging
in his ruling that the law was disputed in Israel.
   ``However, the law should be respected even if it is not
accepted by the public,'' Baiser wrote. ``The court is not to
decide whether a law is bad or good. The accused have committed an
offense in front of the eyes of the whole world and now they should
be punished.''
   The judge noted that the four sentenced were ``good citizens''
and suggested they serve their sentences doing public service and
not in prison.
   The implementation of the sentence was postponed until Aug. 4 to
enable the four to appeal.
   Amnon Zichrony, an attorney for the four, said that his clients,
Latif Dory, Yael Lotan, Reuven Kaminer and Eliezer Feiler, would
appeal the decision.
   ``I hope the severe sentence will give rise to public campaign
against this Draconic law,'' the radio quoted Dory as saying.
   Police prosecutor Raanan Ben-Yosef said the sentence would lead
to indictments against 16 other members of the group that met with
PLO officials in Romania.

<HEAD>Demjanjuk To Appeal Death Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired U.S. autoworker John Demjanjuk today
appealed his conviction and death sentence for Nazi war crimes, his
attorney said.
   Demjanjuk, 68, was sentenced to death on April 25, a week after
being found guilty of being ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a brutal guard
who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinka
death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistaken
identity.
   Israeli attorney Yoram Sheftel said the appeal asks the Supreme
Court to reverse the conviction ``due to lack of proof and much
more than substantial doubt.''
   ``Alternatively, we are asking the court to eliminate the death
sentence,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview at the
Supreme Court.
   Sheftel said the appeal challenges ``every finding of the court
as far as facts and legal aspects'' and accuses the three District
Court judges of handling the case in a ``biased and uncivilized
way.''
   In the 101-page appeal, the defense contends two photo spreads
used by Treblinka survivors to identify the defendant were
``impermissibly suggestive.''
   Sheftel also quoted the appeal as saying the court failed to
introduce any evidence challenging Demjanjuk's version that he was
a Nazi prisoner-of-war during 1942 and 1943, when Treblinka was in
operation.
   He said the defense also criticises an ``organized massive
campaign by the Israeli press ... against the defendant which
completely undermined any possibility of a fair trial.''
   Sheftel said he visited Demjanjuk last week at his maximum
security prison cell in the Ayalon Prison near Tel Aviv: ``He was
fine. He is optimistic and looking forward to the appeal.''
   Supreme Court spokesman Shmaryahu Cohen said a five-judge panel
headed by Chief Justice Meir Shamgar will begin hearing the appeal
Dec. 5. It will be held for three consecutive days, then for
another three days from Dec. 12-15, Cohen said.
   The prosecution is scheduled to reply between Dec. 19 and Dec.
29.
   Demjanjuk moved to the United States after World War II,
settling in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. He was stripped of his
U.S. citizenship after a court ruled that he had lied on his
application to become an American.
   If the court rejects the appeal, Demjanjuk may become the first
man to be executed in Israel since Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann
was hanged in 1962 after a trial in Jerusalem.
   Eichmann, a high-ranking Nazi official who promoted the use of
gas chambers for mass extermination of Jews and oversaw the murder
of millions of Jews in World War II, was kidnapped by the Israelis
in Argentina in 1960.

   Lightning struck and killed a man and
the horse he was riding while rounding up cattle, authorities said.
   The death of 62-year-old Henry E. Lee Jr. was one of two in
Florida caused by lightning this week.
   Jason Cranmer, 10, was killed Sunday as he rode his bicycle
through a campground near Orlando.
   Lee, of Lake Wales, was a third-generation Floridian who always
wanted to be a cowboy, said his brother Alvin.
   ``He was a good Florida cracker cowboy and we liked him,'' said
Pat Wilson, president of the Latt Maxcy ranch property, which
covers thousands of acres in Okeechobee and Osceola counties.
   Lee, who was a ranch foreman and lived on the property, was on
open ground next to a drainage ditch leading to the Kissimmee River
when he was killed, authorities said.
   Wilson's son, Coot, who was working nearby, found Lee with his
feet still in the stirrups, authorities said.
   Lee's clothes were torn from the force of the lightning hitting
him, Medical Examiner Frederick Hobin said.
   Lee's brother said he loved horses and cows and had performed in
rodeos in his earlier years.
   ``He was an easy-going, lovable guy and he never got rowdy
unless you crossed him,'' he said. ``He died doing what he loved to
do.''

<HEAD>Jane's Says U.S. Bombers With Cruise Missiles Coming To Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will deploy 51 F-111 bombers
armed with cruise nuclear missiles in Britain to replace land-based
missiles banned under the superpower arms control agreement, Jane's
Defense Weekly reported.
   Britain's Defense Ministry acknowledged in a statement, without
elaboration, that NATO was considering transferring U.S.-based,
long-range aircraft to Western Europe.
   But it said the deployment of air-launched cruise missiles in
Western Europe ``is not under consideration.''
   Lt. Col. Ed Neunherz, spokesman at U.S. Air Force European
headquarters at Ramstein, West Germany, said plans to adapt F-111s
to carry cruise missiles have been under consideration for several
years, but NATO has not given the final go-ahead.
   Jane's reported that Gen. William Kirk, commander-in-chief of
the U.S. Air Force in Europe, said the 51 F-111s ``would augment
the capability of striking targets deep in the Soviet Union from
their new bases in the U.K. (United Kingdom) when armed with
nuclear cruise missiles.''
   It was the first confirmation of NATO plans to update its
nuclear arsenal following the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty in
December, the magazine said in its issue to be published today.
   The treaty, ratified last month, provides for elimination of
1,800 Soviet and 800 Allied medium-range missiles over three years.
   Jane's said a fleet of F-111s will be transferred from Strategic
Air Command bases in New York and New Hampshire in late 1989 or
early 1990 to ``bolster NATO's flexible response strategy.''
   The U.S. Air Force keeps about 150 of the swing-wing supersonic
F-111s at Lakenheath and Upper Heyford air force bases in England.
   The F-111s are capable of carrying a wide range of nuclear
weapons. Such dual-capable aircraft and air-launched cruise
missiles are not prohibited by the INF treaty, which covers only
land-based missiles with a range from 300 miles to about 3,100
miles.
   The U.S. Air Force said Wednesday that Kirk confirmed in a June
2 interview with the Omaha, Neb., World-Herald that the 51 F-111s
will be transferred on the basis of a one-for-one swap with aging
F-111s already in Britain.

<HEAD>44 Policemen Acquitted of Torture Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A criminal court today acquitted 44 police
officers of charges they tortured Moslem fundamentalists held in a
case linked to the assassination of President Anwar Sadat.
   It was the first time in Egypt's modern history that torture
charges were brought against policemen by a government that was in
power when the offenses were alleged to have taken place.
   The officers, ranging in rank up to brigadier, held posts in the
Interior Ministry's Prisons Administration and the State Security
Service. They were suspended for the duration of the trial that
began in December 1986.
   The defendants, relatives, friends and officers on duty in the
courthouse broke into applause and cheered after Suleiman Ayoub,
president of the three-man tribunal, read out the judgment. They
shouted ``Long live justice'' and ``Long live President (Hosni)
Mubarak.''
   The defendants would have faced penalties of three to 10 years
in prison if convicted.
   The case grew out of the 1982 trial of 300 Moslem
fundamentalists belonging to an underground group called Jihad, or
holy war.
   They were charged with an abortive attempt to overthrow the
government in the wake of Sadat's assassination by Moslem
extremists at a military parade in Cairo on Oct. 6, 1981.
   Mubarak succeeded Sadat.
   Jihad members were tried for riots and armed raids on police
installations in the southern city of Assiut that left 87 people
dead, 66 of them policemen.
   The disturbances occurred two days after Sadat's slaying and the
government said the riots were part of a coup attempt.
   Jihad members, in custody throughout their trial, claimed in
court they had been tortured by prison officers and state security
interrogators.
   In 1984, a state security court sentenced 107 Jihad members to
prison terms up to life at hard labor and acquitted the rest.
   In handing down that ruling, presiding Judge Abdel-Ghaffar
Mohammed Ahmed publicly demanded an investigation of torture claims
by the defendants.
   An investigation began in December 1984 and ended with the
indictment of 44 officers.
   Judge Adly Hussein, a member of the tribunal, told reporters
after today's session that the court had ``more than 130 reasons
for deciding on acquittal, foremost among them superficiality of
investigations and lack of evidence.''
   The court also threw out damages claims made by 26 of the
fundamentalist prisoners who alleged they had been tortured.

   The city's Sanitation Department accidentally
destroyed a news stand that a blind man has operated for 12 years,
and is refusing to build a new one in its place.
   The stand belonged to 68-year-old Rosario Civello, who served
about 500 customers a day from his spot in Brooklyn.
   The Sanitation Department had been sent to tear down an
abandoned stand across the street, but demolished Civello's by
mistake on Tuesday night, according to today's Daily News.
   ``It's tough to lose something I've had for so many years,''
Civello said. ``It's like somebody broke into my house.''
   Gary Walker, a spokesman for the Department of Consumer Affairs,
which licenses news stands, said: ``We cannot apologize enough.''
   However, city officials maintain that Civello's stand was
blocking a subway entrance anyway, and say he can take the
abandoned stand across the street, which would be moved to a new
site, the News said.
   Civello said his stand did not block the subway entrance. And he
said he doesn't want to work elsewhere because he'll lose business.

   Employees streamed from the Tennessee
Valley Authority in a sea of pink clothing, symbolizing the slips
many of them carried as the nation's largest supplier of
electricity slashed its workforce by nearly a quarter.
   ``It's an awful day,'' said Deedra Sluder, a worker in the
employee relations office who, like many, had expected the layoffs.
``Our branch manager called us in one-by-one. He did it as best he
could. It was hard on him.''
   TVA Chairman Marvin Runyon on Wednesday announced that TVA will
lay off 7,500 of its 34,000 workers, or 22 percent, by October. He
said the cutbacks are necessary for the survival of the federal
utility, which operates in seven states and serves 8 million people.
   ``We look at our operation as one that's in very bad trouble
financially,'' Runyon said. ``The steps we're taking are the kind
of steps that you would expect someone who had a real financial
problem to take.
   ``I wish they could all keep their jobs. ... But the fact is,
we're starting a new way of doing business, and we had to make some
very tough, hard decisions.''
   Runyon, who became TVA chairman in January after serving as
chief executive officer of Nissan Motor Manufactur
new jobs.
   ``It does appear that the layoffs have been distributed among
all levels of TVA's employees,'' a statement from the senators
said. ``However, TVA has a responsibility to go all out to help
those employees.''
   Although employees have known about the layoffs for three
months, it was still a sad time for many at TVA's headquarters in
Knoxville and elsewhere. Many wore pink to represent the pink slips
they carried.
   Robert Stone in the office of nuclear power said the layoffs
were handled fairly well.
   ``The only thing was, they said they had been very communicative
toward the employees, and I feel like maybe we haven't heard quite
as much as our managers knew,'' he said.
   According to Runyon's announcement, about 4,000 full-time
salaried TVA employees were laid off, or 15.3 percent of the total.
   He said 1,800 contract employees, or 47 percent, were
eliminated, which should cut TVA's cost for contract services by
$143 million next year. And 1,700, or 23 percent, of the jobs paid
on an hourly basis were cut.
   Runyon said 889 managers would be laid off, reducing the ratio
of supervisors to employees from 1-to-7 to about 1-to-13.
   TVA was created in 1933 during the New Deal as a way of making
the Tennessee River more navigable, controlling floods and bringing
electricity and economic growth to a poor region. In addition to
Tennessee, it operates in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North
Carolina, Virginia and Kentucky.
   TVA embarked on an ambitious nuclear power program in the late
1960s and early 1970s, with plans to build 17 reactors. Five of
those reactors have operated, but all were shut down for more than
two years over management and safety concerns. Only one is
operating. Four others are under construction, and eight have been
mothballed at a cost of some $8 billion to TVA's ratepayers.
   The board also modified its contracts with TVA power
distributors and restructured its energy conservation program, and
changed the pay and benefits package for management level
employees. Managers' salaries will be frozen.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Supreme Court decision dealing with
testimony of young victims in sex abuse cases will likely spark a
new legal skirmish in the marathon McMartin Pre-School molestation
trial, a defense attorney said.
   A prosecutor disagreed, however, saying Wednesday's ruling in
Coy vs. Iowa, which held that victims and defendants must confront
each other in court, should have little impact on the year-old
trial.
   The McMartin trial is on a summer recess, and jurors are
scheduled to resume hearing testimony July 18.
   Raymond Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61,
are charged with 100 child molestations at their now-defunct
McMartin Pre-Schoool in Manhattan Beach. The case has been in the
Los Angeles courts for five years.
   The prosecution, which once involved 41 children, now focuses on
14 youngsters who have grown from toddlers to preteen-agers in the
years of legal proceedings. Nine children have testified at the
trial. One alleged victim is not expected to testify and four
others are scheduled to take the stand before the prosecution rests
its case, probably by September.
   Prosecutors dropped charges against five other teachers at the
school in 1986.
   The disagreement over significance of the Supreme Court decision
will surface in court July 11 when a hearing is scheduled on a
motion by prosecutors to allow use of videotaped preliminary
hearing testimony in place of a child who refuses to testify in
person at the trial.
   ``We will vigorously oppose that,'' defense attorney Danny Davis
said. ``We have a real confrontation problem. ... If a mother says
the child doesn't want to testify because they're frightened, does
that reduce the trial to a video show?''
   ``As far as I understand, it should not affect our case,''
Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson said of the high court's
ruling, which severely limited state efforts to shield child
witnesses in sexual abuse trials.
   The high court overturned the conviction of a man who was
shielded by a one-way screen, which prevented child witnesses from
seeing him.
   Iowa, California and many other states have passed laws intended
to prevent children testifying at sex abuse trials from being
intimidated by the sight of defendants.
   The ruling ``casts serious doubt on the constitutionality'' of
California laws that allow children in molestation cases to testify
by videotape on closed-circuit television, said Steve White, the
state's chief assistant Attorney General.
   In the McMartin case, closed-circuit TV testimony was used
during the appearance of a single child at the preliminary hearing.
But the trial, which has been under way for more than a year, has
not used that device. All witnesses have testified in person.
   ``We have not at trial presented any witnesses where the
defendants could not see them or they could not see the
defendants,'' Gunson said, ``and we do not intend to use such
devices with the remaining children.''

<TEXT>
   A jury took 20 minutes to convict a
woman of gouging out a 16-year-old boy's eye to purge demons from
his body, but her attorney said she has a ``snow-white'' record and
should get a light sentence.
   A six-member jury Wednesday found Andrea Cowan guilty of cruelty
to a juvenile, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in
jail. District Judge Mike McDonald released her on her original
$10,000 bond.
   Attorney John Calmes, who argued Wednesday that Darrell
Washington had plucked out his own eye while he was in a psychotic
state on March 23, 1987, said he may appeal the verdict if Cowan
gets a harsh sentence at a hearing scheduled for Sept. 9.
   Cowan has a ``snow-white'' record and is hoping for a light
sentence, he said.
   Cowan, 26, sat calmly with her hands clasped as the verdict was
read to the crowded courtroom. Washington, now 17, sat two rows
behind her.
   Calmes and Assistant District Attorney Sue Bernie agreed that
Cowan, her husband, and her brother-in-law, the pastor of the Rock
Zion Baptist Church, were called to Washington's house because his
parents believed he was possessed.
   Washington testified Wednesday that he suffered what was
diagnosed as an anxiety attack while he was at school that day, was
taken to a hospital, and began saying vile things in strange voices
after he returned home.
   Washington testified that Cowan hit him on the head, and, after
taking him into his bedroom, bit his ears and plucked out his eye
to drive out the demons.
   Calmes had argued that Washington was in a psychotic state and
plucked his own eye out. However, Cowan's husband, Kevin Cowan, an
assistant pastor at the church, testified that the Lord plucked the
youth's eye out through his wife.

<TEXT>
   Anti-government guerrillas attacked
a military post in eastern Suriname, killing three soldiers and
wounding three others, the Suriname News Agency reported.
   The clash could threaten a cease-fire agreement between rebels
and government representatives, who met in neighboring French
Guiana on Tuesday.
   The soldiers were ambushed Wednesday near the eastern town of
Patamacca as they were drawing water at a pump, the state agency
reported.
   Rebel leader Ronny Brunswijk told a radio station and friends in
Paramaribo by radio on Wednesday that heavy fighting was still
going on since the army attacked his troops in Patamacca last
Friday. He said government soldiers had surrounded his troops,
wounding several.
   Army spokesman Commander Badressein Sital said Tuesday similar
allegations made by Brunswijk Monday were ``a big lie.''
   Brunswijk and government delegates signed an agreement that may
put an end to the guerrilla war that has ravaged this former Dutch
colony for nearly three years. The talks were mediated by the head
of the Council of Christian Churches, Roman Catholic Bishop
Aloisius Zichem.
   Army Commander Desi Bouterse repeated last week that the army
would not negotiate with terrorists but would not prevent the
government from doing so.
   Brunswijk, a former army private, began his attacks on military
and economic installations in the summer of 1986, when Bouterse was
president.
   Bouterse took power by coup in 1980. President Ramsewak Shankar
was elected president last November.
   Shankar's government is treating Brunswijk as a rebel against
the former regime, rather than as a terrorist and criminal, as
Bouterse had done.
   ``The president (Shankar) is also our president and we put our
trust in his government,'' Brunswijk said after the talks in French
Guiana, where he claims to have the support of an estimated 10,000
Surinamese refugees.
   After meeting with representatives of the Council of Christian
Churches to receive their report of the peace talks, President
Shankar met Wednesday with Bouterse. No information on their
meeting has been released.

<HEAD>NBC Announces Contingency Plans for `Writer-Proof' Fall Schedule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC says it will dust off scripts from
old shows and refilm them with new actors this fall, but striking
writers warned that the strategy would fail because ``there's no
such thing as a writer-proof script.''
   The network will use recycled scripts, rejected pilots, foreign
and ``writer-proof'' work as part of a four-point plan to deal with
the strike, NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff said
Wednesday.
   ``We at NBC have worked too hard dragging ourselves out of the
ratings cellar to sit back and let our efforts be dashed because of
the strike,'' Tartikoff said at a news conference that was sent by
satellite to NBC affiliate stations. ``We have been sitting back
patiently watching the negotiations but today we are taking
action.''
   The network will announce a revised fall schedule within 10
days, he said.
   ``We want to let both the public and our advertisers know that
come hell or high water we're going to deliver original shows in
the fall,'' Tartikoff said.
   But a spokeswoman for the 9,000-member Writers Guild of America
questioned that resolution.
   ``They're not going to fill their fall schedule without WGA
members,'' Cheryl Rhoden said. ``Even scripts that are already
written take rewrite work. There is no such thing as a writer-proof
script.''
   The guild struck the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers on March 7.
   Tartikoff noted that NBC was in better shape than the other
networks because its coverage of the Summer Olympics in Seoul,
Korea and baseball's World Series would delay its fall schedule
anyway.
   But NBC was fast approaching the time when, without contingency
plans, it would be unable to put a fall schedule on the air,
Tartikoff said.
   The four-point plan would include:
   _Original shows of existing series that have signed interim
agreements with the striking writers, such as ``The Cosby Show,''
``A Different World,'' ``Highway to Heaven'' and ``ALF.''
   _``Writer-proof'' programming such as ``Unsolved Mysteries'' and
a presentational variety show that does not require writers.
   _The purchase of British and Canadian comedy scripts and
passed-over pilot scripts in which additional episode scripts had
been ordered but never filmed.
   _The revival of old shows that are recast and filmed again using
the original scripts.
   The NBC programming department was sifting through nearly 500
properties looking for possible shows that could be put on the air,
Tartikoff said.
   He defended the plan to revive old shows and said they were not
junk.
   ``It would be much easier to simply buy the golden oldie reruns
than to film the new shows,'' he said.
   ``The example I've been giving to the studios is suppose that
Bruce Willis had not gone into `Moonlighting.' You could get eight
to 10 old Richie Brockleman'' scripts, a short-lived spinoff of
``The Rockford Files,'' and re-do them with Willis, he said.
   ``We all know that a lot of recycling goes on in this business
anyway. Look at Broadway. Without revivals half of Broadway would
be dark. The `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' show we revived two years
ago had 75 percent of the old original scripts.''

   The government today released 46
political prisoners and promised that the status of other
imprisoned dissidents would be reviewed later.
   Along with 453 other ordinary criminals, prison authorities
said, the 46 prisoners were released from various prisons.
   The release came on the first anniversary of President Roh
Tae-woo's promise to undertake democratic reforms. Ever since it
came to power, Roh's government has been trying to deflate
controversy over political prisoners.
   Among those freed today was prominent dissident Kim Kun-tae, who
recently received the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Human Rights. He
was sentenced to five years imprisonment in 1986 for inciting
unrest. International human rights groups have campaigned for his
release.
   Kim was released from a prison in the southern city of Kimchon
as about 30 relatives and friends welcomed him. ``Release all
political prisoners,'' they chanted.
   The Justice Ministry said the dissidents were released ``in line
with the government's continuing efforts to promote democracy in an
atmosphere of national harmony.''
   But opposition groups, which claim there are more than 600
prisoners, demanded the immediate release of other dissidents,
charging President Roh with failing to carry out some of his
promises for broad reforms.
   The opposition said the dissidents were imprisoned for political
beliefs or anti-government activity. But the government contends
they committed violent crimes or violated national security laws.
   Today the three opposition parties agreed to move a resolution
urging the release of all political prisoners. The opposition
stripped the government party of its parliamentary majority in
elections in April.
   Among others released today were five labor activists, a number
of radical students and five people arrested in December on charges
of leading violent protests against alleged government vote rigging
in presidential elections.
   Also released were 11 Koreans from Japan, convicted of spying
for communist North Korea. The 11 were arrested while visiting
South Korea in the late 1970s.
   Today's action left only 81 political offenders in prison,
government officials said. They said there also are about 480
others awaiting trial on similar charges.
   The parole coincided with the first anniversary of the so-called
``grand declaration for democracy'' made by Roh on June 29, 1987,
when nationwide protests forced the government to accept demands
for democratic reforms. He subsequently won the presidential
election.
   Since last year, hundreds of political prisoners have been
released in several amnesties.
   Ministry officials said the cases of dissidents still in jail
would be reviewed on a monthly basis, and they might be released
later.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Persist in Central U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms, some record-setting in intensity,
brought more desperately needed relief today to parts of the
central United States choking under a record-setting drought.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell over much of the central Plains,
and rain was widely scattered over much of the High Plains, the
lower and middle Mississippi Valley and along the Atlantic Coast.
   A few of the thunderstorms on Wednesday unleashed high winds and
in southwest Texas spawned a tornado.
   Springfield, Mo., received more than 3{ inches of rain, more
than double the record of 1.51 inches set on the date in 1905.
Nearly 5 inches deluged Wilsey, Kan., 60 miles southwest of Topeka,
and Hill City, S.D., got 2 inches.
   Thunderstorms in eastern Kansas produced wind gusts up to 60
mph, downing several large trees at Pittsburg, gusts to 69 mph
south of Glasgow, Mont., and gusts to 65 mph at Miami, Okla.
   A break from the heat continued in most areas, although the
mercury hit 105 degrees in Jackson, Miss., on Wednesday, surpassing
the June record of 103 set in 1969. Shortly before midnight, the
temperature at Youngstown, Ohio, dipped to 48 degrees to break the
previous record low of 51 for June 29.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
central and lower Missouri Valley through northern and eastern
Oklahoma and into much of the Tennessee Valley and the southern
Atlantic region; showers and a few thunderstorms from the northern
and central Plains through Arkansas into much of the Southeast
states and Florida; and showers scattered across northern parts and
coastal areas of New England.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s across the northern parts
of the Great Lakes into New England; the 50s for extreme northern
New England; the 90s from the southern Rockies through the southern
Plains, the lower Mississippi Valley and the southern Atlantic
Coast into Florida; around 100 in parts of central Mississippi and
the Rio Grande Plains of Texas; and between 100 and 110 from the
valleys of California into the Southwestern deserts.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Burns, Ore., to 89 degrees at Las Vegas, Nev., and
Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls But Off Early Lows, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in European trading this morning
but was recovering from its early lows as the market waited to find
out whether the West German central bank will raise interest rates.
   Gold prices were higher in moderate trading.
   The dollar dropped in East Asian trading on profit-taking on the
dollar's recent gains, dealers in Europe said.
   Traders said they expected the market to remain quiet until the
Deutsche Bundesbank's top policy-making body, the central bank
council, decides whether or not to raise its official discount
rate, the rate it charges to commercial banks.
   Dealers said they expect the council to vote to lift the
discount rate by half a percentage point to 3 percent and to
increase domestic money market rates by a quarter percentage point.
   ``All eyes are on the Bundesbank, and there's going to be little
activity until the decision is announced or not announced,'' said a
Frankfurt trader.
   One senior trader with an Italian bank in Milan said the dollar
could fall in reaction to a rise in West German interest rates.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.20 yen to a closing 132.20 yen. Later, in
London, it rose to 133.40 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates:
   _ 1.8205 West German marks, down from 1.8290
   _ 1.5098 Swiss francs, down from 1.5155
   _ 6.1375 French francs, down from 6.1635
   _ 2.0492 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0545
   _ 1,349.50 Italian lire, down from 1,350.75
   _ 1.2150 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2173
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7075, stronger
than $1.7060 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $436.80 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $436.85, both up from Wednesday's late bid of
$433.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $436.75, up from $433.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 86 cents to close at a bid
$439.18.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.64 a troy
ounce, down from Wednesday's $6.66.

<HEAD>Subpoenas Served on Three Top Northrop Executives</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp.'s chairman and two top
executives have been ordered to testify before a federal grand jury
investigating payments of more than $6.5 million to South Korean
businesses, the defense contractor said. The subpoenas were issued
by the grand jury for the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,
Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said Wednesday. Northrop also was
ordered to produce documents related to its Korean deals.
   Federal officials were not immediately available to comment on
the action. A call placed to the U.S. Attorney's office after
business hours Wednesday went unanswered.
   The Justice Department and a Congressional subcommittee have
reportedly been conducting criminal investigations into Northrop's
payment of more than $6.5 million to Korean businesses in
connection with attempts to sell its F-20 ``Tigershark'' jet
fighter to the Korean military.
   Northrop has denied it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act and has said it was a victim of fraud by its Korean partners in
a joint venture to build a hotel and office project in Seoul.
   ``We made this investment in 1984 in good faith and to show our
commitment to Korea on the F-20 project,'' Cantafio said.
   ``We made several attempts to get the hotel built, but our
partners delayed the project. When it became clear we weren't going
to get the hotel built, we tried to get our money back by going to
arbitration in Korea.''
   When Northrop couldn't get its money refunded, Cantafio said,
the defense contractor filed a civil lawsuit against its Korean
partners to recover the $6.25 million that it paid into one of the
ventures.
   Eventually, Northrop's program to develop the F-20 jet fighter
failed, with development costs tagged at $1.2 billion without a
single plane being sold.
   Cantafio said the executives ordered to appear before the grand
jury were Thomas V. Jones, Northrop's chairman and chief executive
officer; Welko E. Gasich, an executive vice president; and William
C. McGagh, identified by Cantafio as Northrop's former chief
financial officer.
   Although McGagh's retirement was announced in April, he has been
working with the company during a transition period.

<HEAD>Parliament Reinstates Musavi As Prime Minister</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi was
re-elected by Parliament today and warned that Iran must prepare
for ``all-out struggle'' against Iraq and its other enemies, Iran's
official news agency reported.
   He was reinstated for a fourth term with an overwhelming vote of
confidence by the Majlis, or Parliament, the Islamic Republic News
Agency said.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said 204 of the 217 deputies
present in the Majlis voted for Musavi. Eight voted against him and
five abstained.
   The remainder of the 270 members apparently did not attend the
session.
   The radical Musavi's re-election had been expected following
Parliamentary elections in April and May in which his supporters
and their allies made sweeping gains at the expense of conservative
factions.
   Musavi, 44, has been prime minister since 1981. He said he will
introduce members of his new cabinet in the Majlis next week,
though he said last week that he would be making few changes.
   In a speech before today's vote, Musavi declared that a
``massive mobilization by Iran's enemies is a warning that we must
prepare for an ... all-out struggle against them.''
   He stressed: ``We are faced with an historic confrontation, the
most important manifestation of which has emerged in the
warfronts'' with Iraq.
   He did not elaborate. But he was clearly referring to a string
of Iraqi victories since mid-April in which the Iranians have been
driven out of three of their four bridgeheads on Iraqi soil in a
dramatic turnaround in the nearly 8-year-old conflict.
   The Iranians also claim the United States is actively helping
the Iraqis. The U.S. Navy sank or crippled six Iranian naval craft
in a series of clashes April 18.
   The main objective of the Iraqi-U.S. campaign is to destroy the
Iranian revolution, Musavi said.
   But he declared that Iran is ``potentially capable of putting up
a durable resistance against an all-out economic and arms embargo
by the Great Satan,'' Iran's catchword for the United States.
   Without mentioning any figures, Musavi said the government's
financial and foreign exchange resources ``are limited.'' But he
said that if they are not being used ``to full capacity at present,
they will be in the future.''
   Iran's foreign exchange holdings are estimated at around $5.5
billion.
   They were about $7.5 billion in 1986. But Tehran had to draw on
them heavily to compensate for the collapse of oil prices that year.
   Musavi said Iran's arms industry, built up over the last two
years to sidestep arms embargoes, now produces enough hardware and
ammunition to save the country $50 million a year, IRNA reported.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A college student using a ``TV knowledge''
of childbirth delivered a baby girl on a city sidewalk while
several passers-by looked on.
   ``I'm still high,'' Patrick Combs, 21, a senior at San Francisco
State University, said Wednesday. ``I couldn't believe I was the
first person to touch this baby. When her eyes opened up and she
looked around I just started screaming. The feeling was so
incredible!''
   Shortly after 7 a.m. Wednesday, when Combs left his apartment
for his job at the Levi Strauss Co., he saw a woman lying in a
stairwell next to the sidewalk. She told him she was pregnant and
needed an ambulance.
   He went to call the ambulance, then helped the woman onto the
sidewalk. Several people looked on, he said, but none offered to
help.
   ``They just stood there. It was like she was being shunned.''
   After a neighbor brought a blanket and pillow, Combs went into
action. He removed the woman's pants and spent 15 minutes soothing
her and encouraging her to push.
   ``I just kept telling myself you can have babies anywhere.
Anywhere,'' he said.
   The baby's head appeared.
   ``It was so purple, I didn't know what it was,'' said Combs, who
said he had only seen deliveries on television.
   ``I had a baby head sticking out right there. I didn't know what
to do. I figured doctors would hold the head, but did they pull on
it to help the baby out? I didn't know.''
   Combs cradled the tiny head in his hands just as the woman
pushed again. That contraction pushed the baby all the way out and
left him holding what he called ``a slippery noodle'' of a human
being.
   An ambulance arrrived 40 minutes after Combs stopped to help.
   The mother and daughter were taken to San Francisco General
Hospital.

<HEAD>Taxes And the Summer Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Has a school-age member of your family landed a
summer job?
   Good news! And a hearty welcome for that youngster to the wide
world of taxes and tax planning.
   Sad to report, even a couple of months of waiting on tables,
painting houses or serving as a lifeguard at the local swimming
spot may bring a date of reckoning with Uncle Sam.
   If the summer worker has no ``unearned'' income, he or she won't
have to pay any income tax on wage, salary or tip earnings up to
the standard deduction of $3,000, notes the accounting firm of
Price Waterhouse.
   But for workers who do have income from some source other than a
job _ even interest from a modest savings account _ the situation
is likely to be more complicated.
   Furthermore, anyone who won't owe taxes still needs to play the
game right to avoid having money withheld that can't be retrieved
until a tax return is filed in early 1989 claiming a refund.
   The assignment starts with Form W-4, the Internal Revenue
Service document filed with the employer to determine a worker's
withholding status.
   ``If the child paid no income tax in 1987 and expects to pay
none in 1988, he or she can avoid withholding by completing only
the bottom of the W-4 certificate,'' Price Waterhouse says in a
current report on the subject.
   ``However, the youngster cannot claim exempt status if he or she
can be claimed as a dependent by you or someone else, has nonwage
income and expects his or her total income (both earned and
unearned) to be more than $500.''
   If withholding is necessary, the trick, as for all taxpayers, is
to set it neither too high nor too low.
   Overwithholding means effectively giving a tax-free loan to the
government. Underwithholding can incur penalties and interest
charges from the IRS.
   ``If your child works only part-time or only for the summer
months, the boss may withhold too much from his or her wages if
withholding is based on a worker's annual pay,'' Price Waterhouse
points out.
   To forestall this, the employer can be asked to apply a
different method of withholding that projects summer wages over a
full year and thus reduces the amount taken out of each paycheck.
   To prevent problems with underwithholding, the youngster's
withholding payments (and any quarterly estimated taxes) for the
year must total at least 90 percent of the tax ultimately due, or
100 percent of the previous year's tax bill.
   In cases where summer workers have significant amounts of other
income from savings or investments, Price Waterhouse says, they may
want to request withholding beyond what the job itself would call
for.
   That could serve as a substitute for filing quarterly estimated
returns to cover the taxes owed on the investment income.
   It is also sensible to be aware of strategies available to
reduce a summer worker's tax burden.
   Most people of school age are eligible to deduct on their tax
returns annual contributions of up to $2,000 to an individual
retirement account.
   Of course, many of those same people aren't disposed to toil
through the summer and then put what they earn in a place where
they won't see it for 40 years or more. Chances are, immediate
expenses have first claim on the money.
   But if parents' financial position allows it, they can reimburse
the child for the IRA contribution with a gift that isn't taxable
unless it exceeds $10,000 per year.
   That way, the youngster comes away from the summer job with some
current income, and an investment for the future that has a long
time to compound and grow.

<HEAD>Military Says Soviets Not Fighting Rebels During Afghan Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels have killed 10 Soviet soldiers by
shelling garrisons since the Red Army began withdrawing from
Afghanistan, but the Soviets are no longer actively fighting the
guerrillas, the military said.
   About 20,000 Soviet soldiers have left Afghanistan since May 15,
Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov said Wednesday.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979. More than
100,000 soldiers were helping the Marxist government fight
U.S.-backed Moslem rebels before an agreement providing for their
withdrawal was signed in April.
   Gromov was in Moscow as a delegate to the 19th Communist Party
conference, representing soldiers in Afghanistan.
   He denied reports by Western diplomats in Pakistan of rebel
successes in border areas that Soviet forces have abandoned.
   Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov of the military general staff was also
at the press conference.
   ``From May 15 there were losses, not considerable, but about 10
killed and 15 wounded,'' Gromov said.
   ``They took place not while the withdrawal was being carried out
but as a result of shelling of our garrisons that were supplying
materiel to other garrisons,'' he said.
   ``The Soviet troops are not taking part in action,'' Gromov
said, adding that his main problem ``is to avoid losses, on our
side and the other side, let alone the population.''
   He said he could not give figures for casualties among the
Afghan army or Moslem insurgents.
   Soviet soldiers have been attacked near the eastern city of
Jalalabad and other places along their route out of the country,
Gromov said. ``But all these attempts were cut short. We had no
losses in men and materiel.''
   Western diplomats in Pakistan have said that Soviet soldiers in
the Afghan city of Kandahar had to move to the airport outside of
the city because of rebel pressure on the town itself.
   The diplomats also have reported that rebels had taken their
first provincial capital, Kalat in neighboring Zabul province,
thereby cutting a major road between Kandahar and the capital,
Kabul.
   Gromov called both reports false. Soviet soldiers supply
Kandahar with food and other goods daily from the airport, he said.
   ``I can say quite officially that Kalat was not captured,'' he
added. ``The opposition couldn't capture Kalat. From the military
point of view it is only one more proof that the Afghan armed
forces are capable of carrying out their duty.''
   In Islamabad, Pakistan today, Western diplomatic sources said
Moslem guerrillas were still fighting for a provincial center just
west of Kabul. That contradicted rebel claims that they had driven
communist forces from the area.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels
succeeded in routing Soviet and Afghan government troops from
Maidan Shahr, 18 miles southeast of Kabul, on June 24.
   However, the insurgents were pushed out a day later by communist
artillery, the sources said. They said the battle was still raging.
   Some guerrilla groups reported Sunday that the town was under
rebel control, opening a new attack route to the heights
overlooking western Kabul.

<HEAD>Drug Testing Proposed For Mass Transit Workers, Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mandatory, random drug testing of transportation
workers is ``the only effective, reliable method'' for weeding out
drug abusers, says Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley, but unions
disagree.
   At a news conference Wednesday, Burnley announced a
Transportation Department proposal for such testing among more than
350,000 mass transit workers, merchant seafarers and pipeline
industry workers. The proposal is in line with Burnley's earlier
call for testing in the airline, railroad and trucking industries.
   Burnley said he hoped to have rules imposed in all six sectors
by the end of the year.
   If enacted as proposed, the rules would require workers
throughout the transportation industry to submit to drug tests
before they are employed, at random intervals while they are
working, whenever there is probable cause to believe they are
abusing drugs, and whenever they are involved in an accident.
   ``Nobody has a right in this country ... to have a job in which
they can put the lives of other people in mass transportation at
risk through narcotics ingestion,'' Burnley said Wednesday.
   But transportation unions denounced the proposal as overkill.
   ``Obviously, nobody who's taking drugs and drinking on the job
should be operating a train or a bus,'' said Jim Gannon, spokesman
for the Transport Workers Union representing 100,000 mass transit
workers. ``But I think the percentage of those people is so low
that just to approach it in a Gestapo-type manner is not right.''
   Gannon said the TWU supports mandatory drug testing before
employment, during annual medical examinations and when there is
probable cause to suspect drug use.
   A spokesman for the Seafarers International Union, which
represents 18,000 deep-sea sailors, said he couldn't comment on
Burnley's proposals until he had seen them. But, he said,
``generally, we have not supported mandatory, random testing.''
   Burnley called mandatory, random testing ``the only effective,
reliable method'' of enforcement, and said the benefits outweigh
the loss of privacy to workers.
   The department's proposal will be subject to 60 days of public
comment before final rules are drafted, he said.

<HEAD>Friends Say Minister's Arrest on Rape Charges a `Nightmare'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends and relatives of a Southern Baptist
minister say they are stunned that he has been charged with five
cases of sexual assault in connection with a string of attacks
blamed on the so-called Village Rapist.
   Gregory Charles Goben, 28, was jailed on $453,500 bail on four
counts of sexual assault and one of aggravated sexual assault,
Dallas County Sheriff's spokesman Jim Ewell said Wednesday.
   Goben was arrested late Monday in an attempted burglary of an
apartment, said police Sgt. Larry Lewis. The Dallas Times Herald
cited unidentified sources saying Goben was linked to assaults in
the area through fingerprints.
   The Village Rapist is believed responsible for as many as 20
attacks since 1986 in the sprawling apartment complexes known as
The Village.
   Friends described Goben, pastor of Outreach Baptist Church in
suburban Garland, as a man devoted to his church and his wife and
two sons.
   ``He's always been one of the finest, kindest young men I've
ever known,'' said the Rev. John Sullivan, pastor of Broadmoor
Baptist Church in Shreveport, La., who has known the suspect since
Goben was a teen-ager.
   ``This is just unbelievable; it's a nightmare,'' said Jerry
Jones, Goben's brother-in-law, a lawyer in Shreveport. ``He didn't
do it. We just hope and pray it's something that will be resolved.''
   ``He never drank, he never smoked and he never used bad
language. This is just a grand plan by Satan to destroy someone who
helps others find the Lord through the gospel,'' said Gladys Teer,
Goben's grandmother.
   She said Goben told his parents that he was out on a nightly run
when he was stopped by a security guard. ``There were two men who
had just been robbed who saw him run by and thought he (committed)
the robbery. So, they took after him,'' Ms. Teer said. ``He ran
through this apartment complex, and the security guard saw him
running and put handcuffs on him.''
   The Outreach Church is one of 28 mission churches sponsored by
First Baptist Church of Dallas, which provides funds to pay the
minister's salary and helps the church get started.
   Goben had been pastor of the church for two years, said the Rev.
Lanny Elmore, Goben's supervisor.
   The Village Rapist wore a ski mask and generally tied his
victims' hands with a belt or other article or clothing, according
to police. In at least two cases, the assailant expressed remorse,
police said.
   Police reports said the assailant told one victim, ``At times he
would like to shoot a bullet into his head because he wished that
he could stop doing this,'' The Dallas Morning News reported.

<HEAD>Gang Members Tell Task Force That Death Penalty is Not a Deterrent</HEAD>

   Police sweeps and threats of the gas chamber
cannot stop street gangs from killing to protect their highly
profitable drug trade, two gang members testified.
   ``When I'm out there doing my thing, I don't think about the
consequences. I won't think about the death penalty at the time
because I'm just thinking about getting away,'' a gang member
identified by the pseudonym John told a state task force meeting
Wednesday to plot a war on gangs and drug trafficking.
   Testimony from John and another member of the city's
predominantly black Crips gang, identified by the pseudonym Jack,
highlighted the first day of a two-day hearing.
   The meeting followed a night of violence in which 11 people were
wounded in shootings, many of them gang-related.
   The testimony was piped by loudspeaker into the hearing room at
the County Hall of Administration, while the two men remained
concealed in an adjacent room. The two said they were arrested more
than 10 times each on such charges as robbery and illegal firearms
possession.
   John, 28, became a gang member at age 10 and has spent three
years in state prison and four years in California Youth Authority
facilities.
   His death penalty comment was in response to a question by task
force chairman Robert Philibosian, former county district attorney.
   John also said the Police Department's anti-gang sweeps were
useless, although they have resulted in 16,000 arrests so far this
year, 8,000 of whom were gang members.
   ``As soon as you arrest one, it will be replaced with another,''
John said.
   Other witnesses said gangs had become so sophisticated they hold
out-of-state seminars on expanding their drug empire.
   Jack and John said they were enticed by a narcotics business
that can net them $1,000 a day, but that competition had become so
fierce in Los Angeles that gang members were exporting their
illegal trade elsewhere.
   ``Bakersfield, Sacramento, Seattle, Texas, Dallas and Houston.
It's really going on up there, that's where it's at. Texas is the
hot spot,'' John said. ``You take $100 worth of dope, make $600 or
$700 off of it.''
   Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates suggested incarceration as
a solution to the gang problem.
   ``Let's take those old (military) bases, put some barbed wire
and land mines outside it. Why not?'' he said.
   The chief said the LAPD has found gang members living in
million-dollar houses, while Lt. Larry Carter of the suburban
Inglewood Police Department said a local gang member was arrested
in Seattle with $35,000 in his pocket.
   Called urban terrorists by Philibosian, county street gangs
accounted for 387 slayings in 1987 and more than 140 murders
already this year. Authorities said gangs are using such
military-style weapons as Uzi machine guns, AK-47s and AR-15
assault rifles.
   ``They go out like cowards and shoot little kids and innocent
people. They have no conscience and concern. It's a hideous thing
like you found in Nazi Germany. And we have it here. And our people
have to live with it,'' Gates said.

   Marcel Lefebvre speaks softly, but his
benign smile belies his fierce fight to rid the Roman Catholic
Church of what he calls the ``satanic influence'' of liberalism.
   ``Our future is the past,'' the 82-year-old French
traditionalist declares.
   He says the church has been infiltrated by ``wolves and
thieves.'' He blasts the ``neo-modernist and neo-Protestant
tendencies'' created by Vatican reforms and says the church must be
saved from ``auto-destruction.''
   The rebel archbishop's crusade culminated today with the
consecration of four traditionalist bishops in this hamlet where he
founded the St. Pius X Fraternity, named for the pope who condemned
modernism in a 1907 encyclical.
   The Vatican announced the excommunication of the five shortly
afterward, citing church rules that prohibit consecration of
bishops without papal permission.
   It led to the first major split in the church since 1870, when
the Old Catholics broke with Rome after the First Vatican Council
proclaimed the doctrine of papal infallibility.
   Followers venerate Lefebvre as a representative of the ``true
church.'' To critics he is an incorrigible reactionary who admired
Gen. Francisco Franco, the late Spanish dictator, and would like
the French monarchy restored.
   He says a French cardinal, Gabriel-Marie Garrone, once called
him a lunatic.
   Lefebvre was ordained in 1929 after obtaining doctorates in
philosophy and theology. In 1932, he was sent to Gabon, then a
French colony, and spent 13 years there as a missionary.
   After a brief spell in France after World War II, he returned to
Africa as apostolic delegate, the Pope's personal representative
for all French-speaking regions of the continent.
   He was appointed archbishop of Dakar, Senegal, in 1955 and was
succeeded in the post by a native Senegalese, now Cardinal
Hyacinthe Thiandoum, whom he had ordained.
   Pope John XXIII made him a member of the commission that
prepared the Second Vatican Council.
   During that council in 1962-65, Lefebvre was among the leaders
of a group committed to ``uphold the traditional faith.'' He
refused to sign two of the council's 16 documents, those called
``Religious Freedom'' and ``The Church in the Modern World.''
   Traditionalists say the campaign against Lefebvre originated in
France. They claim the French hierarchy, facing a decline in its
own system, was envious of the increasing number of seminarians at
Econe.
   Lefebvre issued a declaration in 1974 saying his fraternity
refuses ``to follow the Rome of neo-modernist and neo-Protestant
tendencies.''
   He continued celebrating Mass in the Latin liturgy and dismissed
the ``bastard rites'' in the vernacular that took its place under
the Second Vatican Council.
   In 1976, Pope Paul VI suspended him from priestly functions
``because of the scandal caused to the Christian people by your
obstinacy.''
   That barred him from celebrating Mass and giving the sacraments,
but Lefebvre called the sanction ``illegal'' and has ignored it,
ordaining more than 220 traditionalist priests.
   His organization operates seminaries thoughout the world and
Lefebvre says bishops must be consecrated to carry the movement on
after he dies.
   He toned down his comments after the election in 1978 of Pope
John Paul II, whom liberal theologians consider pro-conservative.
   Reconciliation with the Vatican seemed near when he and Cardinal
Joseph Ratzinger signed a ``protocol'' May 5, but Lefebvre finally
rejected the accord because of a clause giving Vatican
representatives the majority on a commission to settle differences
in interpretation of Vatican II documents.
   ``It is to guard carefully the faith of our baptism that we must
oppose the spirit of Vatican II and all the reforms it inspired,''
he wrote the pope on June 2.
   In his reply a week later, John Paul urged Lefebvre to renounce
his plan, warning that such a ``schismatic act'' would have
``inevitable canonical consequences.''
   Lefebvre remained unimpressed. ``It is no longer possible to
trust Rome,'' he told a news conference June 15 at which he said he
would go ahead with the consecrations.

<HEAD>Customs: Arrest Stops Iran Helicopter Smuggling Ring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The arrest of a British man who allegedly plotted
to sell 10 U.S. military-type helicopters to Iran for $30 million
has triggered a search for other U.S. military supplies destined
for the boycotted nation.
   Colin Breeze, 33, was held without bond Wednesday at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center for allegedly conspiring to
violate the U.S. embargo of Iran, said Patrick O'Brien, head of the
U.S. Customs Service in Miami.
   Investigators say Breeze schemed with the Iranian ambassador to
Spain to sell 10 Sikorsky S-36 helicopters to a European company
secretly owned by the Iranian government. The ambassador intended
to take a cut from the sale, said O'Brien.
   ``We are continuing the investigation to look for diversions of
military equipment to Iran,'' he said.
   Breeze's arrest Tuesday at the Fort Lauderdale airport
apparently ended attempts to lure other conspirators into the
country, but agents suspect the operation was part of a much larger
network.
   Breeze appeared Wednesday before a federal magistrate, who
ordered him held without bond. Another hearing was scheduled for
Friday.
   ``The S-36 is a military-type helicopter,'' O'Brien said,
declining to give details of the case. ``They are basically a troop
carrier, a civilian version of the Blackhawk. These things are
great over the desert.''
   The helicopters were originally sold to the Jordanian air force
in 1979 and 1980. Six were later traded back to Sikorsky but
remained in Jordan, and all 10 were for sale at $675,000 each.
   Sikorsky spokesman Bob Stangarone in Stratford, Conn., confirmed
the company owned the six helicopters but said it had never dealt
with Breeze.
   In May, the arrest affidavit says Breeze allegedly approached an
informant for the Customs Service about buying the helicopters for
Iran. The informant advised Customs, and authorities taped
conversations between the two.
   In the conversations, some of which took place in Spain and the
United Kingdom, Breeze, a British subject, told the informant the
ultimate purchaser was Iran.
   ``Breeze further advised that negotiations for the purchase were
being conducted through a Spanish national middleman and the
Iranian Embassy in Madrid,'' Fort Lauderdale Customs agent Thomas
Bailey said in the affidavit.
   Breeze told the informant last week that the sales agreement was
on its way by diplomatic pouch from Madrid to Iran for final
approval. But he later said it was held up because the ambassador
was insisting on a larger share of the profits.

<HEAD>Three Indicted on Illegal Weapons Technology Export Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rocket scientist, a marketing
representative and an Egyptian army colonel have been indicted on
charges of illegally exporting technology used in sophisticated
missile weapons, authorities said.
   Federal grand jury indictments were handed up Wednesday against
Aerojet Solid Propulsion Co. rocket specialist Abdelkader Helmy,
40, of El Dorado Hills; James Huffman, 46, of Lexington, Ohio, the
Midwest marketing representative of Teledyne, McCormick, Selph, a
defense aerospace company based in Hollister; and Egyptian army
Col. Hussam Yossef of Salzburg, Austria.
   The indictments followed the arrests Friday of Helmy and Huffman.
   Huffman, arrested in Indian River, Md., posted $100,000 bond
Wednesday and was released from custody.
   Helmy was ordered held without bail Wednesday by U.S. Magistrate
Esther Mix in Sacramento, who cited the serious nature of the
alleged offenses, Helmy's ties to Egypt, and the strength of the
evidence against him.
   California U.S. Attorney David Levi said his office plans to
seek extradition of Yossef from Austria. A spokesman for Levi said
she didn't know if Yossef was in custody.
   The indictments charge the three with illegally exporting about
430 pounds of a carbon composite material to Europe and Egypt
without obtaining the necessary licenses.
   The special carbon material has a low visibility level to radar
and is used extensively in high-speed aircraft, missiles and
rockets. It is on the federal restricted list and requires special
licenses to be exported.
   The suspects also were charged with money laundering because
they allegedly wired funds into the United States for the purpose
of promoting an unlawful activity, Levi said.
   If convicted, each of the accused face maximum prison sentences
of 95 years and possible fines totaling several million dollars,
said Levi.

   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri rode a
$48,000 Hyundai and a message of economic nationalism to fleeting
stardom in the Democratic presidential campaign.
   To the suprise of many, Gephardt transformed himself from a
congressman little known outside of Capitol Hill to winner of the
Iowa caucuses. Now he is among those mentioned as possible running
mates for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   But Gephardt, 47, says he doesn't think he'll be asked to join
the ticket and predicts the nominee will ``look to the South to
fill that bill.''
   ``I don't expect to be asked, but if I were asked I would do it
because I want to help Gov. Dukakis win the presidency and the
Democrats win the presidency in 1988. And if he feels I can help in
that way, I'll do it,'' says Gephardt.
   He declines to say whether he has discussed the No. 2 spot with
Dukakis or any of his campaign aides.
   Those who point to Gephardt suggest he could provide Dukakis
with needed strength in the midwestern Farm Belt. They also say his
skills as a campaigner, one who demonstrated he could excite voters
with his populist ``It's your fight too'' oratory, would offer a
counterbalance to the governor's staid demeanor.
   But Dukakis and Gephardt clashed on issues during the campaign,
particularly on trade, and some political professionals say that
those differences could hurt the Democratic ticket by providing
Republicans with plenty of ammunition for the general election.
   It was the Dukakis camp that broadcast perhaps the most pointed
attack on Gephardt. A television commercial pointed to Gephardt's
``flip-flops'' on issues, including abortion, and showed an
acrobat, who looked like Gephardt, doing somersaults.
   Some Democrats also worry that Dukakis could anger supporters of
the Rev. Jesse Jackson if he fills the No. 2 spot with one of his
former rivals and doesn't offer it to Jackson.
   Gephardt, serving his sixth term in the House representing a
mostly blue-collar district in St. Louis, wears a Capitol Hill
reputation as a leader among a new generation of House Democrats.
He is known as a legislator's legislator, who excels in the molding
of compromises.
   He also has demonstrated a knack for positioning himself on the
cutting edge of issues. He and Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., were
early advocates of an overhaul of the federal income tax system.
   But Gephardt made his mark on the campaign trail for his tough
talk on trade.
   He championed a proposal for mandatory retaliation against
foreign competitors failing to lower their trade surpluses with the
United States. Critics, including Dukakis, denounced it as
protectionism. The proposal, initially approved by the House, was
ejected from the trade bill eventually passed by Congress and
vetoed by President Reagan.
   Gephardt won the Iowa caucuses after bouncing back from
single-digit, fourth place standings in opinion polls six weeks
before the contest.
   His prescription for recovery was a sharply anti-establishment
theme in his speeches and a television blitz featuring an
advertisement with Gephardt criticizing Korea's tariffs on American
automobiles. The candidate vowed in the ad to retaliate if trade
barriers didn't disappear: ``How many Americans are going to pay
$48,000 for one of their Hyundais?''
   But Gephardt's victory in farm country proved to be his
brightest moment in the political sun. He finished second in New
Hampshire, received a brief boost with a victory in South Dakota,
but ran low on money and was buried in the Super Tuesday primaries
and caucuses on March 8. He abandoned the race on March 28, after
limping to a third-place finish in the Michigan caucuses.
   Before entering the presidential race, Gephardt was known as a
centrist or moderate, even conservative on some social issues. He
once backed anti-abortion constitutional amendments and sponsored
legislation to prohibit busing of school children for
desegregation. He no longer supports either, however, saying there
are more effective ways of achieving the same results.
   Critics say Gephardt has become more liberal because of his
national political aspirations. Gephardt says the changes reflect
growth and flexibility.
   He arrived in Congress in 1977 after coming up through the ranks
in St. Louis politics, where he was one of several activist
Democratic aldermen called the ``Young Turks.''
   He earned a coveted seat on the tax-writing Ways and Means
Committee as a freshman. Since 1985, Gephardt has served as the
chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, the No. 4 leadership spot.

<TEXT>
   Luther E. Gibson, a former newspaper
owner and state senator, has died at the age of 93.
   Gibson, who had been in poor health for the past few years, died
Wednesday at his home.
   Gibson was the owner or part-owner of several newspapers in
Solano and Contra Costa counties, buying his first paper, the
Antioch Tribune, in 1919.
   From 1948 to 1968, Gibson, a Democrat, represented Vallejo and
Benicia in the Legislature.
   The Felton native began his newspaper career as an apprentice,
setting type for publications in Santa Cruz. He remained a member
of the International Typesetters Union throughout his life.
   Gibson moved to Vallejo in the 1920s and founded the Vallejo
Herald, a morning daily, in 1922. Later that same year, he bought
the Vallejo Times and merged the two papers into the Vallejo
Times-Herald.
   Five years later, Gibson bought the Vallejo Evening Chronicle
and merged it with another afternoon paper, the Vallejo News, to
form the Evening News-Chronicle.
   Gibson sold the Times-Herald to the Donrey Media Group in 1974.
He earlier had stopped publishing the News-Chronicle.
   At one time, Gibson also owned or partly owned the Martinez
News-Gazette, the Napa Journal, Sonora Democrat and Daily Contra
Costa Gazette. He still owned Gibson Publications, which publishes
the Benicia Herald.
   Gibson is survived by his wife, Maybelle, the couple's daughter,
Jeanne Payne of Vallejo, and three grandchildren.
   Services were scheduled for Friday in Vallejo.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-three years after this town closed
both its swimming pools rather than integrate them, a single pool
for everyone was opened to the cheers of blacks and whites alike.
   ``This pool is going to get integrated in a few minutes. George
and I are going to integrate it,'' said Fred Edwards, who is white
and served as an alderman in 1954 when the Redbud Park pool was
constructed specifically for blacks.
   The Redbud Park pool in southwest Canton and another pool in the
northwest part of town were closed in 1965 when black residents
tried to integrate the public facilities.
   Edwards and 77-year-old George Washington, who is black, jumped
into a new pool at Redbud Park simultaneously Wednesday.
   ``It was a long time coming. It was something we had to do and
was needed,'' Alderman Jewel Williams said. ``We had pools, and
they were closed. That should never have happened.''
   As city officials gave their speeches, Edwards and Washington
waited poolside for their symbolic dive. Edwards wore black socks
as protection against the concrete, made almost unbearable by the
105-degree heat.
   The 25-meter pool was built on the site of a trash dump, about
20 yards from the old pool site.
   The dedication plaque for the old pool still stands. It reads:
``Dedicated to the colored citizens of Canton. Project of the Negro
Chamber of Commerce.''
   ``It's bringing people together,'' Alderman John Taylor said
about the new pool. ``I think we are doing something for everybody.
I'm so proud of this pool.''

   Officials are considering turning disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh over to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's home region until
the demands of two ethnic groups can be resolved, a delegate to the
Communist Party conference said today.
   Eduard M. Dzhrbashyan, director of the Institute of Literature
of Armenia's Academy of Sciences, said the proposal was one of
three under consideration.
   Armenians, who make up the majority of Nagorno-Karabakh's
population, have been demanding since February that the region be
taken out of the republic of Azerbaijan and be annexed to
neighboring Armenia. The Armenian parliament endorsed the demand,
but Azerbaijan rejected it.
   Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature proposed a compromise June 21 in
a move to calm tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis that
have led to strikes, demonstrations and riots. The legislature
suggested turning the region over to the central government in
Moscow until a long-term solution is found.
   At a Moscow news conference, Dzhrbashyan offered another
temporary compromise. He said Nagorno-Karabakh, classified as an
autonomous region of Azerbaijan, should be put under the control of
the Russian republic, specifically of the Stavropol region of
southern Russia.
   Dzhrbashyan did not make clear who was considering the
compromise, but his mention of it as a conference delegate
indicated it had some official support.
   Gorbachev was born in a farming village in the Stavropol region
in 1931. After completing law school in Moscow in 1955, he returned
to his home district along with wife Raisa and worked there for 23
years, serving successively as head of the Communist youth league,
city party boss and party chief in the region, which is about the
size of South Carolina.
   Sergei A. Ambartsumyan, head of Yerevan University in Armenia's
capital and a conference delegate, also mentioned at the news
conference the possibility of temporarily transferring
Nagorno-Karabakh to the Russian republic.
   Grant M. Voskanyan, Armenia's president, told the news
conference he is on a commission of the conference that is drafting
the resolution and that it contains no specific proposals for
resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute. But he said the party's
Central Committee recommended the conference discuss ``perfecting
federation of the country'' and expanding the rights of republics.
   Voskanyan refused to endorse any of the proposed solutions to
the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.
   ``The question is extremely complicated because two union
republics have taken practically opposite decisions,'' Voskanyan
said. ``In such a situation, governmental wisdom to resolve the
issue ... in the interests of all people is demanded of our
republic and all of us.''
   The Communist Party conference is scheduled to adopt a
resolution outlining policy toward the country's more than 100
ethnic groups.

   Rain soaked the drought-stricken Plains today, but prayers for
precipitation by Alabama's governor went unanswered and forecasters
cautioned that a lot more rain would be needed to reverse the long
dry spell.
   ``It's likely to get worse before it gets better,'' Michael
Hudlow, director of hydrology for the National Weather Service said
as long-range forecasts were released Wednesday.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell today over much of the central
Plains, and rain was widely scattered over much of the High Plains
and the lower and middle Mississippi Valley.
   Americans who prayed or danced for rain in recent weeks got it
in spades in some places Wednesday.
   In North Platte, Neb., more than 2 inches of rain fell in about
90 minutes, flooding city streets, caving in the roof of a downtown
business and causing at least $25,000 damage to a hotel,
authorities said. A tornado touched down near the city, but no
injuries were reported.
   Springfield, Mo., received more than 3{ inches of rain
Wednesday, more than double the record set on the date in 1905, the
weather service said. Nearly 5 inches deluged Wilsey, Kan., 60
miles southwest of Topeka, and Hill City, S.D., got 2 inches.
   The 3.7 inches of rain that fell Wednesday in west-central
Minnesota was the first significant moisture since the Memorial Day
weekend, said John Cunningham, agricultural extension agent in Big
Stone County.
   ``Those people that got this rain will get some corn now,'' said
Cunningham, who called the precipitation a psychological boost for
farmers. ``It keeps things alive.''
   But the weather service issued an advisory Wednesday saying the
nation's driest areas remained basically unchanged. The most
critical area extends from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian
border east of the Continental Divide and west of the Applachians.
Drought conditions are severe to extreme in the inland Pacific
Northwest, California, the nothern Rockies, the northern Plains,
the Great Lakes, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the southern
Applachians and northern New England.
   Record heat has exacerbated the problem. In the first 25 days of
June, nearly 550 high-temperature records were set or tied, the
service said.
   For the next 30 days, below-normal rainfall was expected in
Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and most of California.
   However, above-normal rainfall was predicted for some
drought-plagued parts of Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska,
Kansas, New Mexico, Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas.
   As the weather service released its forecast, Republican Vice
President George Bush attended a livestock auction in Marion, Wis.,
and his Democratic presidential rival, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, visited an Iowa corn field.
   ``We do want to help,'' Bush told about 200 people at the
auction. ``I don't want to over-promise,'' he said, cautioning no
major changes should be expected in federal dairy policies.
   Dukakis, visiting a farm south of Des Moines, stressed ``the
importance of pulling together'' during the drought.
   ``We're one nation and one community and one family,'' he told
about 250 people under threatening skies and in chilly weather that
caused many to don sweaters.
   ``I don't know whether those storm clouds overhead mean Dukakis
brings good fortune,'' he said. ``I hope so.''
   In Alabama, Gov. Guy Hunt, a Primitive Baptist preacher who ran
a farm before his 1986 election, declared Wednesday a day of prayer
and asked all Alabamians to join him.
   ``Many of our people are suffering,'' Hunt said in a prayer at
the start of a meeting with legislators at the Governor's Mansion.
He asked God to ``bless our state, our lands with bountiful rain.''
   There was no measurable precipitation anywhere in the state as
of this morning, but John Hoffner of the weather service in
Birmingham said Wednesday the prayers were well-timed because a
storm was approaching northern Alabama.
   In other developments:
   _Grain and soybean futures prices tumbled on the Chicago Board
of Trade as the Midwestern rain spurred some of the steepest
declines in the exchange's history.
   ``It was just panic liquidation,'' said Jay Homan, an
independent trader.
   _The Agriculture Department reported the average soybean price
jumped this month to its highest level since May 1977 and the fifth
highest ever. Corn and wheat prices increased to their highest
levels since August 1985 and May 1984, respectively.
   _The Ohio River, which reopened only Friday after a barge
traffic jam, was closed again for more dredging near its confluence
with Mississippi.
   ``Conditions, based on what I see, are just deteriorating,''
said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Jim Clifton at Paducah, Ky., predicting
that the latest closure would last three to four days.
   _On the Mississippi, nine towboats ran aground, said Coast Guard
Cmdr. Michael Donohoe, who tightened shipping restrictions for the
third time in a week. Donohoe limited southbound towboats with
nine-foot drafts to 12 barges, down from 20.
   _Country clubs from the Corn Belt to the East Coast are
reporting that golf courses are cracked and parched from the
drought. Officials of the Professional Golfers Association and
Ladies Professional Golfers Association said tour courses are
holding up because they're better maintained to begin with, but
links that lack irrigation systems or depend upon restricted city
water are suffering.

   Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre today
defied the Vatican and consecrated four bishops of his
traditionalist movement, provoking the first major split in the
Roman Catholic Church since 1870.
   The Vatican responded shortly afterward by excommunicating
Lefebvre and the four new bishops. Rome had warned that
consecrations without the approval of Pope John Paul II would bring
automatic ejection from the church.
   ``We are convinced we are following the call of God,'' the
French-born Lefebvre told about 10,000 supporters in a half-hour
homily before the ceremony.
   The prelate accused the church of accepting ``modernism,
liberalism, communism, Zionism'' and said the changes are ``not
Catholic.''
   John Paul urged Lefebvre in a telegram Wednesday to refrain from
his plans ``for the love of Christ and his church.''
   Lefebvre said the pope sent him a car Wednesday night to take
him to Rome. He said he was surprised at this effort to make him
cancel the elevation.
   Today, the rebel prelate placed his hands over each of the new
bishops to complete the consecrations. They highlighted a festive
ceremony in a tent on a vast meadow in front of the traditionalist
seminary in this Swiss hamlet surrounded by vineyards and Alpine
peaks.
   In Rome, a statement read by Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro
said the consecrations were a schismatic act carried out against
the wishes of the pope.
   A schism is a formal rupture with the Holy See. Excommunication
means Lefebvre and the four bishops are excluded from the rights,
sacraments and privileges of the church.
   ``This is not a schism, we are not schismatic,'' Lefebvre said.
``There is no question at all of this. On the contrary, we are here
to manifest our attachment to the church of all times.''
   Rome has followed a course of ``grave errors'' since the reforms
of the Second Vatican Council in 1962-65 that was ``about to
destroy the church,'' Lefebvre said.
   He said he had to go ahead with the consecrations because ``we
have tried everything to make Rome return to the traditions, but it
was in vain.''
   ``This is an operation of survival of the tradition,'' and
signing an accord with the Vatican would have been ``operation
suicide,'' Lefebvre said.
   About 180 traditionalist priests and 150 seminarians were among
the faithful assembled under bright sunshine today.
   Econe is the birthplace of Lefebvre's St. Pius X Fraternity,
founded in 1970 for clerics opposed to the Second Vatican Council,
whose reforms included modernizing the liturgy.
   Lefebvre continues to celebrate Mass in Latin, dismissing the
``bastard rites'' in the vernacular that took its place.
   Named after a pope who condemned ``modernist'' trends in the
church in a 1907 encyclical, Lefebvre's movement claims to have
millions of sympathizers.
   Lefebvre, 82, says his age makes the consecrations urgent to
ensure continuity of the fraternity's struggle against
``self-destructive trends.''
   Church law allows only bishops to perform ordinations so,
Lefebvre says, the fraternity would be ``orphaned'' unless he
consecrates new bishops before dying.
   Lefebvre, in a recent magazine interview, dismissed
excommunication as ``worthless'' and said it will not slow him in
pushing for a ``true renewal of the church.''
   ``These events will strengthen our unity,'' he was quoted in the
conservative French weekly Figaro-Magazine. ``In 10 years, one will
see that I have defended the last bastion of faith.''
   The four newly consecrated bishops were Richard Williamson, 48,
English-born head of the Ridgefield, Conn., seminary; Bernard
Tissier de Mallerais, 43, secretary general of the fraternity;
Alfonso de Galarreta, 31, Spanish-born head of the seminary in
Argentina; and Bernard Fellay, 30, administrator of the Fraternity,
a Swiss.
   The Vatican did not immediately excommunicate Brazilian prelate
Antonio de Castro Mayer, bishop of Campos and Lefebvre's assistant
in the rites. The Vatican said his role was unclear.
   De Castro Mayer, 84, is not a fraternity member but has formally
associated himself with Lefebvre's crusade against the Vatican.
   Three weeks ago, the pope exhorted Lefebvre in a personal letter
``from a paternal heart'' to renounce the consecrations, which
would ``bring a new wound'' to the church.
   The pontiff warned the consecrations ``could only appear as a
schismatic act.''
   The last split in the church occurred when the Old Catholics
broke with the Vatican because they opposed the doctrine of papal
infallibility proclaimed at the First Vatican Council in 1870.
   Defying earlier Vatican sanctions, Lefebvre has ordained about
220 traditionalist priests, including 16 on Wednesday. That
ceremony drew at least 7,000 sympathizers to Econe.
   ``The cancer of liberalism is spreading in the Church'' since
the Second Vatican Council, Lefebvre said in his homily Wednesday.
   ``Join the fight against liberalism, that false notion of
freedom,'' he said.
   Traditionalist sources have hinted they still hope for an
eventual settlement with the Vatican. An accord was close last
month after a protocol was signed in Rome, but Lefebvre reneged.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Lawyer Ad Issue in California Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states may ban virtually all lawyer advertisements
featuring testimonials or client endorsements.
   The justices said they will review a California rule that
presumes such ads are false or misleading.
   Today's order comes just two weeks after the high court ruled in
a Kentucky case that states may not ban all direct-mail
advertisements sent by lawyers to potential clients.
   Mark H. Oring of Los Angeles was reprimanded by the California
Bar Association for a radio commercial in which a client who had
been involved in an auto accident praised Oring and his partner.
   The client said that, thanks to Oring's firm, an insurance
company paid her twice the amount of money she originally was
awarded when her lawsuit went to trial.
   State bar officials said the commercial ``inherently tended to
confuse and mislead the public'' because it failed to explain that
the client's case was highly unusual and that such doubling of
awards in accident cases generally does not occur.
   Bar officials said the burden was on Oring to prove the ad was
truthful.
   Oring said the state rule presuming testimonials are deceptive
violated his free-speech rights. He said the rule has the effect of
banning truthful ads.
   The California Supreme Court rejected Oring's challenge to the
rule last October.
   The nation's highest court in 1977 ended the legal profession's
longtime ban on all lawyer advertising but left it to the states to
ensure that ads are not deceptive.
   The court said lawyer advertising, like other commercial speech,
is not constitutionally protected if found to be false or
misleading.
   In a series of decisions since, the justices have forced states
to relax certain restrictions on lawyer advertising, such as
Kentucky's ban on direct-mail solicitation.
   Oring's partner, David A. Grey, also was reprimanded for the
firm's radio commerical, and lost a similar appeal to the high
court in 1987.
   The case acted on today is Oring vs. California, 87-1224.

   A bomb exploded in a busy
shopping center in downtown Pretoria today where the air force has
its headquarters, and at least 14 people were injured, police said.
   The blast occurred shortly after 1 p.m. on the ground floor of
the Poyntons Building. The main offices of the nation's air force
are on the upper floors of the building, along with headquarters of
the prison services.
   Thirteen whites, including two children, and one black were
among those injured, police said. Hospital officials said none of
the injuries was serious.
   No information was immediately available on the extent of damage
to the building, police said.
   The bomb was the latest in a recent series of attacks aimed at
civilian targets. There have been about 90 bombings since the
government declared a nationwide state of emergency in June 1986.
About 25 have occurred this year.
   The deadliest blast in South African history occurred on the
street outside the Poyntons Building in May 1983, when a car bomb
exploded, killing 19 people and injuring about 200.
   Police have blamed virtually all of the attacks on the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla group, the main organization
trying to overthrow South Africa's government and end white
domination.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, seldom confirms or denies
involvement in attacks.

<HEAD>Court to Decide If Lawyers Can Practice in Virgin Islands Without
Living There</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether lawyers who do not live in the Virgin Islands should be
allowed to practice there.
   The court said it will hear appeals by bar association officials
seeking to reinstate attorney residency requirements in the U.S.
territory.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last March that the
residency restrictions are unlawful.
   The appeals court struck down a rule that applicants for
licenses to practice law in the Virgin Islands must live there for
one year before applying for admission to the bar and must state
their intention to reside there.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that the residency rule is
needed to assure adequate legal representation for criminal
defendants in the Virgin Islands.
   ``Alternative rules could validly be adopted that would impose
reasonable requirements on non-members of the Virgin Islands bar to
assure that they would bear professional responsibilities
comparable to those now imposed on resident attorneys,'' the
appeals court said.
   The appeals court also said it had the authority to throw out
the residency requirement, which was adopted by the district court
of the Virgin Islands. The appeals court said the district court is
akin to a state court and is subject to Supreme Court rulings on
lawyer residency.
   The appeals court ruled in favor of Susan Esposito Thorstenn of
Brooklyn, N.Y., and Lloyd DeVos of Mountainside, N.J.
   The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of liberalized residency
requirements for lawyers in recent decisions.
   The court on June 22 struck down a Virginia rule that allowed
lawyers living in the state to practice there _ without passing the
Virginia licensing examination _ if they were licensed for at least
five years in another state that gives Virginia-licensed lawyers
the same privilege. Out-of-state residents had been denied the same
treatment by Virginia.
   The justices in 1985 said states generally may not require
lawyers to be residents to practice within their borders, striking
down a New Hampshire rule.
   The cases acted on today are Barnard vs. Thorstenn, 87-1939, and
Virgin Islands Bar Association vs. Thorstenn, 87-2008.

   Can a pig farm be a form of political protest?
   The Supreme Court today refused to answer that unusual legal
question in a case from the ski resort community of Stowe, Vt.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by developers who
set up a pig farm on their property after their plans for a large
motel were blocked.
   The developers, Normand Ramsey and his son, Raymond, sought in
1981 to add to their chain of motels by building a 79-unit motel on
a parcel of land in Stowe.
   The plans were challenged by neighbors, including the owner of a
gift and gourmet food shop and a couple that own a motel.
   The Ramseys were given a permit to build a 15-unit motel, but
the proposal for the larger motel was blocked as a violation of a
state environmental protection law.
   In apparent retaliation, the Ramseys abandoned the motel plans
and instead applied successfully for a permit to operate a pig farm.
   A few days after the permit was approved, according to court
records, the Ramseys had tons of wet chicken manure dumped along an
edge of their property and a large rusty storage tank was placed in
their meadow.
   In the ensuing months, untended manure attracted an infestation
of flies and caused a powerful stench. The owners of the nearby
motel installed air conditioners for their rooms because of the
odor.
   Scores of pigs, cows, sheep and roosters were brought in but
were not cared for adequately, the court records said. When the
animals died, decomposing carcasses were left lying around.
   The decaying pig farm also had become a tourist attraction of
sorts, causing traffic congestion.
   The Ramseys were sued in state court by their neighbors, and
were deemed to be causing a public nuisance. They were ordered to
pay nearly $568,000 in damages.
   The Vermont Supreme Court upheld the decision that the Ramseys
had caused a nuisance, and ordered further hearings that could mean
additional punitive damages.
   The state court said, ``The weightiest factor in the punitive
damages assessment was the degree of malice involved. Short of
physical violence, it is difficult to imagine a situation entailing
greater animosity and malevolence than that exhibited here.''
   The state court also noted that Normand Ramsey operates
businesses worth more than $3 million.
   In the appeal acted on today, the Ramseys said they were being
punished, in effect, for their political protest.
   They said the pig farm, while complying with land-use
regulations, was ``a constitutional visual protest against the
arbitrary action'' that denied them a permit to build a 79-unit
motel.
   Such a protest is protected by constitutional guarantees of free
expression, they said.
   The case is Ramsey Associates vs. Victor and Mary Coty, 87-1856.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Become Involved in California Dispute Over Oil
Pipelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to become
involved in a California dispute over the power of cities to charge
fees to companies that operate oil pipelines under city streets.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Santa
Monica, Calif., may charge Shell Oil Co. $237,000 a year to carry
crude oil through 3.9 miles of underground pipeline within the city.
   While a lower court ruling in the case largely favored the city,
Santa Monica officials as well as Shell asked the high court to
intervene because one important aspect of the lower court decision
exposed the city to suits for restricting interstate commerce
unlawfully.
   Santa Monica has permitted Shell Oil and its former owners to
use the portion of the pipeline within the city limits since 1941.
The 3.9-mile segment is part of a pipeline stretching 82 miles from
Ventura County to Shell's Wilmington refinery in Los Angeles County.
   Shell transports more than 32,000 barrels of crude oil each day
through the pipeline.
   Shell had been paying Santa Monica $1,029 a year to use the
pipeline within the city until the company's lease expired in 1981.
   Since then, the company and city officials have disagreed over
the fee.
   Shell at one point agreed to pay up to $12,500 a year. But the
city insisted on $237,000 with annual adjustments for inflation.
   The oil company has been permitted to use the pipeline for
around $10,000 a year pending the outcome of the court battle.
   Shell filed a federal lawsuit that said the $237,000 fee
violates the Constitution because it ``places an unreasonable
burden on interstate commerce.''
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October dismissed the
company's lawsuit. But the appeals court, stopping short of a
complete victory for Santa Monica, said cities are subject to the
Constitution's commerce clause restrictions in such cases.
   The appeals court rejected the city's argument that it should be
immune from attack under the commerce clause because the city is
acting as a ``market participant'' rather than ``market regulator.''
   The fact that Santa Monica has a contractual relationship with
Shell does not make the city a market participant insulated from
commerce clause scrutiny, the appeals court said.
   ``In deciding whether, or on what terms, to grant a franchise
for the use of public streets the city may not burden interstate
commerce in a manner that violates the commerce clause,'' the
appeals court said.
   But the appeals court said the franchise fee the city seeks to
charge Shell is reasonable because it ``is based on an evenhanded''
appraisal of the value of the property adjacent to the pipeline.
   The cases are Shell vs. Santa Monica, 87-1685, and Santa Monica
vs. Shell, 87-1841.

   Michael Dukakis today blamed the Reagan
administration for economic policies that have left average family
income ``right where it was 20 years ago.''
   Dukakis told employees at a Reynolds aluminum plant that the
average weekly wage for jobs lost between 1979 and 1985 was $440,
while the average weekly pay for new jobs during that period was
only $270. The numbers that Dukakis used did not take into account
the last three years of economic recovery.
   ``Today there are more Americans working than at any time in our
history, but average family income in America is right where it was
20 years ago, even though there's been a huge increase in the
number of families where both parents work,'' the certain
Democratic presidential nominee said in remarks prepared for
delivery at the plant, the largest manufacturing facility under one
roof in Illinois.
   ``Too many of our families are struggling to hold on, challenged
by change, anxious about their jobs, burdened by the rising costs
of health care and housing and college tuition, troubled by the
lack of quality affordable child care,'' Dukakis said.
   As Dukakis began a second day of campaigning in the troubled
Midwest, he kept his counsel on his search for a vice presidential
nominee.
   ``I can't say at this point if I'm close or not so close,'' the
Democratic presidential candidate said Wednesday after meeting with
members of Congress, including four senators often mentioned as
potential running mates.
   At a farm in Norwalk, Iowa, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, one of
Dukakis' defeated rivals in the fight for the Democratic
presidential nomination, offered this praise for the Massachusetts
governor:
   ``There's not a phony bone in Mike Dukakis' body. He's genuine.''
   On Wednesday, Dukakis told farmers gathered at the 160-acre farm
of Howard Hughes, ``It's good to be home.'' Dukakis recalled the
months he spent campaigning before the Iowa caucuses last winter
only to finish third behind Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and
Simon.
   Hughes and other Midwest growers face heavy losses from a
prolonged drought.
   But as Dukakis spoke the sky was obscured by thick dark clouds
and the ground was damp from rain the night before.
   The corn Dukakis inspected in one of Hughes' fields towered at
least a foot above the head of the 5-foot 8-inch governor.
   ``That corn looks awfully good over there,'' said Simon. ``You
can't judge that by it's being green, that doesn't mean it will
produce anything. Don't get any false impression even though that
looks better than a lot of corn in Illinois and South Dakota and
everywhere else.''
   But this healthier looking corn was only four miles from the end
of the runway at the Des Moines airport, making it a convenient
stop on the candidate's five-state Midwest swing.
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Midwest farmers have lost 10
percent to 15 percent of their corn crop and stand to lose much
more if the drought continues.
   ``In North Dakota and some parts of South Dakota, it's the worst
drought since 1934,'' said the senator, who, along with Simon and
Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, flew to the Midwest with Dukakis.
   One of the senators Dukakis met with on Wednesday was Sam Nunn
of Georgia, a favorite of many Southern Democrats who believe Nunn
would help Dukakis throughout their region.
   But the senator told Dukakis he wasn't interested in the second
spot on the Democratic ticket.
   During an hour-long meeting during which they discussed other
possible choices, Nunn said he told Dukakis ``I was still not
interested in the vice presidency.''
   The Georgian, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said his feelings about the vice presidency ``had
absolutely nothing to do with Gov. Dukakis.''
   Others with whom Dukakis met privately were Sens. John Glenn of
Ohio, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, and Bob Graham of Florida, all of
whom have been mentioned as among the most prominent potential
choices.
   ``Things have a way of sorting themselves out,'' said Dukakis.
``We're making progress.''
   During his Midwest campaign tour, Dukakis was expected to be
joined by Glenn in Ohio and Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana in his
home state. Hamilton also is considered a top contender to join
Dukakis on the Democratic ticket.

<TEXT>
   Here is the official English-language text
of the Vatican statement on Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. The
original was issued in Italian.
   ``With regard to rumors voiced in Monsignor Lefebvre circles
concerning the excommunication latae sentetiae (automatic)
mentioned in Canon Law N. 1382, the Vatican Press Office notes that:
   ``According to Canon 1013 (no bishop is allowed to consecrate
another bishop without the explicit papal authorization), the
consecration of bishops on June 30 by Mons. Lefebvre, in spite of
the admonition on June 17, have been carried out explicitly against
the pope's will; this is a formally schismatic act according to
Canon 751, in as much as he openly refused submission to the Holy
Father and communion with the members of the church under his
jurisdiction.
   ``Consequently, both Mons. Lefebvre and the bishops consecrated
by him, Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard
Williamson, Alfonso de Galarreta, have ipso facto incurred
excommunication latae sententiae reserved to the Apostolic See. In
this case Canon 1323 is inapplicable, because the circumstances
mentioned in the canon have not obtained: the so-called `case of
necessity' has been intentionally fabricated by Mons. Lefebvre in
order to maintain an attitude of division within the Catholic
church, notwithstanding the ecclesial communion and the concessions
offered by the Holy Father John Paul II.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Kill Libel Lawsuit Against Tennessee Congressman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to kill a
libel lawsuit against a Tennessee congressman who criticized a
legal services lawyer.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, let stand a ruling that Rep. Don
Sundquist, R-Tenn., may be sued for statements he made in a news
release and in a letter to the U.S. attorney general.
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Harry A. Blackmun and Byron R.
White voted to hear arguments in the case _ one vote short of the
four needed to grant such review.
   Sundquist in January 1985 urged then-Atty. Gen. William French
Smith to investigate the Memphis Area Legal Services program and
one of its lawyers, Wayne Chastain.
   Sundquist said Chastain was trying to undermine efforts by
juvenile courts in the Memphis area to collect child-support
payments.
   Chastain and other lawyers in the legal services program since
1978 had been involved in a dispute in which they said juvenile
court procedures to collect the payments were violating the rights
of indigent parents.
   In his letter to Smith, Sundquist said the legal services
program ``seems to be employing at least one attorney, Wayne
Chastain, to do nothing but harass'' juvenile court officials.
   Sundquist said Smith should investigate ``alleged
irregularities'' and the ``possibility of the obstruction'' of the
law.
   Chastain sued the congressman, charging that the letter and a
related news release defamed him.
   A federal judge here threw out the suit, but it was reinstated
last November by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court, in a 2-1 decision, said Sundquist's
statements were not covered by the Constitution's speech or debate
clause that shields members of Congress from lawsuits arising from
their official duties.
   ``The speech or debate clause protects all lawmaking activities
undertaken in the House and Senate, but affords no constitutional
immunity beyond its carefully defined scope,'' the appeals court
said.
   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1979 Supreme Court ruling
that permitted Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., to be sued over one
of his so-called ``Golden Fleece'' awards.
   Proxmire had given one of the tongue-in-cheek awards to a
scientist who conducted government-funded research the senator said
was a waste of taxpayer money.
   The appeals court here said the Proxmire case made it plain that
members of Congress do not enjoy absolute immunity from defamation
suits.
   ``The speech or debate clause provides members of Congress with
an immunity that is co-extensive with their constitutional
responsibilities,'' the appeals court said.
   ``When they move beyond the requirements of their legislative
responsibilites, they do so as volunteers, and at their own risk,
however important their myriad other activities may be in the
texture of contemporary political life,'' the appeals court said.
   The ruling was written by Judge James L. Buckley, a former
Republican senator from New York. Judge Abner Mikva, a former
Democratic member of the House from Illinois, dissented.
   Sundquist's appeal to the Supreme Court was supported by
numerous news media organizations, including the National
Association of Broadcasters, the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, the National Newspaper Association, the Reporters
Committee for Freedom of the Press, the Society of Professional
Journalists, Time Inc. and The Washington Post.
   They told the justices, ``If members of Congress are forced to
assess their risk of liability before they speak openly on issues
of public concern, the quality of public debate, in which the press
is an important participant, will be impoverished.''
   The case is Sundquist vs. Chastain, 87-1756.

   City and community leaders are trying to reduce
tensions between Arab shopkeepers and their black neighbors in the
wake of the shooting death of a black man and a series of store
firebombings.
   Tempers have erupted since June 18 when a black man was shot and
killed by an Arab store clerk after the two quarreled and the black
man later returned to the store with a shotgun and fired at a store
display. The clerk was charged with involuntary manslaughter. The
following night, a crowd ransacked the store.
   There also has been a rash of firebombing attacks in the black
neighborhoods where Arabs have businesses, including one store set
afire three times in as many weeks.
   City Council member Helen Knipe Smith, whose district includes
the neighborhood, said most of the groceries and delicatessens in
the area are operated by Arabs.
   Patricia Blackmon, the city's chief prosecutor, has met with
community groups in recent days to calm tensions. She said concerns
among blacks focus on food quality, prices and a demand for more
courtesy from shopkeepers.
   The Middle Eastern shopkeepers, including Egyptians, Lebanese
and Palestinians, have complained about thefts and police response
time, Ms. Blackmon said.
   Mayor George Voinovich said Wednesday the city has increased
health code violation inspections at the groceries, which some
black community leaders have complained are selling outdated items.
   ``Neither the proprietors of stores or any member of our
community should take the law into their own hands,'' Voinovich
said.
   Police have increased patrols in the neighborhoods, said police
spokesman Detective Robert Bolton.
   The tensions could be ``a perception problem or lack of
information,'' Bolton said. ``We're trying to work with both
groups.''
   In addition to extra police patrols near Arab-operated
businesses, police community relations specialists are working with
community leaders on the problem, Bolton said.
   ``We don't want it to escalate to anything. If there are
problems that have to be fixed, that's fine,'' he said.
   Mrs. Smith blamed tensions on a need by ghetto businesses to
charge higher prices than large chain stores operating in the
suburbs and a concern by Arabs about crime.
   ``These are the kinds of issues that are out there that have
been there for 30, 40, 50 years as long as we've had black and
minority neighborhoods,'' Mrs. Smith said.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Way Cable TV Operators Pay Copyright Royalties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand the way
cable television operators pay copyright royalties for
retransmitting broadcast programming.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the the U.S. Copyright Office is overcharging the cable industry by
at least $40 million a year.
   The payment system had been challenged by Cablevision Co., a
cable television operator in New York and New Jersey, and the
National Cable Television Association.
   Under the Copyright Act of 1976, cable television systems are
entitled, under a ``compulsory license,'' to retransmit copyright
broadcast programming to cable subscribers. In return, the cable
systems must pay royalties into a Copyright Royalty Tribunal for
distribution to copyright owners who file claims.
   Failure to pay a government-established fee by a cable operator
retransmitting programs from over-the-air television stations is
deemed a copyright infringement.
   Each cable system must pay a fee equal to a ``specified
percentage of the gross receipts ... for the basic service of
providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast
transmitters.''
   At issue in the dispute acted on today is the definition of
``gross receipts'' under the 1976 law.
   Cablevision sued in 1983, contending that the royalties fee
should be based only on revenue from retransmission of local
broadcast signals _ and not on revenue from cable-originated
stations such as ESPN and CNN and so-called superstations such as
WTBS in Atlanta and WGN from Chicago that may be included in a
cable system's ``basic service.''
   Cablevision had been threatened by the Motion Picture
Association of America, a group of copyright owners, with possible
infringement lawsuits for underpaying royalty fees.
   The MPAA filed counterclaims, contending that Cablevision had
infringed on the copyrights held by the association's members.
   U.S. District Judge June L. Green here rejected the
interpretation of ``gross receipts'' that was favored by the MPAA
and had been adopted by the Copyright Office.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here reversed the judge's
ruling last Jan. 5. The appeals court ruled that the Copyright
Office's interpretation was entitled to judicial deference, and
ordered Judge Green to restudy the MPAA's claims for higher royalty
fees from Cablevision.
   In its Supreme Court appeal, lawyers for Cablevision argued that
the Copyright Office lacks the authority to issue a binding
regulation on how royalty fees should be calculated.
   The National Cable Television Association's appeal made the same
argument.
   The appeals said annual copyright royalties paid by the cable
industry exceed $100 million, and that the Copyright Office's
regulation on calculating royalty-fee liability ``cost the cable
industry an additional $40 million in this past year alone.''
   The Federal Communications Commission recently approved a policy
that could alter significantly copyright considerations for cable
operators.
   The policy would let local, over-the-air television stations buy
exclusive rights to syndicated programs. Cable systems that
transmit the same programs in a local station's viewing area would
have to black out the shows or substitute other programs.
   The cases are Cablevision Co. vs. Motion Picture Association of
America, 87-1642, and National Cable Television Association vs.
Columbia Pictures Industries, 87-1814.

   A man accused of murdering two of six
kidnapped women he imprisoned in a basement ``house of horrors''
was attacked by two other inmates while a jury deliberated the
charges against him, officials said.
   Gary Heidnik, 44, suffered only bruises in Wednesday's attack,
which occurred in a holding cell one floor above where the jury was
meeting.
   ``The guards told me he took the fetal position when they
knocked him down and he didn't fight back,'' said Heidnick's
attorney, A. Charles Peruto, who argued in court that his client
was insane. ``He's upset. But he's going to have to get used to it
if he gets sent to a prison.''
   The jury Wednesday spent 3{ hours deliberating before Common
Pleas Judge Lynne Abraham sent them back to their hotel ``to get
some rest and come back refreshed'' this morning. The panel resumed
work shortly before 9 a.m.
   Heidnik was arrested in 1987 after a captive escaped and alerted
police. He is accused of luring women to his basement, where he
chained them and raped them repeatedly in hopes of breeding a
``superior race.''
   He used a chain saw to cut up one corpse and then fed the
remains mixed with dog food to the other women, according to police
and trial testimony. The body of the second woman was found in the
woods in New Jersey.
   Heidnik and his assailants were together at lunchtime when he
was punched several times, said Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Janet
Pina. No charges against the men _ a murder suspect and a robbery
suspect _ were filed.
   On Wednesday, the judge took nearly three hours to outline the
19 charges against Heidnik to the jury, and explained all the
possible verdicts, among them innocent by reason of insanity and
guilty but mentally ill. The charges included murder, kidnapping,
rape, aggravated assault and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse.
   The panel was chosen in Pittsburgh because the judge said
pretrial publicity here hampered the selection of impartial jurors.
   The prosecution said it would seek the death penalty if it gets
a first-degree murder conviction.
   After Wednesday's attack, the judge advised sheriff's deputies
to keep Heidnik in a room designated for psychiatric prisoners and
to try to keep him segregated.
   It was the second time Heidnik has been attacked since his
arrest in March 1987, when one of his captive women escaped and
brought police to the so-called ``House of Horrors.''
   Heidnik later tried to commit suicide and since then he has been
kept in isolation and on a suicide watch.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican today announced the
excommunication of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and four bishops he
consecrated.
   A statement read by Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro cited
church law for the excommunications, noting the prohibition on
consecrating bishops without papal approval.
   In such cases, the excommunication is automatic, requiring no
formal act by the Vatican. Only the pope can lift the sanction,
Navarro said.
   The statement, made shortly after Lefebvre carried out the
consecrations in Econe, Switzerland, said it was a schismatic act
carried out expressly against the wishes of the pope.
   A schism is a formal rupture with the Holy See.
   Excommunication puts a Roman Catholic outside the church and
unable to receive its sacraments, such as communion and extreme
unction, or last rites.
   Earlier this week, Lefebvre's traditionalist movement challenged
the excommunications, claiming that church law permits such
ordinations in an ``emergency.''
   The Vatican said the only ``necessity'' in the case was raised
by Lefebvre ``to conserve an attitude of division in the Catholic
Church, despite the offers of communion and concessions made by the
Holy Father John Paul II.''
   Navarro said a statement would be issued in coming days on the
position of Lefebvre's lay followers.
   The communique identified those excommunicated as Lefebvre and
the four bishops: Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais,
Richard Williamson and Alfonso de Galarreta.
   Brazilian prelate Antonio de Castro Mayer, bishop of Campos,
assisted at the rites in Econe. Navarro said the Vatican was
awaiting clarification on his role in the ceremony before making a
decision on excommunication.
   John Paul carried out official duties as usual today, including
receiving five Soviet journalists, but Lefebvre's action provoked
considerable bitterness at the Vatican. A symphonic concert
scheduled for Thursday evening was canceled to express ``deep
pain'' over the schism.
   The Italian Bishops' Conference immediately called for prayers
for the pope.
   Archbishop Albert Decourtray of Lyon and president of the French
council of bishops, said: ``It is a day of mourning for the
Catholic church, for all those who are attached to Christian
unity.''
   Navarro has estimated that Lefebvre's traditionalist movement
has 80,000 to 100,000 followers, although other Vatican officials
have said as many as half a million lay people turn to his priests
for various church functions.
   Navarro said the Vatican plans to announce Friday the legal
position of the priests and lay supporters of Lefebvre.
   The Vatican spokesman estimated that relatively few Catholics
incur excommunication and that many of the cases today involve
Catholic doctors who perform abortions. However, he noted that
these are matters of individual conscience and no records are kept.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal of Minnesota Woman in Airbag Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected the appeal of
a Minnesota woman severely injured in a 1983 car crash, turning
away arguments that her car's manufacturer negligently failed to
install airbags.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings dismissing that
portion of Dr. Jan Marie Wickstrom's product-liability lawsuit
against Toyota Motor Corp. and its U.S. subsidiaries.
   Minnesota courts ruled that the National Highway Traffic Safety
Act, and federal regulations by implication bar such a claim
because car manufacturers are allowed to install seatbelts and
shoulder harnesses instead of airbags.
   Trial courts in other states also have ruled that car
manufacturers cannot be held legally liable for not installing
airbags.
   But according to Wickstrom's lawyers, some state trial courts _
including those in California, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania _
have allowed ``no-airbag claims'' to reach juries in similar cases.
   ``This is an important question which has not been, but should
be, settled by this court to assure justice and fairness to all
tort victims regardless of the jurisdiction of the injury,''
Wickstrom's appeal contended.
   After robbing a Minneapolis bank on March 31, 1983, Louis
Chapman fled from police by speeding the wrong way down Interstate
94. His full-size 1973 Pontiac crion's
leading airlines challenging California's anti-eavesdropping rule.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last November upheld a
regulation adopted in 1982 by the California Public Utilities
Commission prohibiting the secret listening to or recording of
telephone conversations by others.
   A person wishing to listen in on a conversation must notify both
parties to the conversation that it is being overheard.
   The penalty for violating the order is termination of phone
service.
   The Air Transportation Association of America and leading
airlines sued in federal court to block enforcement of the
regulation.
   They said it interfered illegally with their monitoring of calls
to ticket agents to assure agents are being courteous, accurate and
efficient. The airlines listen in on from 1 percent to 2 percent of
phone calls.
   The airlines said the California ban affects interstate phone
calls because they have telephone reservations facilities in
California that take calls both from within and outside the state.
   The 9th Circuit court, overturning a federal judge's ruling,
said the airlines ``have not established any basis for the federal
courts to interefere in the operation of the state regulation.''
   The airlines said California's rule violates provisions of the
Federal Communications Act banning unjust discrimination against
any class of customers.
   The airlines also said the state rule is pre-empted by the 1978
Airline Deregulation Act, which bars states from regulation rates,
routes or service for the airline industry.
   The airlines compared the California rule to a state roadblock
that interferes with traffic on an interstate highway.
   The case is Air Transportation Association vs. California Public
Utilities Commission, 87-1859.

   An 18-year-old Palestinian who was shot during
a clash with Israeli soldiers died today, and the army closed six
more Palestinian schools, Arab reports said.
   Arafat Awad Hanani died of injuries suffered in a clash June 16
in Beit Furik, near the West Bank city of Nablus. One other Arab
was killed and 18 were wounded in the fighting which erupted after
the army blew up an Arab-owned home.
   His death brought to 213 the number of Palestinians killed in
the nearly 7-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Four Israelis have died.
   Also today, troops opened fire at Arab youths throwing rocks in
Nablus' old city, wounding a 17-year-old in the leg, said officials
at the city's Al Ittihad Hospital. Army officials said they were
checking the report.
   The military administration closed six West Bank and east
Jerusalem schools, the daily Arabic newspaper Ashaab reported.
   Fifty-three schools have been ordered closed again after the
army reopened West Bank schools on June 6, according to the
Palestinian-run Jerusalem Media and Communications Center.
   The army shut down more than 1,000 schools in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip on Feb. 2, but schools in Gaza have been operating
on-and-off since. Israeli officials have hoped that the reopening
of schools in the West Bank would help restore normal life in the
area.
   Also today, 19 Arabs charged in connection with an April 6 clash
in the West Bank village of Beita went on trial. A 15-year-old
Israeli girl was killed during violence between Arab villagers and
Jewish teen-agers.
   The army determined that Tirza Porat was killed by a bullet
accidentally fired by an Israeli guarding the teen-agers.
   The Arabs were charged with attacking and injuring the Israeli
guard, causing bodily harm, throwing stones and seizing and
concealing weapons.
   On Wednesday, Israeli troops shot and killed a 15-year-old
Palestinian in a clash that Arab witnesses said erupted after a
Jewish settler torched olive trees near the boy's village in the
occupied West Bank.
   Ibrahim Ghassan Aranka was fatally shot in the pelvis and
abdomen during protests in the village of Taiyiba near Ramallah,
said offiials at Jerusalem's Mukassad Hospital.
   The army said an officer opened fire in Taiyiba after Arabs
pelted troops with stones and bottles, and two soldiers were
slightly injured. An army official said the circumstances of
Aranka's death were under investigation.
   The incident began when residents spotted a Jewish settler
setting fire to olive trees near the village, said Salem Suleiman
Khoriyeh, the son of Taiyiba's village elder.
   Hundreds of villagers rushed to the grove and battled the blaze,
which destroyed about 15 acres of olive trees, said Khoriyeh, 42.
   Soldiers in five jeeps watched the two-hour battle but did
nothing to help douse the flames, Khoriyeh said.
   Angered by the indifference of the troops, villagers began
stoning the soldiers, who responded by opening fire, Khoriyeh said.
   Army officials said they had no reports of arson by Jewish
settlers in the area.
   Palestinian nationalists are believed to be responsible for more
than 100 cases of arson in Israel since January. Arabs have blamed
Jewish settlers for arson in the occupied territories.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, troops shot and wounded two
Arabs near the open-air market, area hospital officials said.
   The officials said the clash erupted when youths threw empty
bottles and rocks at troops accompanying Israeli tax officials on a
tax check of Arab shops.
   The army confirmed one Palestinian was wounded and said it was
checking the report of the second shooting.

   The wife of Grammy-winning singer
Lionel Richie was arrested after a noisy brawl with her husband and
a young woman that triggered neighbors' complaints, police said.
   Brenda Richie, 35, was arrested Wednesday for investigation of
corporal injury to a spouse, resisting arrest, trespassing,
vandalism, battery and disturbing the peace, said Lt. Robert
Curtis. She was released on $5,000 bail.
   Richie's publicist, Howard Brandy, said he had no information
about the incident.
   Callers to the 911 emergency telephone line reported a woman
screaming in an apartment at 2:34 a.m., Curtis said. Officers who
arrived at the residence shortly afterward observed Mrs. Richie
``striking and kicking the victim, Diane Alexander, while on the
floor of the apartment there,'' Curtis said.
   Richie was not at the apartment when police arrived but later
called authorities and reported he had been kicked in the abdomen
by Mrs. Richie, Curtis said.
   At one time, all three had apparently been at the apartment of
Ms. Alexander, 22, the lieutenant said. He did not release any
information about how the brawl began.
   Ms. Alexander complained of pains in the head, neck and left
side but said she would seek medical attention on her own, Curtis
said.
   Richie, once a member of The Commodores, has had hits as ``Say
You, Say Me,'' ``All Night Long,'' and ``Endless Love.'' He
co-wrote the famine relief song ``We Are The World'' with Michael
Jackson.

   Vice President George Bush said today that after
eight years of Republian rule in the White House ``some good people
yearn for a change'' and that's why the GOP ticket faces an uphill
struggle.
   ``It's our job to let them know that this time, in this case,
change and improvement come from the Republican Party,'' Bush said
in remarks prepared for a GOP fundraising luncheon.
   The vice president, the certain Republican presidential nominee,
also accused liberals of ``champing at the bit to raise taxes
again'' and said, ``the trouble with the Democrats in Congress is
that they haven't learned to `just say no.'''
   Bush praised the current economic recovery, the longest
peacetime expansion in history, and took a swipe at economists for
being pessimistic.
   He said that as recently as 1986, 60 percent of the members of
the National Association of Business Economics predicted a
recession in 1988.
   ``Wrong, wrong, wrong,'' Bush said. ``No wonder it's called the
`dismal science.''
   Referring to polls showing him in a tough race against Democrat
Michael Dukakis, Bush said, ``It's an uphill fight for our
Republican team this year. After eight years of one party in the
White House, no matter how successful, some good people yearn for a
change _ hoping that change will mean improvement.''
   Bush compared himself with former President Harry Truman, noting
that Democrat Truman too had been the underdog when he ran in 1948.
   ``The crowds would yell, `give 'em hell.' And he'd shout back,
`I don't have to give 'em hell. I just tell the truth and they
think it's hell,''' Bush said.
   ``In the final analysis, liberals promise compassion but they
deliver misery,'' Bush said. ``We promise hope, growth and
opportunity and we deliver hope, growth and opportunity.''
   On Wednesday, Bush criticized Dukakis for ill-founded ideas
about the Soviet Union and arms control, and he said ``it would be
ridiculous'' to proceed with the nuclear weapons cuts Dukakis wants.
   At the same time, Bush spoke cautiously about the sweeping
reforms advocated by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, including
a redistribution of power in the Soviet Union.
   Bush said the changes would be ``revolutionary'' and
``historic'' if they were implemented.
   However, he said, ``We've got to remember, the cold war is not
over.'' In contrast to the upbeat tone adopted by President Reagan
after the Moscow summit, Bush said the West should be prepared for
a protracted conflict with the Soviet bloc.
   Bush, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee,
stressed foreign policy in a speech Wednesday in San Francisco and
in an interview on Air Force Two as he flew back to Washington.
   He stopped in the farming community of Marion, Wis.,to talk
about the drought.
   While announcing no new initiatives, Bush said, ``I want to say
that, leave aside the politics of the moment and my ambitions for
the fall _ what we want to do as a part of the administration is do
as much as possible under the circumstances.''
   The vice president's message Wednesday was that Dukakis, who is
virtually assured the Democratic presidential nomination, is weak
on national security and foreign affairs and particularly fuzzy
about why the Soviet Union has been willing to negotiate nuclear
arms agreements.
   Dukakis has voiced opposition to the MX missile and Midgetman
missiles, and also has said he would replace the administration's
Strategic Defense Initiative with a buildup in conventional forces.
   ``He wants to do away with a lot of these systems and I think _
to negotiate an arms control agreement with the Soviet Union _ it
would be ridiculous to do that,'' Bush said.
   The vice president said it was the United States' refusal to
make unilateral concessions on arms that persuaded the Soviets to
sign an agreement to abolish U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range
nuclear missiles.
   Bush said Dukakis' emphasis on conventional, or non-nuclear,
forces ``leads you inextricably to the question: `Is he proposing
the winnability of a conventional war?' And leads you to ask the
question: What about the United States? What's going to happen in
defense of the United States?''
   The vice president said, ``In fairness, I don't know really what
his approach is yet. But if (the conventional force buildup) is his
approach towards dealing with the Soviet Union, I have a distinct
difference with him.''

<HEAD>Court to Hear Appeal of Texas Man Said to Have Capacity of
7-Year-Old</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear the
appeal of a Texas man sentenced to death who, the justices were
told, has the reasoning capacity of a 7-year-old.
   The justices said they will study arguments that executing
Johnny Paul Penry for the Oct. 25, 1979, killing of Pamela
Carpenter would be ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the
Constitution's Eighth Amendment.
   Penry's appeal also contended that his confession to police
should not have been used as evidence against him because, given
his mental capacity, it was not made voluntarily.
   Prosecutors said Penry beat Ms. Carpenter and then stabbed her
repeatedly with a scissors at her home in Livingston, Texas.
   Ms. Carpenter survived long enough to give police a description
of her attacker.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously rejected
Penry's arguments and upheld his murder conviction and death
sentence.
   The case is Penry vs. McCotter, 87-6177.

   Acid rain is destroying vegetation in the tourist
city of Hangzhou and in the former capital of Nanking, official
reports say.
   Acid rain has destroyed foliage and damaged ancient statues and
stone tablets in the city of Hangzhou, the official China News
Service said in a report seen in Beijing today. Hangzhou is in
coastal Zhejiang province.
   In Nanking, capital of the Nationalist government until the
Communist takeover in 1949, acid rain is also causing serious
problems, the report said. Nanking is in Jiangsu province.
   In May 1986, leaves of 400 snow pines planted in Hangzhou's
parks and hotel grounds turned yellow and withered as a result of
acid rain.
   Around Hangzhou's famous West Lake, stone statues and stone
tablets bearing inscriptions by historical figures are being eroded
by the rains, as are stone Buddha images at the Monastery of the
Spirit's Retreat, the city's best-known monastery.
   Experts say the problem is caused by pollution from industries,
which burn low-quality coal that has a high sulphur content, and by
the city's thousands of boilers and tens of thousands of family
coal stoves that release sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, the
report said.
   Earlier news reports said acid rain is a major problem in
Sichuan province in southwestern China and neighboring Guizhou
province, in the southern provinces of Hunan and Guangxi, and in
Shanghai.
   The problem is most serious in the south, where the soil is
basically acidic. In the north, the alkaline soil neutralizes the
acid in the rain, experts said.
   China started its research into acid rain in 1981 and last
September passed the country's first air pollution prevention law.

<HEAD>Police Say Owners Burned Their House Rather Than Clean It Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KERNERSVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A brother and sister burned their
filthy, $70,000 house, which allegedly had a stronger odor than
fresh asphalt, rather than clean up garbage that had accumulated
for years, police say.
   Although the house, owned by Terry W. Key, 41, and his sister,
Barbara J. Key, 54, was paid for and was not insured, police said
the two can be charged with willfully burning their own house, a
felony that carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.
   ``I think his temper got to him,'' said Officer C.C Perdue III,
who questioned Key on Wednesday. ``He just figured, `Hey, we can't
clean it up, there's no way to clean it up, let's burn it up.'
That's the way he was thinking. That's strange.''
   Perdue said Key told investigators he doused the brick house
with gasoline Monday and set it afire. Key was treated for burns on
his face, ear and arms.
   ``He said that he just wanted to get out of the neighborhood,''
Perdue said. ``He didn't think about selling the house, he didn't
think about anything but just eliminating the problem.''
   Although neighbors said they had been enduring the stench of the
house for years, the events that led to Monday's fire began last
Friday when police investigated a complaint from a crew paving
streets in the rural neighborhood.
   The road crew told police they could smell the house through the
odor of freshly laid asphalt.
   Perdue told the Greensboro News & Record that he and another
officer went to the house and found sewage soaking the back yard
from a broken septic tank and mounds of garbage festering in ripped
plastic bags under the carport.
   ``When they opened the door, you felt like you just wanted to go
behind a tree or something, it smelled so bad,'' Perdue said.
``Both had to kick the trash out of the doorway to get out. They
couldn't even open the door all the way.''
   The officers told the Keys their house posed a health risk and
that it must be cleaned up by Monday or the Forsyth County Health
Department would be called to investigate.
   Perdue said the Keys made excuses for the house's condition,
that his night job and her recent knee surgery had kept them from
getting the garbage to the curb. They had lived in the house for
more than 20 years.
   ``But this problem was building up for several years,'' Perdue
said. ``This didn't just happen.''
   Gary Almond, who lives across the street, said the Keys' house
has been an odorous eyesore ever since he moved to the neighborhood
in 1980. He said neighbors had called the Health Department many
times seeking relief, but got nowhere.
   ``I don't understand how anyone could live in something like
that,'' he said. ``They used to feed the cats inside and then throw
the cans out the door. The cans would be piled up on each side of
the steps.''
   ``We're going to try to charge them,'' said agent Curtis Douglas
of the State Bureau of Investigation. ``It may have been their own
property and they may not have had any insurance on it, but the
danger they created with that explosion and fire in a neighborhood
with kids and everything, we can't let that go.''
   The Keys could not be reached for comment; Perdue said they had
gone to live with a relative.

<HEAD>Brother Says Abducted Nun Has Mailed Her Habit Back to Convent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was abducted from a convent by her
family doesn't want to go back, one of her brothers says. However,
the spiritual leader of the convent said he doesn't believe it.
   Mary Susan Greve, 22, took off her habit Tuesday and mailed it
back to the convent, Dave Greve said from the family's home here
Wednesday.
   ``One of their rules is that by taking off the habit, it means
you don't want to be a part of it. She gave up wanting to belong to
that order. She didn't give up wanting to be a nun,'' Greve said.
   But the spiritual adviser, the Rev. Clarence Kelly, said the
order had not received any package or message from the woman, known
as Sister Mary Cecilia.
   ``I can't believe the kidnappers, quite frankly,'' Kelly said in
an interview in New York Wednesday. ``The only thing that disturbs
me is for the family to impose what they believe on (Mary Susan)
and do it illegally.''
   Police in New York and Ohio have been looking for the woman
since her father, James, and brothers Dave, Mark and John pushed
her into a waiting car Sunday as she walked with two nuns on a
street near St. Joseph Novitiate Convent in Roundtop, N.Y., in the
Catskill Mountains.
   New York state police have said they would not press charges
unless the woman wants to file them. It was the second time Miss
Greve had been abducted by her family.
   Dave Greve said his sister and parents were at a Catskills
motel, which he would not identify, when he left them Tuesday. He
said he did not know when they plan to return to Cincinnati.
   Sister Mary Cabrini, the order's secretary-general and senior
sister, arrived in Cincinnati on Wednesday to try to contact the
woman's family. She said she spoke with the FBI.
   ``We are sincerely concerned about our sister,'' she said. ``We
want to establish she is safe and free. We have to know it from
her. And thirdly, we want to establish that this will not happen to
anyone ever again, or nobody will be safe.''
   The St. Joseph Novitiate Convent calls itself a traditionalist
Roman Catholic convent, said the Rev. Michael A. Farano, chancellor
of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Albany, N.Y. However, he said
it is not recognized by the Catholic Church. Its services are in
Latin and it has rejected all of the teachings of the Second
Vatican Council of the 1960s.
   John Greve said the family opposed his sister's decision to
become a novice at the convent after the family broke with a
traditionalist Catholic church in the Cincinnati suburb of
Sharonville.
   Dave Greve said the family abducted his sister because of the
family's suspicions of Kelly. Kelly heads an ultra-traditionalist
Catholic sect called the Society of St. Pius V, which broke from
the traditionalist Catholic Society of St. Pius X in 1983.
   Miss Greve first joined St. Joseph's in September 1986. In
April, her mother drove to the convent and tricked her into getting
into the car, then brought her back to Cincinnati. The convent's
mother superior persuaded Miss Greve to return to the convent.
   Dave Greve said his sister still wants to become a nun and that
the family is searching for a convent for her to join.

<HEAD>Seattle Archdiocese To Announce Sponsorship Of Gay Mass, Report
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Archdiocese of Seattle plans to take over
sponsorship of a Mass for gay Catholics from Dignity, a group that
opposes traditional church teaching on homosexuality, it was
reported today.
   Announcement of the change, to take place about Aug. 1, was
expected today, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported. It was
negotiated during the past year, the newspaper said.
   Dignity has been forced out of churches in several cities,
including New York and San Diego, since a 1986 Vatican letter
labeled all homosexual activity a sin and said even a tendency
toward homosexuality is an ``objective disorder.'' The directive
warned bishops not to support any group that condones homosexual
activity.
   The change was expected to be announced today in the form of an
edict from Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen and Coadjutor Archbishop
Thomas Murphy.
   The Seattle change would follow the lead of Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin, who earlier this month took similar steps in Chicago.
His solution to the Dignity dilemma was initially hailed by gay
activists as an acceptable alternative to an outright ban of the
group from church property, but the issue has since split Chicago's
homosexual Catholic community.
   Mass for homosexuals was never formally sanctioned by the
Seattle archdiocese, but the group's presence at St. Joseph Church
was approved by the parish council and supported by a large number
of the clergy, religious and laity.
   That tolerance figured prominently in the Vatican's decision to
discipline Hunthausen, who in 1983 delivered, on videotape, the
welcoming address at Dignity's national convention in Seattle and
permitted the group to celebrate Mass at St. James Cathedral.
   Although archdiocese officials declined to provide details of
its ministry to homosexuals, the newspaper quoted sources as saying
that the Rev. Gerald Stanley, pastor of St. Edward parish, would be
coordinator.
   Characterizing negotiations between the church and Dignity as
``painful and frustrating,'' one priest who didn't want his name
published said many Dignity members are struggling to determine if
they can accept the archbishops' decision and still maintain their
integrity.
   Dignity, a national support group with more than 100 chapters,
has sponsored Mass, sacraments, educational and social programs,
and has worked for equal rights for homosexual Catholics for more
than 20 years. According to the organization's statement of
purpose, homosexuals can express their sexuality in a morally
responsible way.
   Soon after Hunthausen addressed Dignity's 1983 convention, he
became the target of a papal investigation and eventually was
stripped of much of his authority.
   Hunthausen's authority has been restored, but ending Dignity
sponsorship of the Mass at St. Joseph apparently was a condition
set by the commission of U.S. bishops appointed to supervise the
Seattle church.
   The commission has until October to make its final report on
Hunthausen, who was criticized for encouraging a ``climate of
permissiveness.''

UPDATE with Indiana governor banning unsupervised fireworks today.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   There won't be any rockets' red glare or bombs bursting in air
this Fourth of July in many drought-devastated communities across
the Midwest, Plains and South, where tinder-dry conditions have
sparked fears of a conflagration.
   Scores of towns and counties in Iowa, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri,
Kansas, Indiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Tennessee
have canceled or limited Independence Day displays of rockets,
sparklers and other fireworks.
   ``Right now is not the time to be shooting fireworks,'' said
Dwight Barnett, a spokesman for the state forestry division in
Tennessee, where authorities are encouraging localities to ``save
it for the rain.''
   ``We're creatures of habit, and we're used to shooting fireworks
on the Fourth of July, but this Fourth of July is different.
There's a high degree of risk out there,'' Barnett said.
   Restrictions vary and are widespread in some states, with some
officials wavering because of recent rain. In North Dakota, one of
the most drought-ravaged states, 19 of 53 counties have banned the
use and or sale of fireworks while the danger remains.
   Indiana Gov. Robert Orr announced today that he had banned
unsupervised fireworks displays on state properties such as parks
and urged Hoosiers to attend supervised public displays. He said he
had wanted to declare a complete ban on private fireworks during
the holiday weekend, but that state law was so complex such a
restriction would likely be unenforceable.
   In Wisconsin, Gov. Tommy Thompson signed an order Tuesday
banning private fireworks displays. Local governments and the state
may make exceptions and community displays are exempt if they take
fire precautions.
   ``Things are so dry that we are seeing grass and brush fires in
cities and villages,'' Thompson said. ``We have to do what is right
and necessary to protect lives and property.''
   The National Safety Council also issued a warning Monday saying
fireworks, which are linked to 11,000 to 12,000 injuries each year,
will be even more dangerous this year because of parched forests
and fields.
   In Tennessee, a fire that scorched three to four acres at
Lavergne on Tuesday night was blamed on fireworks. More than 150
firefighters were called to fight the blaze.
   ``We think it was possibly started by juveniles shooting
fireworks,'' said John Goodrum, a rescue worker. ``We found a lot
of bottle rockets.''
   Though the bans have prompted a few lawsuits, the head of a
fireworks group said he doesn't oppose the restrictions. ``If they
make a decision their local conditions are that bad, we're
certainly not going to take issue,'' said John Conkling, executive
director of the American Pyrotechnics Association.
   However, he said, cancellations will be a blow to the $170
million-a-year industry, which has about 80 percent of its business
tied to the holiday.
   ``Fireworks companies are very likely to be additional
casualties of the drought,'' Conkling said. ``It very likely will
have impact on every fireworks company in this country.''
   The largest in the nation, Zambelli Fireworks Internationale,
said this is the first time in 40 years drought has affected
business. ``The Midwestern states are backing out the fastest,''
George Zambelli Sr. said Wednesday.
   Some towns have planned alternative celebrations or have
postponed events. The Chicago suburb of Addison will have a
fireworks show in September. Independence, Mo., and Hoffman
Estates, Ill., are planning laser light shows.
   Other towns going ahead with fireworks are taking special
precautions. In Champaign-Urbana, Ill., for example, workers at the
University of Illinois stadium will water the area heavily before
July Fourth and firefighters will stand by, erecting sandbags to
prevent stray sparks from catching fire.
   Iowa State Fire Marshal Wilbur Johnson is advising towns that if
they proceed with fireworks shows they should make sure a firetruck
is standing by.
   But even with safety measures, some officials say fighting a
fire would further deplete water supplies and conditions are just
too risky.
   ``I don't know who would take the responsibility if anything
happened,'' said Dennis Ballou, fire chief in Exira, Iowa.
``Everything is so dry now. Lawns are so cracked it hurts to walk.''

<HEAD>AMA Approves Wide-Ranging AIDS Policies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 14 grafs to UPDATE with vote on AIDS policies,
picking up 14th graf pvs, `In calling ....'
^By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association today approved a
package of policies designed to help check the spread of AIDS,
including a recommendation that states begin tracing the sex
partners of people infected with the deadly virus.
   The nation's largest doctors organization also renewed its call
for mandatory testing of all prison inmates to see if they are
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.
   The AMA adopted a similar prison-testing proposal last year and
reapproved it today, despite objections from several doctors that
it would accomplish little and cost too much.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal, incurable
disease primarily spread by sexual intercourse and sharing
contaminated hypodermic needles.
   On Wednesday, the AMA's House of Delegates, policymaking body
for the organization of 295,000 doctors, moved to offset the
nation's severe nursing shortage by testing a new class of bedside
hospital worker.
   The delegates also approved two major policies calling for a new
direction in the nation's war on drugs and an overhaul of the
government's Medicaid insurance program for the poor.
   The decisions by the House of Delegates were made by voice vote.
   To deal with the shortage of nurses, the AMA's governing board
of trustees will develop pilot programs for training new
``registered care technologists'' to handle chores like taking
vital signs and bathing patients.
   The technologists would receive from two months to 18 months of
training and work under the direction of nurses, handling such
chores as changing bandages, making beds and dispensing some
medications.
   The American Nurses' Association strongly opposed the proposal,
contending the answer to the nursing shortage is to raise salaries
and improve working conditions, not create a new category of worker.
   ``I really am appalled that in the face of opposition from all
of organized nursing that medicine has gone ahead with this
decision to test the creation of a new category of care-giver,''
said Judith Ryan, executive director of the group, which represents
188,000 nurses.
   Ms. Ryan contended that the new technologists wouldn't have
enough training and would duplicate the work of nursing assistants,
licensed practical nurses and technical registered nurses.
   AMA leaders lashed out at the nursing officials for failing to
fill out their ranks and turning people away from the profession by
working to require all nurses to have four-year college degrees.
   ``It's a bankrupt policy,'' declared Dr. William Hotchkiss , who
completed his term as AMA president Wednesday. ``There's a shortage
of 300,000 nurses in United States hospitals at this time and that
is expected to double by the turn of the century.''
   In calling for major changes in the war on drugs, the delegates
said ``real progress'' will only be made by shifting the attack
from catching smugglers to treating abusers.
   The policy recommends that the federal government expand
treatment programs, ease regulations to permit private doctors to
treat opiate addicts with methadone and beef up drug education
programs aimed at adolescents.
   Shifting their attention to another pressing social problem, the
lack of medical care for the poor, the AMA policymakers proposed
creating uniform nationwide eligibility standards for Medicaid and
uniform payments for medical care.
   The delegates voted to lobby the federal government to create
the standards and expand Medicaid to cover 27 million more poor
people at an increased annual cost of $24 billion at 1988's
spending levels.
   The program, administered by state governments, now covers an
estimated 19 million poor people at a projected cost of $52 billion
in 1988.
   Also Wednesday, Dr. James E. Davis, a surgeon from Durham, N.C.,
was sworn in as AMA president. In his inaugural speech, Davis
proposed that county and state doctors' associations organize and
staff _ free of charge _ medical ombudsman offices to serve the
public.
   ``They will receive the public's questions, concerns,
suggestions and recommendations about health matters and follow
through on consumer complaints,'' he said.

   On a lawn where their predecessors
traded musket fire, U.S. and Canadian soldiers today honored 28
American servicemen who died during the War of 1812 in the first
repatriation ceremony between the two nations.
   Although the repatriation and burial of the servicemen is more
than a century and a half overdue, they are being treated as if
they died only yesterday, said Lt. Col. Robert Trotter.
   ``This is the day these men waited 174 years for,'' said
Trotter. ``They are coming home.''
   U.S and Canadian military details stood by as cannon saluted the
fallen men.
   Fort Erie Mayor Heinz Hummel told the crowd of about 500 that
the soldiers' sacrifice paved the way to an undefended border
between the two nations.
   ``Their death was the beginning of our peace,'' he said.
   The remains of the servicemen were discovered during a
construction project in Fort Erie in October 1987 and taken to a
Toronto laboratory for study.
   Archaeologists were able to determine that the skeletons were
American, but could not come up with individual identifications.
They are believed to have been killed during a British siege on an
American position at Snake Hill in 1814.
   George Hees, Canadian minister of veterans affairs, transferred
possession of he remains to Thomas Niles, U.S. Ambassador to
Canada, saying, ``There can be no finer expression of the good
relation between our countries than the reverence we show for these
men.''
   Before the ceremony, an honor guard of U.S. and Canadian
soldiers stood vigil over the 28 caskets, draped with American
flags and lined up in rows on the lawn at old Fort Erie, in the
early morning chill.
   Though the bones are being treated with reverence now, the dead
were given a hasty burial at the time, said Ronald Williamson, head
of the team in charge of the excavation. The soldiers dodged
British artillery and patrol attacks to bury the soldiers in
separate but unmarked graves.
   The victims ranged in age from mid-teens to about 40, and at
least 12 of the men showed evidence of severe injuries, presumably
from musket or cannon fire, Williamson said.
   After the ceremony, 28 hearses carried the caskets over the
Peace Bridge into Buffalo. They were to be buried at Bath National
Cemetery in Steuben County.
   The ceremony marked the beginning of the annual Friendship
Festival between the United States and Canada, which celebrates
continuous peace between the two nations since 1814.
   ``We could not ask for a more symbolic gesture,'' said Patrick
Mines, a festival organizer from Fort Erie.

   Secretary of State George P.
Shultz today pledged continued U.S. support to this Central
American nation, but he expressed concern about an increase in
politically motivated killings of civilians.
   During a four-hour visit, Shultz signed a $125 million balance
of payments agreement. He urged the couuntry to reject the
challenge of the ``guerrillas and their communist allies.''
   ``They don't want democracy; they don't want freedom,'' Shultz
said in a statement shortly after his arrival from Guatemala. He
planned to fly to Honduras from El Salvador.
   After a meeting with Acting President Rodolfo Castillo
Claramount, Shultz conferred with commanders of the Salvadoran
armed forces.
   U.S. officials said Shultz expressed concern about an increase
in killings of civilians to an average of 34 a month. Last year,
the average was 27 civilian slayings each month.
   The administration is worried that a major setback in human
rights performance could jeopardize congressional support for U.S.
aid to El Salvador. The country is receiving $400 million in
economic and military aid this year.
   Speaking of the leftist insurgency, Shultz said, ``They want to
achieve with bullets the power that the people of El Salvador
refuse to give them by the ballot.''
   In Guatemala on Wednesday night, Shultz set the tone for his
four-nation Central American journey by contrasting Nicaragua's
performance with that of the region's democracies.
   He said the democratic countries have been making political and
economic progress with U.S. help, while hopes raised by Nicaragua's
1979 revolution had given way to ``repression and stagnation'' and
``deepening misery.''
   ``The economy is a bust,'' Shultz said. ``Ideology is plentiful
but milk is rationed. The standing army has grown from 6,000 to
80,000 men.''
   Shultz signed a $75 million balance of payments support
agreement with Guatemalan officials and met with President Vinicio
Cerezo. Cerezo is now in his third year as the country's first
elected civilian president since 1970.
   While criticizing Nicaragua, Shultz said the picture is
different elsewhere in the region.
   ``In the last decade, three countries _ Guatemala, El Salvador
and Honduras _ have each made significant progress, more than most
believed possible,'' he said.
   ``Ten years ago, Costa Rica was Central America's only
democracy; today, Nicaragua is Central America's only
dictatorship.''
   Despite Shultz' upbeat assessment, El Salvador and Guatemala
both face potential instability. There have been signs of military
unrest in Guatemala and the political situation in El Salvador is
becoming increasingly polarized.
   Shultz said U.S. support will continue for Central America's
democracies regardless of who wins the U.S. presidential election
in November, because the policy enjoys bipartisan support.
   Shultz returns to Washington on Friday night after a visit to
Costa Rica.
   Shultz said his visit is not focusing on administration plans to
seek additional aid for the rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist
government.
   In his lengthy arrival statement Wednesday night, Shultz made
only scant reference to the rebels, perhaps reflecting the
Guatemalan government's steadfast coolness to the Contra cause.
   Under questioning from reporters during his flight here, Shultz
acknowledged that the military effectiveness of the Contras has
``lessened substantially'' since U.S. military aid ended in
February.
   He accused the Sandinistas of compiling a record of ``evasions
and non-compliance'' in negotiations dating back to the 1979
revolution.
   The Sandinistas, he said, continue to support subversion in
neighboring countries.
   ``Theirs is not a record of honest negotiations. It is a record
of negotiations corrupted by the Sandinistas' efforts to destroy
those who do not agree with them,'' he said.
   Negotiations between the Sandinistas and the Contras broke down
earlier this month and no new talks have been scheduled. Each side
has blamed the other for the breakdown of the negotiations over an
end to their 6{-year-old war.

<HEAD>ACLU Sues Illinois Child-Welfare Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court-appointed overseer should take over the
Illinois Department of Children and Family Services because
officials of the child-care agency are leaving thousands of young
people at risk, according to a lawsuit.
   The suit, filed Wednesday in federal court by the American Civil
Liberties Union on behalf of 14,000 wards of the state, charges
that the department is overburdened and often houses youngsters in
overcrowded, violent shelters or sends them to foster homes where
they are abused.
   ``Thousands of them (wards) are consigned to a life of drift,
disruption and despair,'' according to the lawsuit.
   The department had to deal with 91,715 abuse complaints last
year, up 30 percent from the previous year, officials said. The
1988 total is expected to be higher.
   Department Director Gordon Johnson, named as the defendant, said
a lack of money is the problem.
   ``I am in charge of the department and the buck stops here,''
Johnson said. ``But I am not the one who appropriates money to the
department or raises money in taxes. That is for the Legislature to
do.''
   He said that despite shortcomings, the department is ``one of
the best agencies in the country.''
   Johnson also disputed the need for appointment of an overseer.
   ``Is the federal overseer going to bring federal dollars?'' he
asked.
   The lawsuit charges the agency with violating the children's
constitutional rights of due process and equal protection under the
law.
   ACLU attorney Benjamin Wolf said the agency's shortcomings were
the result of ``10 years of (Gov.) James Thompson's cruelty.''
Thompson is not named as a defendant.
   Wolf said the four-term governor has consistently failed to
provide sufficient funds to manage the agency and other human
services, and has never asked for enough money to address the needs
of the children in his care.
   Dave Fields, a spokesman for the governor in Springfield, said
today that ``Mr. Wolf is engaged in demagoguery.
   ``The fact is that the governor has given DCFS money to vastly
increase the network of child abuse reporting in this state over
the last 10 years. This year, under the tax increase proposal he
submitted, DCFS would have gotten $48 million more'' than the $334
million it got this year.
   Thompson declared his tax increase proposal dead Tuesday because
of opposition in the Legislature.
   Johnson said appropriations for his agency have increased by
$100 million since he took over in 1983.
   The lawsuit contends caseworkers routinely have three times the
number of cases the department itself considers manageable, that
staffing at state facilities is short of adequate levels, that the
agency does not have enough foster homes in which to place
children, and that the agency does not make adequate attempts to
reunite families.
   Wolf said the department's shortcomings have long been apparent,
but Johnson ``never addresses serious problems until they appear on
the front page.''
   ``We respond to children's needs, not newspaper stories,''
Johnson said.
   Wolf said the lawsuit was unusual but warranted.
   ``We only do something like this,'' he added, ``when the whole
system has collapsed.''

<HEAD>Romania Orders Closing of Hungarian Cultural Center</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with Grosz's comments, summoning
of Romanian charge d'affaries. Pick up 3rd graf pvs: `On

<TEXT>
   Romania ordered Hungary's cultural center
in Bucharest closed and told the embassy to leave the building, a
Hungarian diplomat said today.
   The move was the latest in a diplomatic war prompted by
Hungary's contention that Romania is mistreating ethnic Hungarians
who live within its borders.
   In Budapest, Premier Karoly Grosz said tensions between the two
countries were only temporary and that he still intended to visit
Romania as planned.
   Grosz was invited to visit Romania as government leader, before
he was appointed party leader last month. The visit will be the
first to Romania by a Hungarian Communist Party chief since 1977.
No date has been set.
   ``I am convinced that if we don't talk to each other, we cannot
understand each other,'' Grosz said, speaking through an
interpreter.
   The Hungarian Foreign Ministry summoned the Romanian acting
charge d'affaires and expressed its ``regret'' at Romania's
expulsion of Hungarian diplomats.
   Relations between the two Soviet bloc neighbors have been
strained for years over what Hungary maintains is Romania's
discrimination against the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in
Romania. Bucharest has accused Hungary of interfering in its
internal affairs.
   On Tuesday, in an unprecedented action involving two Warsaw Pact
allies, Romania ordered Hungary's consul general in the
Transylvanian city of Cluj to leave the country and declared the
consulate closed.
   The Romanian Foreign Ministry told the Hungarian Embassy on
Wednesday that the cultural center, which never opened to the
public, must be vacated within 48 hours, the diplomat said in a
telephone interview from Romania's capital.
   Both decisions apparently came in retaliation for a rally Monday
night of about 50,000 Hungarians in Budapest who protested
Romania's plans to destroy 7,000 Romanian villages, including
hundreds of Hungarian communities.
   Romanian Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu was angered over
what he said was Hungarian government support for the protesters,
who filed past the Romanian Embassy. He hinted in a speech Tuesday
that he may order the Hungarian missions' operations scaled down.
   Hungarian newspapers and government officials said the
village-demolition scheme would destroy the 1.7 million Hungarians'
cultural heritage in the Romanian province of Transylvania.
   Romanian officials said the villages to be razed by the year
2000 would be replaced by modern agricultural-industrial centers
and remove differences between country and city dwellers.
   The decision to open cultural centers in Bucharest and Budapest,
the Hungarian capital, was made in 1977 at a meeting between
Ceausescu and former Hungarian party chief Janos Kadar.
   Hungary rented a bulding in downtown Bucharest where it planned
to open the center, complete with a library and a projection room.
But Romania never used its reciprocal right to do the same in
Budapest and has not said why.
   The Hungarian cultural center was never issued a permit to start
operation, the diplomat said. In recent years the building was used
as a storage for the Hungarian Embassy.
   The United States, France, West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Great
Britain and Italy have received permission and opened similar
centers in Bucharest in the past 20 years.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling Forcing Defense Contractor to Pay Damages
for Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that forced a defense contractor to pay damages for an on-duty
accident involving a Navy pilot.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Grumman
Aerospace Corp., ordered to pay $840,556 to the pilot's family who
died when his plane crashed off the California coast in 1979.
   The court's action comes just three days after the justices
ruled that government contractors enjoy sweeping legal immunity
from personal injury lawsuits.
   In Monday's ruling, the court said contractors cannot be sued if
they designed the equipment according to government specificiations
and notified the government about any hazards they knew about.
   It appears a federal appeals court's ruling in the Grumman
Aerospace case focused on the Navy's lack of notification about any
hazards.
   The death of Navy Lt. Gary S. Shaw of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was
blamed on a design defect in Grumman's A-6 plane. The plane crashed
within seconds after taking off from the aircraft carrier
Constellation about 100 miles off the coast of San Diego.
   Navy investigators said the most likely cause of the crash was
the loss or failure of a bolt in the plane's system for controlling
its up-and-down movement.
   Although the A-6 is the mainstay of the Navy's carrier-based
attack fleet, there have been at least six other accidents
involving the plane's flight control mechanism since the 1960s.
   In 1981, Shaw's father, Edwin Lees Shaw, sued over his son's
death.
   Last December, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
$840,556 jury award against Grumman.
   The appeals court said military contractors in such cases are
not exempt from liability.
   Grumman contended that forcing it to pay undermines the
military's independence and violates the separation of powers by
giving courts too much power.
   But the appeals court said, ``Although the Navy did formally
approve Grumman's A-6 specifications and design changes, that
approval did not constitute the sort of informed military decision
to accept the risk of a dangerous product to which this court must
defer under separation of powers doctrine.''
   In such cases, the appeals court said, the defense contractor
has more information about risks and ``the military may simply be
working in the dark.''
   The appeals court added: ``Our central concern is whether or not
the military actually made a decision to use a product that it knew
to be dangerous to servicemen.''
   Since the military was not sued by the Shaw family, it was up to
Grumman to prove it followed very specific orders in designing the
A-6, the appeals court said, adding that the company failed to do
so.
   Grumman had argued that allowing monetary damages in such
lawsuits would undermine servicemen's confidence and give comfort
to enemies of the United States.
   ``If anything persuades pilots to tremble and the enemy to
rejoice, it will be the A-6's accident record itself _ not this
court's recognition of it,'' the appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, Grumman's lawyers said four other
federal appeals courts have disagreed.
   Most of the nation's defense industry joined in support of
Grumman, arguing the 11th Circuit court ruling undermines military
independence.
   But lawyers for the Shaw family said the companies were trying
to deceive the Supreme Court into believing the government was the
defendant in the case.
   ``Neither the United States nor the Navy are on trial,'' they
said.
   The high court has ruled that members of the armed services may
not sue the government over injuries suffered in connection with
their military service.
   The case is Grumman vs. Shaw, 85-1529.

<HEAD>Only Two Prime-Time Movies a Week on French TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French television stations will be limited to
showing two films a week in prime time in a bid to boost attendance
at movie houses, the government announced Thursday.
   Culture Minister Jack Lang said on France's annual ``Cinema
Day'' that he also would be putting together an ``emergency plan''
to provide $12 million for promoting films and movie houses.
   The Culture Ministry said in a statement that the heads of
France's six television networks had agreed to cut back film
broadcasts during the prime-time hours from 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.
Regulations giving the limit the force of law are being drawn up.
   ``It is a first step, and other measures will have to be taken
to assure a new balance among the media,'' the statement said.
   The networks currently are forbidden from showing movies in
prime time only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Some channels have
scheduled films on the other five nights.
   The French are the most active moviegoers in Europe, but cinema
admissions have been falling in recent years as film buffs stay
home to watch TV.
   Bernard Vidal, spokesman for the National Federation of Cinema
Halls, said about 500 movie houses have closed since January 1987.
He said the proliferation of movies on TV was the prime culprit,
with 1,300 films broadcast last year.
   ``This situation, without precedent in France, does not have an
equal anywhere in the world,'' he said.
   On Cinema Day, an annual event started in 1985, anyone who buys
a single cinema ticket at full price can then go from one movie to
the next all day long, paying just one franc (about 16 cents) per
ticket.

   Two Laotian tribesmen who became U.S. citizens
were sentenced by a judge to learn English and study American
heritage and culture following their convictions on battery charges.
   ``I recognize that they came from a different society and a
different culture, and one that unfortunately experienced violence
on a daily basis,'' Cook County Circuit Judge Michael Jordan said
during sentencing Tuesday.
   Ching Xiong, 71, who had been mayor of a Laotian village, and
his son, Bravo Xiong, 38, were accused of beating a man in a
disagreement on an expressway ramp.
   The Xiongs had wanted the judge to allow a tribal test of truth,
in which both parties tell their side of the story and then drink
water containing rooster blood.
   In the March 1987 incident, the Xiongs stopped their car on a
ramp after Michael Speropulous, 23, of Chicago, honked his car's
horn at them several times because their car cut his off,
authorities said.
   Prosecutors say the elder Xiong, who was convicted of battery,
held Speropulous while the younger Xiong, who was convicted of
aggravated battery, hit Speropulous on the head with a metal bar.
   The Xiongs claimed they acted in self-defense, but five
witnesses backed up Speropulous.
   A Northwestern University professor who testified on the Xiongs'
behalf called the sentence ``the ultimate outrage.''
   ``They came to this country with no resources, stripped of their
land and money,'' said Dwight Conquergood. ``They have suffered
enough.''
   The Xiongs, who are Hmong tribesmen, were wounded in the Vietnam
War, fighting on the side of the United States. They left Laos in
1975, and lived in a refugee camp in Thailand for five years before
moving to Chicago.
   Bravo Xiong said at trial that the rooster blood test works
because it is believed that a person who drinks the blood after
telling a lie soon will die. Usually in Hmong standoffs, the liar
does not drink the water, he said.
   Assistant State's Attorney Cathy Crowley said the younger Xiong
should have been sentenced to jail.
   ``You don't take a tire iron or a locking device to someone's
cranium because you don't appreciate them honking their horn,'' she
said.
   In addition to the cultural education, Jordan sentenced the
father to a year's court supervision and sentenced the son to two
weekends in jail and 600 hours of community service and placed him
on 30 months' probation.

   About 85,000 Minnesotans have returned
voter registration forms that were mailed with their income tax
booklets.
   Voter registration forms for the first time were mailed out in
tax booklets this year as part of a program to increase
participation in elections.
   People applying for or renewing driver's licenses also receive
voter registration information, and Secretary of State Joan Growe
said Wednesday that the state has received about 55,000 forms back
from that effort.
   An additional 40,000 to 50,000 forms filled out by driver's
license applicants are believed to have been sent directly to
county auditors, Growe said. About 2,000 voter registration forms
obtained during visits to other state agencies also have been
returned, Growe said.
   According to the secretary of state's office, about 2.5 million
of Minnesota's estimated 3.1 million eligible voters are registered.

   Four prep-school students dumped the body of an
18-year-old classmate in a park, wiped blood from their car and
burned their bloodied clothing after he was shot robbing an
off-duty police officer, authorities said.
   Two of the teen-agers were in police custody today and two
others were expected to surrender, police spokeswoman Alice
McGillion said.
   The body of James Patrick Cooney, 18, was found early Wednesday
among weeds in a Bronx park. His panicked classmates dumped his
body there Sunday after the off-duty officer shot him once in the
head as the teen-agers fled the robbery, police said.
   The teens went on a robbery spree early Sunday to raise $900 to
repair a station wagon that Cooney had damaged, Ms. McGillion said.
One of the young men had been afraid to tell his father that his
friend dented the car.
   ``They made some attempt to raise the money themselves, but
could only get about $100,'' she said. ``They tried to borrow the
money from someone, can't come up with the money, so they commit
robberies.''
   Authorities believe at least two of the five teen-agers first
participated in a grocery store robbery and shot out six car
windows, Ms. McGillion sad.
   At 2:10 a.m. the teen-agers tried to rob off-duty police officer
David R. Erosa, 27, who was sitting inside his car with a date,
police said.
   Cooney demanded Erosa's wallet, and as the officer was reaching
to give it to him, Cooney pointed a rifle at him and said, ``I'm
not fooling around, this is not a fake gun,'' according to Ms.
McGillion.
   He then fired the rifle, striking Erosa's car door, police said.
   As the teens' car drove off, Erosa pulled a revolver and fired
five shots, shattering a car window, Ms. McGillion said. One of the
bullets hit Cooney in the head and he died in the car shortly
thereafter.
   ``They panicked,'' she said. ``There was 20 to 30 minutes of
screaming and carrying on in the car and panic as to what to do.''
   Erosa reported the robbery and shooting on Sunday, but was
unaware his bullet had struck Cooney, she said.
   The young men dumped Cooney's body in the park and then dropped
one of their classmates at home. The three later burned
blood-soaked clothing in a field and used kerosene to scrub out the
bloodstains on the front seat, Ms. McGillion said.
   Barry Bootan, 18, was arrested at his home Tuesday after he told
a girlfriend about the killing and she told a police officer she
knew, Ms. McGillion said.
   Jason Katanic, 18, surrendered Wednesday, police said.
   They were charged with the attempted murder of a police officer
and attempted robbery, authorities said. Bootan also was charged
with robbery; Katanic also was charged with the unlawful use of a
firearm, police said.
   Cooney, Bootan, Katanic and the two other students graduated
June 3 from Fordham Prep School, a select Catholic preparatory
school on the campus of Fordham University. None of them had
previously been arrested.
   The Rev. Edward Maloney, president of the prep school, described
Cooney, the stepson of a police officer, as ``a fine young man,''
who was planning to attend college in the fall.
   ``In my book, he's the greatest kid in the world,'' Maloney said.

Wednesday they had to cross her picket line to reach their offices.
   The Machinists say Ms. Gaal, 35, earns more than many union

   Ms. Gaal admits her $13.55 an hour salary is good, but has
protested a clause the union wanted in her contract that would set
her minimum workweek at 17 hours. The union offered to drop that
clause, but Ms. Gaal says she also wants her workload lightened, a
bigger bonus and yearly increase.

   Soldiers captured a major leftist
guerrilla base and destroyed several narcotics laboratories and
36.5 tons of drugs, Colombian military officers announced today.
   The leftist National Liberation Army guerrilla base was
discovered Tuesday night in a wooded area near the town of San
Alberto, 230 miles north of Bogota, Gen. Farouk Yanine Diaz
reported.
   Diaz, commander of the Second Army Division, said the guerrillas
fled when a network of alarms was activated.
   Guerrillas have blown up the country's main oil pipeline 79
times since last year. Diaz said his troops captured 90 pounds of
dynamite.
   The pipeline carries 215,000 barrels of oil daily from the Cano
Limon field to port Covenas on the Caribbean. The guerrilla attacks
deprived Colombia of $200 million of oil export income this year,
Ecopetrol, the state oil company, says.
   Diaz said arms, communications equipment and uniforms were
captured at the base, as well as notebooks containing details of
rebel activities. He said these included account books of sums
extorted from landowners in the area and plans to continue dynamite
attacks.
   ``The information will make it easier for us to destroy this
gang,'' Diaz told reporters.
   Gen. Harold Bedoya Pizaro, commander of the Seventh Army
Brigade, said in a communique his troops had destroyed 84 cocaine
processing laboratories in a joint operation with police in the
Guaviare area of southwestern Colombia. He said they had also
rendered inoperable 18 clandestine airstrips and destroyed 20.5
tons of coca base and 16 tons of coca leaves.

<HEAD>Lower House Approves Transfer of U.S. Jets to Italy</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: ADDS 7 grafs to details.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lower house of Parliament today overwhelming
approved the government's decision to accept 72 U.S. F-16 fighter
jets being evicted from their base in Spain.
   The Chamber of Deputies, in a secret ballot, voted 298-196, with
24 abstentions, to back the plan to move the jets to Crotone, in
the Puglia region of southern Italy.
   In his appeal to the legislature before the vote, Foreign
Minister Giulio Andreotti called acceptance of the fighter wing ``a
decision in tune with the politics of peace that our country has
always pursued.''
   Italy's government on June 4 announced that it had accepted a
NATO request to accept the jets, which Spain has had at the orrejon
air base. Spain has decided that the jets must go within three
years.
   A coalition of Communists, Italy's second-largest party, and
smaller leftist groups, had opposed accepting the jets. But Premier
Ciriaco De Mita's five-party coalition has a comfortable majority
in Parliament.
   The vote on whether to accept the jets came on the opposition's
request.
   The opposition has also asked for a vote in the Senate but no
date has been set for it. The government coalition also has a
majority in the upper house.
   The coalition had viewed keeping the jets in the Mediterranean
an essential key to guaranteeing security in NATO's southern flank.
   Opposition parties in the lower house argued on Wednesday,
during the first day of debate, that Italy's acceptance of the
planes would upset the strategic balance between East and West and
hamper efforts to ease tensions between the two blocs.
   Andreotti addressed those concerns today, saying that the F-16
issue ``certainly has not damaged the relations between our
government and Moscow.'' He noted that Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in recent talks with Italian officials, did
not raise the subject.
   Andreotti told the chamber that basing the planes at Crotone
would serve to keep the balance between NATO and Warsaw pact forces.
   Outside Parliament, several members of the small leftist
Proletarian Democracy party, including one parliamentarian, joined
by members of Communist Party youth groups and some independent
peace activists, demonstrated peacefully against the basing of the
missiles, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.

<HEAD>Dust From Building Sites May be Cause of Illness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some health experts suspect dust from construction
sites that filters into air conditioning systems may cause
Legionnaires' disease, a magazine reported Thursday.
   The magazine New Scientist quotes Christopher Bartlett, a senior
epidemiologist at the Communicable Diseases Surveillance Center, as
saying the air conditioners could be sucking up dust which
neutralizes the sterilizing agents in the cooling systems and
converts them into food for the bacteria that cause the disease.
   It also quoted Patrick O'Sullivan, a specialist on building
hazards from the Welsh School of Architecture, as saying there were
construction sites near 90 percent of the buildings where outbreaks
of Legionnaires' disease occurred.
   The government's Health and Safety Executive called the theory
``a bit far-fetched.'' Linda Allen of the Institute of
Environmental Health Officers told the magazine that in large
cities like London, ``everyone is near a building site.''
   The report came a month after an outbreak of the disease at
British Broadcasting Corp. headquarters in London in which two
people died.
   It quoted Bartlett as saying engineers should make frequent
checks of cooling systems whenever building activity is going on in
the area.
   The government has reacted to the threat of Legionnaires'
disease by issuing stricter guidelines to engineers. These require
weekly checks of cooling systems at hospitals.

   An Emery Air Freight DC-8 with hydraulic problems
blew out four tires when it landed at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport today, forcing one of airport's two main runways to close,
authorities said.
   A small fire broke out because of the rough landing, but airport
crews quickly extinguished it and the five-member crew was
evacuated with no injuries, Port of Seattle officials said.
   Port spokeswoman Vicki Schmitz said the flight to Seattle from
Dayton, Ohio, warned the control tower of the plane's hydraulic
problems. Emergency crews were on hand for its landing.
   The DC-8 was diverted from the main runway after landing, Ms.
Schmitz said, and the flat tires would be changed before the plane
was unloaded.
   No delays were reported because of the shutdown runway three
hours after the landing.

   Mozambican rebels raided villages in
southeastern Zimbabwe, killing one person and injuring two others,
police said Thursday.
   About 30 armed Mozambique National Resistance rebels drove 20
cattle across the border into Mozambique after ransacking villages
and homesteads in the Chisumbanje area near Chipinge, about 275
miles southeast of Harare, police said.
   The guerrillas, also known by their Portuguese acronym Renamo,
stole food and property worth about $5,000 in the June 24-26 raids,
police said.
   No further details of the raids were given in the police
statement.
   The right-wing front has been fighting since 1977 to topple the
Marxist government in Maputo.
   In the past two months, at least nine Zimbabwean villagers have
been killed in cross-border attacks by rebels foraging for food and
supplies.

<TEXT>
   Two Soviet cosmonauts from the Mir space station
took a walk in space today to repair a telescope but were unable to
complete the job after more than five hours, the Tass news agency
said.
   The report said Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov were outside the
station for five hours and 10 minutes trying to replace a detector
unit on an X-ray telescope. The telescope is on the Kvant orbiting
observatory, which is attached to the Mir.
   Tass later said the work was incomplete and would have to be
resumed later. It was unclear whether the unit was replaced or what
work remained to be done.
   The cosmonauts left the Mir station at 9:33 a.m., Tass said. It
said they had some problems unfastening the clasp holding the
detector unit to the telescope.
   Tass said a new detector would permit the telescope to be used
for a longer period.
   The cosmonauts made a similar walk on Feb. 20 to replace a solar
battery. That walk lasted four hours and 25 minutes.
   Titov and Manarov took over from cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko on
Dec. 21 when they blasted off from the Central Asian cosmodrome.
Romanenko returned to Earth on Dec. 29 after a space endurance
record of 325 days.
   The Mir station, the newest of the two Soviet research complexes
in orbit, was launched Feb. 20, 1986. The Kvant orbiting
observatory was attached to it in early 1987, and Soviet scientists
have been using the space complex for a series of observations and
experiments.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Law Banning Nude Dancing At Bars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today blocked implementation of a new
Georgia law that bans nude dancing at businesses serving alcohol,
13 hours before it was to have gone into effect at midnight.
   Superior Court Judge Luther Alverson granted a temporary
restraining order sought by operators of the Gold Club of Atlanta,
which contended the law is so broad it could be applied to
theaters, art museums, hotels, motels and even private homes.
   Alverson's 16-page ruling stresses that the order was issued
strictly to give him time to hold further hearings. But he added
that he believed the Gold Club would win the lawsuit because the
ban violated Georgia's constitution.
   Alverson agreed that federal court rulings may support the ban,
but said, ``The court finds that the General Assembly of the state
of Georgia lacked the power to enact (the ban) and (it) is
therefore unconstitutional under the Georgia Constitution.''
   He also ruled that the Gold Club may be able to prove that the
law is too broad and therefore violates even federal law.
   Supporters of the ban had relied heavily on rulings giving the
state widespread control of liquor laws, but Alverson said other
rulings had undermined some of that authority. ``Restrictions will
not pass constitutional scrutiny if the result is to eliminate
totally the activity,'' he said.
   ``While the record is not complete on this issue, (the Gold
Club) may be able to show that by restricting the activities
prohibited through the liquor laws of this state, the result will
be to eliminate totally the activities which are otherwise
protected by the United States Constitution.
   ``In fact, some might argue that the true purpose ... is not to
regulate liquor but rather to banish once and for all the
activities prohibited ... from the state of Georgia. The state
clearly cannot do by indirection what it cannot do directly.''

<HEAD>Court to Study Alleged Race Discrimination in Alaskan Salmon
Canneries</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents of 13th graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to study
alleged race discrimination in Alaskan salmon canneries, setting
the stage for an important sequel to a one-day-old ruling that
makes it easier for workers to prove their bosses are guilty of
illegal bias.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by two companies
based in Washington state and Oregon that operate canneries in
Alaska.
   The court will review a ruling that the companies must stand
trial on bias charges by non-whites, primarily Filipinos, Alaskan
natives and Asians who say they are relegated to the lowest-paying
jobs.
   A ruling by the justices is expected sometime in 1989.
   By an 8-0 vote Wednesday, the justices said employees can use
statistical evidence to prove that some subjective decisions made
by their employers violate federal law. The court reinstated a suit
by a black woman who charged a Texas bank with discrimination.
   But only four justices in the Texas case agreed on how difficult
it should be to prove, with statistics, that subjective decisions
are illegally discriminatory.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the newest member of the court, did
not take part in reviewing the Texas dispute.
   By agreeing to study the Alaskan cannery case, the justices will
have the opportunity to elaborate on some of the guidelines it
provided Wednesday. Their eventual ruling could have widespread
impact for job-bias claims.
   Non-whites charged discrimination against Wards Cove Packing Co.
Inc. of Seattle, Wash., and Castle & Cooke Inc. of Astoria, Ore.
   The companies operate salmon canneries in remote areas of Alaska
during the summer salmon run.
   The non-whites said that while they hold nearly half the jobs at
the canneries, the jobs are racially stratified with whites
dominating in the higher-paying positions such as machinists,
carpenters and administrative slots.
   The non-whites also said that discrimination is so pervasive
that mess halls and bunkhouses are racially segregated.
   Even the salmon-butchering machine at one of the canneries has a
name with racial overtones _ the ``Iron Chink,'' they said.
   But lawyers for the cannery companies said any racial divisions
are caused by legitimate business-related reasons. They said, for
example, that most of the higher-paying jobs require skill and
prior experience that it is difficult for the non-whites to acquire
because they are seasonal workers from remote regions of Alaska.
   Moreover, the companies' lawyers said, the lower paid cannery
workers are hired through a union which is primarily non-white.
   The companies said statistics showing non-whites hold most of
the seasonal cannery worker jobs should not be allowed as proof of
discrimination. The companies said what is relevant is that they
hire for the higher-ranking positions from a labor market that is
only 10 percent non-white. The companies said they have filled
those better jobs with more than 20 percent non-whites.
   A federal judge ruled in favor of the companies in 1983. But the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the bias suit by the
non-whites last September.
   The appeals court said statistics showing a concentration of
non-whites in the lower-paying jobs can be used as evidence of
discrimination in the better jobs. The appeals court also gave the
non-whites broad leeway to cite a host of company employment
practices to support their discrimination claims, placing a heavy
burden on the company to disprove those claims.
   For example, the non-whites said the firms are guilty of
nepotism _ hiring relatives for the better jobs. The federal judge
who ruled in favor of the companies said any nepotism was
permissible because those hired had greater skills and were not
given jobs because they are relatives of other employees or bosses.
   But the 9th Circuit court, in reviving the suit, said the
companies must prove that any nepotism was a ``business necessity.''
   The case is Wards Cove vs. Antonio, 87-1387.

   The withdrawal of Vietnamese forces
from Cambodia has conjured fears of a comeback by the dreaded Khmer
Rouge, one of the most brutal regimes of modern times.
   Although it has been nearly a decade since the Khmer Rouge were
toppled by the Vietnamese invasion, there is a fear in southeast
Asia of a reprise of their 1975-78 reign of terror in Cambodia.
According to some estimates, up to 3 million people died.
   ``One has to be either naive or an idiot to believe that the
Khmer Rouge in the '80s can be different from the Khmer Rouge of
the '70s,'' Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former leader, said
recently.
   Having been both their prisoner and their ally, few outsiders
know the Khmer Rouge as well as Sihanouk.
   Similar apprehension is being voiced in the now bustling capital
of Phnom Penh, whose citizens died by the tens of thousands in a
forced march into the countryside during the Khmer Rouge rule.
   And, somewhat ironically, alarms are being sounded in countries
that in recent years have called for the withdrawal of the
Vietnamese and tried with considerable success to brand Hanoi an
international pariah because of its late 1978 invasion of Cambodia.
   ``We cannot preclude the possibility that a Vietnamese
withdrawal might create conditions in which the Khmer Rouge could
return to power,'' said U.S. Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y. and
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia.
   Solarz recently described a Khmer Rouge comeback as ``morally
unthinkable and politically unacceptable'' and called for an
international conference to face this dilemma.
   There have been other proposals, such as holding internationally
supervised elections, disarming warring parties, and creating a
United Nations peacekeeping force to prevent Khmer Rouge domination
of a post-war Cambodia.
   ``I would like people to know who really is the obstruction to
peace in Cambodia: the Vietnamese or the Khmer Rouge,'' said former
Thai prime minister and elder statesman Kukrit Pramoj.
   Thailand has been a vocal opponent of Hanoi and allows Chinese
arms to flow through its territory to the Khmer Rouge.
   Such concern was set off by Hanoi's partial withdrawal Thursday
of some of its 50,000 troops. Vietnam, apparently with some Soviet
urging, has promised to pull out all its remaining forces by 1990
and said it would enter talks to find a political solution to the
protracted conflict.
   In the absence of a Vietnamese military shield, the
35,000-member army of the People's Republic of Kampuchea would be
left alone to face the three-party coalition of the Khmer Rouge and
two non-communist groups, Khmer People's National Liberation Front
and Sihanouk's followers.
   Despite Hanoi's claims that the Phnom Penh regime can stand on
its own, virtually all western analysts regard its army as
substandard.
   Western analysts and the two coalition partners themselves have
pointed out that the Khmer Rouge have done little fighting but have
stockpiled much weaponry in recent months. The conclusion drawn is
that the guerrillas are trying to put themselves in the strongest
position possible in the event of a ceasefire.
   China, the prime backer of the Khmer Rouge, is key to their
future. Although denying recent American newspaper reports that it
was prepared to grant asylum to the top Khmer Rouge leaders, says
Beijing appears ready to show some flexibility on the Cambodian
issue, the U.S. State Department says.
   Some analysts speculate that if peace comes the Khmer Rouge will
have difficulty retaining their rank and file, who may rally to the
side of Sihanouk.
   Still widely popular, the 65-year-old Sihanouk has been
Cambodia's king, head of state and nominal chief of a front, which
included the Khmer Rouge, that fought the U.S.-backed Phnom Penh
government in the 1970-75 war.
   After victory, Sihanouk became a prisoner of the Khmer Rouge,
who released him as Vietnamese troops moved into Cambodia so he
could plead the country's case before the world community.
   During their rule, Khmer Rouge leaders turned Cambodia into a
vast labor camp and charnel house
   By conservative estimates, hundreds of thousands were killed;
Phnom Penh says three million perished. Schools were closed,
Buddhist temples destroyed, all private property was abolished and
millions were forced to labor in the fields on near-starvation
diets.
   The top Khmer Rouge leaders, including Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and
Khieu Samphan, reverted to being guerrillas after the Vietnamese
invasion and admitted only to ``some mistakes'' during their rule.
They claimed to have renounced communism.
   The Khmer Rouge dropped the harshest aspects of their rule but
human rights groups and defectors have consistently reported severe
punishments in areas of the Thai-Cambodian border under their
control.
   The United Nations recently said it might cut off aid to a
second Khmer Rouge border camp because its leaders have blocked
outside aid efforts and reportely prevented refugees from being
evacuated for medical treatment.
   A U.N. official cited ``bizarre violations of human rights.''

   The Supreme Court agreed Thursday to
grant a retrial in the case of an air force officer whose spying
conviction was based on circumstantial evidence.
   His attorney said he was confident the court would clear the
officer, Lt. Col. Bertil Stroberg, who maintained he was innocent.
   Stroberg completed half his six-year sentence and was released
on parole in 986.
   Stroberg said he was doing a favor for an acquaintance when he
went to a post office to pick up a letter indicating he offered to
sell military secrets to Poland.
   The letter was planted by police who earlier were alerted to a
spy operation by another letter sent to the Polish Embassy
containing military secrets and offering more information for
payment.
   ``There was no direct evidence that Stroberg had written the
letter to the embassy nor that he had delivered it,'' said his
lawyer, Ulla Jacobsson.
   The 1983 case received notoriety in part because Stroberg
continued to receive 90 percent of his military salary while he was
in jail.

   Conditions for a political solution to the
long Cambodian conflict have improved with a Vietnamese troop
withdrawal and plans for discussions among all sides in the
conflict later this year in Indonesia, administration officials
said Thursday.
   ``Recent events in Indochina suggest reasons for being
cautiously optimistic about ending the seemingly intractable
conflict in Cambodia,'' said Karl D. Jackson, deputy assistant
secretary of defense for East Asia.
   Jackson and David Lamberston, a deputy assistant secretary of
state for the region, cited the withdrawal of 50,000 Vietnamese
troops from Cambodia that began this month and the prospect for
informal talks among Cambodian factions, Vietnam and other
interested parties in Indonesia in late July.
   ``We do not expect concrete decisions to result from these
initial talks, but we believe that they reflect increasing momentum
in the direction of a political settlement of the conflict,''
Lamberston told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on East Asia.
   Both officials reiterated U.S. concern that the withdrawal of
Vietnamese occupation troops could create an opening for the
resumption of power by the Khmer Rouge, which was responsible for
the genocide of more than a million Cambodians in the 1970s under
the ruthless leadership of Pol Pot.
   Also testifying at the hearing was Kitty Dukakis, wife of the
apparent Democratic presidential nominee, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis. Mrs. Dukakis asked for a greater U.S. commitment
to improving the lives of the 300,000 or more Cambodian refugees
now living in camps along the Thai-Cambodian border.
   Living conditions in the camps have deteriorated, she said.
Residents have no space in which to grow fresh vegetables, and the
60 percent of their inhabitants who are children have no place to
play. Rapes and brutality have increased, and Thai officials are
failing to provide adequate security, she said.
   While some education is available to the refugee children, it is
of poor quality, Mrs. Dukakis added. ``It is a tragic loss of the
future of Cambodia ... We must provide a sense of hope.''

<TEXT>
   Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi today
met with President Reagan and said afterward that Reagan agreed
with a new plan intended to bring ``peace and reconciliation to my
country.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said after Sabimvi spoke
with reporters that ``generally speaking'' Reagan supports
Savimbi's plan. Fitzwater did not go into detail.
   In a speech to the National Press Club following his White House
meeting, Savimbi listed the four points of the plan:
   _U.S. military assistance should continue for UNITA as long as
the Soviet Union and Cuba continue to provide military assistance
to the Angolan government his guerrillas are battling.
   _The United States should maintain contact with the governments
of Angola, Cuba, the Soviet Union and South Africa to ``force the
withdrawal of all foreign troops from Angola as soon as possible.''
   _The United States and key African states should promote a
dialogue between UNITA and the Angolan government to discuss the
formation of an interim government leading to free elections.
   _The United States and African countries should obtain
agreeement from both UNITA and the Angolan government on a date for
free elections.
   The United States says Cuba has about 45,000 Cuban troops in
Angola backing that nation's Marxist government. Savimbi's UNITA
organization receives about $16 million in U.S. aid, including
shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, a year.
   Savimbi, who has said he is satisfied with the U.S. aid, said he
did not mention the subject to Reagan.
   But he said he did support U.S.-sponsored negotiations between
the Angolan government, South Africa and Cuba intended to gain the
withdrawal of the Cuban troops as well as South African soldiers
who support Savimbi's guerrillas.
   Many U.S. civil rights leaders oppose Savimbi because of his
South African support. Democrats in Congress are calling for a new
ban on U.S. aid to UNITA.
   Today, however, he was accompanied to the White House by Ralph
David Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and
several prominent black Republicans who vouched for Savimbi's
opposition to South African apartheid.
   The White House said Savimbi met privately with Reagan and they
were joined later by Abernathy and the black Republicans, who
included Charles Evers, mayor of Fayette, Miss., and Maurice
Dawkins, candidate for the Senate in Virginia.
   Abernathy said Savimbi deserved U.S. support from ``the black
people of America and the world, and white people of goodwill and
all mankind'' in his effort to bring peace to Angola.
   Before coming to Washington this week, Savimbi toured the
southern United States in an effort to build support in
predominantly black churches.
   On Wednesday, Savimbi said in a speech that UNITA would accept
support from wherever we get it.''

<HEAD>Common Cause Assails Proposed Tax Break On Lawmakers' Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government watchdog group on Thursday urged
members of the House tax-writing committee to reject a proposal to
give lawmakers a bigger deduction on their homes.
   ``This action would ... enhance preferential tax treatment for
members of Congress that is available to no other taxpayer,'' said
Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a group which advocates
higher ethics standards in goverhment.
   ``We strongly urge you to resist any efforts to repeal or
increase the deduction for living expenses for members of
Congress,'' he said in a letter sent to committee members.
   Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., has
proposed to repeal the current $3,000 limit on deductibility for
members' Washington living expenses as part of a plan allowing
higher congressional salaries in exchange for banning acceptance of
speaking fees.
   The committee is currently drafting a catch-all bill of changes
to the 1986 income tax law, and could include Rostenkowski's
proposed tax break in that legislation.
   Rostenkowski argues that his plan would treat lawmakers in the
tax code the same as businessmen and women who travel frequently.
Wertheimer said that argument was false, since Washington becomes
the normal residence for most lawmakers.
   ``Because of this special provision, members of Congress ...
(are) eligible to take business deductions for what are actually
the normal everyday costs of living at home,'' Wertheimer said.

   Scientists today began innoculating an
acre of corn stalks in the first field test of a genetically
engineered microbe designed to combat the European corn borer, one
of agriculture's most destructive pests.
   Although researchers have conducted other experiments of
genetically altered materials in the environment, the tests of
Cxc-Bt at the federal experimental station here are the first
approved of a genetically altered ``plant vaccine,'' scientists and
federal officials said.
   Proponents of the Crop Genetics International project call the
testing a step toward an era of chemical-free pest control.
   The company's chief scientist, Peter Carlson, said today he
hoped Cxc-Bt will have the effect of making the corn borer sick.
But he said the main purpose of the test is to determine whether
the pesticide will spread from plant to plant, an undesireable
effect.
   The microbe works by attacking the alkaline stomach of corn
borers, giving them ulcers. It doesn't affect humans because
people's stomachs are acid and are unaffected by the Bt protein,
according to researchers. In previous experiments in petrie dishes
and in a greenhouse, the microbe killed the borers in the petrie
dishes and sickened them when tested in the greenhouse.
   The pest costs American farmers $400 million annually.
   Critics worry that Cxc-Bt experiment could set a precedent and
are concerned that genetically engineered materials could spread
uncontrollably once released into the environment.
   Environmental groups, including the National Audubon Society and
the Environmental Defense Fund, did not oppose the limited field
tests begun today.
   Environmental experts said if their questions about spreading
are answered with more tests, they may support the final product.
   The crucial question for environmental groups is whether there
will be adequate testing and regulation because Cxc-Bt is just the
beginning of a rush of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of similiar
products, said Maureen Hinkle, the Audubon Society's director of
agriculture policy.
   Only one other genetic crop protector, a microbe altered to
fight frost, has been approved for field testing by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington-based Foundation on
Economic Trends, said the pesticide hasn't been shown to work in
greenhouse tests.
   Rifkin said today his organization did not oppose today's test
because ``this product doesn't work. It does not kill corn borers.
(The company's) evaluation data supplied to the EPA shows the
product does not kill the insects. It poses no immediate threat
because it doesn't work.''

<TEXT>
   In 1976, a knot of dissident Teamsters agitating
against multiple salaries, jet air fleets and other abuses by some
union leaders were showered with verbal abuse by union President
Frank Fitzsimmons.
   Twelve years later the Teamsters for a Democratic Union is a
minority party within the giant union with its own constitution,
bylaws and annual conventions. TDU goals were echoed by the reforms
the federal government sued this week to try to force on the 1.6
million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
   The 11,000 members of TDU have won little more than abuse and
busted heads for their efforts.
   At the Teamsters convention in 1976 in Las Vegas, Nev., dock
worker Peter Camarata, representing the fledgling TDU, urged
changes from the convention floor. He was met with jeers, power was
cut to his microphone, and he later was beaten up at a convention
party.
   In 1983, a crowd loyal to current Teamsters President Jackie
Presser shoved its way into a Romulus, Mich., hotel where the TDU
was meeting. They trashed the meeting room but missed the
dissidents, who slipped out a side door.
   TDU influence may be wider than its 11,000 members, according to
Frank DePirro, a national organizer of the Detroit-based group. He
said he mails about 50,000 copies of the group's 10-times-yearly
newsletter Convoy Dispatch, of which he is editor.
   In the U.S. Justice Department suit filed this week, the
government proposes taking over the union and setting up direct
election of officers.
   ``If you beat your head against a stone wall for long enough,
either your head gets bloody or the wall gets a chink in it. Maybe
this is a little bit of both,'' said Washington attorney Arthur
Fox, who represents the TDU.
   The TDU agrees that direct elections are needed, but DePirro
said the rank and file doesn't trust the government to run the
union.
   Fox said TDU grew out of a meeting of truck drivers sponsored in
1971 by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who urged members to
petition the government for protections their union did not provide
_ such as limits on driving hours.
   In 1976, Fox and a law student published ``Teamsters Democracy
and Financial Accountability,'' a book that rocked the union with
accounts of officers drawing two, three or more salaries, abuses of
the union jet fleet and widspread nepotism.
   Fox treasures a tape of a radio interview that year in which
Fitzsimmons berated him and the 6,000 Teamsters then in the
dissident group.
   ``Frank Fitzsimmons called me lots of names. ... He said we
weren't fit to sweep the floors of the Teamsters union,'' Fox said.
   Camarata voiced the TDU's positions at the 1976 convention,
proposing direct election of officers, and limiting officers to ``a
reasonable salary not to exceed $100,000.''
   Then, as now, top union officers were chosen through a delegate
system that put power in the hands of 16 regional vice presidents.
They make up the convention, said Camarata, now a driver for a
Detroit trucking company.
   ``When I went down there I walked into a total snake pit,'' he
said. ``They are just not open to any kind of opposition. They just
hated my guts.''
   Camarata was shouted down on the floor of the convention. Later
at an International Executive Board party, he was jumped and beaten
up. Camarata left the convention under the protection of hotel
security guards.
   At the Teamsters next convention, in 1981, TDU members nominated
Camarata for union president. ``I got about 10 votes,'' he said.

<HEAD>New ERA Drive Set</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Feminists and lawmakers launched a new drive
Thursday to add an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution,
vowing to introduce the measure as soon as the 101st Congress
convenes in January.
   ``My dream today is that 1989 will be the last time they swear
in a president of the United States under a constitution that does
not treat women as equals,'' Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., told
about 300 people at a Capitol rally sponsored by the National
Organization for Women.
   Schroeder and Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said they will
introduce the new ERA next year with the backing of the House
Democratic leadership and, according to Edwards, ``even some
Republicans who have seen the light.''
   Schroeder said petitions containing hundreds of thousands of
signatures, collected by NOW members across the country, would be
delivered to appropriate House delegations in order to build
advance support for the new ERA bill.
   NOW scheduled the rally for June 30 because the most recent
drive for the ERA ended on that day in 1982, when an insufficient
number of state legislatures had met the deadline for ratifying the
measure.
   Women wearing green T-shirts that said ``Put women in the
Constitution'' cheered as Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and a
string of House members exhorted them to keep ERA alive.
   ``Watch out, all of you. ERA is coming. All the signs are
here,'' said Edwards, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee
on civil and constitutional rights.
   Edwards cited the congressional override of President Reagan's
veto of a major civil rights bill earlier this year and the House
vote Wednesday in favor of a fair housing bill that bans
discrimination against families with children. He also cited the
``gender gap'' afflicting the Republican Party, and suggested it
stems from GOP opposition to the ERA.
   The ERA says that ``equality of rights under the law shall not
be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on
account of sex.'' Other sections of the brief amendment give
Congress the power to enforce it and say it shall take effect two
years after ratification.

<HEAD>U.S. Offers $500,000 Reward to Catch Killers of Defense Attache</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States offered a reward of up to
$500,000 Thursday for information leading to the apprehension and
punishment of the killers of Navy Capt. William Nordeen, the
American defense attache in Athens, Greece.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said it was the
largest sum offered since a 1984 law authorized rewards to catch
terrorists.
   ``Information received will be handled confidentially and the
identities of the informants will be protected,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
``The amount of the reward will be determined by the value of the
information received.''
   A Greek organization called November 17 has claimed
responsibility for planting a bomb that killed Nordeen as he drove
to work Tuesday. In an article published in a Greek newspaper the
group said it would attack more Americans until the U.S. military
presence in Greece ends.
   A team of agents from the FBI and State Department has gone to
Greece to aid authorities in the investigation.
   Five previous terrorist attacks against Americans have generated
reward offers, but no claimants have ever come forward, Mrs. Oakley
said.
   ``There's always a first time in a situation like this,'' she
said.
   ``Offering rewards is a well-established practical tool for
aiding in the investigation of criminal activities,'' the
spokeswoman said. ``The rewards also may have the effect of helping
to disrupt some terrorist activities, since those who are planning
terrorist attacks can never been sure who among them might take
advantage of the offer.''
   ``The rewards also show the U.S. government's resolve to combat
terrorism and to continue to work on this case,'' she added.
   The State Department offered rewards of up to $250,000 in the
case of the bombing of a Trans World Airlines plane over Greece in
1986, the hijacking of a TWA flight on which Navy diver Robert
Stethem was murdered in 1985, the hijacking of a Kuwaiti plane on
which two employees of the U.S. Agency for International
Development were killed and in the seizure of the Italian cruise
ship Achille Lauro. An American, Leon Klinghoffer, was killed in
the ship takeover.
   A $100,000 award was offered for information in the case of four
U.S. Marines and two civilians shot in El Salvador in June 1985.

   Military investigators today
examined debris of two jet crashes that killed an American pilot
and destroyed three U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter planes in one day.
   A newspaper report said cracks were found in the engine blades
of some F-16s and were the likely cause of the crash of one of the
jets in April.
   The accidents Wednesday brought to five the number of F-16
fighter jets that have crashed in West Germany in the past three
months.
   A leader in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government called
for the immediate grounding of F-16 fighter jets stationed in West
Germany.
   ``If the F-16, which has recently piled up a number of crashes,
has a technical fault, it must be temporarily grounded,'' said
Werner Hoyer, a military expert and member of the Free Democratic
Party.
   The Air Force said in a statement later that it had halted all
routine flight operations to prepare for a ``safety day'' on Friday
to ``review all flying, ground and weapons safety operations.''
   The statement made no mention of the F-16 crashes.
   Two of the jets collided in the air Wednesday, and a third
crashed and exploded in the Black Forest 90 minutes earlier.
   Tracy Burnett, a spokeswoman for the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing
at Hahn Air Base, said one pilot was killed after the F-16s
collided during a training maneuver near this small town about 35
miles west of Frankfurt.
   Burnett identified the dead pilot as Capt. Michael A. Crandall,
30. His hometown was not available.
   The pilot of the other aircraft ejected to safety before his
plane plunged into a field and exploded. He was identified as Capt.
Robert McCormack, 31, of Delmar, Calif.
   McCormack was being treated for minor back and neck injuries at
an Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden, she said.
   No one was injured in the crash in the Black Forest.
   Following crashes of F-16s in March and April, the West German
Defense Ministry asked that the single-engine jets be grounded.
However, U.S. Air Force European Commander Gen. William L. Kirk
said at the time the move would be premature before determining
what caused the crashes.
   In a report from its Washington bureau, the military's
unofficial Stars and Stripes newspaper said today the U.S. Air
Force had replaced the engines of 31 F-16 jets ``because of
potential cracks in high-speed engine blades.''
   It said blade cracks found in some General Electric F110 engines
that are used in some F-16s were ``the likely cause'' of an April
18 crash near Erzberg, West Germany.
   Citing an interview with General Electric Co. spokesman Bill
Schumann, the newspaper quoted him as saying the Erzberg crash was
caused by an engine problem, ``and, as far as I know, that engine
problem was believed to have been caused by one of these blade
cracks.''
   The newspaper said the Air Force had found cracks in several GE
F110 engines, and ``as a precaution, 23 engines were removed in
Europe and eight from planes in Japan and Korea.''
   Lt. Col. Ed Neunherz, spokesman for the U.S. Air Force European
headquarters at Ramstein Air Base, declined immediate comment on
the cracked blades or possible grounding of the F-16s following the
latest crashes.
   A U.S. Army OH58 observation helicopter crashed into Lake
Starnberg in Bavaria on June 14, critically injuring the pilot and
killing the co-pilot.
   On June 9, a U.S. Army helicopter crashed after hitting power
lines near a busy highway in Bavaria state, killing the three-man
crew.
   A British Chinook helicopter on May 6 hit a loading ramp with
its rear rotor at the Hanover air show, throwing debris over a wide
area and killing two people on board. Twelve people were injured on
the ground.
   On April 18, a U.S. Air Force F-16 crashed near an ammunition
depot and hospital south of Trier near the Luxembourg border. The
pilot was slightly injured when he ejected.
   On March 31, a U.S. Air Force F-16 crashed into the town of
Forst north of Karlsruhe, killing the pilot and a resident.
   The crash came one day after a French military Mirage jet
fighter crashed in southern Bavaria near a nuclear power plant.

   County and state fair time is coming up but
the hot, dry summer over wide areas of the nation may be drying up
farmers' hopes of displaying plump, prize-winning cattle, pigs,
squash and pumpkins.
   And with grain crops in jeopardy, 4-H members face rising prices
for feed for their would-be blue-ribbon heifers, pigs and lambs.
   Animal exhibitor registrations for the Michigan State Fair, Aug.
26-Sept. 5, are lagging behind last year. Farmers may be hesitant
about putting their animals through the rigors of hot-weather
transport, a fair official said.
   Watering helps the ``fooling-around garden'' that produced the
largest pumpkin and the tallest sunflower at last year's state
fair, but Joe Malburg Jr. says his potential prize vegetables still
are feeling the drought.
   Malburg's sunflower last year stood 12 feet 10 inches. If he has
an entry this year, he said, ``It could still be the largest. But
it might be five feet shorter than last year.''
   The drought creates problems for Michigan's 9- to 19-year-old
4-H Youth Program exhibitors, who entered 3,704 swine, 3,615 cattle
and 2,919 sheep in county fairs last year, said Ken Geuns, 4-H
livestock youth specialist at Michigan State University.
   Feed corn and hay prices are rising in anticipation of short
harvests. Out in drought-stunted hayfields, Geuns said, ``A lot of
people are harvesting whatever forage they can.''
   But many of the youths have no hayfields, he said. ``Where it's
going to affect the kids right now is in terms of buying feed. A
reasonably high percentage of the kids, their families are not
full-time farmers.''
   Geuns said about 200 head of cattle were entered in the recent
Michigan Youth All Breed Beef and Sheep Show at Ionia, down 50 from
last year.
   The show may have lost exhibitors to a competing show in
Maryland, he said, but ``I think some of it was due to the
weather.''
   Many youths may have to put off their fall or early winter
purchases of cattle to fatten for next year's exhibits, Geuns said.
   With a month before the Aug. 1 deadline for entering livestock
in the state fair, Joanne Schwedt of the fair's entries office said
registrations, particularly of heat-sensitive swine, seem to be
trailing last year's.
   Part of the problem is general, Schwedt said. ``It's no secret
farmers are not doing well. The fewer farmers, the fewer exhibits
there are.''
   But she said farmers who do want to enter probably are waiting
for a break in the heat.
   ``It's extremely expensive to bring your animals down to the
state fair to show them. In these weather conditions, they just
won't do it,'' she said. ``And the vegetables will be hurt. I don't
think you will see a lot of big pumpkins and so on.''
   Malburg raised his sunflowers and his wife, Pam, raised last
year's largest pumpkin, 182 pounds, on a one-acre plot on the
180-acre farm of Joe's parents in Romeo.
   Their plot with potential prize pumpkin plants, squash and
Indian and other decorative corn varieties gets some special
treatment, said Malburg's mother, Clara. ``We have it right by our
house here. We've been keeping it going with the sprinkler from the
house.''
   But that is no substitute for a wet summer, she said.
   ``It's so windy and dry and hot that even if you irrigate, the
next morning it's gone.''

   A steelworker harangued government leaders
Thursday for their failure to deal with ecological problems he said
have reached ``the level of a Chernobyl-like catastrophe.''
   Veniamin A. Yarin, a middle-aged mill operator at a huge steel
mill in the Ural Mountains, was one of several delegates to the
nationwide Communist Party conference who raised the problem of the
environment either at the rostrum or in written suggestions to the
forum.
   But Yarin's speech hit home particularly hard because he comes
from the city of Nizhny Tagil, 10,000 of its 403,000 inhabitants
took to the streets earlier this year to protest pollution caused
by two 45-year-old coke-burning furnaces at a steel mill.
   Soviet media accounts in April quoted a crying woman at the
demonstration demanding, ``Who will answer for 54 stillborn
children in 1987?''
   Yarin dramatized his plea for urgent action by telling the 5,000
delegates that an old Bolshevik had told him to go before this
week's conference and sing a line from a popular song where pigeons
fly over town roofs.
   ``At our works, we've long had no pigeons. We don't even have
crows,'' Yarin said. ``We look up at the sky and we are horrified.''
   But city inhabitants were just as shocked when they studied the
text of a national government resolution for action to clean the
air in their town.
   ``Our hair stood on end at how little action was going to be
taken,'' he said.
   Yarin said he believed there were 50 to 100 cities in the Soviet
Union where ecological damage had become a serious health threat.
He demanded an immediate government resolution on a group of these
cities and funds to resolve their problems within two years.
   ``I'm not afraid to say that this problem has reached the level
of a Chernobyl-like catastrophe,'' Yanin said, referring to the
explosion and fire at a Ukrainian nuclear plant on April 27, 1986,
that led to at least 31 deaths.
   A $14 billion program was launched to clean up the contamination
caused by the accident and to rehouse an estimated 135,000 people
who were evacuated.
   Environmental problems ``have a huge social resonance,'' Yanin
said. ``They should be discussed at this conference.''
   Also Thursday, the Communist Party chief of the Central Asian
republic of Uzbekistan addressed one of the nation's most serious
ecological catastrophes, the drop in the water level of a vast
inland sea, the Aral Sea.
   A newspaper account in 1983 said excessive tapping of the sea
for irrigation in Central Asia had halved its depth in a decade and
caused its shoreline to recede 40 miles in just a few years.
   That account was ahead of its time in sounding the alarm on
ecological problems, which in the past two years have received
increasing attention in the media and from intellectuals.
   In 1986, an active campaign by well-known writers led the ruling
Politburo to overturn a potentially catastrophic decision to
reverse the flow of several northward-flowing rivers to the arid
south for irrigation.
   But the media still are full of ecological horror stories like
the one from Nizhny Tagil. In December, the Communist Party daily
newspaper Pravda quoted intellectuals in the Urals city of Ufa as
saying their city was no longer fit for human habitation because of
chemical pollution.
   All three Baltic republics have brought written resolutions to
the conference about the urgent need to deal with ecological damage
in their areas.

<HEAD>Students, Soldiers Clash In East Jerusalem; Seven Schools Closed</HEAD>

   Arab students threw stones and smashed
windshields during protests in Jerusalem on Thursday, and
authorities shut down seven Palestinian schools.
   A 17-year-old Arab was shot and wounded in a clash with soldiers
during a funeral in the occupied West Bank.
   An Arab teen-ager shot by soldiers two weeks ago died in a West
Bank hospital, bringing to 213 the number of Palestinians killed
since the ``intefadeh,'' or uprising, began Dec. 8. Four Israelis
also have been killed.
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told reporters that
Israel was ``closer to the end'' of the uprising against the
21-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Dozens of high school girls staged rock-throwing protests in
several parts of Arab east Jerusalem, and police responded with
tear gas, Israel radio reported. It said several car windshields
were smashed and two girls were arrested.
   Two male students were arrested after throwing stones at police
from a high school in the walled Old City, the radio said. It said
police closed the Dar El Aytam School.
   In the West Bank, the army closed six schools following violent
protests in the past few days against the Israeli occupation, said
Olivier Rafowicz, spokesman for the military government in the West
Bank.
   Rafowicz said Thursday's closures brought to 38 the number of
schools shut since June 6 when classes on the West Bank resumed
after a four-month suspension that began in February.
   ``If the disturbances are not going to be stopped, we will be
forced to close all the schools and we will not allow students to
take final exams,'' Rafowicz said.
   The army shut down more than 1,000 schools in the West Bank on
Feb. 2. Israeli officials had hoped that the reopening of schools
in the West Bank would help restore normal life in the area.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus on Thursday, soldiers shot a
17-year-old in the left leg, officials at Al Ittihad Hospital said.
   Soldiers opened fire when youths, some wearing masks, threw
stones and tried to incite a riot among people taking part in a
funeral of a heart-attack victim, an army spokesman said. One youth
was wounded and several were arrested, he said.
   The Palestinian youth who died Thursday, Arafat Awad Hanani, was
shot by soldiers June 6 in the village of Beit Furik near Nablus.
Villagers began throwing stones after soldiers blew up an Arab home.
   Shamir talked to reporters after delivering a speech to the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He said the army
reported a drop in the past few days in violent incidents in the
West Bank and Gaza.
   Asked if the uprising was at an end, Shamir replied: ``I can't
determine that. There is no doubt that we are getting closer to the
end.''
   Shamir told the American group that the uprising wasn't about
land at all.
   ``The experience of the last few months should have taught all
that the problem is not of territories, but of Arab refusal to
recognize the legitimacy and permanence of the state of Israel,''
he said.
   Shamir repeated he saw no reason to negotiate with the PLO
``because they oppose peace with Israel.''
   A magistrate's court sentenced four Israeli leftists to
six-month jail terms for violating a law that forbids contact with
the PLO. They were the first Israelis sentenced under the 1986 law.
   The four were convicted June 2 in the court in Ramle, near Tel
Aviv, for violating the law by meeting with 15 PLO members in
Costinesti, Romania, in November 1986. The jails terms were
postponed until Aug. 4 to allow an appeal.
   Also Thursday, a trial opened in a military court for 19
Palestinians accused of taking part in a clash with hikers from a
Jewish settlement. A 15-year-old Israeli girl was killed in the
April 6 clash in the West Bank village of Beita.
   The incident caused a furor among Israelis after Jewish settlers
said the villagers shot the girl, Tirza Porat. But an army
investigation later determined she was accidentally shot by one of
the guards accompanying the hikers.
   Among the charges against the Arab defendants are
stone-throwing, causing serious bodily harm, making threats, and
trying to seize and conceal the weapons of the two guards.

<HEAD>Gunmen Attack Leftist University President for Second Time in
Seven Months</HEAD>

   Gunmen with a grenade launcher and
automatic rifles attacked a leftist university president Thursday,
the second attempt against him in seven months, police said. Three
bodyguards were killed.
   The educator, five aides and a pedestrian were wounded, but none
seriously, police said.
   The ambush occurred as Nemesio Prudente and his party approached
the campus of the government-run Polytechnic University of the
Philippines.
   No group claimed responsibility. The first attack, in November,
was blamed on right-wing extremists.
   ``This second attempt on the life of Dr. Prudente is brutal,
brazen and contemptible,'' President Corazon Aquino said in a
statement read by spokesman Teodoro Benigno. She ordered a ``speedy
solution.''
   Shortly before the attack, three suspected communist urban
guerrillas shot and killed a policeman in the Manila suburb of
Malabon.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate's defense committee,
criticized police for failing to maintain order in the capital,
which has been rocked in recent years by killings blamed on
left-wing and right-wing extremists.
   ``It seems easy for anybody to shoot and kill anybody in this
country,'' Maceda said.
   Police said Prudente and his aides were ambushed as they
approached the university campus at 8:45 a.m. The group was
traveling in a van followed by a security car.
   Four gunmen waited for Prudente's party to pass under a concrete
bridge and then opened fire with grenades and automatic rifles,
police said. Two others acted as lookouts, police said.
   Prudente suffered shrapnel wounds in the left arm and both legs,
police said.
   The military and police have accused Prudente, an outspoken
human rights activist, of using the school to shelter communist
urban guerrillas. Prudente denied the charge.
   On Nov. 11, suspected rightwing extremists sprayed his car with
bullets, wounding the educator and killing a university lawyer.
   No arrests have been made in that attack. But human rights
groups blamed right-wing death squads for the first ambush, which
occurred a week after soldiers and policemen chanted ``Kill
Prudente!' during a funeral for a police captain and three other
people killed by communist assassins.

<HEAD>Begin's Son, Netanyahu Chosen at American-Style Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin
and former U.N. ambassador Benjamin Netanyahu were among the
parliamentary candidates chosen Thursday by the main faction in the
right-wing Likud bloc.
   The political newcomers in the Herut Party election won more
votes than most of the veterans in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
Cabinet, including Industry Minister Ariel Sharon and Deputy
Premier David Levy.
   Herut is the senior partner of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc,
which shares power in a shaky alliance with the left-leaning Labor
party. Also in the Likud is the Liberal Party.
   Herut was founded by Begin as an outgrowth of his Etzel
underground militia that fought the British rulers in Palestine in
the 1940s.
   The results of the secret balloting by 2,092 central committee
members do not determine the place any of the 35 candidates will
hold on the party list for the November election.
   The nominees will be ranked July 7, with Shamir assured the top
spot. Only about 30 of the nominees are likely to be elected.
   But the showings made by Netanyahu and Benjamin Begin meant they
were likely to be ranked high. They also boosted Shamir's standing
in his fractious party while dealing a blow to his rival, Sharon.
   During the convention at a country club in Herzliya, north of
Tel Aviv, many of the 104 candidates used American-style gimmicks
to attract the attention of the Central Committee members.
Candidates showered delegates with buttons, stickers, balloons,
wine and perfume _ campaign methods new to Israel.
   It also was an attempt to keep up with the Labor party, whose
convention earlier this month was marked by carnival-style antics.
   Netanyahu and Begin, among 14 new faces on the party's list, are
expected to enhance Likud's chances of defeating the Labor party,
which elected a slate of young, new candidates earlier this month.
   Shamir, pleased by the results, told reporters: ``We have an
excellent list which will also give the public incentive to vote
for us.''
   Pollsters predict a close race between the two parties, and the
latest survey shows Labor with a slight edge of Likud.
   Begin, a 44-year-old geologist, is the first offspring of an
Israeli prime minister to enter politics successfully.
   Begin said his victory showed party members were repaying his
father ``with extraordinary love.''
   His father, a recluse since he resigned in 1983, issued a
statement broadcast on Israel army radio, saying he was happy with
his son's victory.
   The younger Begin became active in the party shortly after his
father resigned, but refrained from declaring himself a legislative
candidate until just before the convention.
   Netanyahu, 39, and son of a Cornell University professor, spent
most of his teen-age years in the United States. He went to high
school in Philadelphia and studied business administration at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   He made Arab terrorism a chief target of his speeches in his
four years as U.N. ambassador. He stepped down this year to run for
parliament.
   ``It is very flattering to see this kind of support,'' a beaming
Netanyahu said on Israel television.
   Netanyahu won the highest number of votes with 1,408.
Iranian-born Moshe Katsav, a labor minister in Shamir's Cabinet,
was second with 1,324, while Begin finished third with 1,233.
Sharon came in fifth; Levy seventh.
   In the balloting, committee members had to cast votes for 21 of
the 104 candidates. The top 35 made the slate, but only about 30
have a realistic chance of being elected to parliament.
   Under Israel's electoral system, voters choose a party, not
individual candidates. The party is apportioned seats in the
120-member parliament according to the number of votes it gets.

<HEAD>Government Renews Amnesty Offer to Tamils</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has renewed its offer
of general amnesty for Tamil rebels if the dominant militia agrees
to surrender its weapons and stop fighting for a separate homeland,
a communique said Thursday.
   The government also promised to free all Tamil political
prisoners in jails and military detention camps. More than 600
Tamils are believed still in custody.
   In addition, it pledged to complete arrangements for an election
for a new regional council in Tamil-dominated areas by the end of
July. The council would give Tamils a greater voice in their own
affairs.
   According to reports, the dominant rebel group, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, is close to an agreement with India to end
the 5-year-old insurgency for a separate homeland in north and east
Sri Lanka.
   ``If the Tamil militants would lay down arms and support the
Indo-Sri Lankan agreement, the detenus will be released and all
Tamil militant groups would be granted general amnesty and would be
allowed to return to the mainstream of the democratic process,''
said the statement issued by the Presidential Secretariat.
   The statement appeared aimed at assuring the Tigers that the
terms of the peace accord would be carried out despite the Tigers'
intransigence.
   The peace accord, brokered by India, was signed July 29, 1987,
by President Junius R. Jayewardene and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi. It included amnesty for the guerrillas and a pledge to
release all prisoners.
   The Tigers at first accepted the accord, but later resumed
fighting. The Sri Lankan government withdrew the amnesty promise,
and India moved an estimated 50,000 troops to the island to put
down the insurgency.
   Talks between the Tigers and members of the Indian Research and
Analysis Wing, an intelligence branch of the Indian government,
have been under way in recent weeks in southern India.
   The top Indian diplomat in Sri Lanka, High Commissioner J.N.
Dixit, was called to New Delhi last weekend for talks with Gandhi
on the negotiations with the Tigers. Dixit returned to Colombo on
Wednesday and briefed Jayewardene, according to officials at the
Indian High Commission, or embassy.
   The statement issued by the government Thursday said that Gandhi
informed Jayewardene that the Tigers militia ``has given
indications of their williness to lay down their arms and cooperate
in the implementation of the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement.''
   It gave no clues on when a final deal with the Tigers might be
reached.
   Tamils are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million population. They claim they are discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the government.
   Militant Tamils began fighting for an independent homeland in
July 1983. Authorities have said at least 8,000 people have died.
   India became involved because it is the dominant power in South
Asia and its own 60 million ethnic Tamils are sympathetic to their
Sri Lankan brethren.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Report Documents Destroyed in Pentagon Bribery Probe</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top 12 grafs new with Pentagon spokesman rejecting proposals
to freeze award of new contracts. Picks up 6th graf pvs, Hudson in
his court brief. Removes last 3 grafs pvs to shorten.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pentagon spokesman today rejected
congressional proposals to freeze the award of new contracts, and
said drastic action could raise costs, cause layoffs and detract
from the readiness of the armed forces.
   The spokesman, Fred Hoffman, said he was unaware whether any
documents involved in the Pentagon bribery probe had been destroyed
in the Defense Department, but that the department was looking into
such allegations.
   People implicated in the investigation have destroyed documents
on at least two occasions in the past two weeks, according to
prosecutors who say making key information public would trigger a
coverup by ``major felons.''
   ``In the short time since the execution of the search warrants
became public (June 14), the government has already become aware of
several incidents of destruction of documents related to this
case,'' U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson, who is coordinating the probe,
said in a court brief released Wednesday.
   In an affidavit, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica said
prosecutors have learned of two incidents of document destruction.
   On Capitol Hill, members of Congress called on Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci to make a ``dramatic move'' such as halting new
Pentagon contracts to win back public credibility in the wake of
the bribery probe.
   ``We're fighting a credibility problem here and it seems as
though tough action is required,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio.
   ``We would be glad to discuss with the Congress the question of
freezing awards of new contracts while the Justice Department is
investigating allegations of procurement fraud,'' said Hoffman.
   ``But at this point we feel it would be imprudent to apply such
a freeze or moratorium,'' he told reporters at a briefing.
   ``The innocent would suffer as well as the guilty. And such a
freeze would be equivalent of debarment without due process. You
may be sure that we will take precautions in any awards.''
   ``Our contracts have adequate clauses which can be brought into
play to repen them and take other action to protect the public
interest,'' he said.
   ``However, we wonder whether the members of Congress calling for
a freeze or a moratorium have thought through the possible
consequences, such as higher program costs, production line
shutdowns, widespread plant lay-offs and damage to the readiness of
our forces,'' he said.
   Hudson, in his court brief, discussed the possibility of further
document destruction in arguing against release of sealed court
documents.
   ``Revealing the precise contours of the government's intentions
and current information may well encourage document destruction and
other acts'' which ``would have the practical effect of putting
major felons beyond the reach of justice,'' said Hudson, the U.S.
attorney in Alexandria, Va.
   Newsday Inc. is asking U.S. District Judge Edward Korman in
Brooklyn, N.Y., to lift the seal on several search warrants and
supporting affidavits in the probe: for Unisys Corp.'s plant in
Great Neck, N.Y.; Charles Gardner, a defense consultant to Unisys
and former Unisys vice president; Dennis Mitchell, an employee at
the Great Neck Unisys plant; and the Hazeltine Corp. in Greenlawn.
   Newsday said the seals should be lifted because the
investigation has been extensively reported in the media, but
Hudson said previous news stories haven't disclosed significant
portions of the material, ``particularly the wiretap information.''
   Hudson also said disclosing the affidavit in support of a search
warrant at Hazeltine would reveal the identity of a confidential
source cooperating in the investigation.
   Hudson did not provide any details on who destroyed what types
of documents, how they were destroyed or how they might have been
related to the probe of alleged bribes to Pentagon personnel in
exchange for confidential information funneled to consultants and
defense contractors.
   In Washington, the Pentagon's top purchasing official, Robert B.
Costello, testified before Congress and said he would talk with
Carlucci today about a suggestion to halt Pentagon contracts.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Carlucci should order ``absolutely
no contracts signed for 60 days (or) six weeks'' with companies
involved in the criminal investigation.
   ``Carlucci could make a dramatic move,'' Aspin told Costello,
the undersecretary of defense for acquisition policy.
   ``We're going to write some tough language into these contracts
so that we can recoup some of this stuff and make sure that all
contracts that are let, from here on out,'' are legal, said Aspin.
   Aspin noted that contractors and weapons involved in the
investigation include McDonnell-Douglas and the F-A-18, the
top-line Navy fighter. After the two-year investigation became
public, the Pentagon went ahead with contract awards for the plane,
Aspin said.
   On June 23, the Pentagon announced it was granting
McDonnell-Douglas a $960 million contract for F-A-18 work, Aspin
noted.
   ``It's clear the Pentagon hasn't come up with any plan for
dealing with contractors under a cloud,'' he said.
   Costello, during a day-long meeting of the House Armed Services
Committee, repeatedly defended the Defense Department procurement
policies of the Reagan administration.
   Congress can enact new laws and the Pentagon can pass new
regulations, but there is no way to ensure against cheating,
Costello said.
   Costello shied away from his May 5 proposal last month to give
Defense Department officials authority to prevent searches of
contractors' facilities by fraud investigators. Costello said he
wouldn't write the same memo he had written May 5.
   Rep. J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., told Costello his proposal ``is not
appropriate. ... It doesn't look good; it doesn't smell good.''
   Costello declined to agree it was inappropriate, but added that
he wouldn't write it now. ``I can change my mind,'' he said.

   The $25 million Richard M. Nixon
Presidential Library has passed muster with local officials and is
scheduled to open in early 1990.
   ``I have traveled a long road from my youth in Yorba Linda, and
this project has traveled a long road back,'' Nixon said in a
letter read Wednesday by Mayor Roland E. Bigonger following a
unanimous vote by the planning commission approving the final
design.
   ``Now that we have seen the kind of project it will be, we
cannot imagine it any other way, or in any other place,'' Nixon
wrote.
   The two-story library will sit on a six-acre site adjacent to
the wood-frame house where Nixon was born 75 years ago. The complex
will include a museum, offices, a theater, an exhibit room and
air-conditioned facilities for document storage. Groundbreaking is
planned Nov. 18.
   ``This is a very important thing as far as Yorba Linda is
concerned, and as concerns the history of the United States,'' said
city Planning Commissioner Ronald Watroba.
   A theme garden will feature deep-red Pat Nixon roses, named
after the former first lady, as well as an herb and iris garden.
   No official documents from the 37th's president six years in
office will be housed at the library because the U.S. Congress
ordered those papers retained in the National Archives in
Washington, D.C. The library will feature his vice presidential
papers, personal papers since leaving office, manuscripts for his
six books and personal White House diaries.

   It's time for Americans to begin commemorating
the birth of President John F. Kennedy, rather than his
assassination, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy writes in the Sunday edition
of Parade magazine.
   ``The shock of that tragic moment in Dallas is still vivid in
people's minds ... and it is easy to understand the natural desire
of many Americans to honor Jack on that day,'' his brother wrote.
   ``But the Nov. 22 anniversary, with its traumatic pictures and
TV replays, is always a depressing time for our family.''
   Instead, he suggests Americans remember the late president on
May 29, his birthday.
   Kennedy also said his brother's idealism remains alive around
the world.
   ``Few things move me more deeply than to visit a hut in a
distant, poverty-stricken land and come upon his picture on the
wall,'' he wrote. ``In the brief time Jack had, he touched our
hearts with fire, and the glow from that fire still lights the
world.''

   Prince and Princess Michael of Kent celebrated
their anniversary Thursday aboard the Orient Express on its
inaugural run to Vienna, where they married 10 years ago.
   Some 100 passengers, who paid $1,720 each to join the couple,
were seen off by a 1930s-style band at Victoria Station. When the
train stops at Innsbruck and Salzburg, it will be greeted by bands
provided by the Austrian government.
   The prince and princess were guests of James Sherwood, president
of Sea Containers which owns the train that normally runs between
London and Venice. ``It's a fun journey _ pure nostalgia,'' he said.
   Sherwood said $344 of each ticket will go to a hospice for the
terminally ill.
   The prince, a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, and princess
will stay at the Schwarzenberg Palace in Vienna, where they spent
the first part of their honeymoon. On Monday, they will travel to
Budapest to attend a memorial service for the princess's mother who
died earlier this year.

   Richard Dysart has his own opinion about what
will happen to his stuffy ``L.A. Law'' character, senior partner
Leland McKenzie, who was left flirting with a May-September romance
when the TV show's latest season ended.
   ``Leland will go with it,'' he says. ``Oh sure. Just to see
where it goes.''
   But he admits he really doesn't know. ``I asked (executive
producer) Steven (Bochco). He said, `Do you really want to know?' I
said no.''
   Dysart was in Atlanta this week as a surprise guest speaker at
the convention of the American Association of Law Librarians. He
commented in an interview with The Atlanta Constitution.
   The ``L.A. Law'' season was cut short by the Writers Guild of

<HEAD>Nader Criticizes Auto Club</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader took the giant
American Automobile Association to task Thursday for its alleged
laxity in defending consumer interests.
   The national association of auto clubs performs a wide variety
of services for its nearly 30 million members, Nader said. But that
``contrasts with its abdication of the consumer cause in other
quite consequential fronts,'' he said.
   Nader's charges came in a 10-page letter addressed to AAA
President James B. Creal.
   He was critical of the club for generally opposing government
regulations, for example, pointing to club statements that safety
and emissions rules should not be imposed without verifiable
evidence of their need and value.
   Nader asserted that the AAA has been weak in its efforts to
encourage more recalls and said the organization has too quickly
accepted as adequate industry efforts to improve fuel efficiency.
   And he was critical of club support of higher speed limits,
limited member involvement, its cautious position on mass transit
and club activities in insurance.
   Asked about the letter, J. Kay Aldous, a vice president of the
Falls Church, Va.-based AAA, said: ``We don't plan to reapond other
than to say that Ralph Nader is like a 17-year locust. He emerged
July 1, 1971, to make the same irresponsible charges.''

   American followers of rebel Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre say they are sticking with his movement rejecting Roman
Catholic reforms despite his break with the official church.
   His consecration of four bishops in Switzerland on Thursday in
defiance of Rome brings his automatic excommunication and marks the
first split in the church in 118 years.
   ``I don't know of a single priest or seminarian who is leaving
because of this so-called excommunication,'' said the Rev. Charles
Ward of St. Louis, administrator of the movement's U.S. district.
   ``We're holding fast to the faith, which is what a true Catholic
does. We know he (Lefebvre) is teaching the truth.''
   Other American adherents of the Lefebvre revolt, organized
internationally as the Priestly Society of St. Pius X, expressed
the same determination.
   ``There's no dissenion in our ranks,'' said Jason Huvar of
Victoria, Texas, one of about 15 seminarians refurbishing new
quarters for their St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary near Winona, Minn.
   ``It's a dire situation,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``But what is being done had to be done.
   ``It's a matter of life and death for the faith, of keeping
traditional priests. You can't have them without bishops to ordain
them.''
   Lefebvre, 82, under suspension since 1976 for condemning key
reforms of the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council, has continued to
ordain priests and celebrate other sacraments.
   But the further step of consecrating new bishops to perpetuate
his revolt beyond his lifetime formalizes the breach with Rome,
marking failure of recent Vatican negotiations for reconciliation.
   ``He is taking measures to insure continuation of the Catholic
priesthood, the traditional Mass and survival of the church,'' said
Timothy McDonnell, a seminarian from Manitowoc, Wis.
   He said other U.S. priests and bishops ``are no longer teaching
the faith,'' and Lefebvre is consecrating new bishops ``to maintain
the faith. Most of us have been openly for it.''
   He and others followers echoed charges by Lefebvre that Rome's
embrace of religious liberty, ecumenical relations with other
churches and the vernacular liturgy violated Catholic tradition and
were ``democratizing'' it.
   McDonnell said the changes parallel those of 16th-century
Protestant reformers Martin Luther, John Calvin and Thomas Cranmer.
   Other than Ward, top officers of the Lefebvre's U.S. movement
were in Switzerland for the consecrations, including the movement's
superior, the Rev. Francois Laisney of St. Louis, and its seminary
rector, the Rev. Richard Richardson.
   Ward compared Lefebvre's excommunication to the fourth-century
papal excommunication of Alexandrian Bishop Athanasius, later made
a saint. Lefebvre, Ward said, ``can't truly be ecommunicated. He
will be by the letter of the law, but not by the spirit of the
law.''
   The U.S. wing of the Lefebvre movement has 29 priests, about 95
centers across the country for worship in the traditional
Tridentine Latin Mass, an estimated l0,000 lay participants, and
various substantial properties.
   Those listed include St. Vincent's Church in Kansas City, Mo.;
Immaculate Conception Church and a grammar school at Post Falls,
Idaho; Queen of Angels Church and printing press for its magazine,
Angelus, at Dickinson, Texas; and a grammar school, high school and
two-year college at St. Marys, Kan.
   Internationally, the movement has 220 priests and an estimated
100,000 followers, with seminaries in Switzerland, Argentina,
Australia, Germany and France, enrolling about 250 seminarians.
Some Vatican officials have said the movement has as many as a
half-million followers.
   Kenneth Novak of Downers Grove, Ill., one of about 40
seminarians in this country, said the society is ``the only
institution organized to perpetuate the faith. Rome is no longer
defending the faith and tradition.''
   He said most people in the Lefebvre movement ``had already made
up their minds beforehand'' and would stick with him despite
excommunication.
   ``If any leave, it will be the weaker types, the fringe,'' he
said.
   ``It's a bad thing that we're being condemned for being what
Catholics should be,'' said Huvar. ``Thirty years ago, we'd be
considered good. Now we're considered schismatics, outcasts and
rebels.''

<HEAD>Groups Urge Lyng To Crack Down on Chicken Contamination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group said Thursday it was urging
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng to rewrite regulations that
it contends allow millions of chickens contaminated with bacteria
to reach American homes.
   Officials at the Washington-based Community Nutrition Institute,
along with the Government Accountability Project, a group that
provides legal support for government whistleblowers, said they had
written a letter to Lyng asking him to rescind the current
regulations that allow processors to wash poultry.
   ``No amount of washing can help poultry once bacteria become
firmly attached,'' said Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of
Community Nutrition Institute.
   Instead, the groups want Lyng to impose new regulations that
would require poultry processors to cut away contamination portions
or to throw away the whole chicken if the body cavity is
contaminated.
   However, both Leonard and Tom Devine of the accountability
project said properly cooked chicken is safe to eat. They suggested
that consumers thoroughly clean kitchen surfaces that the raw
chicken has touched.
   The Agriculture Department had no immediate response to the
letter, although it has in the past defended its inspection
procedures.
   A spokesman for the broiler industry, Steven Pretanik, said
poultry producers make every effort to reduce chicken
contamination, but said it is impossible to produce a chicken that
is bacteria-free.
   ``Any raw food product, whether it's of animal or plant origin,
naturally has bacteria present,'' said Pretanik, director of
science and technology for the National Broiler Council. ``That's
one of the reasons we cook food _ to destroy the bacteria.''
   The exact amount of bacterial contamination in poultry is
unclear. However, estimates have ranged from 35 percent to 60
percent nationally. Salmonella and other organisms can be spread
when slaughtered birds are put through eviscerating machines and
contents of the birds' intestines are spilled.

   The Friar's Club elected its first female
members Thursday, none of whom should need membership cards to be
recognized at the door.
   Barbara Sinatra, Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, Eydie Gorme,
Barbra Streisand, Elizabeth Taylor, Dinah Shore, Phyllis Diller and
Martha Raye all were elected to honorary membership after the
club's board of governors changed its constitution to allow female
members.
   Liza Minnelli, who had applied for regular membership, was
approved, according to Friar's spokesman Al Rylander.
   The 84-year-old club's decision to admit women followed a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that upheld a New York City
anti-discrimination law. The law prohibits private clubs from
banning women.
   The California Friar's Club, in Beverly Hills, voted last year
to admit women. A member of the California club, Los Angeles
attorney Gloria Allred, was admitted to the New York club for lunch
last week following the court's ruling.
   The Friar's Club has more than 1,300 members in New York, most
of them active in the performing arts. Frank Sinatra is its top
officer, the abbot.

   Iraq said its warplanes bombed Iran's
biggest gas production plant and attacked an offshore oil field
today, and it claimed major victories in the northern and central
sectors of the war front.
   State-run Baghdad Radio interrupted programming to announce that
Iraqi troops, backed by tanks and helicopter gunships, recaptured
four ``strategic'' border heights along the Shehabi ridge, in the
central sector of the 733-mile front.
   ``The enemy is collapsing,'' Baghdad Radio declared. ``The four
heights were purged of the filthy enemy.''
   Earlier, Baghdad Radio reported that the northern Mawat basin,
in the Kurdistan mountains, was ``liberated'' after fierce battles
with the Iranians.
   It said the Iraqi flag was hoisted on 24 strategic heights
overlooking the town of Mawat town at 2:45 p.m. It said two border
outposts occupied by the Iranians also were seized.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the Iraqis launched the
offensive at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday. There was no immediate reaction
from Tehran.
   The Iraqis have been inching into Iranian-held territory in
northern Sulaimaniyeh province for several weeks. But they have not
totally dislodged their enemy from the strategic mountain region,
inhabited mainly by pro-Iranian Kurds who are fighting the Iraqi
government for autonomy.
   Earlier, the official Iraqi News Agency said its aircraft bombed
the gas plant on Sheik Sho'eyb Island in the southern Persian Gulf
and the Cyrus oil field in the northern gulf.
   It said all the planes returned safely to their bases.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iraqi jets
bombed ``an industrial-labor complex'' on its southern gulf coast,
killing or wounding an unspecified number of workers and causing
some damage.
   The Iranians also claimed their air force fighters shot down an
Iraqi warplane over the gulf at 8.29 a.m., 30 minutes before the
Iraqis said their fighter-bombers hit Sheik Sho'yeb.
   The Iranian news agency, also monitored in Nicosia, said a
second Iraqi jet was shot down over western Iran by anti-aircraft
fire.
   The Iraqi News Agency quoted a military communique as saying
``large numbers'' of Iraqi warplanes were involved in the two gulf
raids and left their targets ``engulfed with fire and smoke'' after
penetrating Iranian air defenses.
   ``The Iranian regime today received a strong blow which will
have an extreme effect on its economy and oil resources,'' the
communique said.
   The raids came several days after Iraqi forces drove the
Iranians out of their last major bridgehead in southern Iraq, the
Majnoon islands in the oil-rich Howeizah marshes.
   The Iraqis recaptured the southern Faw Peninsula on April 18,
two years after the Iranians had seized it and a month later drove
them from a position east of the port city of Basra.
   These battlefield defeats dramatically swung the military
balance in the nearly 8-year-old war in Iraq's favor after years of
Iraq being on the defensive.
   The military setbacks have badly jolted Tehran. Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi said today when he was re-elected by Parliament that
Iran faces ``a historic confrontation'' with its enemies and must
``prepare for an all-out struggle against them.''
   The Iraqi communique declared: ``The Iranian regime must realize
that after the successive victories of the Iraqi army and air force
that it has to accept peace and nothing but peace.''
   The Iraqi air force's last major raids against Iranian oil
installations were June 23, when 10 targets in the southwestern
Ahwaz, Bibi Hakimah and Sarran oil fields were bombed.

   Edwin Ortiz says he felt compelled to lend a
hand when a woman rushed up and asked him to help rescue a man who
had fallen from a subway platform and was lying unconscious on the
track.
   ``I just reacted ... more so because as the woman came running
up she looked directly in my face. I just did it,'' the unemployed
New York City man said Thursday after the Carnegie Hero Fund
Commission honored him and 19 other people for risking their lives
to rescue someone.
   Ortiz, 31, said he and several friends were waiting for a subway
last Sept. 4 when about 30 feet away Alex Cumba, 23, apparently had
a seizure and tumbled onto the track.
   As Ortiz and another stranger struggled to lift the 200-pound
Cumba to people on the platform, someone yelled that a train was
coming.
   ``Myself and the other gentleman ... tossed him under the
platform'' in an opening roughly three 3 feet by 3 feet and crawled
in with him, Ortiz said.
   ``It was pretty easy while he was unconscious. When the train
stopped, he regained consciousness and didn't know what was going
on. He was trying to grab for the underside of the subway,'' he
said.
   The commission did not identify the other rescuer, and spokesman
Jim Rethi declined to give details, citing a policy of
confidentiality.
   The organization, founded by industrialist Andrew Carnegie, also
honored the heroism of a 34-year-old man who died of burns after
saving his 4-year-old daughter from a burning cabin in Canada.
   Maxwell Machmer was the only one of the latest Carnegie Medal
recipients who died from injuries received while helping others.
His daughter was hospitalized five months for burns; Machmer died
the day after the Aug. 5, 1986, rescue, before help arrived.
   Each recipient received $2,500 along with the Carnegie Medal
from the commission. The awards bring to 7,238 the number of people
who have received the award since the fund's inception in 1904.
   The commission described the other rescues as follows:
   _ James M. Davidson III, 18, of Curlew, Wash., dived into the
Kettle River on April 28, 1987, and rescued Pauline Demoskoff, 60,
after an auto accident.
   _ Ollie J. Hightower, 39, and Samuel J. Ranallo Jr., 31, both of
Pittsburgh, jumped onto the hood of a burning car, kicked a hole in
the windshield, and pulled out Glenn F. Iacono, 29.
   _ Edward J. McDonald, 53, of Mar Lin, Pa., pulled Albert A.
Akulauckas, 80, from his car as gasoline burned behind the vehicle
after a collision with service station pumps July 15.
   _ Joseph P. Jackson, 13, of Arvonia, Va., pulled his mother from
the driver's seat through the passenger window of their car after
it fell from a bridge into Raldolph Creek June 26, 1987. Jackson
took his mother to the bank, returned to the submerged vehicle,
cleared a path through cargo and pulled out 9-year-old William D.
Flint.
   _ Christopher Strickland, 17, of Charleston, S.C., and Steven
Ray, 16, of Johns Island, S.C., swam 200 feet into the Atlantic
Ocean Aug. 13 to reach Jerry C. Holloway, 34, who was unconscious,
and his 11-year-old daughter Shannon. Strickland swam against a
seaward current with Shannon on his shoulders, handing her off to
others when he developed cramps. Ray towed Holloway to shore, but
the man could not be revived.
   _ Passer-by James H. Newby, 45, of Louisville, Tenn., twice
entered a burning mobile home, rescuing Sarah L. Cunningham, 17,
and Timothy R. Cunningham, 10. All three recovered from burns.
   _ Police Officer Russell S. Wilde, 21, and Christopher J.
Laurent, 22, both of Cranford, N.J., and Ben V. Mirto, 23, of
Northford, Conn., swam 300 feet into the Atlantic Ocean to help
save Amy Meissner, 11, and her sister Bonnie, 18, who were pulled
out by an undertow at Skip Bottom, N.J., on June 25, 1987.
   _ James W. Potter, 31, a farmer from Oneonta, N.Y., and Davis B.
Conley of Otega, N.Y., pulled Robert M. Wilday, 58, from his
burning tractor-trailer Aug. 2.
   _ John R. Boyes Jr., 39, a teacher from Vancouver, Wash., swam
into the Pacific Ocean July 31 to help pull Christine M. Reves, 19,
to shore through a strong current.
   _ Jessie J. Knowles Jr., 32, of Nashville, Tenn., manuevered his
newspaper delivery truck in front of a runaway truck whose driver
was slumped over the steering wheel. Knowles let the runaway ram
him, then braked both vehicles to a stop. The other driver could
not be revived.
   _ Danny R. Heaton, 28, of Tacoma, Wash., sustained a fractured
skull and third-degree burns over a third of his body in helping
rescue a man whose clothes caught fire at an electrical substation
June 27, 1987. Both recovered.
   _ Passer-by Richard L. Michaud Jr., 24, of Pinellas Park, Fla.,
ran beside a wrecked car as the driverless vehicle accelerated
backwards in tight circles. He reached inside and retrieved Nykia
Baldwin, 4.
   _ Retired railroadman Albert C. Lundy, 69, of Virginia Beach,
Va., entered a burning home May 12, 1987, and carried Leonard I.
Cooper, 2, through a bedroom window to safety. Both recovered from
burns, but Lundy died several months later.

   The so-called Committees for Defense of the Revolution are being

   Until the change, the secret, anonymous committee reports had
been necessary for a variety of activities including entrance to
universities and obtaining certain jobs.
   Reports on ``neighbors' attitudes and behavior'' have generated

   In the future, the committee reports must be public and can be

<TEXT>
   Three environmental groups have filed a
lawsuit to block what they contend are illegal low-level flights by
Air National Guard jets over the Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness in northeastern Minnesota.
   In the lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, the
environmentalists contend the flights over the million-acre area
violate federal law, disrupt the area's solitude and harm wolves
and other wildlife.
   They contend the Air Guard and the Federal Aviation
Administration have failed to assess the environmental impact of
the flights.
   Since 1949, the federal government has banned flights over the
BWCA lower than 4,000 feet above sea level. The environmental
groups contend military jets have flown below that level, which in
most places is 2,000 to 2,500 feet above the ground.
   Suing are the national Izaak Walton League, Friends of the
Boundary Waters Wilderness and Friends of Animals and Their
Environment. Named as defendants are the top officials of the FAA
and the National Guard Bureau, which oversees the Air Guard.
   Don Leyden, an FAA spokesman in Washington, D.C., said Wednesday
the agency could not comment.
   The environmentalists were joined in complaints about the
flights last year by the U.S. Forest Service. Air Guard officials
challenged the contentions, saying no military flights are flown
below 4,500 feet in the area. They also said perhaps 80 percent of
Guard flights over the area were more than 8,000 feet above the
ground.
   Brian O'Neill, a lawyer representing the environmentalists, said
low-level military flights also are a problem at other wilderness
areas and national parks.

   Republican George Bush blamed liberals and
economists Thursday for seeking to cloak the good news about the
U.S. economy and compared his presidential candidacy to the 1948
come-from-behind effort of Democrat Harry Truman.
   ``We're in for a real battle in the fall. Everybody knows
that,'' the vice president told a $10,000-a-couple GOP fund-raising
luncheon that raised $2 million toward a fund to be used by the
Republican National Committee for the fall election, according to
organizers.
   The $8.3 million fund is exempt from the $2,000-a-person limit
on direct campaign contributions to a candidate, according to
federal election laws that also prevented Bush from mentioning his
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis in his speech.
   Although recent public opinion polls show a narrowing of
Dukakis' early lead, Bush said Republicans still face an uphill
struggle _ in part because a Republican has been in the White House
for two terms.
   ``After eight years of one party in the White House, no matter
how successful, some good people yearn for a change _ hoping that
change will mean improvement,'' the likely nominee told the GOP
audience. ``And it's our job to let them know that this time, in
this case, change and improvement come from the Republican party.''
   The vice president also accused liberals of ``champing at the
bit to raise taxes again'' and said, ``the trouble with the
Democrats in Congress is that they haven't learned to `just say
no.'''
   ``They rush to enact every soft-hearted idea that crosses their
desks, eyes closed to the social and economic consequences,'' Bush
said.
   He praised the current economic recovery, which began in late
1982, as the longest peacetime expansion in history, and took a
swipe at economists for being pessimistic.
   ``Economists aren't any help,'' he said, noting that leading
economists have been projecting a recession since 1984 and two
years ago, 60 percent of the members of the National Association of
Business Economics predicted a downturn in 1988.
   ``Wrong, wrong, wrong,'' Bush said. ``No wonder it's called the
`dismal science.'''
   ``I'm feeling like Harry Truman,'' Bush added. ``Forty years
ago, he was fighting against the odds and when he went out to
speak, the crowds would yell, `give 'em hell.' And he'd shout back,
`I don't have to give 'em hell. I just tell the truth and they
think it's hell,''' Bush said.
   Bush also reiterated his call for tougher sentences for drug
abusers in a speech to the National Organization of Black Law
Enforcement officers.
   ``Only 14 percent of the drug felons convicted in New York City
last year were sentenced to as much as a year with no probation,''
he said in prepared remarks.
   He said that states should make more use of ``habitual
offender'' laws that make repeated conviction on felony charges a
separate crime _ and proposed providing ``federal jail space for
them when needed.''
   Bush was scheduled to leave Thursday night for his vacation
resort in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he will spend most of the

   John Demjanjuk appealed his conviction and
death sentence for Nazi war crimes Thursday, contending a ``lynch
atmosphere'' pervaded the court that found him guilty of mutilating
and killing death camp inmates.
   The retired Ohio autoworker's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to
reverse his conviction ``due to lack of proof and much more than
substantial doubt'' that he was the brutal Ukrainian guard called
``Ivan the Terrible'' by inmates of the Treblinka concentration
camp.
   Demjanjuk, who is 68 and was born in the Ukraine, was sentenced
April 25, a week after being found guilty of operating the gas
chambers that killed 850,000 Jews in 1942-43 at the camp in
Nazi-occupied Poland. He claims to be a victim of mistaken identity.
   Speaking in an interview at the Supreme Court, defense lawyer
Yoram Sheftel said the 101-page appeal challenged ``every finding
of the court as far as facts and legal aspects'' and accused the
three District Court judges of acting in a ``biased and uncivilized
way.''
   It accused the judges of ``extreme and unprecedented involvement
in questioning witnesses'' that, in effect, made them prosecutors.
   State television, which broadcast the trial daily, and other
Israeli media conducted an ``organized, massive campaign ...
against the defendant,'' the appeal said, and ``all this
contributed to a lynch atmosphere ... which completely undermined
any possibility of a fair trial.''
   Defense lawyers also contended in the appeal that two groups of
photos used by camp survivors to identify the defendant were
``unpermissibly suggestive.''
   They said no evidence was produced to challenge Demjanjuk's
story that he was in a German prisoner-of-war camp during the time
in question. He was taken prisoner while serving in the Soviet army.
   Sheftel said he visited Demjanjuk last week at his maximum
security cell in Ayalon Prison near Tel Aviv and ``he was fine. He
is optomistic and looking forward to the appeal.''
   Supreme Court spokesman Shmaryahu Cohen said a five-judge panel
headed by Chief Justice Meir Shamgar will hear the appeal from Dec.
5-7 and Dec. 12-14.
   The prosecution is scheduled to reply sometime between Dec. 19
and Dec. 29. Chief Prosecutor Yonah Blattman's office declined to
comment on the appeal, saying prosecutors had not yet received a
copy.
   Demjanjuk moved to the United States after World War II and
settled in the Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills. He was stripped of
U.S. citizenship asnd extradited after a court ruled he had lied on
his application to become an American citizen.
   If Demjanjuk is hanged, he will be the first person executed in
Israel since Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann was put to death in
1962 after a trial in Jerusalem.
   Israeli agents kidnapped Eichmann, the architect of Adolf
Hitler's mass extermination of Jews, in Argentina in 1960.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today made an impassioned
appeal to delegates at a Communist Party conference to adopt his
proposed overhaul of the Soviet system and said socialism will die
if they don't.
   The Kremlin leader recalled that previous attempts in the 1950s
and 1960s to reform the Soviet economy were ``swallowed up'' by the
system. He said those failures made clear that this time there must
be change in the political system itself.
   It was the second time Gorbachev had taken the floor at the
conference he called to assess his 3-year-old reform program and
set a course for the future.
   In a 40-minute speech broadcast later on national television,
Gorbachev told the 5,000 delegates, ``Socialism, Lenin, that is the
creative activity of the masses.''
   ``But that activity will die unless we reform the political
system,'' he said.
   Gorbachev recommended in his opening address to the conference
on Tuesday a a structural overhaul of the political system that
would make the presidency a more powerful post than the largely
ceremonial office it is now. The president would be elected by a
new 2,250-member Congress of Deputies.
   Gorbachev noted that some of the 40 or so delegates who have
spoken at the conference so far had complained there were no real
results yet from the three years of reform since he became party
leader in March 1985.
   Getting overnight results would be ``the simplest, shortest but
most mistaken way'' to pretend successful reform had already taken
place, Gorbachev said.
   Earlier, a Communist Party official told delegates that some
people believe party stalwarts like Andrei A. Gromyko are no longer
fit to hold office because they can't work under Gorbachev's
reforms.
   And a steelworker said that three years after the reform program
was launched, his town still doesn't have meat and consumer goods
have vanished.
   Delegate Vladimir I. Melnikov's remarks were the first reported
by state-run media in which top party figures were attacked by name.
   A delegate's note read at the conference later praised Gromyko
but also said he ``has fallen behind the times.''
   Despite the freer climate created by the Kremlin campaign for
``glasnost,'' or openness, criticism of top leaders is still
largely off-limits to the Soviet press, and members of the ruling
Politburo generally maintain an image of monolithic unity.
   Melnikov, party leader in the Russian federation region of Komi,
said restructuring of the party's policy-making Central Committee
is proceeding too slowly, the Tass news agency said in a summary of
his remarks.
   Both Communists and non-party members, Melnikov said, have said
that ``people who in previous times actively conducted the policy
of stagnation cannot now be on, or work in, central party or Soviet
organs, in the period of recontruction.''
   Tass said Gorbachev, sitting on the dais, broke in, saying:
``Maybe you have some concrete suggestions? We're sitting here and
don't know: Is he talking about me, or somebody else?''
   ``I was referring first of all to Comrade Solomentsev, and to
Comrades Gromyko, Afanasyev, Arbatov,'' Melnikov replied.
   Mikhail S. Solomentsev, 74, and Gromyko, 78, are both members of
the Politburo and have held seats on the Central Committee since
the days of Nikita S. Khrushchev in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
   As Politburo members, they have seats on the dais close to
Gorbachev. Television showed Solomentsev listening as Melnikov
spoke but did not show or say whether Gromyko was there.
   Tass said a delegate identified only as Mamayev sent a note to
the presidium that was read to delegates. It praised Gromyko as a
man who ``has popular respect and love.''
   According to Tass, the note said Gromyko had devoted his life to
Communism, but added: ``We have worked him too hard. And Comrade
Gromyko today has fallen behind the times, but he has done his job
and his noble deeds are remembered by the people.''
   Central Committee official Georgy Kryuchkov, asked by reporters
about reaction to Melnikov's remarks, said there were no other
immediate expressions of support for the men attacked by name. None
of them spoke up immediately in their own defense, he said.
   Gromyko served as foreign minister for 28 years and was shifted
to the mostly ceremonial post of president in 1985. Solomentsev is
chairman of the party's Control Committee.
   Georgy A. Arbatov, one of the Soviet Union's veteran specialists
on American affairs, is frequently seen on U.S. television, has led
the U.S.A.-Canada Institute since 1967 and has been a voting member
of the Central Committee since 1981.
   It was not clear which Afanasyev Melnikov was referring to.
There are at least two men by that name among the conference
delegates. The most prominent is Viktor G. Afanasyev, who has been
editor of the Communist Party daily Pravda and a full member of the
Central Committee since 1976.
   Veniamin A. Yarin, a mill operator at a huge industrial complex
in the Ural Mountains, told delegates that despite promises to
reward workers for increased productivity, the government has cut
housing subsidies.
   And although Gorbachev's program of ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring, is supposed to provide incentives by making
enterprises operate on their own finances, the government still
takes his factory's profits, Yarin said.
   ``Workers are asking straight out: `Where is the
`perestroika?''' he said. ``For example, in stores, the way it was
before with food products is the way it still is. ... There wasn't
any meat, and we still don't have any. Consumer goods have vanished
completely.''

<HEAD>Vatican II Reforms Are Major Issues of Contention</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lefebvre, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre has challenged
some of the most important reforms in the modern history of the
Roman Catholic church.
   The French prelate contests the reforms of the Second Vatican
Council of 1962-65, which he charges have led to ``neo-modernist
and neo-Protestant tendencies.''
   Major points of contention with the Vatican include:
   _ Vatican II documents on ``the church in the modern world'' and
on ``religious freedom,'' which Lefebvre refused to sign as a
council member.
   _ The 16th century Tridentine Mass. Lefebvre continues to
celebrate this Mass, which the council replaced with a simplified
and modernized liturgy to be said in the modern local language,
rather than in Latin. Lefebvre has described the modern Mass as
``bastard rites.'' A few years ago, the Vatican said the Tridentine
Mass could be celebrated with special permission.
   _ Ecumenism, or the opening to other churches and faiths. The
Second Vatican Council formally recognized that other faiths have
elements of truth and that their members stand in the love of God.
Lefebvre objects to the concept of religious freedom as a
``horrible apostasy'' because it put the church on equal footing
with all other, including non-Christian, churches. He condemned as
``appalling'' Pope John Paul II's meeting with leaders of other
religious faiths in 1986.

   Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed to
delegates of the Communist Party conference on Thursday to adopt
his proposed overhaul of the Soviet system and said that socialism
will die if they don't.
   Taking the floor for the second time at the conference he called
to assess his 3-year-old reform program and set a course for the
future, Gorbachev recalled that previous attempts in the 1950s and
1960s to reform the Soviet economy all were ``swallowed up'' by the
system.
   In an impassioned 40-minute speech broadcast later on national
television, Gorbachev told the 5,000 delegates assembled in the
Kremlin he had decided to address them again because he felt there
was a ``certain lack of understanding'' of the proposals he made
Tuesday at the conference opening.
   Gorbachev, the general secretary of the party and the nation's
most powerful leader, proposed to redistribute political power,
investing authority in a president to be elected by a new
2,250-member Congress of Deputies. He has not indicated whether he
would seek the new presidency.
   He said executive power should be similarly transferred to local
and regional governing councils that would be headed by local
Communist Party chiefs.
   The new national congress would meet annually to set policy and
would elect a considerably smaller full-time legislature to conduct
government business.
   On Thursday, Gorbachev argued that the failure of earlier reform
efforts made clear that this time there must be change in the
political system itself.
   ``Socialism, Lenin, that is the creative activity of the
masses,'' Gorbachev said in an emotional speech punctuated by
frequent sweeping gestures with his hands and only occasional
glances at his notes. ``But that activity will die unless we reform
the political system.''
   He noted that some of the 40 or so delegates who have spoken at
the conference so far had complained there were no real results yet
from the three years of reform since he became party leader in
March 1985.
   Getting overnight results would be ``the simplest, shortest but
most mistaken way'' to pretend successful reform had already taken
place, Gorbachev said.
   Without naming names, the Soviet leader noted some party members
want to fix percentages of representation or administer the economy
by directives from the seat of power.
   ``No, comrades,'' he said. ``We have to give a general
direction. We have to work out a political line.''
   The nation, he said, is faced with critical problems in ethnic
relations and youth affairs, and he noted that all were agreed that
something should be done about them.
   ``These are all questions of the fate of the country,'' he said,
``and that's why it is necessary to free the party of other
functions.''
   Very few of the speakers in the closed-door debate so far have
specifically addressed Gorbachev's proposals for structural
overhaul.
   Excerpts shown on television or reported in the state-run media
have reflected lively discussion of concrete problems such as food
shortages, ecology or ethnic questions.
   Talking about his proposal to make Communist Party chiefs the
heads of their local governing councils, known as soviets,
Gorbachev stressed, ``we have to give full power to the soviets.''
   Gorbachev's intervention at the end of the morning session on
the third day of the conference had the tone of a personal appeal
to the delegates to understand what he wants from them.
   At least three times, Gorbachev noted the need to return to the
principles of Vladimir I. Lenin and make the Communist Party the
``political vanguard'' of Soviet life.

   A House subcommittee on Thursday narrowly
approved a bill designed to give independent distributors rights to
sell scrambled cable programming to rural home satellite dish
owners.
   But even many of the bill's supporters said they have serious
reservations about the measure and urged the industry to work out
its own solution.

   But, he added, ``the fate of this legislation rests as much in
the hand of the affected industries as it does in the hand of
Congress.''
   Subcommittee members said the panel's impending vote on the bill
apparently had provided impetus for renewed talks between cable
programmers and groups that want to distribute packages of cable
programming to the nation's nearly 2 million dish owners.
   Most of the popular cable programmers, like Home Box Office and
Showtime, scramble their signals. Dish owners with a decoder can
subscribe directly with these cable programmers, but they have to

<HEAD>Health Workers Use AZT To Fight AIDS Exposure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some doctors and other health workers
exposed to the AIDS virus through needle sticks, tainted blood or
other accidents are taking the drug AZT in hopes of preventing
infection by the virus.
   The theory is that AZT _ now known as zidovudine _ if taken
early after exposure might prevent the AIDS virus from installing
itself in the genetic material of the cell, thus preventing
infection.
   Interest is so high that Burroughs Wellcome Co., maker of the
drug, launched its own nationwide study last month of health
workers exposed on the job.
   Company spokeswoman Karen Collins said Thursday that only ``a
handful'' of subjects have enrolled in the study so far, but the
company expects 5,000 to 7,000 participants within the next few
years.
   Health workers are required to enroll within five days of the
exposure; half will receive a six-week series of the drug free of
charge and half will receive a placebo, Collins said in a telephone
interview from Research Triangle Park, N.C., where the company is
based.
   ``I've been bombarded with calls from health care workers around
the country,'' said Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of an AIDS
health care worker study at San Franciso General Hospital and the
University of California at San Francisco. Her study examines the
risk of AIDS infection among health workers, but does not involve
participants taking AZT.
   Gerberding said the callers want to know whether the possible
toxic effects of zidovudine outweigh the 1-in-200 chance of
infection after a worker is stuck by an AIDS-tainted needle.
   The toxic and experimental drug can cause muscle aches, nausea,
headaches, and severe anemia. Since it works by impeding cell
replication, it cannot be given to pregnant women.
   No one knows the number of health workers taking the treatment
under the guidance of their private physicians. A six-week supply
of the drug costs about $800.
   ``Like everything else with AIDS, it's quasi-underground,'' said
Dr. June Fisher, who runs the city's Center of Municipal
Occupational Safety and Health.
   Gerberding said she knew of two workers at San Francisco General
who had taken the drug after they were exposed through tainted
blood.
   William Owen, a private doctor who treats AIDS patients, said he
prescribed the drug to a surgeon who cut his hand with a scalpel
while operating on an AIDS patient.
   Preventive use of the drug is gaining credence among AIDS
authorities, including Dr. Paul Volberding of San Francisco
General. Volberding said he has enough faith in the drug's
effectiveness that he cannot in good conscience advise any worker
to enroll in the Burroughs study for fear they will be among those
receiving the placebo.
   Volberding said 22 health workers worldwide have become infected
with the virus. He also said that with a deep cut the odds of
infection may run as high as one in 100.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican excommunicated Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre and the four bishops he consecrated Thursday, and
condemned the rebel French traditionalist for provoking a schism in
the Roman Catholic Church.
   A statement issued two hours after the consecration ceremony at
Lefebvre's seminary in Econe, Switzerland, said the five men
excommunicated themselves by defying papal authority and by
ignoring warnings and a last-minute appeal from Pope John Paul II.
   Leading Catholic clerics rallied around the pope and urged
Lefebvre's supporters not to follow him out of the church.
   John Paul performed his official duties as usual Thursday,
including a meeting with five Soviet journalists, but Lefebvre's
decision to consecrate bishops without his approval caused
considerable bitterness here.
   A performance of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis scheduled for
Thursday evening in the Paul VI Auditorium was canceled to express
``deep pain'' over the schism, the first major split in the church
in 118 years.
   An excommunicated Roman Catholic is not permitted to receive the
church's sacraments, which include communion and extreme unction,
previously known as last rites.
   ``No one is put to hell or condemned,'' a Vatican official said,
on condition of anonymity. ``He (Lefebvre) has put himself outside
the communion of the church and takes responsibility before God.''
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said only the pope can lift
the sanction against Lefebvre, 82, and the four bishops.
   Lefebvre caused the first schism, or formal break with the
Vatican, since the so-called Old Catholics rebelled in 1970, after
the first Vatican Council proclaimed the doctrine of papal
infallibility.
   Navarro's statement said the consecrations were carried out
``explicitly against the pope's will.''
   ``This is a formally schismatic act according to Canon 751, in
as much he openly refused submission to the Holy Father and
communion with the members of the church under his jurisdiction,''
and automatic excommunication was the result, it said.
   The spokesman rejected claims by Lefebvre's St. Pius X
Fraternity that the consecrations could occur because of an
``emergency'' situation.
   ``The so-called `case of necessity' has been intentionally
fabricated by Monsignor Lefebvre in order to maintain an attitude
of division within the Catholic church, notwithstanding the
ecclesial communion and the concessions offered by the Holy Father
John Paul II.''
   Lefebvre and his followers reject many modernizing reforms of
the Second Vatican Council, 1962-65, including openings to other
religions and Christian denominations.
   Pope Paul VI suspended Lefebvre from priestly duties in 1976 but
he has continued ordaining priests, including 16 on Wednesday.
   John Paul, considered to be a doctrinal conservative, had hoped
to woo the French archbishop back and the two sides were reported
close to agreement last month, but Lefebvre reneged on a compromise.
   Those excommunicated were Lefebvre and the four bishops: Bernard
Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson and
Alfonso de Galarreta.
   Antonio de Castro Mayer, bishop of Campos in Brazil, assisted at
the rites and also faced automatic excommunication. Navarro said,
however, that the Vatican was awaiting clarification on his role in
the ceremony.
   The Italian Bishops' Conference immediately called for prayers
for the pope.
   Archbishop Albert Decourtray of Lyon and president of the French
council of bishops, said: ``It is a day of mourning for the
Catholic church, for all those who are attached to Christian
unity.''
   Cardinal Basil Hume, archbishop of Westminster and head of the
church in England and Wales, said: ``All Catholics will be saddened
by the action taken today by Archbishop Lefebvre.'' He urged those
sympathetic to Lefebvre to reaffirm their loyalty to the pope.
   Navarro said recently that Lefebvre's supporters numbered 80,000
to 100,000, but other Vatican officials have said about half a
million people turn to his priests for various church functions.
   The Vatican spokesman said he would announce Friday the position
in the church of Lefebvre's priests and lay followers.

<HEAD>Agency Orders UPS To Resume Fireworks Deliveries _ After July 4th</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a masterpiece of timing, a government
agency this week told United Parcel Service it had to transport
shipments of fireworks, then said three days later the order won't
take effect until July 8.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission gave no reason for
effectively reversing itself except to say it was acting on a
petition by UPS. The package delivery service had wanted out of the
fireworks hauling business because of the difficulty of obeying all
the different local, state and federal laws.
   ``It was a great administrative burden,'' said Bob Kenney, a
spokesman for UPS in Greenwich, Conn. He said that while UPS had
been one of the leading shippers of fireworks _ which can't go
through the U.S. mail _ it was only a minor part of its business.
   Last year UPS asked the ICC to be let out of shipping fireworks
and the commission said OK. In March, four fireworks manufacturers
asked that the decision be reversed, and on Monday the ICC did.
   The commission ruled that the UPS action ``is unreasonable
discrimination and therefore unlawful.'' It gave the parcel
delivery service two days to reinstate the service it had stopped
on Jan. 8.
   The commission's action was not unanimous. Chairman Heather J.
Gradison dissented, saying it was ironic that in ``its overweening
zeal to use regulatory intervention to keep the `bang' in the
Fourth of July'' the commission showed the fragility of the
liberties being celebrated.
   ``For business reasons ... UPS has made the deicsion that it no
longer wishes to invest its time, labor and capital carrying
fireworks,'' she wrote. ``The commission is in effect taking from
UPS its right to exercise its control over its property.''
   ICC Vice Chairman Frederick Andre also dissented:
   ``UPS is now being ordered to ... immediately transport
fireworks for the upcoming Fourth of July holiday,'' he wrote. ``In
return for such a radical readjustment, UPS is merely offered the
promise of an adequate explanation to be issued at a later date.''
   UPS filed its objection on Tuesday and the fireworks companies
objected to the objection.
   The last word was the commission's. ``Our prior decision is
stayed until July 8, 1988,'' said the order on Thursday.

   Iraq said its jets bombed an Iranian

   Baghdad Radio said Iraqi forces recaptured four border points

   It also said two other border outposts were recaptured from the
Iranians.
   ``The enemy is collapsing,'' Baghdad Radio declared.
   It said the offensive in the central sector lasted more than 12
hours and ended when the Iranians retreated to the pre-war border,
``leaving their dead littering the battlefield.''
   Tehran had no immediate comment on the reports.
   But Tehran radio said Iranian warplanes strafed troop positions
in Iraq's northern Sulaimaniyeh province Wednesday night and
inflicted ``heavy losses on the enemy.''
   Iraq had claimed its forces retook Mawat two weeks ago.
Thursday's communique claimed the entire Mawat basin, two miles
west of the border, has been recaptured.
   The official Iraqi News Agency also said its aircraft bombed a
natural gas plant on the Iranian mainland in the southern gulf and
the Cyrus oil field in the northern gulf. It said all the planes
returned safely to their bases.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored
in Nicosia, said Iraqi jets bombed ``an industrial-labor complex''
on its southern gulf coast, killing or wounding an unspecified
number of workers and causing some damage.
   It said Iran's air force fighters shot down an Iraqi warplane
over the gulf at about the same time Iran reportedly raided the gas
plant.
   Iraq said the gas plant, which it called Iran's biggest, was on
the mainland across from the island of Lavan, also known as Sheik
Sho'yeb.
   The Iranian News Agency said a second Iraqi jet was shot down
over western Iran.
   Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency denied any plane was downed
during the two gulf raids. The agency quoted an unnamed spokesman
as saying ``large numbers'' of warplanes were involved in the two
raids and left their targets ``engulfed with fire and smoke.
   ``The Iranian regime today received a strong blow which will
have an extreme effect on its economy and oil resources,'' he said.
   The Iraqi air force's last major raids were June 23, when 10
targets in the southwestern Ahwaz, Bibi Hakimah and Sarran oil
fields were bombed.
   The Iraqi spokesman declared: ``The Iranian regime must realize
that after the successive victories of the Iraqi army and air force
that it has to accept peace and nothing but peace.''
   Last week, Iraqi forces drove the Iranians out of their last
major bridgehead in southern Iraq, the Majnoon islands in the
oil-rich Howeizah marshes.
   They also recaptured the southern Faw Peninsula April 18, two
years after the Iranians had seized it.
   The battlefield defeats dramatically swung the military balance
in the nearly 8-year-old war in Iraq's favor after years of being
on the defensive.
   An authoritative oil source said the apparent target of one of
the Iraqi raids was the Kangan natural gas plant.
   Meanwhile, Iran's parliament re-elected Prime Minister Hussein
Musavi on Thursday, Iran's official news agency reported.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said 204 of the 217 deputies
present in the Majlis, or parliament, voted for Musavi. Eight voted
against him, five abstained and the remainder did not attend.
   In a speech before today's vote, Musavi declared that a
``massive mobilization by Iran's enemies is a warning that we must
prepare for an ... all-out struggle against them.''
   He stressed: ``We are faced with an historic confrontation, the
most important manifestation of which has emerged in the
warfronts'' with Iraq.
   He did not elaborate, but he was clearly referring to a string
of Iraqi victories since mid-April.

<HEAD>Political Arm of Nation's Largest Teacher Union Backs Dukakis

   Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis
won the backing Thursday of the political arm of the National
Education Association, the nation's largest teacher union.
   The decision came during a closed-door meeting of NEA's
political action committee in New Orleans where the teacher group
will hold its annual convention next week. The union's endorsement
won't be official until Friday, when the NEA board of directors is
scheduled to meet and almost certainly concur with NEA-PAC's choice.
   NEA officials said the endorsement applies only to the
Democratic nomination. The 1.9 million-member union won't make a
final presidential endorsement until Sept. 8, after both parties
have held their conventions.
   Dukakis ``believes in and supports a view and a vision of
education policy consistent with our efforts to assure every child
a quality education,'' said NEA president Mary Hatwood Futrell.
   On Wednesday, Dukakis picked up his first formal labor
endorsement from the 59,000-member National Treasury Employees
Union, a group that represents mostly federal Internal Revenue
Service and Customs Service workers.
   The labor movement, stung by charges that it contributed to the
landslide defeat of Walter Mondale in the 1984 presidential
campaign with its strategy of early endorsements, has mostly held
off endorsements so far in 1988.
   It is unlikely that George Bush, who has clinched the Republican
nomination, will gain the teachers' blessing because he has refused
to respond to the union's questionnaires on education issues or to
meet with union officials, said Futrell in a recent interview.
   The NEA has frequently locked horns with the Reagan
administration on a variety of subjects, especially federal aid to
school programs.
   The American Federation of Teachers, the rival teacher union
with 680,000 members, won't endorse a candidate until after the
political conventions. But the AFT's president, Albert Shanker, and
political director, Rachelle Horowitz, will both be Dukakis
delegates in Atlanta.
   Futrell said she had met with Democratic candidates Jesse
Jackson and Dukakis. But she said she was rebuffed by the Bush camp.
   ``My indication is that they think it wouldn't be desirable. He
has eliminated himself from the process,'' she said.
   In her discussion with Jackson, she said she ``indicated our
concern that we should come out of the convention united. We
stressed the unity issue.''
   Futrell, a Mondale delegate in 1984 and a political activist in
her home state of Virginia, will not be a delegate this year. But
Kenneth Melley, the NEA's director of government relations, said
the union will have 280 delegates and 77 alternates in Atlanta,
with a large majority for Dukakis. The NEA will send 28 members as
delegates to the Republican National Convention.
   The NEA fielded 279 delegates and 84 alternates in 1984 at the
Democratic Convention.
   In NEA questionnaires submitted to presidential hopefuls of both
parties last year, Dukakis backed nearly every item on the union's
legislative agenda including opposition to any English-only
constitutional amendments or public funding of private schools
through vouchers.
   But he parted company with the union with his opposition to
federal tax deductions for union dues.

<HEAD>U.S. Foreign Debt Leaped to $368 Billion Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States' foreign debt burden climbed
to $368.2 billion in 1987, a sharp 36.8 percent rise over the
previous year, as the country lengthened its lead as the world's
largest debtor nation.
   The Commerce Department said the new debt total was $99 billion
higher than the $269.2 billion in debt to foreigners that the
United States owed at the end of 1986.
   The debt means that foreigners now own more in U.S. assets than
Americans own abroad. For 1987, the government reported that
foreign holdings in the United States increased to $1.54 trillion
from $1.34 trillion at the end of 1986. American investments
overseas totaled $1.17 trillion at the close of 1987, up from $1.07
trillion a year earlier.
   The difference between foreign investments in this country and
American holdings overseas represents the $368.2 billion debt
burden the country is carrying.
   The country now has a debt load greater than the combined total
of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, the Third World countries with the
largest debt burdens.
   Critics have charged that the transformation of the United
States from the world's largest creditor nation, a position it held
as recently as 1983, to the world's biggest debtor is the chief
failure of President Reagan's economic policies.
   Democrats, who hope to use the issue to their advantage in this
year's presidential campaign, have charged that the burgeoning debt
is eroding America's political and economic standing in the world.
   But the administration on Thursday sought to minimize the annual
accounting of the country's investment position, contending that
the figures were a sign of strength showing foreigners still
believed America was an excellent place to invest.
   The United States had an investment surplus of $89.4 billion as
recently as 1983. That surplus fell to $3.5 billion in 1984 and
disappeared altogether in 1985, the year the country became a net
debtor for the first time in 71 years with a debt of $110.7 billion.
   America's investment surplus has evaporated as the country ran
up huge merchandise trade deficits during the 1980s, transferring
billions of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay for color
televisions, stereo equipment and automobiles.
   These dollars, now in foreign hands, have been reinvested in the
United States in everything from government bonds to real estate,
triggering alarm bells and calls in Congress for curbs on foreign
investment.
   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner, briefing reporters
Thursday, said the administration was adamantly opposed to curbs
being placed on foreign investment in the United States. He also
objected to comparing the United States to Third World countries,
saying unlike Brazil, the United States owes its debt in its own
currency.
   Private economists have contended that the growing debt burden
has already begun to lower Americans' standard of living as more
and more money must be transferred into the hands of foreigners in
the form of interest payments and dividends.
   But Ortner said he believed most Americans regarded the entire
debate as a ``big yawn.'' He said that even with the growth in
foreign investment, the debt still represents only about 4 percent
to 5 percent of the country's total assets.
   Ortner said foreigners own about 17 percent of U.S. Treasury
securities and about 12 percent of manufacturing assets in the
United States.
   ``I am not calling this report good news. I am trying to argue
that it isn't terrible news,'' he said.
   Ortner refused to make any projection about how large the debt
would grow in coming years, but private economists have estimated
it could top $1 trillion in the early 1990s before it begins to
level off.
   ``We are losing control over our own economy and our capital
markets. This money doesn't come free,'' said Lawrence Chimerine,
president of the WEFA Group, an economic consulting firm in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa.
   C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International
Economics, said the United States has become hostage to the whims
of foreign investors. He said foreign uneasiness with a plunging
U.S. dollar and rising interest rates was an underlying cause of
last October's stock market collapse.
   ``As long as the United States has to rely on foreign financing
of such magnitudes, events could at literally any moment trigger a
sharp turndown in our economy,'' he said.
   The Commerce Department report said that foreign direct
investment in the United States, defined as ownership of at least a
10 percent stake in a company, had climbed 18.8 percent to $261.9
billion in 1987.
   The nation whose citizens had the biggest share of that
investment was Britain, with $74.9 billion, followed by the
Netherlands at $47 billion and Japan at $33.4 billion.

<HEAD>Three States Target Sex Offenders for AIDS Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted sex offenders in Georgia and Washington will be
required to submit to AIDS tests under laws effective Friday, while
Colorado apparently is the first state to require such a test for
those charged but not yet convicted of sex offenses.
   Of dozens of new state laws taking effect July 1, many are
efforts to deal with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a deadly
disease for which there is no cure and which is spread mainly
through sexual contact and the sharing of needles by drug abusers.
   Colorado's law would make test results available ``to any victim
of the sexual offense who requests such disclosure,'' but those
victims would face fines or jail terms if they disclosed the
information to unauthorized people.
   Of the dozen states which now require AIDS tests for sex
offenders, Colorado is the first to put the test before conviction
of sex crimes other than prostitution, said Mona Rowe, co-director
of the AIDS Policy Center at George Washington University.
   ``If you wait for the person to be convicted, that could be a
year or two. If you were assaulted, that wouldn't give you a very
good feeling,'' state Sen. Dave Wattenberg, the Republican who
sponsored the Colorado law, said Thursday.
   Nevada requires AIDS tests of people arrested for prostitution,
and those suspects are billed $100 for the test if convicted, Ms.
Rowe said Thursday.
   Georgia's new law requires AIDS tests of anyone convicted of
crimes involving sex or drug abuse and, eventually, of all inmates
in state prisons. Beginning Friday, an AIDS carrier who engages in
AIDS-transmitting behavior in Georgia without informing his partner
will be guilty of the felony of reckless conduct.
   Washington's law, which also extends anti-discrimination
protection to people infected with AIDS, requires testing and
counseling for those convicted of sex crimes, prostitution or
intravenous drug use. Violent prison inmates could be subjected to
AIDS tests against their will under the statute.
   People who intentionally infect others with AIDS would face a
10-year prison sentence in Washington.
   New legislation in Indiana will require AIDS education for
health care workers, teachers, public school students and marriage
license applicants. Each school corporation in Indiana will be
required to have a community advisory committee to screen AIDS
education materials.
   Indiana also is making it a crime to knowingly donate
AIDS-contaminated blood or to fail to notify state officials when a
person tests positive for the AIDS virus. The maximum penalty for
donating contaminated blood would be eight years in jail, or 50
years if another person was infected by the donated blood.
   The law also allows Indiana judges to order the temporary
detention of AIDS victims who persist in high-risk behavior.
   Starting Friday, applicants for marriage licenses in Idaho will
have to state that they have read a pamphlet on AIDS provided by
the county clerk. The pamphlet includes information on how AIDS is
spread and how to seek testing.
   Only Illinois and Louisiana now require AIDS tests of
marriage-license applicants, Ms. Rowe said.
   Another new law in Idaho provides for testing for the AIDS virus
in organs and fluids to be transplanted and of people donating
organs or fluids for transplant, and makes it a felony to knowingly
transmit the disease to another. In Florida, Gov. Bob Martinez has
until Wednesday to act on legislation that could subject
promiscuous AIDS carriers to quarantine for up to four months.
Martinez is expected to sign the bill, which would require public
education and outlaw discrimination against AIDS carriers.
   The bill makes it a first-degree misdemeanor for someone
infected with the virus to have sexual intercourse without telling
the partner.
   Meanwhile Thursday, delegates to the American Medical
Association convention in Chicago renewed their call for states to
test all prison inmates for AIDS, and for states to trace the
sexual partners of persons known to be infected.
   Among other new laws effective Friday:
   _Connecticut will take account of student achievement test
scores in distributing state education aid, with communities with
lower scores receiving more aid. Critics claimed the change would
reward failure, but state Education Commissioner Gerald N. Tirozzi
says, ``We're trying to identify weakness and drive dollars where
they're needed.''
   _Georgia will allow juries to find murder defendants ``guilty
but mentally retarded,'' a verdict which would preclude capital
punishment.
   _Sports agents come under new regulations in Indiana,
Mississippi and Georgia. Indiana will require agents to give
schools 10 days notice before signing an athlete with remaining
amateur eligibility. Mississippi will require sports agents to
register, and Georgia has a commission to regulate sports agents.
   _Connecticut is raising its tax on gasoline by a penny to 20
cents a gallon, while New Jersey is adding 2{ cents to its tax on
motor fuels, raising the total to 10{ cents a gallon. Both states
will use the added revenue for transportation improvements.
   _Kansas is scrapping its nine-bracket income tax system, which
had rates from 2 percent to 9 percent, in favor of two brackets,
and repealing the state deduction for federal taxes paid. State
officials say one-third of Kansas residents will pay more taxes,
but lower-income families will pay less.
   _Rhode Island is raising the cigarette tax by 2 cents, to 27
cents a pack, and extending the tax to cigarette papers in an
effort to discourage marijuana use. Each paper will be taxed as if
it was one cigarette.
   _Vermont will require businesses with more than 10 employees to
set aside no-smoking areas. The law does not apply to restaurants.
   _Minnesota is exempting non-prescription drugs from a 6 percent
excise tax. Bullet-proof vests purchased by police officers, meals
served in prisons, items sold at charitable events and used motor
oil also will be exempted.
   _Tennessee is boosting penalties for writing bad checks,
permitting recipients of bad checks to collect triple the face
value, up to $500, unless the person who wrote it makes it good in
10 days.
   _Tennessee is also prohibiting any service station from selling
gasoline below the cost of doing business at the station, to
protect independent stations from price-cutting competition from
stations owned by major oil companies.
   _Minnesota has repealed the so-called ``Twinkie'' law, which
made it possible to charge candidates with bribery for serving
coffee and cookies at campaign gatherings. Repeal was prompted by
the case of George L. Belair, an independent candidate for
Minneapolis City Council in 1985, who was indicted for dispensing
$34.13 in Twinkies, Ho-Hos, doughnuts, cookies, Kool-Aid and coffee
to two senior citizen groups. The indictment eventually was
dismissed.

   Stuck on the bottom of the world since August,
Debbie Enzenbacher had a craving for candy.
   There's no grocery store at the corner glacier, of course, so a
Chicago company made an air drop of sweet stuff over the South Pole
to boost the spirits of researchers who lack the comforts of home.
   ``When they told us it was a plea from the South Pole for a
supply of Tootsie Pops, we didn't know if it was a joke or a
serious request,'' said Ellen Gordon, president of Tootsie Roll
Industries Inc.
   It was no joke.
   Mrs. Gordon said she received a letter from Miss Enzenbacher
last December. The first drop was made in February and another drop
was scheduled this week.
   Miss Enzenbacher, 28, of Calumet Park, employed by Antarctic
Services Inc. of Paramus, N.J., is in charge of materials for a
19-member team doing research, according to her mother, Jean
Enzenbacher.
   ``I find that one of the things I truly miss here that is not
available on the continent, since there are no stores, is your
Tootsie Roll Pops,'' Miss Enzenbacher said in her letter.
   ``Is there any way you could possibly send us some?'' she asked.
``It would make the long six months' winter night ... that much
more bearable.''
   Mrs. Gordon said the company reponded in February by
air-dropping 1,280 Tootsie Rolls, the chewy chocolate candies, and
400 Tootsie Roll Pops.
   In a thank-you letter to the company in March, Miss Enzenbacher
said it had been ``consistently colder than minus 100 degrees since
February, what with the wind chill here and all. But still, it is
starkly beautiful.''
   Mrs. Enzenbacher said her daughter studied anthropology in
college and did a thesis on Antarctica while getting a master's
degree in international relations.
   ``She has a love of this strange climate,'' her mother said.
   Besides her affection for science, ``She has a sweet tooth,''
Mrs. Enzenbacher confided.

   Outer clothing isn't the only thing people tend
to shed at the beach. Try rings, rare coins and pocket knives.
   The Midwest Historical Research Society has nearly 120 members,
all carrying metal detectors in search of treasure.
   ``Wedding rings seem to predominate in the jewelry we find,''
said Sara Seibs, a Chicago realtor who plies the beaches, parks and
forest preserves with her metal detector in her spare time.
   ``At the beaches we tend to find many more men's wedding rings
than women's, although I'm not quite sure why,'' Ms. Seibs said in
a recent interview. ``Maybe men wear looser rings and their fingers
shrink in the cold water.''
   Ms. Seibs, president of the group of metal detector hobbyists,
says rings of all sorts turn up.
   ``Aluminum pull tabs from beer cans drive everybody crazy,'' Ms.
Seibs said. ``You find about 100 of them for every coin or useful
item you detect _ especially on beaches.''

   Mayor Sophie Masloff called New York Mayor Ed
Koch ``the big apple sauce'' after he pretended he didn't know
where Pittsburgh was during an exchange spurred by ads run before a
Pirates-Mets three-game series.
   The Pirates, in second place behind the Mets in the National
League East, referred in radio ads to the Mets as ``just one more
thing to hate about New York.''
   In an interview Wednesday with WWOR-TV of Secaucus, N.J., Koch
was asked what he would say to the mayor of Pittsburgh or its
residents about the ads. ``Grow up,'' he responded.
   When asked what he thought of Pittsburgh and whether he has ever
been there, Koch said with a straight face, ``Where is it?'' and
``What country?''
   Masloff responded on KDKA-TV later in the day.
   ``The nerve of him,'' she said. ``He's not the big apple. He's
the big apple sauce.''
   New York won two of the three games.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
banning the death penalty for all juvenile murderers, a day after
issuing a decision that could end capital punishment for killers
not yet 16 when they committed their crimes.
   The justices said they will decide sometime next year whether
use of the death penalty for anyone under 18 when the crime was
committed violates the Constitution's ban on ``cruel and unusual
punishment.''
   The court voted to consider overturning the death sentences of
Georgia death row inmate Jose Martinez High, who was 17 when he
participated in a 1976 murder, and Missouri death row inmate Heath
Wilkins, who was 16 when he commited a 1985 murder.
   The court Wednesday overturned the death sentence of an Oklahoma
man convicted of a murder committed when he was 15.
   Four of the eight justices who voted in that case said the death
penalty for convicted murderers who committed their crimes before
reaching 16 always amounts to unlawfully ``cruel and unusual
punishment.''
   Three justices said no such age limitation on imposing capital
punishment can be derived from the Constitution.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in Wednesday's
ruling but will vote in the two cases decided next year.
   In her controlling vote Wednesday, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
voiced serious doubts whether states may execute people for crimes
committed when only 15.
   ``Although I believe that a national consensus forbidding the
execution of any person for a crime committed before the age of 16
very likely does exist, I am reluctant to adopt this conclusion as
a matter of constitutional law without better evidence than we now
possess,''' O'Connor said.
   But she supplied a fifth vote to overturn William Wayne
Thompson's death sentence, ruling that the state's death penalty
law could not be applied to him because it has no minimum age.
   Wednesday's ruling left unclear whether O'Connor would vote to
strike down a death penalty law that explicitly made 15-year-old
murderers eligible for execution.
   The decision also left unclear whether the court would find
fault with death penalty laws in which convicted killers who were
16 or 17 when they committed their crimes are eligible for
execution.
   Those questions could be answered when the court completes its
study, expected to begin when the court starts its new term in
October, of the appeals filed in behalf of High and Wilkins.
   High was sentenced to death for killing an 11-year-old boy
during a gas station robbery in Taliferro County, Ga.
   He was convicted in the July 26, 1976, shooting death of Bonnie
Bulloch, the step-son of a gas station attendant.
   High was weeks short of his 18th birthday when the crime was
committed.
   Wilkins was 16 when on July 27, 1985, he helped rob an Avondale,
Mo., liquor store.
   Nancy Allen, a clerk in the store, was fatally stabbed during
the robbery.
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Apparently removed the last legal obstacle to a $180 million
settlement between Vietnam veterans and manufacturers of the
herbicide Agent Orange.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissed
lawsuits by about 300 veterans who challenged the settlement, in
which some 120,000 others are expected to participate.
   _ Agreed to study alleged race discrimination in Alaskan salmon
canneries, setting the stage for an important sequel to a
one-day-old ruling that makes it easier for workers to prove their
bosses are guilty of illegal bias.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by two companies
based in Washington state and Oregon that operate canneries in
Alaska.
   On Tuesday, the court made it easier, by an 8-0 vote in a Texas
case, for workers to prove their bosses are guilty of illegal
discrimination by expanding the way employees can use statistics to
prove bias.
   _ Agreed to hear the appeal of a Texas man sentenced to death
who, the justices were told, has the reasoning capacity of a
7-year-old.
   The justices said they will study arguments that executing
Johnny Paul Penry for the Oct. 25, 1979, killing of Pamela
Carpenter would be ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the
Constitution's Eighth Amendment.
   _ Agreed to decide whether states may ban virtually all lawyer
advertisements featuring testimonials or client endorsements.
   The justices said they will review a California rule that
presumes such ads are false or misleading.
   _ Rejected the appeal of a Minnesota woman severely injured in a
1983 car crash, turning away arguments that her car's manufacturer
negligently failed to install airbags.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings dismissing that
portion of Jan Marie Wickstrom's product-liability lawsuit against
Toyota Motor Corp. and its U.S. subsidiaries.
   _ Refused to kill a libel lawsuit against a Tennessee
congressman who criticized a legal services lawyer.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, let stand a ruling that Rep. Don
Sundquist, R-Tenn., may be sued for statements he made in a letter
to the U.S. attorney general. The lawsuit also alleges he repeated
the libelous statements in a news release.
   _ Refused to answer the unusual legal question: Can a pig farm
be a form of political protest?
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by developers who
set up a pig farm on their property after their plans for a large
motel were blocked.
   Lawyers around the country still were absorbing the impact of
Wednesday's ruling on the death penalty for young offenders.
   ``As a practical matter, l5-year-olds will not be executed in
this country,'' predicted Paul L. Hoffman, a Los Angeles lawyer for
Amnesty International. ``Justice O'Connor walked right up to the
edge of saying that.''
   In Oklahoma, Assistant Attorney General David Lee said: ``The
line has been drawn in my opinion. Our reading of the opinion is
that (the court) used 16 as the line.''
   If Hoffman and Lee are correct, the decision will affect only
three of the some 2,100 people now on death row nationwide. But
Thompson's case nevertheless had captured worldwide attention.
   Of the 100 men and women executed in U.S. prisons since the
Supreme Court in 1976 allowed states to resume capital punishment,
three died for murders committed when they were 17.
   Since 1948, no one has been executed in this country for a crime
committed while under the age of 17.
   Of the 37 states with death penalty laws, 19 of them do not
specify a minimum age. Of the 18 state laws tht do impose a minimum
age, none of them allows execution of killers younger than 16 when
they committed their crimes.
   Thirteen states and the District of Columbia do not allow
capital punishment.
   Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun voted to ban the death penalty for
any crime committed by someone not yet 16.
   Writing for the four, Stevens said killing such criminals ``is
nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain
and suffering, and thus an unconstitutional punishment.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Byron R. White voted to let Thompson be killed. Writing for the
three, Scalia said he found ``Thompson's age inadequate grounds for
reversal of his sentence.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court after
Thompson's case was argued, did not participate in the case.
   Thompson, now 20, was one of four people convicted in the Jan.
29, 1983, death in Grady County, Okla., of Charles Keene, his
former brother-in-law.
   The court, although postponing for one day issuing a list of
orders in new cases, ended its 1987-88 term Wednesday. In other
decisions, it:
   _Upheld the power of independent counsels to prosecute illegal
acts by high-ranking government officials, a momentous
constitutional decision and a defeat for a handful of former White
House aides such as Oliver L. North and Michael K. Deaver.
   _Severely limited state efforts to shield young sex abuse
victims from trauma when they testify at criminal trials. The 6-2
ruling in a case from Iowa jeopardizes the use of such protective
devices for witnesses as one-way screens and videotaped testimony.
   _Ruled, 5-4, that the federal government may give money to
religious groups to promote chastity among America's teen-agers as
long as the groups do not teach religion while using the federal
aid.
   _In a high-stakes defeat for organized labor, voted 5-3 to make
it easier for millions of non-union workers to withhold financial
support from the unions that represent them in collective
bargaining.
   _Barred states from placing strict regulations on professional,
for-profit organizations that solicit contributions for charities.
The 7-2 ruling struck down a North Carolina law as a violation of
free-speech rights.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Seizure of Land Planned for Battlefield Shopping
Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee on Thursday approved a
bill to seize land that was to be used for a disputed shopping
center adjacent to a Civil War battlefield near the nation's
capital.
   The Interior and Insular Affairs subcommittee on national parks
and public lands acted to take control of a 542-acre tract
bordering the Manassas National Battlefield Park, the site of two
major Civil War battles.
   A developer has planned a massive shopping, residential and
office complex next to the 4,600-acre battlefield park located in
Prince William County, Va., 27 miles west of Washington. But
historians and local groups have claimed the development would
destroy the still-rustic sanctity of the park.
   ``This is a remedy the Congress, and the American people, have
available,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of the panel.
``I don't see any other alternative to dealing with this problem.''
   The bill, which combines prior measures proposed by Reps. Robert
Mrazek, D-N.Y., and Michael Andrews, D-Texas, and a separate
proposal by Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., also would close U.S. 29 and
state route 234, which run through the park, and provide up to $30
million for the construction of new roads around the site. The
federal government also would pay the site's developer, the
Hazel-Peterson Cos., for the land that was seized.
   The land was sold to developer John T. Hazel for an estimated
$12 million in 1985. Land experts estimate repurchasing the land
and paying for road closings could cost the government up to $150
million.
   ``We will eventually pay probably three times what we have spent
in the past year on acquisitions for national parks,'' said Rep.
Ron Marlenee, R-Mont. ``Oh, for the shame of taxpayer abuse we have
in this legislation.''
   He said the roads in the park should be closed, but the
development plans should be allowed to proceed.
   The bill now moves to the full Interior committee, which is
chaired by Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz.
   On Wednesday, the House passed a transportation bill that
included an amendment offered by Mrazek that would prevent federal
involvement in the costly construction of bypasses or access roads
associated with the development.
   Hazel plans to build a complex featuring 1.2 million square-feet
of retail space, 1.7 million square-feet of office space and 560
homes.
   The development site is next to the area in which the First and
Second Battles of Manassas were fought.

<HEAD>Officials Say TVA Layoffs Shouldn't Hurt Knoxville's Economy Too
Badly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SHARP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Government and community leaders said
Thursday that the thousands of layoffs announced by the Tennessee
Valley Authority will be devastating in limited areas without
destroying the region's economic foundations.
   And many said TVA's stated goal of keeping its power rates low
will be a boon in years to come.
   ``There seems to be a trade-off here that TVA is trying to
address,'' said Matthew Murray, an assistant economics professor at
the University of Tennessee. ``The short-run impact will be
negative for the Knoxville area and the TVA region in general. But
TVA apparently has decided the long-run benefits outweigh the
short-run costs of the dislocations and terminations.''
   The TVA, the nation's biggest supplier of electricity, announced
Wednesday that it will lay off 7,500 of its 34,000 workers to
remain competitive and ensure its survival.
   The 22 percent reduction, to be completed by Oct. 1, is in line
with TVA Chairman Marvin Runyon's goal of making the utility
businesslike and capable of competing with privately owned
utilities. The layoffs, as well as other changes, are an effort to
avoid a rate increase of about $300 million in the budget year that
begins Oct. 1.
   TVA will lay off 988 workers in Knoxville, its headquarters, and
transfer 250 additional jobs to Chattanooga. That will leave
Knoxville with about 3,300 TVA employees.
   Chattanooga will suffer a total reduction of 775 jobs, leaving
the city with about 4,800 TVA jobs. An additional 329 employees
will be laid off at Muscle Shoals, Ala., leaving that city with
more than 1,800 TVA jobs.
   ``It's tough on some of those laid off,'' said Knox County
executive Dwight Kessel.``I'm sure they have house and car
payments. But in a community our size, 1,000 people laid off is not
a disaster, although it certainly is very real to those people.''
   Knoxville has a population of about 175,000. The county has a
population of some 321,000, Kessel said.
   The largest employer in the Knoxville area is Martin Marietta
Energy Systems, with 15,700 employees. Martin Marietta also runs
the Department of Energy's facilities in Oak Ridge, about 25 miles
away.
   Kessel estimates the layoffs will have some ``ripple effect''
because there will be fewer paychecks spent on goods and services.
   George Korda, a spokesman for Mayor Victor Ashe, said,
``Obviously, in the short run it's a difficult thing. That's why
the mayor and Chamber of Commerce and TVA are cooperating on a
large-scale job fair in July, to help people who have been affected
get back on their feet, hopefully in the Knoxville area.''
   That job fair is just one of several efforts to provide TVA
employees who are losing their jobs with new opportunities. Similar
efforts are under way in Chattanooga and northern Alabama. TVA also
is putting together a job bank with cooperation of area businesses.
   ``Certainly this will have some impact,'' Korda said. ``But
overall, the area's economy is strong, and diversifying more than
ever. The outlook with a healthy TVA is very good.''

<HEAD>Remains of Composer Arrive in Europe For Burial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The remains of composer Bela Bartok
arrived in Europe from New York on Thursday for burial in his
native Hungary next week.
   A brown-painted wooden box with brass corners and orange-red wax
seals along the edges of the lid, held the remains of the master of
modern musical composition who died in 1945 and was buried in New
York's Ferncliff cemetery.
   The box stood in an otherwise empty storeroom on a lower deck of
the liner Queen Elizabeth 2, which left New York on Saturday and
arrived at its home port of Southampton in bright sunshine.
   Earlier reports said Bartok, who died of leukemia in New York in
1945, was buried in New York's Ferncliff cemetery in a steel coffin
because all who knew him were certain he would one day be
reinterred in his native land.
   ``A steel coffin would have been easier to move, but someone
cheated us in 1945,'' said the composer's younger son, Peter, 64, a
sound recording engineer from Homosassa, Fla., north of Tampa.
   ``Steel was ordered but the undertakers buried him in wood. When
we dug up our father the wood had disintegrated and there wasn't
enough left to cover my thumbnail,'' he said.
   Peter and his brother, Bela, 78, an engineer who lives in
Budapest and is president of Hungary's Unitarian Church, crossed
the ocean with their father's remains.
   The brothers will attend the funeral in Farkasret cemetery,
Budapest, July 7. Their mother is buried there, as is Hungary's
other famous modern composer, Zoltan Kodaly, who died in 1967.
   When reporters saw the box in 5 Deck Aft Recess it was
undecorated, although in New York it had been covered with ribbons
in the Hungarian red, white and green colors.
   The sons were met on the quayside by Matyas Domokos, Hungary's
ambassador to Britain, and Pat Bear, mayor of Southampton, who wore
her gold chain of office over a blue dress.
   ``We felt we had to be here to show respect to Bela Bartok,''
said Mrs. Bear.
   ``I think it is good that we are doing this _ I know Hungary
wants it,'' said the composer's elder son.
   The two sons were driven to city hall for tea and then taken on
a tour of Southampton.
   A memorial concert was scheduled at the Turner Sims Concert
Hall, part of Southampton University.
   Bartok's body was in a coffin enclosed in a shipping crate
covered with ribbons in the Hungarian colors, red, white and green.
   ``We know that Bela Bartok did not want to rest in eternal
exile, but the family for a long time were reluctant to disturb his
grave,'' said Gabor Horvath, press attache at the Hungarian embassy.
   ``It has been a longstanding wish of our government and nation
to rebury Bela Bartok in Budapest as one of Hungary's greatest sons
and our greatest composer of the 20th century,'' Horvath said.
   The diplomat said the coffin would remain on the liner overnight
for Friday's sailing to Cherbourg in France. The coffin will then
travel through France, West Germany and Austria to Hungary, where
Bartok was born at Nagyszentmiklos on March 25, 1881. His
birthplace is now in Romania and renamed Sinnicolau Mare.

<HEAD>F-16 Crashes Rekindle Controversy Over Military Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
coalition government on Thursday called for the immediate grounding
of F-16 fighter jets stationed in West Germany.
   Three U.S. Air Force F-16s crashed Wednesday in two incidents in
West Germany. The crashes, which occurred 90 miles apart, rekindled
controversy over low-level military training flights.
   ``If the F-16, which has recently piled up a number of crashes,
has a technical fault, it must be temporarily grounded,'' said
Werner Hoyer, a military expert and member of the Free Democratic
Party.
   The party is the junior partner in Kohl's coaliton goverment.
   Five F-16 fighter jets have crashed in West Germany in the last
three months.
   U.S. Air Force officials declined comment on the possible
grounding of the F-16s or on a published report that said cracked
blades might have caused one of the accidents.
   A U.S. Air Force pilot was killed Wednesday when his plane
collided with another F-16 on a training flight near Bodenheim,
about 35 miles west of Frankfurt. The other pilot ejected safely.
   Later Wednesday, another U.S. Air Force pilot ejected to safety
when his F-16 crashed in the Black Forest.
   Military air crashes in March and April triggered a storm of
public controversy after fighter jets went down near a nuclear
power plant and an ammunition dump. An F-16 also crashed into a
small village, killing the pilot and a resident on the ground.
   West German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz, in an interview with
Suedwestfunk radio, said Thursday that he had asked U.S. officials
to work with the West Germans ``to do an exact analysis of a number
of potential causes,'' of the crashes and ``to do all possible to
prevent such accidents from being repeated.''
   But Scholz added that it was premature to ground the aircraft.
The U.S. Air Force European commander, Gen. William L. Kirk, also
has said the cause of the crashes must first be determined before
making any move.
   Florian Gerster, a member of the main opposition Social
Democratic Party, told reporters in Bonn that military flights over
densely populated West Germany had reached the stage ``where it is
as if we must protect ourselves against attacks from our own air
defenses.''
   Gerster charged that West German and U.S. air forces try to
outdo each other in practicing low-level and other flight training
exercises.
   The military's unofficial Stars and Stripes newspaper said
Thursday that the U.S. Air Force recently has replaced the engines
of 31 F-16 jets ``because of potential cracks in high-speed engine
blades.''
   It said blade cracks found in some General Electric F110 engines
that are used in some F-16s were ``the likely cause'' of an April
18 crash near Erzberg, West Germany.
   Most F-16s are powered by a Pratt-Whitney engine, but the Air
Force ordered the GE F110 engines in 1984 as part of an effort to
increase competition among engine manufacturers, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Forget Polls, Expect Close Race</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Jackson meeting scheduled, inserting new grafs

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis dismissed as meaningless Thursday
new polls showing his lead over George Bush had shrunk dramatically
and said he always had anticipated ``a very tough and very
competitive race'' for the presidency.
   He refused to speculate publicly about his next big campaign
decision, the choice of a Democratic running mate. ``I'll make a
decision when I'm ready to make a decision,'' he told reporters.
   Jesse Jackson, who has pressed for an offer of the No. 2
position, will meet Monday night with Dukakis, said Dayton Duncan,
Dukakis' campaign press secretary. Duncan said Jackson and his wife
would have dinner with Dukakis and his wife at the Massachusetts
governor's Brookline home and then accompany them to the July
Fourth fireworks and Boston Pops concert alongside Boston's Charles
River.
   The aide gave no indication what Dukakis and Jackson might
discuss.
   Dukakis, in Illinois on the second day of a campaign swing
through the Midwest, told workers at a Reynolds Aluminum Co. plant
that Reagan administration talk of economic prosperity is
misleading.
   ``Too many of our families are struggling to hold on,'' he said.
   The Massachusetts governor spent most of Wednesday in Washington
talking to members of Congress including four senators often
mentioned as potential running mates.
   He planned a return trip to the Capitol on July 13, less than a
week before the Democratic National Convention.
   Aides have speculated that he might not wait until the
convention to announce his choice. But he responded that ``I
haven't made any judgment about timing'' when asked if the July 13
trip could be taken as assurance that no decision would be
announced before that date.
   ``I have the luxury of having the time and of being able to do
this thoughtfully and deliberately,'' he said. ``I'd rather spend
more time than less and make the right decision. I'm not going to
hurry it.''
   One of the senators Dukakis met with on Wednesday _ Sam Nunn of
Georgia _ took himself out of the running for a spot on the
Democratic ticket. Others with whom Dukakis met individually were
Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Bob Graham of Florida and Lloyd Bentsen
of Texas _ all from states considered critical to a Democratic
victory in the presidential election.
   During the past two months, national polls have said Dukakis
holds leads of from seven to 17 points over the Republican vice
president, but two surveys made public this week showed a much
smaller margin.
   One, by the Gallup Organization, said voters favored Dukakis
over Bush by a margin of 46 percent to 41 percent, slightly more
than the three-point margin of potential sampling error. The other,
by ABC News and Money Magazine, had 45 percent for Dukakis to 42
percent for Bush, less than the four-point margin of error.
   Asked about the new surveys, Dukakis replied, ``I can only say
what I've been saying for 16 months: Early polls are meaningless.''
   He added, ``This is a wide open race; it always has been and
this is going to be a very tough and very competitive race just as
the primary was.''
   In the past week, Dukakis has approved a new cigarette tax to
help balance his state budget and also has had questions raised
about a possible scandal involving acquisition of land for a new
state prison.
   In addition, both Bush and President Reagan have hit hard at the
Massachusetts governor, particularly on the tax issue.
   In his speech to workers at the aluminum plant, Dukakis
questioned the the Republican administration's claim to have
created millions of new jobs.
   ``Today there are more Americans working than at any time in our
history,'' he said. ``But average family income in America is right
where it was 20 years ago.'' He said new jobs opening up between
1979 and 1985 paid far less than jobs lost during that period.

<TEXT>
   A British man in custody here for allegedly trying
to smuggle helicopters to Iran claims federal agents turned the
single sale of one aircraft into a major crime, his attorney said
Thursday.
   Colin Breeze, 33, of Manchester, England, is charged with
violating U.S. export laws by trying to secretly deliver 10
military-type Sikorsky helicopters to Iran with the help of that
nation's ambassador to Spain. Customs officials also said a suspect
in the case is a man said to be a member of the Spanish royal
family.
   In Spain, the Iranian Embassy said Thursday it had no
information on the case, and that Ambassador Hadi Soleimanpour was
unavailable for comment.
   Henry M. Bugay, a public defender representing Breeze here,
Thursday blamed the U.S. Customs Service for trying to turn the
small-time broker into an international smuggler.
   ``Breeze is a fixed-wing aircraft broker who works out of his
home in Manchester,'' with no expertise in helicopter sales, Bugay
said.
   Bugay said the case began when Breeze agreed to sell one
helicopter ``for tourist, sight-seeing purposes'' to Juan Perez de
Guzman, whom he identified as a nephew of Spain's King Juan Carlos
II.
   Perez de Guzman, ``said to be a relative of the King of Spain,
is a major suspect in the case,'' confirmed Patrick O'Brien, head
of Customs here.
   However a spokesman for the royal household in Madrid told The
Associated Press they have no record of Perez de Guzman, and
O'Brien said Customs had not established if the man was indeed a
relative of the king.
   Bugay said that when Breeze unknowingly approached a
confidential informant for the Customs service about the
helicopter, the informant pushed him to expand the deal, eventually
raising it to 10 helicopters with Perez de Guzman's cooperation.
   Breeze ``was led down the garden path,'' said Bugay. ``The
original deal was concerning one single helicopter ... the whole
case, we believe, borders on entrapment.''
   The attorney refused to say whether Breeze knew Iran was the
eventual buyer of the helicopters, but acknowledged his client
understood the deal was ``bordering on a gray area.''
   Customs accuses Breeze of knowingly arranging the sale of the 10
Sikorsky helicopters to a European company secretly owned by Iran,
and O'Brien said investigators have tapes of many conversations
about the deal.
   The helicopters were on sale in Jordan for $6.8 million, but the
final price for the sale and delivery to Iran was to be $30
million, Customs said.
   Soleimanpour was to take a cut of the deal, although at the last
minute he delayed the sale by trying to raise his percentage, said
O'Brien.
   O'Brien said although Breeze was unaware of it, Customs had
discovered that the deal was falling through because someone else
had made a higher bid. They arrested Breeze at the Fort Lauderdale
airport Tuesday because they feared he would not return to the
United States when he discovered the deal was off.
   Breeze is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
south of Miami, and goes before a magistrate Friday for a full bond
hearing.

   Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, a close
adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is now the overseer of ideology in
the Communist Party, a senior party official said Thursday.
   Byelorussian party head Yefrem Sokolov was asked at a news
conference to outline the individual responsibilities of the 13
members of the ruling Politburo following a complaint by a delegate
to the Communist Party's national conference that he did not know
which leader does what.
   ``I may make some mistakes,'' Sokolov said. ``You know very well
that Yakovlev is responsible for ideology.''
   He said Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, who was once thought
to have the key task of overseeing ideology, ``is responsible for
organizational work in the Politburo.''
   Central Committee official Georgy Kryuchkov said Ligachev chairs
the sessions of the policy-making body's secretariat, which is
responsible for day-to-day handling of party affairs. That is a job
that customarily falls to the No. 2 member of the ruling Politburo.
   There were unconfirmed reports last spring that Ligachev had
lost the ideology portfolio after engineering a public attack on
Gorbachev's harsh criticism of the nation's Stalinist past.
   Neither Sokolov nor Kryuchkov would confirm or deny when pressed
by reporters that Ligachev has specifically lost the ideology
portfolio.
   ``He was dealing with, and is dealing with, these questions,''
said Kryuchkov. ``He has never relinquished these duties.''
   Sokolov made it clear, however, that he considered that all
Politburo members deal with ideology, leaving unclear whether
Ligachev has any special responsiblities in that field.
   Rumors that Ligachev had lost the key ideology portfolio
surfaced after the publication of a letter March 13 from Leningrad
teacher Nina Andreyeva.
   Mrs. Andreyeva attacked the reforms and the criticism of Josef
Stalin that has grown in the Soviet media. The publication of her
letter in the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya triggered protest from
intellectuals and led to a public outcry and rebuke from the party
newspaper Pravda in April.
   Pravda editor Viktor G. Afanasyev confirmed Monday Mrs.
Andreyeva had written a reply to that article, but he declined to
give details.
   Kryuchkov said Thursday Mrs. Andreyeva had written a letter to
the conference presidium. He said it was similar to her other
letter but declined to elaborate.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
announced Thursday by the Supreme Court.
   
   YOUNG KILLERS
   
   The court agreed to consider banning the death penalty for all
juvenile murderers, a day after issuing a decision that could end
capital punishment for killers not yet 16 when they committed their
crimes.
   The justices said they will decide sometime next year whether
use of the death penalty for anyone under 18 when the crime was
committed violates the Constitution's ban on ``cruel and unusual
punishment.''
   The cases are High vs. Zant, 87-5666, and Wilkins vs. Missouri,
87-6026.
   
   AGENT ORANGE
   
   The court apparently removed the last legal obstacle to a $180
million settlement between Vietnam veterans and manufacturers of
the herbicide Agent Orange.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissed
lawsuits by about 300 veterans who challenged the settlement, in
which some 120,000 others are expected to participate.
   The cases are Lombardi vs. Dow Chemical, 87-436, and Krupkin vs.
Dow Chemical, 87-620.
   
   BIAS
   
   The court agreed to study alleged race discrimination in Alaskan
salmon canneries, setting the stage for an important sequel to a
one-day-old ruling that makes it easier for workers to prove their
bosses are guilty of illegal bias.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by two companies
based in Washington state and Oregon that operate canneries in
Alaska.
   The case is Wards Cove vs. Antonio, 87-1387.
   
   DEATH PENALTY
   
   The court agreed to hear the appeal of a Texas man sentenced to
death who, the justices were told, has the reasoning capacity of a
7-year-old.
   The justices said they will study arguments that executing
Johnny Paul Penry for the Oct. 25, 1979, killing of Pamela
Carpenter would be ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the
Constitution's Eighth Amendment.
   The case is Penry vs. McCotter, 87-6177.
   
   DEFENSE CONTRACTOR
   
   The court let stand a ruling that forced a defense contractor to
pay damages for an on-duty accident involving a Navy pilot.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Grumman
Aerospace Corp., ordered to pay $840,556 to the family of the pilot
who died when his plane crashed off the California coast in 1979.
   The case is Grumman vs. Shaw, 85-1529.
   
   LAWYERS ADS
   
   The court agreed to decide whether states may ban virtually all
lawyer advertisements featuring testimonials or client endorsements.
   The justices said they will review a California rule that
presumes such ads are false or misleading.
   The case is Oring vs. California, 87-1224.
   
   AIRBAGS
   
   The court rejected the appeal of a Minnesota woman severely
injured in a 1983 car crash, turning away arguments that her car's
manufacturer negligently failed to install airbags.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings dismissing that
portion of Jan Marie Wickstrom's product-liability lawsuit against
Toyota Motor Corp. and its U.S. subsidiaries.
   The case is Wickstrom vs. Maplewood Toyota, 87-1881.
   
   CONGRESSMAN
   
   The court refused to kill a libel lawsuit against a Tennessee
congressman who criticized a legal services lawyer.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, let stand a ruling that Rep. Don
Sundquist, R-Tenn., may be sued for statements he made in a letter
to the U.S. attorney general. The lawsuit also alleges he repeated
the libelous statements in a news release.
   The case is Sundquist vs. Chastain, 87-1756.

   An executive-branch task force recommended
Thursday that businesses receiving government contracts be required
to show they plan to have drug-free workplaces.
   The National Drug Policy Board, headed by Attorney General Edwin
Meese III, met with President Reagan at the White House, and later
released a summary of recommendations the president had sought in
his campaign against drug abuse.
   Among the chief recommendations was a call by the task force to
have private companies adopt the sort of drug-testing program that
Reagan called for at the federal government level in an executive
order he signed on Sept. 15, 1986.
   The task force also recommended that federal aid to education be
subject to a college or university certifying that it has an
effective anti-drug program. It urged that federal student
financial aid be withheld from young people with drug offenses.
   The board also lent its support to the administration's prior
advocacy of legislation authorizing the death penalty for
defendants convicted of murder while engaged in ``a continuing drug
enterprise.''
   The board, consisting of top law enforcement and drug policy
experts, said a way should be found to make drug treatment programs
more accountable by requiring users to share the cost and to submit
to drug tests after completing such programs.
   It also recommended increased international drug eradication
efforts and economic assistance for developing countries whose
business health often depends on the drug trade.
   Reagan said in a statement that he plans to present the
recommendations next week to a joint executive-legislative branch
drug task force.
   The White House, however, acknowledged in a fact sheet that
``congressional Democrats have yet to appoint their members to the
task force.''
   Sources close to House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, House
Majority Leader Thomas Foley of Washington and Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia have said the Democrats do
not plan to participate in Reagan's joint task force.
   Reagan said in his statement that the drug policy board's work
``builds upon the solid foundation already laid by this
administration's strategy to reduce the supply and demand for
illegal drugs.''
   ``These recommendations send a strong message to drug law
offenders, including users and traffickers,'' it said. ``I join the
chairman (Meese) in emphasizing that we cannot tolerate drug users
who provide the illegal market for the drugs or who benefit from
the taxpayers' generosity through federal grants, contracts or
loans.''
   ``We must hold people responsible for their drug use through
accountable treatment programs and through our parole and probation
systems,'' Reagan's statement said.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said ``The administration
is desperate to come up with anything that sounds like a policy,
because of its failure to have one for 7 1@2 years. The
administration's emphasis on penalizing users is just a new brush
to paint the same tired old slogans, `zero tolerance' and `just say
no.'
   ``The fact that Attorney General Meese heads the policy board
making today's recommendations,'' said Rangel, ``demonstrates one
of the most disturbing aspects: no one is in charge full time of
finding answers to the drug crisis.''
   ``The administration's support of the death penalty,'' Rangel
said, ``is an emotionally charged hollow gesture to create the
impression that something is being done about the problem, an
effort to shift attention away from a needed comprehensive attack
against drugs.''

   The United States praised the South Korean
government Thursday for releasing a group of political prisoners,
notably Kim Keun Tae, an opposition leader held since 1985 for
organizing protest meetings.
   ``We welcome this amnesty for some of Korea's political
prisoners as another forward step in the continuing process of
democratization,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   The government of President Rho Tae-woo released Kim and nearly
four dozen other political prisoners in an image-enhancing
operation and at the urging of U.S. officials and human rights
advocates.
   Mrs. Oakley also welcomed the Rho government's recent proposals
for increased contacts between North Korean and South Korea.
   ``Exchanges of students and other academics, freedom of
dissemination of information from the other side, are sound ideas
we hope will evoke a positive response from North Korea,'' she said.
   Under the southern plan, the exchanges would be permitted if the
North Koreans pledged to renounce terrorism.
   ``The way to peace is for North Korea to join the rest of the
international community in constructive cooperation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House, on the heels of revelations
that five employees were relieved of their duties as authorities
investigate drug use, said today it will soon begin mandatory,
random drug tests.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the months-old investigation,
which has resulted in the dismissal of two National Security
Council clerks and the suspension of three White House guards,
``illustrates all too well the terrible fact of drug use in our
society.''
   Reagan, asked at a picture-taking session about the
developments, first reported in today's Washington Post, said,
``Yes, of course I am upset that it (drug use) is found anywhere.''
   Asked if he thought his security had ever been endangered, the
president replied, ``No, I don't think so.''
   Reagan, posing with Republican congressmen who had come to the
White House to discuss drug policy options, said that if White
House workers are found to have used drugs he would like to see
them enter drug treatment programs.
   ``If it was just a case of using'' drugs, Reagan said, ``then I
would like to see us do our best to get them into a drug-treatment
organization with a view to attempting a cure. ... Let the people
know that then we will do our best to salvage anyone who has been a
victim.''
   On Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Liz Murphy said the two
clerks had ``admitted drug use and were separated from the NSC.''
   Fitzwater today told reporters that the clerks ``agreed to
resign'' several months ago, ``during the winter.''
   Asked at what level the NSC clerks worked, Fitzwater said he
could not specify except to say they were at the ``secretary
level.''
   Pressed to say whether the two were involved in handling
sensitive matters, he responded, ``It's fair to assume that
everyone who works at the NSC has access to sensitive material.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan, who has led a
campaign to ``just say no to drugs,'' have known of the
investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Secret
Service ``for several months.
   ``It was started last winter when allegations were brought to
the attention of the Secret Service,'' Fitzwater said. He said the
tip had come from a member of the Uniformed Division, whose
officers guard the Executive Mansion. But the White House later
today corrected Fitzwater's statement, saying the information had
come from outside the Secret Service.
   Fitzwater would not say today what drugs had been involved.
   The Post, however, quoted an unnamed source as saying that a
transaction involving cocaine had taken place on the White House
grounds. Fitzwater said today there was no evidence produced by the
investigation so far to substantiate that any such drug sales
occurred.
   Fitzwater said that White House employees will be sent a letter
giving them 60 days' notice of the mandatory, random drug testing.
   Fitzwater said the tests will be conducted six times a year,
with each round involving about 2 percent of the approximately
1,600 employees of the executive office of the president.
   Included are employees of the Office of Management and Budget,
the National Security Council and the office of the vice president
and first lady.
   The spokesman also said that the Secret Service will begin on
July 13 a program of pre-employment drug testing for job applicants.
   ``We have been advised that drugs were not used or sold on the
White House premises and there was no breach of security,'' he
said, although Fitzwater cautioned that the investigation by the
U.S. attorney's office, Secret Service and DEA was continuing.
   Names of the five employees were not released.
   Evidence in the investigation, begun several months ago, has
been turned over to the U.S. attorney's office, Secret Service
spokesman Robert Snow said Wednesday.
   ``No arrests have been made,'' Snow said. ``These are only
administrative actions at this point.''
   Two of the guards were relieved of their duties last Friday. The
third was placed on leave Monday. It was not clear when the NSC
clerks were fired.
   Asked why the clerks were no longer on the payroll while the
Secret Service officers were on paid leave, Fitzwater said the
guards have the protection of civil service appeal processes while
members of the executive office serve at the pleasure of the
president.
   In addition to guarding the White House grounds, uniformed
members of the Secret Service guard the vice president's home and
foreign embassies. They also travel with the president to provide
security.
   The NSC, chaired by the president, advises the president on
matters of national security.

<HEAD>Seattle Archdiocese Creates Ministry To Homosexuals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seattle Archdiocese will assume sponsorship
of Mass for homosexuals, the archbishop announced Thursday, but the
group that had run the ministry is divided over whether to accept
the change or move elsewhere.
   While accepting homosexuals within the church, Archbishop
Raymond G. Hunthausen made clear that ``church teaching rejects
homosexual acts.''
   The Seattle chapter of Dignity, a group for homosexual
Catholics, was evenly split Sunday in a vote on whether to endorse
Hunthausen's decision or to move the Mass elsewhere. Calls to the
organization's office Thursday were answered by a recording.
   ``Hunthausen is the best bishop we have in the country,'' an
unidentified Dignity spokesman told The Seattle Times after
Sunday's vote.
   The spokesman said the group was convinced Dignity would never
have been pushed out except for Vatican pressure on Hunthausen, who
was relieved of some duties in 1986 because of his tolerance of the
group.
   Hunthausen said the decision was ``in response to the challenge
offered'' in a Sept. 30, 1985, letter from Rome in which he was
strongly criticized for allowing Dignity to celebrate weekly Mass
in St. Joseph's Church in Seattle.
   ``For 16 years, Dignity has assumed a ministry to Catholic gay
and lesbian persons which has included a celebration of weekly
liturgy,'' Hunthausen said. ``However, because Dignity has taken
public positions that are contrary to the teaching of the church,
Dignity will no longer retain the sponsorship of the celebration of
the Eucharist that has taken place at St. Joseph's Church.''
   Hunthausen said he was appointing the Rev. Gerald Stanley,
pastor of St. Edward's Church here, to coordinate the ministry
along with other priests.
   The ministry ``must be based on Catholic moral teaching,''
Hunthausen said. ``Such teaching must ensure that the church's
position on human sexuality is presented clearly and without
ambiguity.
   ``Church teaching rejects homosexual acts, but not homosexual
people.''
   The 1985 letter critical of Hunthausen followed a 1983
``apostolic visitation'' in which a delegation examined whether the
bishop was lax in certain areas of his ministry.
   In September 1986, the Vatican appointed an auxiliary bishop to
relieve Hunthausen of certain duties, including authority over
ministering to homosexuals.
   That unprecedented move upset many U.S. bishops, and the Vatican
last year restored Hunthausen's powers, appointed Coadjutor
Archbishop Thomas J. Murphy to assist him and named a three-bishop
commission to review Hunthausen's administration.
   In 1983, Hunthausen delivered, on videotape, the welcoming
address at Dignity's national convention in Seattle and permitted
the group to celebrate Mass at St. James Cathedral. He was
upbraided for that in the 1985 letter by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger,
prefect for the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, who
wrote that the archdiocese should not support a group that doesn't
accept church teaching ``concerning the intrinsic evil of
homosexual activity.''
   Dignity, with more than 100 chapters, has sponsored Mass,
sacraments, programs, and worked for homosexual Catholics for more
than 20 years. The organization maintains homosexuals can express
their sexuality in a morally responsible way.
   But the group has been forced out of churches in several cities,
including New York and San Diego, since a 1986 Vatican letter
labeled all homosexual activity a sin and said even a tendency
toward homosexuality is an ``objective disorder.''
   The directive warned bishops not to support any group that
condones homosexual activity.
   Hunthausen's decision follows the lead of Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin, a member of the commission overseeing Hunthausen. In
May, Bernardin said his Chicago Archdiocese would take over the
Mass and ministry to Catholic homosexuals.
   Bernardin's decision was initially hailed by gay activists as an
acceptable alternative to a ban of the group from church property,
but the issue has since split Chicago's homosexual Catholic
community.
   Dissidents have begun celebrating Mass in a Lutheran church in
defiance of Bernardin's decision.
   In San Francisco, Archbishop John Quinn, another commission
member, permits the Dignity chapter to meet in a Catholic church.
   ``The ground rules for this thing are that so long as they don't
take a public position in opposition to church teaching, they're as
welcome as anybody else,'' said archdiocesan spokesman Norman
Phillips.

   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods fell 0.6 percent in May as a sharp drop in demand for
aircraft offset strength in other areas, the government reported
Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said factory orders declined $1.36
billion to a seasonally adjusted $217.97 billion in May. It was the
largest one month decline since a 1.4 percent plunge last August.
   Orders had been up sharply in the previous two months, rising by
1.5 percent in April and 1.6 percent in March. Analysts said the
one-month breather would be good for the economy, giving factories
more time to catch up with a backlog of unfilled orders.
   ``Orders had been growing at an unsustainably high rate,'' said
Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass. ``This is a welcome sign because it eases the pressure a bit
on an industrial sector that is operating at close to full
capacity.''
   The weakness in May was confined to the transportation sector,
which fell 10.2 percent to $28.2 billion because of a big drop in
orders for new aircraft. Without this weakness, orders would have
climbed a healthy 1 percent during the month.
   Analysts said orders were likely to jump sharply in June as
aircraft demand rebounds reflecting large orders placed with the
Boeing Co.
   The U.S. manufacturing sector is the star of the economy this
year because of a boom in exports brought about by the weaker
dollar.
   The setback in May came in orders for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years. They declined 1.9 percent,
also the biggest drop since August. A week ago in an advance
report, the decline was put at a slightly larger 2.2 percent.
   Orders for military equipment plunged 19.5 percent to $8.02
billion while orders in the category of non-defense capital
investment fell 5.9 percent to $31.52 billion. Analysts said both
of those declines were related to the drop in aircraft orders.
   Orders for non-durable goods rose 0.8 percent to $102.9 billion
with most of the increase coming in tobacco products. Analysts said
this represented price increases and a boost in export sales.
   Shipments of manufactured goods rose 1.4 percent in May to
$217.8 billion, the fourth consecutive month that shipments have
increased.

   Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre defied the
pope and consecrated four bishops Thursday, causing the first Roman
Catholic schism in a century and his own expulsion from the church
that was his life for 60 years.
   The 82-year-old rebel prelate, who has spent a generation
fighting the ``satanic influence'' of modernism, rejected a
last-minute appeal from Pope John Paul II. He looked pale and tired
under his white, gold-embroidered miter as he conducted the rite
that split the faith for the first time since 1870.
   Lefebvre performed the historic act in a huge, sweltering tent
in a meadow below the seminary he founded in this hillside hamlet
18 years ago and named the St. Pius X Fraternity, for the pope who
condemned modernism in a 1907 encyclical.
   His chosen Mass, as usual, was the 16th century Tridentine rite
in Latin, which was replaced by the vernacular under the 1962-65
Second Vatican Council reforms he detests.
   A Vatican statement issued less than two hours later condemned
the consecrations as an act of schism, a formal break with the Holy
See that had not occurred since the so-called Old Catholics
rebelled when the doctrine of papal infallibility was proclaimed.
   It announced the excommunication of Lefebvre and the four new
bishops _ British, French, Spanish and Swiss graduates of
traditionalist seminaries _ for refusing to submit to papal
authority. The Briton, Richard Williamson, 48, heads a
traditionalist seminary in Ridgefield, Conn.
   An excommunicated Catholic is not permitted to receive the
church's sacraments, which include communion and extreme unction,
previously known as last rites.
   ``No one is put to hell or condemned,'' a Vatican official said,
on condition of anonymity. ``He (Lefebvre) has put himself outside
the communion of the church and takes responsibility before God.''
   During the four-hour ceremony, the French archbishop told
thousands who crowded the tent that he was creating new bishops as
an ``operation of survival'' for his movement, to ensure continuity
``of the church of all times.''
   Lefebvre says the church has been infiltrated by ``wolves and
thieves'' and is being consumed by the ``cancer of liberalism.''
   ``The Lord may soon call me home,'' he said Thursday. ``I must
not leave you orphaned,'' with no one to ordain new traditionalist
priests.
   John Paul sent Lefebvre a telegram Wednesday urging him ``not to
betray the episcopate'' and summoning him to Rome. At the
consecration, his audience laughed when the archbishop said the
pope sent the official car of the papal nuncio to take him to Rome
the same night.
   He called the Vatican sanctions ``null and void'' and told his
supporters ``not to pay any attention'' to them. He said canon law
permits his actions ``in a state of emergency,'' which the Vatican
denies.
   In a homily beginning the ceremony, he renewed his argument that
the Vatican, not he, was on a ``schismatic'' course because it
accepted ``errors once condemned'' that were leading to
``destruction of the church.''
   Among those errors, he said, were ``ecumenism, communism,
socialism, and Zionism.''
   ``This is not a schism. We are not schismatic,'' he said.
``There is no question at all of this. We are here to manifest our
attachment to the church of all times.
   ``We are convinced we are following the call of God. We will
wait until Rome recognizes the value of our witness.''
   Applause interrupted Lefebvre several times. A lone woman
protester, shouted ``We remain faithful to the pope!'' in Italian,
but no reaction was noticeable in the tent.
   On Wednesday, the archbishop ordained 16 traditionalist priests,
bringing to nearly 250 the number he has ordained in defiance of
the Vatican since Pope Paul VI suspended him from priestly
functions in 1976.
   Lefebvre himself was ordained in 1929 after obtaining degrees in
philosophy and theology. Before his rebellion, he was a missionary,
archbishop and papal representative in Africa and a member of the
commission that prepared the Second Vatican Council, whose reforms
he rejected.
   A Vatican spokesman has said that Lefebvre's supporters numbered
80,000 to 100,000, but other Vatican officials have said about half
a million people turn to his priests for various church functions.
   Thousands of people who could not get into the tent Thursday
listened to loudspeakers outside. For those who did not understand
French, priests gave summaries of the homily in German and English
of Lebvre's homily.
   About 20 small confessionals were set up around the tent and
many people used them. Organizers estimated the total audience at
nearly 10,000.
   Just before noon, Lefebvre ended the consecration ceremony by
laying his hands on the four bishops as they knelt before him,
facing the altar. They then received the symbols of office: miter,
ring and crooked pastoral staff.
   Assisting him was Antonio de Castro Mayer, the only Catholic
bishop who has publicly supported Lefebvre.
   Ordained as bishops and excommunicated Thursday were Williamson,
a convert from the Anglican church; Bernard Tissier de Mallerais,
43, secretary-general of Lefebvre's fraternity; Alfonso de
Galarreta, 31, Spanish-born head of the seminary in La Reja,
Argentina, and Bernard Fellay, 30, a Swiss who is chief
administrator of the fraternity.

   The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday
approved comprehensive anti-drug legislation, including
establishment of a national seven-day waiting period before
purchasers can take possession of handguns.
   The gun provision passed by voice vote. But James Jay Baker,
chief lobbyist for the National Rife Association, said his group
will try to separate the waiting-period amendment from the overall
bill, and force a separate vote on the provision before the full
House.
   Other key portions of the drug bill would:
   _Restrict the availability of chemicals used to refine cocaine
or make dangerous drugs such as amphetamines and PCP.
   _Create a cabinet-level drug czar to develop and carry out a
national anti-drug strategy.
   _Authorize $1.75 billion in 50-50 matching grants over the next
four years for state and local anti-drug enforcement efforts.
   _Deny most federal benefits to persons with two or more
convictions on drug offenses unless they complete a rehabilitation
program.
   _Establish a mandatory five-year prison sentence for possession
of ``crack'' cocaine in certain circumstances.
   The handgun waiting period would allow local police time to
conduct a background check into criminal records or a history of
mental incompetency _ but such a search would not be required by
the legislation.
   The provision would leave intact any state law that is stronger
than the federal language, but supercede weaker laws. Twenty-two
states have waiting periods, with California's the longest at 15
days.
   A purchaser could be exempted from the waiting period by
presenting a certificate from police stating that the purchaser's
life was threatened.
   The waiting period was sponsored by Rep. Edward Feighan, D-Ohio,
and supported strongly by law enforcement groups and Sarah Brady,
wife of presidential press secretary James Brady _ who was shot
with a handgun during the 1981 assasination attempt on President
Reagan. The police groups said drug dealers would purchase weapons
in states with weak gun laws.
   ``We will be incapable of making substantial headway in our war
against drug trafficking unless we are also prepared to disarm drug
dealers and drug traffickers and drug users,'' Feighan said.
   The provision withstood a challenge from Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., who attempted to substitute an amendment requiring that a
system be developed to identify felons who attempt to buy firearms.
   The McCollum substitute was defeated, 22-12.
   ``I'm delighted, thrilled, very proud of the Judiciary
Committee,'' Mrs. Brady said after the committee vote. An official
of Handgun Control Inc., she told reporters, ``I think this ensures
that we're going to see this enacted this year. And I think it's
going to save lives.''
   Rep. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, said the waiting period is
``clearly going to provide a cooling-off period, but it is going to
be a hit-and-miss situation under our current situation.''
   Baker, the NRA lobbyist, said, ``We don't think that waiting
periods work. We think that law-abiding citizens will be the only
ones affected and criminals will continued to evade the law.''
   A similar waiting-period bill sponsored by Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, is pending in the Senate Judiciary constitution
subcommittee.

   Republican leaders, accusing the Democrats of
hiding true tax-and-spend policies in a bland platform, promised
Thursday to give the American people a GOP platform that spells out
exactly where the party stands.
   The Republican platform committee also heard two former rivals
to George Bush, Sen. Bob Dole and Rep. Jack Kemp, emphasize a need
for the Republicans to attract independent and cross-over
Democratic voters and to bring more members of minority groups into
the party.
   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the party chairman, opened the committee's
hearing with an attack on the ``bland and featureless'' document
that the Democrats' platform committee approved last Saturday in
Denver.
   The Democrats ``are trying to hide their true policies,'' said
Fahrenkopf. ``Their platform is truly a facade with no interior
drafted by politicians who have chosen to avoid the issues of the
election of 1988.'' He challenged Michael Dukakis and the Democrats
``to meet us on the battlefield of ideas in 1988.''
   Sen. Bob Kasten, R-Wis., one of the platform writers, said the
only way for Democrats to get elected is to ``adopt outright
Republican policies of economic growth and freedom or hide their
liberal policies behind a facade of bogus consensus.''
   As the election nears, he said, ``the disguise will come off and
Michael Dukakis will be exposed for the narrow-minded, liberal wolf
in sheep's cothing that he really is.''
   Both Dole and Kemp said after testifying to the platform
committee that Bush was closing in on Dukakis in polls because the
public is taking a closer look at the Massachusetts governor.
   ``For the last several weeks he hasn't had Jesse Jackson to
beat,'' said Dole. ``Now people are starting to focus on who is
this Dukakis and how did he get here. ... He's a true,
Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy liberal.''
   Kemp said Dukakis ``is not the center of the American political
mainstream that he looked like when he was campaigning against
Jesse Jackson. He is from the McGovern wing of the Democratic
Party.''
   Kemp told reporters he does not expect to be picked by Bush as a
running mate, but said Dole might be.
   ``I'm not after it because I don't think it's going to be
offered,'' said Kemp, adding that from ``all of the signals, all of
the press reports coming out of the Bush campaign, it sounds to me
like they're leaning to Bob Dole.''
   Dole, asked if he wanted the No. 2 job, said, ``I don't think
it's a question of wanting it. ... It's a question of winning the
election, helping your party and trying to help your country. I'd
want to be majority leader if I had my choice.''
   The Kansas senator, who was Gerald Ford's running mate in 1976,
was majority leader until the Democrats regained control of the
Senate in the 1986 elections.
   Dole, in his testimony, urged the party to fashion a platform
that pays special attention to the needs of children, including new
child-care grants for states _ paid for by phasing out the child
care tax-credit for high income families.
   Dole said the Democrats kept their platform short because ``they
don't have much to talk about. ... I mean, who wants to talk about
raising your taxes and more regulation and more spending?''
   Kemp said the party needs to expand its ranks and be more like
``the party of Lincoln.''
   ``The Democrats measure compassion by how many people are on
welfare. I think we ought to tell the American people we're going
to measure compassion by how few people need welfare,'' said Kemp.
   The platform committee also heard Robert Vernon, an assistant
police chief of Los Angeles, call for stiff measures against drugs
and drug-related crime.
   ``I truly believe we are approaching a civilization crisis _ a
literal civilization crisis,'' said Vernon. He called for a World
War II-like mobilization to fight drugs, including creation of a
national drug czar and depriving drug users of driver's licenses
and other social privileges.
   A businessman, Barry Baszile, testified that drug dealers are
entrepreneurs, too, and might turn to legal businesses if economic
development funds were available in the inner cities.

   The nation's wheat stockpile on June 1 was
about 1.27 billion bushels, down 30 percent from a year ago, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Even so, the June 1 inventory _ wheat left over from previous
harvests _ was about 30 million bushels larger than had been
predicted by USDA analysts.
   The quarterly report showed that 520 million bushels were stored
on farms, down 7 percent from a year ago. Off-farm holdings totaled
746 million bushels, down 41 percent.
   Corn in storage was estimated at 5.83 billion bushels, down 8
percent from Juine 1, 1987. Farm storage accounted for 3.24 billion
bushels, or 56 percent of the total. The farm corn holdings were
down 7 percent from a year earlier.
   Soybean inventories, at 655 million bushels, were down 22
percent from June 1, 1987. Farm stocks were estimated at 304
million bushels, up 8 percent from last year. Off-farm soybeans
were shown at 351 million bushels, down 37 percent from June 1,
1987.
   Other June 1 grain inventory estimates, included:
   _Barley, at 321 million bushels, was down 4 percent from June 1,
1987. Farm stocks were estimated at 193 million bushels, about the
same as a year ago, and accounted for 60 percent of the total.
   _Oats were estimated at 112 million bushels, down 16 percent
from a year earlier. Farm stocks, at 76.8 million bushels, were
down 26 percent. The estimated off-farm supply of 35.1 million
bushels was up 19 percent, however.
   _Sorghum totaled 814 million bushels, a 2 percent decline from
June 1, 1987. Off-farm holdings accounted for 709 million bushels,
or 87 percent of the total.

   The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared away the
last legal obstacle to a multimillion-dollar settlement between
Vietnam veterans and manufacturers of the herbicide Agent Orange.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissed
lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged the 1984
settlement.
   ``We've been waiting for four years for this appeals process to
end,'' said Frank McCarthy, president of the Vietnam Veterans Agent
Orange Victims Inc.
   ``The money will be put to good use _ most of all, a lot of
children who aren't getting help will begin to receive that help
now for their birth defects,'' McCarthy said.
   Agent Orange, which was sprayed over Southeast Asia during the
1960s by the U.S. military as a defoliant, contains highly toxic
dioxin. Veterans contend that exposure to it causes cancer and
other illnesses. They say Agent Orange exposure caused miscarriages
by wives of servicemen and birth defects in their children.
   The $180 million settlement has grown and, with interest, now
totals about $240 million.
   Estimates on how many people will receive some payment from the
settlement fund range as high as 250,000.
   The chemical companies sued over their making Agent Orange were
Monsanto, Dow, Uniroyal, Hercules, T.H. Agriculture and Nutrition,
Diamond Shamrock and Thompson.
   ``We are pleased,'' Dow spokeswoman Pat Brink said after the
high court's action Thursday. `What pleases us the most is that the
veterans will now get the money they've been waiting for.''
   She noted, however, that Dow has never conceded that Agent
Orange was responsible for any health problems.
   The lawsuit acted on Thursday was filed by veterans who opted
out of the huge class action lawsuit that ended in a settlement.
   The smaller suit was dismissed when a federal judge ruled that
the Agent Orange manufacturers were immune from being sued over the
alleged health effects of the herbicide.
   The ensuing appeals from that ruling had been pending before the
nation's highest court for months, held until a key decision about
government contractors' legal liability.
   Three days ago, the court ruled that government contractors
cannot be sued over government-approved design defects unless the
contractors failed to notify the government about hazards they knew
about.
   U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein threw out the suits filed by
the 300 veterans, relying on three findings:
   _That no plaintiff could prove a particular illness was caused
by Agent Orange.
   _That no plaintiff could prove which defendant manufactured the
Agent Orange that allegedly caused his or her injury.
   _And that all the claims were barred by the military contractor
defense.
   His dismissal was upheld by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.

   A former Continental Illinois National Bank &
Trust Co. officer and an ex-banker from Oklahoma accused of
contributing to Continental's near collapse pleaded guilty Thursday
to criminal charges.
   John R. Lytle pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds and
William G. Patterson pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting Lytle
before U.S. District Judge Milton I. Shadur.
   Shadur had been scheduled to preside over a retrial of the men
on charges of wire fraud and misapplication of bank funds, after
the defendants' initial trial ended with a deadlocked jury two
months ago.
   Lytle, 53, a former Continental vice president, was accused of
taking on millions of dollars in risky loans from customers of Penn
Square Bank of Oklahoma City in return for alleged kickbacks.
   Patterson, 38, former head of energy lending at Penn Square, was
accused of arranging the kickbacks, in the form of $585,000 worth
of unsecured personal loans to Lytle between 1980 and 1982.
   Each man faces up to five years' imprisonment and a $5,000 fine,
said Shadur, who set sentencing for Aug. 30.
   The plea agreement reached by prosecutors and defense attorneys
will avert the need for another long trial like the 6{-week
proceeding that ended May 3 when a jury said it was deadlocked
after deliberating five days.
   The panel, however, cleared a third defendant, Oklahoma drilling
contractor Jere Sturgis, of wire fraud charges for allegedly
participating in a purported scheme to defraud Continental.
   ``As far as we're concerned, this is it. This puts to rest the
Continental Bank chapter, book, encyclopedia, whatever you want to
call it,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Joesph Duffy said after Shadur
accepted the plea agreement. ``The object was justice, and we think
there's justice in the guilty plea.''
   Shadur last month approved a retrial of Lytle and Patterson at
the request of prosecutors, who cited the fact that 11 jurors had
voted to convict the pair and one had held out for acquittal.
   Penn Square failed in 1982, and Continental came close to
collapse two years later after the largest run on deposits in
banking history. The government kept Continental's doors open with
a $4.5 billion bailout.
   Prosecutors charged that Patterson manipulated Lytle and Sturgis
in schemes to save his own failing bank.
   The government accused Lytle, caught in spiraling personal debt
to finance a luxurious lifestyle, of accepting kickbacks from
Patterson in exchange for buying risky energy loans from Penn
Square for Continental.
   Attorneys for Lytle and Patterson contended Continental was
saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive
lending policy, not because of a fraud scheme.

   A U.S. inspection team was headed to Moscow to
carry out the first ``baseline inspection'' under the treaty signed
last December to eliminate superpower medium-range nuclear
missiles, officials said Thursday.
   A Soviet team also was expected to announce a visit to the
United States starting on Friday, the beginning of a 60-day period
during which the two sides may inspect scores of sites associated
with the missiles to be eliminated.
   The ``baseline inspections'' are to verify the exact number of
missiles and related components to be destroyed under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty signed at the Washington
summit last Dec. 9.
   At 12:30 EDT on Thursday, the United States notified the Soviet
Union through a new Risk Reduction Center located in the State
Department that a team headed by Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, chief of
the On-Site Inspection Agency, would arrive in Moscow at about 3:30
p.m. (Moscow time).
   ``They will travel to the Soviet Union on a U.S. Air Force C-141
from Rhein-Main Air Force Base'' near Frankfurt, West Germany, the
Pentagon said in a statement.
   Under the terms of the treaty, the two sides must give each
other 16 hours' notice of their intent to make an inspection. The
U.S. team had not given notice of the exact sites to be inspected,
preferring to wait as late as possible, said Kendell Pease, a
spokesman for the American agency.
   In addition to the short-notice spot inspections, the INF treaty
allows the Soviets to station up to 30 inspectors for the next 13
years in Magna, Utah, site of Hercules Plant No. 1, where
medium-range American missiles were produced.
   The U.S. government, in turn, has the right to station
inspectors near a Soviet missile-producing site, the Votkinsk
Machine Building Plant.
   The treaty, the first to allow such on-site inspection, is
viewed as a trial for the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weapons
by 30-50 percent, and involve much more complicated verification
procedures.

   The Reagan White House, chafing over
revelations of drug abuse by presidential employees in sensitive
jobs, announced Thursday that all 1,600 workers on its payroll will
be subject to random narcotics tests in about 60 days.
   President Reagan said he was not surprised by the disclosure
that two National Security Council clerks resigned and three Secret
Service officers were suspended during a drug probe. ``We've known
this for some time, and the investigation goes on,'' he said.
``This problem crosses all kinds of lines,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan did say that ``I am upset.'' Nancy Reagan, who has been
carrying a ``just-say-no'' message to America's youth, said ``drugs
are everywhere.'' And spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said private
business should use the sort of random drug-testing program the
White House plans to invoke shortly after Labor Day.
   Neither the White House nor the U.S. Secret Service would
describe what drugs were involved in the investigation, which led
to the resignations of the two NSC clerks and placement of three
Uniformed Division officers on administrative leave. The Washington
Post said the probe focused on cocaine use.
   The members of the Uniformed Division protect the White House
grounds, and people who work for the National Security Council have
access to highly sensitive government material.
   The Post, which first reported the drug investigation and
suspensions in Thursday morning's editions, quoted an unnamed
source as saying that at least one sale of cocaine allegedly
occurred on White House property. Fitzwater said that ``We have
been advised that drugs were not used or sold on the White House
premises.'' Secret Service spokesman Bob Snow would not comment on
that, although he did say that no charges had yet been filed.
   The disclosure of the drug investigation shook the White House
at a time when Reagan's ``zero-tolerance,'' anti-drug abuse
campaign is in disarray and the president was playing host to a
group of Republican members of Congress who wanted to discuss the
problem.
   Moreover, the latest uproar came on a day in which Reagan was
receiving recommendations from his Drug Policy Board, headed by
Attorney General Edwin Meese III, on new strategies. Among the
proposals was one which would require firms doing business with the
government to demonstrate effective plans for a drug-free workplace.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse, said ``The fact that ... Meese heads
the policy board making today's recommendations demonstrates ... no
one is in charge full time of finding answers to the drug crisis.''
   Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md., told reporters the incident
``demonstrates how it (drug use) can reach anybody in any area in
any place in any position.'' Mrs. Morella said she supported random
testing ``only in high security positions, which would mean public
safety also.''
   Reagan gave a urine sample in the late summer of 1986 and he and
his wife made a nationally televised appeal from the White House
living quarters as the first couple sought to dramatize the
administration's anti-drug abuse offensive.
   But a volunteer program of drug testing, in which senior White
House staff members would follow Reagan's lead, was a onetime
affair, used by the administration in 1986 to kick off its
anti-drug abuse campaign. Fitzwater said ``I don't believe there
have been any voluntary tests since then.''
   The White House had been working for some time to bring about a
program of random drug-testing of employees in the Executive Office
of the President, but the revelations of actual abuse within its
own ranks apparently gave the plan new impetus.
   Fitzwater opened his daily briefing with an announcement that
letters will be sent to the 1,600 presidential employees next week.
These letters will warn them that a mandatory, random program of
drug testing will commence 60 days hence. That program will not
directly affect Secret Service workers, since they are on the
Treasury Department payroll.
   Meese announced Monday that the Justice Department would start
drug testing, also in about 60 days. The next day, 42 lawyers and
paralegals from the department filed suit, claiming the program
violates their Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search
and seizure and Fifth Amendment due-process rights.
   Neither Fitzwater nor Snow would identify the two clerks ousted
from the NSC and the three suspended Secret Service Uniformed
Division officers. Fitzwater did say none of the allegations
involved ``the president's detail,'' the Secret Service officers
who directly protect the president.
   Reagan, when asked if he thought his security had been
compromised, replied, ``No, I don't think so.''
   Snow said the three Secret Service officers were placed on
administrative leave with pay, and that their status will depend on
whether charges are brought by the U.S. attorney's office in the
District of Columbia.
   Fitzwater said the random tests of presidential employees will
be conducted six times a year, with each round involving about 2
percent of the staff.
   Included are employees of the Office of Management and Budget,
the National Security Council and the offices of the vice president
and the first lady.
   The spokesman also said that the Secret Service will begin on
July 13 a program of pre-employment drug testing for job applicants.
   ``We think it is worthwhile for all private employers to
consider,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater confirmed that the drug investigation by the U.S.
attorney's office, Secret Service and federal drug agents was
continuing. Asked whether others have been implicated, the White
House spokesman replied, ``There are others within the Uniformed
Divisiion that are part of the investigation. A small number. I
can't give you the specific number.''
   There are approximately 960 men and women in the Uniformed
Divisiion of the Secret Service, but the agency would not divulge
how many of them are involved in direct protection of the White
House grounds. These officers also have responsibility for
protecting the vice president's mansion, foreign missions and other
executive offices.

   The American Federation of Teachers
announced Thursday it is launching a program to reform the most
basic teaching methods in U.S. public schools.
   Albert Shanker, president of the AFT, made the announcement at a
news conference kicking off the convention for the 500,000-member
federation.
   He said the ``AFT Center for Restructuring'' could lead the way
in bringing about a revolution in teaching.
   ``The center will critically examine the assumptions on which
traditional schooling have been based,'' he said, with the center
in the AFT's Washington headquarters acting as a kind of clearing
house for innovative ideas passed up from the teachers ``working as
a team.''
   ``We think this is the first time in the history of the country
that there has been (an effort) sponsored by teachers, devoted to
the notion that the best kind of change comes through a process of
continuous experimentation,'' Shanker said.
   The biggest problem for 40 million students in American
elementary and secondary schools right now ``is that the schools
have been the same for the last 200 years,'' the union leader
declared.
   The center will supply general outlines and suggestions on
methods of interesting district boards and parents to try new ways
to teach, he said, adding that ``many of these things do not
involve additional money.''
   ``My guess is that if teachers and principals, at school level,
begin to do exciting things the public will later on say `you're
doing such terrific things that we are now more willing to invest
money.'''
   The center will encourage the formulation of ``new ways of
testing and assessing what students do, with the idea of drawing a
more accurate picture of students'' in given schools, he said.
   Shanker took aim at the basic granite of American public
education, starting with organizational and academic orders issued
from district boards and superintendents to the principals and
teachers.
   He spanked the school bell, class periods, daily teacher-changes
and, finally, multiple-choice tests, which sourly described as a
tool principals and superintendents hope will make them ``look
good.''
   Shanker said the AFT does not have all the answers, but added,
``If we keep doing the same things (as in the past), we are going
to have the same results ... we don't like the results.''
   Shanker criticized education reform efforts over the past few
years which are aimed at tightening teaching standards and moving
back to a classic curriculum.
   ``We welcome these moves,'' he said. ``However, we do not
believe the implementation of these forms will bring about
substantial improvement in student achievement in most areas.''

   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi on Thursday
presented President Reagan with a plan calling on the United States
to sponsor a peace settlement for southern Africa.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that ``generally
speaking'' Reagan supports the plan, which calls on the United
States to continue providing arms to Savimbi's UNITA forces as long
as the Soviet Union and Cuba back the Angolan government.
   In a speech to the National Press Club, Savimbi said the plan
urges the United States to pursue negotiations with Cuba, the
Soviet Union and South Africa for the withdrawal of all foreign
troops from Angola as soon as possible.
   It also calls on the United States and ``key African states'' to
promote a dialogue between UNITA and the Angolan government that
would lead to an interim government and free elections.
   The U.S. government is sponsoring talks among South Africa,
Angola and Cuba to seek the withdrawal of South African and Cuban
troops from Angola and independence for neighboring South-West
Africa, or Namibia, which is controlled by South Africa.
   According to U.S. officials, Cuba has about 45,000 Cuban troops
in Angola doing much of the fighting with UNITA. Savimbi said Cuba
sent in an additional 12,000 troops in March and April and now has
57,000 troops there. In addition, he said, there are 2,500 Soviets,
3,000 North Koreans and 600 East Germans.
   The Soviets have helped the Angolan forces with military
planning and provided them with MiG-23 jet fighters, helicopter
gunships, missiles and radar sights, he said.
   Savimbi declined to say how much aid he received from the United
States and South Africa, but it is estimated he gets about $16
million a year in U.S. aid, including shoulder-fired Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles.
   He credited the missiles, which he declined to name since the
United States doesn't officially acknowledged that it is providing
them, with stopping air strikes against his forces enough so UNITAs
hospitals, schools and factories can operate.
   He claims to control one-third to one-half the territory of
Angola, a country nearly twice the size of Texas.
   Vice President George Bush, who also met with Savimbi, issued a
statement calling the guerrilla leader ``a true patriot.'' Bush
said he used the meeting to ``reaffirm my strong support for his
struggle and the struggle of UNITA to rid Angola of communism.''
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee-to-be, added that ``a
cut-off of support of Dr. Savimbi, as suggested by the Democrats,
would be an immoral sell-out of a loyal friend and a foreign policy
disaster.''
   Democratic presidential candidates Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson have called for an end to aid for UNITA. Savimbi said he
had sent letters to the two candidates seeking to explain his
position and had met with aides to Jackson.
   ``We think something will come out,'' he said.
   ``Governor Dukakis did not get yet the correct information about
what we are doing,'' said Savimbi. ``We believe that he is a very
good American. The day he knows we are working for peace and
democracy and stability in the whole of southern Africa I think he
will have a different approach.''
   Savimbi noted that the Angolan government had sent a rival
delegation to Washington to lobby against him during his visit and
said he had tried to meet with the officials, but they had not
responded to his request.
   About 25 protesters chanting anti-Savimbi slogans demonstrated
outside the National Press Building during his luncheon speech, and
a man interrupted his speech from the open door of the dining room
to shout three times, ``Savimbi is a murderer.''
   ``I think that's democracy,'' said Savimbi. ``It's good.''

   A delegate to the Communist Party conference
bluntly criticized President Andrei A. Gromyko and other longtime
Kremlin fixtures Thursday, suggesting there is high-level support
for removing them from office.
   The delegate, Vladimir I. Melnikov, specifically mentioned
Gromyko and the others after Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
asked him to name the targets of his criticism.
   Gorbachev, in an impassioned speech to the 5,000 Communists
gathered at the Kremlin, appealed for their support in overhauling
Soviet institutions, warning that socialism ``will die unless we
reform the political system.''
   He expressed concern there had been misunderstanding about one
of his recommendations, that local party leaders serve as chairmen
of government councils at all levels. That plan has been been
openly criticized by delegates to the conference Gorbachev called
to set a future course for the party.
   ``We do not abandon the role of the ruling party in the
country,'' Gorbachev said. ``On the contrary, we want to affirm
it,'' while getting the party out of day-to-day administrative
affairs.
   Earlier, Melnikov had said: ``Those who in the past actively
promoted the policy of stagnation may not serve and work on the
central party and government bodies now, at the time of
perestroika. They should answer for everything and do so
personally.''
   One Communist official said he took the speech as a signal
``that it's time for the old guys to retire.''
   On the third day of the conference, the party's first in 47
years, delegates have openly disagreed on the concrete results of
Gorbachev's drive for perestroika, or economic and social
reconstruction, launched after he took power in March 1985.
   But the remarks from Melnikov at the closed-door conclave were
the first reported by state-run media that named names and called
members of the party leadership on the carpet, including Gromyko,
78, and fellow Politburo member Mikhail S. Solomentsev, 74, who
chairs the party's Control Commission.
   The speech by the relatively obsure conference delegate was
televised during the evening news program ``Vremya'' which is
watched nightly by millions of Soviets not accustomed to hearing
their leaders criticized by name.
   A delegate's note later read from the dais at the conference
praised Gromyko and won warm applause, but it also noted that he
``has fallen behind the times.''
   Melnikov, the balding, bespectacled party leader in the Russian
federation region of Komi, said restructuring of the party's
policy-making Central Committee is proceeding too slowly and that
Communists and other Soviets want people responsible for stagnation
brought to account.
   Gorbachev, sitting on the dais, interrupted Melnikov, saying:
``Maybe you have some concrete suggestions? We're sitting here and
don't know: Is he talking about me, or somebody else?''
   ``I would refer first of all to Comrade Solomentsev, and to
Comrades Gromyko, Afanasyev, Arbatov and others,'' Melnikov
replied. Delegates applauded loudly.
   As Politburo members, Solomentsev and Gromyko have seats on the
dais close to Gorbachev, but television showed neither man's
reaction to Melkinov's comments.
   The stout, bespectacled Georgy A. Arbatov, one of the Soviet
Union's veteran specialists on American affairs, is often seen on
U.S. television, has headed the U.S.A.-Canada Institute since 1967
and has been a voting member of the Central Committee since 1981.
   It was not clear at which Afanasyev the criticism was directed.
There are at least two men by that name among the conference
delegates. However, the most senior and prominent is Viktor G.
Afanasyev, who has been editor of the Communist Party daily Pravda
and a full member of the Central Committee since 1976.
   Gorbachev indicated in his opening address to the conference on
Tuesday that Gromyko could be replaced in a structural overhaul
that would make the presidency a more powerful post than the
largely ceremonial office Gromyko now holds.
   Tass said a delegate identified only as Mamayev sent a note to
the presidium that was read to delegates praising the dour-faced
Gromyko as a man who ``has popular respect and love.''
   According to the official news agency, the note said Gromyko,
who spent 28 years as foreign minister before being shifted to the
presidency in 1985, had devoted his life to communism. But the note
added:
   ``We have worked him too hard. And Comrade Gromyko today has
fallen behind the times, but he has done his job, and his noble
deeds are remembered by the people.''
   The note sparked ``stormy applause'' when it was read aloud,
Georgy Kryuchkov, a Central Committee official, told a news
conference.
   Asked about the personal attacks on leading party members,
Kryuchkov warned reporters at a news conference against jumping to
conclusions the men would lose their jobs.
   A Communist Party official, speaking on condition he not be
identified further, said the criticism should not be interpreted as
a signal the old guard would be forced out at the conference but as
an indication that change almost certainly is in the wind.
   ``After being so protected for decades, they're suddenly being
told to their faces what no one would ever whisper about before,''
the source said. He added the speeches amounted to a challenge to
the Kremlin old guard to come to its own defense ``or go home,
think about what was said and act accordingly.''
   Another delegate, Vasily Starodubtsev from an agricultural
enterprise in Tula, called for a re-examination of the practice
that insulates the leadership from criticism, saying it has created
a ``caste of untouchables'' among senior party officials.
   Despite the freer climate created by the Kremlin campaign for
``glasnost,'' or openness, independent criticism of Soviet leaders
has been largely off-limits to the press, and members of the
Politburo and other top party bodies maintain an image of
monolithic unity.
   In another speech Thursday, a steelworker from the Ural
mountains said that three years after the party instituted
Gorbachev's reform program, ``consumer goods have vanished
completely.''
   ``Workers are asking straight out: `Where is the perestroika?'''
Veniamin A. Yarin told his fellow delegates. ``For example, in
stores, the way it was before with food products is the way it
still is. On top of that, they have introduced rationing for sugar.
There wasn't any meat, and we still don't have any.''

   The Pentagon's complicated purchasing system
would be overhauled and centralized under a bill introduced
Thursday as one of the first pieces of legislation resulting from
the Pentagon bribery and fraud investigation.
   ``The current bribery probe at the Pentagon is not surprising,''
said Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., one of the 55 House co-sponsors and
also a co-chairman of the congressional Military Reform Caucus.
   ``It has happened before and it will happen again unless we
change the fundamental way we do business,'' said Ridge.
   The bill would create a single buying office, known as the
Defense Acquisition Agency, to replace the current mix of
purchasing agencies scattered throughout the Defense Department.
   For example, each of the four services buys weapons separately
for the nation's 2.1 million uniformed personnel. In addition,
there are separate purchasing agencies for the 1 million Defense
Department civilians.
   The current investigation focuses on allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of whom are former military men,
bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that could be
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   The bill is the first piece of legislation resulting from the
2-year-old probe, which became public only two weeks ago. More
legislation is expected later, according to Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   The bill provides that the Defense Acquisition Agency would only
have civilian employees. They would be trained at a Defense
Acquisition University that would also be created by the
legislation.
   Rep. Dennis Hertel, D-Mich., another co-sponsor, said, ``The
Pentagon needs a change in its mindset. The American people will
not tolerate these annual procurement scandals while nothing
fundamentally changes at the Department of Defense.''
   Hours later, Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., introduced a bill he
said would close the ``revolving door'' between defense contractors
and the Pentagon. It would require Pentagon officials to wait two
years after they quit before working for a defense contractor.
   ``Our whole procurement system will continue to be suspect if,
on a Friday, someone can sit on the government side of the table
with responsibility for millions of taxpayer dollars and then on
Monday be sitting on the contractor's side of the table,'' Bennett
said.

<HEAD>Rep. English Assails FmHA Management</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political appointees may be attempting to
sabotage the Farmers Home Administration, the lender of last resort
to the nation's farmers, Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., charged
Thursday.
   A House committee report last week declared management of the
agency inadequate and unable to properly oversee the operations of
1,900 county offices. English said may be a sign political
appointees ``don't like the program and they don't think the
government should have this program.''
   ``If you look at it in a sinister way, you could draw the
conclusion that they're doing their best to make sure the program
does not work _ you could say they were sabotaging the program,''
said English.
   FmHA Administrator Vance Clark, appointed by President Reagan in
March 1986, said he did not know what English meant when he
referred to sabotage.
   ``It's a nice rhetorical flourish which is consistent with the
intemperate tone of the report as well as the season of the year,''
Clark said. ``But this level of discourse lends little in the way
of credit or credibility to the report or its chief author.''
   English, chairman of the Government Information, Justice and
Agriculture subcommittee, said the FmHA's ``inability to supervise
its own affairs has meant that farmers have not had access to
valuable programs the law intended for them.''
   English based his findings on a hearing he conducted last
November to determine the FmHA's effectiveness in administering
farm programs in its jurisdition. The House Government Operations
Committee, chaired by Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, released a report
on that hearing last week.
   In summary, the report found that ``in many instances, the
national office does not know what is going on in the county
offices and does not have any way of finding out.
   ``All of the problems at FmHA identified by the committee could
have been alleviated or avoided altogether by competent,
professional, effective management,'' the report said.
   The committee in its report recommended that the secretary of
agriculture ``require FmHA to institute effective management
procedures so that the department, the Congress and the public may
be assured that the agency is meeting its mission.''
   Witnesses complained of racial discrimination, farmer
intimidation by FmHA county supervisors, disregard of regulations
by local FmHA workers, and loans that sometimes were made too late
for farmers to produce their crops.
   The report said that despite strict prohibitions against selling
farmland from inventory if it would depress price levels, 14 FmHA
state directors sold land without conducting the analysis required
by the national office.

   President Reagan intends to nominate Elizabeth
Moler, a member of the staff of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
the White House announced Thursday.
   Ms. Moler, 39, would succeed Charles Stalon in one of the two
Democratic seats on the five-member commission if her nomination is
confirmed by the Senate. Stalon's appointment expired last Oct. 20,
but commissioners may remain in office for a year if no successor
has been sworn in.
   Her term would expire Oct. 20, 1991.
   Ms. Moler, a 1970 graduate of American University in Washington
and the George Washington University Law School, has been on the
committee staff since 1976 and also has worked on House staffs.
   Martha Hesse, commission chairman, said in a statement of
welcome that Ms. Moler was respected ``for her professional
non-partisan approach'' to the issues the commission deals with _
regulation of natural gas production and pipeline transportation,
wholesale electricity sales, hydroelectric dams and oil pipelines.
   The nomination still would leave the commission's membership
unsettled. The panel has one vacancy created by the resignation of
Michael Naeve in March and will have another next month with the
departure by resignation of Anthony Sousa. Ms. Hesse has not been
confirmed as chairman and the term of the fifth member, Charles
Trabandt, expires in October.

   A Voice of America writer filed suit Thursday
challenging a requirement that she obtain government permission to
publish an article accusing the Reagan administration of
politicizing agency broadcasts.
   The suit by Carolyn Weaver is the first court challenge to
regulations that require Voice of America employees to obtain prior
approval before publishing articles or making speeches about U.S.
foreign policy or the operation of the agency, according to her
attorney, Stephen M. Kohn.
   All books or manuscripts ``of official concern'' must be
submitted for clearance by the U.S. Information Agency, which
operates the Voice of America. The regulation also covers employees
of the State Department and the Agency for International
Development.
   The government has the right to delete passages or stop
publication of publication of material it considers ``inaccurate,
inconsistent with current foreign policy, or can reasonably be
expected to affect adversely U.S. foreign relations,'' according to
the regulations.
   Weaver, a part-time writer and editor, is preparing an article
that accuses the VOA of failing to observe requirements of its
charter that it be an ``accurate, objective and comprehensive''
source of news for foreign listeners.
   Her lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, charges that the
clearance requirement is a form of prior restraint prohibited by
the First Amendment.
   The suit seeks an injunction barring USIA from requiring her to
submit the article for its review before it is sent to the Columbia
Journalism Review.
   The magazine must have the manuscript by July 14 in order to
publish the piece in its September-October issue, according to the
lawsuit.
   In a series of cases, federal courts have upheld prepublication
review of manuscripts by former CIA employees to prevent
unauthorized disclosure of classified information.
   But Weaver, who has no access to classified information,
contends that in at least one decision, a court has explicitly
prohibited restrictions on the publication of unclassified material.
   In 1972, the Supreme Court declined to review a federal appeals
court finding that ``the First Amendment limits the extent to which
the United States, contractually or otherwise, may impose secrecy
requirements upon its employees and enforce them with a system of
prior censorship.''
   In that case, former CIA agent Victor Marchetti was barred from
publishing confidential information, but the appeals court said he
kept ``the right to speak and write about the CIA and its
operations, and to criticize it as any other citizen may.''
   Kohn said the regulation ``denies the American public access to
critical views of United States foreign policy.
   ``Even if an employee is given permission to criticize U.S.
foreign policy, it is approved criticism _ approved criticism is
not real criticism,'' he said.
   Lois Herman, a USIA spokeswoman, said the agency did not have a
comment on the lawsuit.

<HEAD>Scientists Call For Reduction in Carbon Dioxide Emissions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for AM-Ozone in digest.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists called Thursday for a 20 percent
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2005 to combat
the so-called ``greenhouse effect'' that is trapping heat like a
blanket around the Earth.
   ``Every day we wait for a reduction in greenhouse gases will
bring us closer to disaster,'' Dutch Environment Minister Eduardus
Nijpels told the closing session of a four-day conference on the
changing climate hosted by the Canadian government.
   Scientists use the term ``greenhouse effect'' to refer to
manmade pollution trapped in the atmosphere that is warming up the
Earth's surface.
   Carbon dioxide, one of the pollutants, is naturally emitted by
animal and plant life. An excessive buildup of that and other gases
results from the burning of fossil fuel in power plants, factories,
homes and cars, as well as agricultural and industrial pollution.
   More than 300 scientists and government officials from 40
countries and agencies warned in a closing statement that the
increase in greenhouse gases will raise temperatures by 3 to 8
degrees before the middle of the next century unless something is
done.
   ``Many scientists believe that warming due to greenhouse gases
has begun,'' the statement said. It said that unless the global
warming is halted, ``the expected rates and magnitude of climate
change will greatly exceed those experienced since civilization
began.''
   The scientists said that merely to stabilize carbon dioxide
concentrations, emissions would have to be reduced 50 percent.
   But after European countries pointed out they have already taken
many clean air measures, the conference recommended an initial goal
of reducing carbon dioxide emissions ``approximately 20 percent of
1988 levels by the year 2005.''
   About half of the recommended reduction can come from more
efficient use of existing energy supplies, the statement said,
noting some countries have shown they are energy savings of 2
percent annually.
   In an opening day speech Monday, Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo.,
said the United States could save more than $200 billion a year in
energy costs through improved efficiency in transportation,
construction and government.
   He cited photovoltaic solar energy as a promising alternative to
fossil fuel and said it was time to reexamine nuclear power.
``Those nations that have halted the nuclear option are going to
have to reconsider,'' he said.
   The scientists called on all nations to ratify the 1987 Montreal
Protocol on halting the depletion of the earth's ozone layer by
reducing the use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. On Thursday,
Canada became the fourth country to do so.
   CFCs are used in aerosol sprays, refrigerator coolant,
insulation and industrial cleaning. Once released, the CFCs break
down the ozone layer, allowing the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays
to reach the surface of the earth and thus increasing the incidence
of skin cancer.
   The scientists also said global warming from carbon dioxide,
methane, nitrous ozide, CFCs and the depletion of the ozone layer
could raise sea levels by up to five feet by the year 2050,
inundating coastal areas.
   In opening the conference, host Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
said Canada would like to see an International Law of the Air to
protect the atmosphere as the existing Law of the Sea defends the
oceans.
   But the conference endorsed a suggestion from keynote speaker
Gro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister of Norway, for work towards
an international convention on atmospheric protection.
   The conference also urged the establishment of a ``world
atmosphere fund'' financed by a tax on oil, gas and coal in
industrialized countries to pay for global protection efforts.
   The conference had few representatives from the Soviet bloc and
no representative from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   U.S. Rep. George E. Brown, Jr., (D-Calif., sent a message
complaining that Washington will drag its feet on environmental
issues ``until an enlightened leader occupies the White House.''
   Meetings are planned in Ottawa next year and in Geneva in 1990.

<HEAD>Hog Production Still Up Despite Higher Feed Costs From Drought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hog farmers are continuing to expand
production in the face of rising feed costs prompted by the
drought, an Agriculture Department report showed Thursday.
   As of June 1, the U.S. inventory of hogs and pigs was estimated
at 56.2 million head, up 8 percent from a year ago and 15 percent
more than two years ago. Industry analysts had expected a smaller
increase.
   The number of breeding hogs, at 7.53 million head, was up 7
percent and 17 percent from June 1 of 1987 and 1986, respectively.
That indicated further production increases in the months ahead.
   Officials said the June 1 inventory of market hogs _ animals
headed for slaughter and the consumer market _ totaled 48.7 million
head, up 8 percent and 15 percent from the previous two years.
   The pig crop during the first half of the hog marketing year
that began last Dec. 1 was estimated at 46.6 million head, a gain
of 8 percent from a year ago and 15 percent from two years ago.
   Looking at future prospects, the report said hog farmers
surveyed intend to have 6.2 million sows give birth in the
June-November period, a 7 percent increase from the same six months
of last year and 14 percent more than two years ago.
   But the report cautioned that the farrowing intentions ``do not
reflect conditions after the June 1 survey date.''
   Leland Southard of the department's Economic Research Service
said in a telephone interview the industry had expected the total
inventory to be up only about 4 percent as of June 1.
   But Southard said ``a spike in feed costs'' has raised doubts
about further expansion, however.
   ``I think there is a question whether producers will carry
through with these farrowing intentions to the extent that they've
indicated (in the June 1 survey),'' he said. ``We can blame that on
higher feed costs ... costs of production.''
   The following list shows the June 1 inventory in the 10 leading
hog states, which account for about 79 percent of the nation's
pork. The first number, in thousands, is the total number of hogs
in the state, the second is the June 1 figure's percentage of a
year earlier.

   They were good kids from good families, June
graduates of a prestigious Jesuit prep school.
   So why did a simple problem _ as simple as a classic premise for
a situation comedy _ begin a series of events that left one dead
and four others in disgrace?
   ``You just sit back and say, `How the hell could this happen?'''
Fordham Preparatory School headmaster Cornelius McCarthy said
Thursday. ``I think it was immediate gratification. They perceived
the need to solve this problem immediately.''
   James Patrick Cooney, 18, was shot to death by an off-duty
policeman during a Bronx robbery spree designed to raise $1,000 for
car repairs, police said. Cooney and his friends allegedly tried to
rob the officer minutes after they held up a grocery store at
gunpoint early Sunday.
   After Cooney was shot, the other 18-year-olds who were in the
car with him dumped his body in a park, wiped blood from the car
and burned some bloody clothing, police said.
   The body was found Wednesday after one youth, Barry Bootan,
bragged of the incident to a girlfriend, who told police,
authorities said.
   It all began with the kind of problem that has formed the basis
for teen-age sitcoms like ``Happy Days'' or movies like ``Risky
Business'' _ A teen-ager loans his father's station wagon to a
friend for a date. When the car is damaged in an accident, the kids
plot how to raise the money to get it fixed before Dad comes home.
   In this case, Cooney borrowed a station wagon Friday belonging
to the father of his classmate, Bootan. But Cooney drove the car
into a utility pole, scraping and denting the vehicle. Bootan was
frantic because his father was returning from a fishing trip Sunday
and he could find no one to loan him $1,000.
   To get the money, they allegedly enlisted the aid of another
Fordham student, Jason Katanic, who provided a car and a
.22-caliber rifle. Two other students accompanied them.
   The solution the youths allegedly devised _ armed robbery _
seemed inexplicable in light of their seemingly solid pasts and
promising futures.
   Cooney's stepfather is a 19-year veteran of the Police
Department who insisted that his stepson attend Fordham Prep even
though the family could barely afford the $3,700-a-year tuition.
   Bootan and Katanic, who face charges of attempted murder,
robbery and attempted robbery, were honor students at Fordham Prep.
   Two other students alleged to have been riding in the car but
not charged in the case also came from privileged backgrounds:
Brendan Moynihan, who lives in the expensive Westchester County
town of Pelham, is the son of a former Manhattan prosecutor; Daniel
Florio, who comes from Queens, reportedly is related to a judge.
   Speculation, however, centered on Cooney, ``J.P.'' to his
friends, who lived with his mother, stepfather and older sister in
a three-story redbrick house on a quiet Bronx street.
   A next-door neighbor described Cooney as polite and helpful. The
youth shoveled snow from his walk, tended his flower bed and
carried neighbors' groceries, the neighbor said.
   In school, he was a member of the wrestling team and, like all
graduating seniors, he performed 60 hours of community service. He
reportedly had been admitted for the fall semester at St. John's
University in Queens.
   Fordham Prep is a 147-year-old school with a reputation for
rigid academic standards and strict discipline. Virtually all 209
students who graduated June 3 planned to attend college.
   ``This is so out of character,'' said McCarthy. ``None of them
had any major disciplinary problems. He (Cooney) satisfied his
academic requirements. He seemed like the kind of kid who enjoyed
life.''
   But some of those who knew Cooney said he showed another side.
One classmate said he had begun to hang around with a rough crowd,
many of whose members were not Fordham Prep students, and had begun
to neglect his studies.
   Cooney left the school when he was a sophomore because of low
marks and never seemed entirely happy there when he returned. In
this year's yearbook, the space beneath Cooney's photo, reserved
for student activities and achievements, is blank.

   Armenian delegates to the Communist Party
conference on Thursday offered several solutions to their regional
dispute with the republic of Azerbaijan, but the Azerbaijanis
rejected all of them.
   Eduard M. Dzhrbashyan, director of the Institute of Literature
of Armenia's Academy of Sciences, said one of the proposed
compromises was turning the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh
over to the home area of Mikhail S. Gorbachev in southern Russia.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, a Caucasus Mountains enclave, is part of the
predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan republic but is dominated by mostly
Christian ethnic Armenians. Residents have been agitating for
annexation by Armenia since February.
   Armenia's parliament has endorsed the demand but Azerbaijan has
rejected it, leaving the issue deadlocked.
   Azerbaijan President Suleiman Tatliev told a news conference the
solution to the dispute lies in fostering friendship between
Azerbaijanis and Armenians, restoring a calm atmosphere in the
region and ``normalizing the situation.''
   Afrand Dashdamirov, deputy head of the propaganda department of
Azerbaijan's Communist Party Central Committee, told reporters the
compromises mentioned by the Armenian delegates ``would lead to the
disintegration of Azerbaijan.''
   Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature proposed on June 21 that the area
be turned over temporarily to the central government in Moscow in
an effort to calm tensions that have led to violent strikes,
demonstrations and riots.
   Dzhrbashyan told reporters that Nagorno-Karabakh, now classified
as an autonomous region of Azerbaijan, should be put under the
control of the Russian republic, specifically of the Stavropol
region north of the Caucasus Mountains.
   Dzhrbashyan did not make clear who was considering the
compromise, but his mention of it as a conference delegate
indicated it had some official support. He did not mention it was
Gorbachev's home area.
   Gorbachev was born in a farming village in the Stavropol region
in 1931, and worked there for 23 years in Communist Party jobs.
   Dzhrbashyan said the Stavropol region should be considered
because it was the closest part of Russia to Nagorno-Karabakh. He
said the idea of alliance between the two areas dates back to the
17th century.
   The current Communist Party conference is scheduled to adopt a
resolution outlining policy toward the country's more than 100
ethnic groups.
   Grant M. Voskanyan, Armenia's president, said a commission
drafting a resolution on ethnic relations had come up with no
specific proposals for resolving the dispute. But he said the party
Central Committee recommended the conference consider ``perfecting
federation'' of the Soviet Union and expanding the rights of
republics.

   Certain wetland areas protected under the
Water Bank Program will be opened up for emergency hay cutting to
provide forage for drought-stressed livestock, the government
announced Thursday.
   The approval will be effective Friday in some counties and
within 15 days in others. The Water Bank Program, or WBP, is
jointly administered by the Agriculture and Interior departments.
   About 524,000 acres in 222 counties of 12 states are in the
conservation program. An estimated 350,000 of these could be used
for haying if declared eligible.
   Under the program, participants agree, unless otherwise
authorized, not to harvest hay or otherwise use the land for crops
for 10 years. In return, they receive annual rental payments from
the government.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel said the later authorization for
some counties will protect waterfowl still nesting in wetland areas.
   ``Early next week, we will review the status of nesting in those
areas and determine if some can be opened for haying at that
time,'' he said.
   Conditions for haying the WBP land include:
   _Ten percent of the land nearest the wetland will not be hayed.
   _Haying will begin on the land farthest from the wetland and
progress inward.
   _Participants haying on these lands will have their next federal
rental payment reduced by 25 percent for each acre hayed.
   USDA officials said counties already approved for haying and
grazing of land taken from production under annual commodity
programs, along with Conservation Reserve Program land approved for
haying in Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi,
Nebraska and Wisconsin, will be eligible for immediate WBP haying.
   The following Minnesota counties also will be eligible for
immediate WBP haying: Blue Earth, Brown, Carver, Cottonwood,
Freeborn, Jackson, Le Sueur, Lincoln, Lyon, Murray, Nicollet,
Renville, Rice, Scott, Sibley, Steele, Todd and Waseca.
   All counties approved for haying and grazing under the crop
programs and the Conservation Reserve Program in Montana, North
Dakota and South Dakota will be approved for WBP haying not later
than July 10, officials said.
   In Minnesota, the following counties will be approved not later
than July 15: Becker, Big Stone, Chippewa, Clay, Douglas, East
Ottertail, East Polk, Grant, Kandiyohi, Lac Qui Parle, McLeod,
Mahnomen, Meeker, Pope, Stearns, Stevens, Swift, Traverse, West
Ottertail, Wright and Yellow Medicine.

<TEXT>
   Scientists say they took a step toward
improving bone marrow transplants for people with cancer and
radiation sickness by purifying, or isolating, a type of cell
crucial to development of blood and immunity in mice.
   Isolation of the special cell type, called a stem cell, eluded
researchers for 30 years until achieved by doctors at Stanford
University Medical Center in Northern California and Royal
Melbourne Hospital in Australia.
   The research is outlined in Friday's issue of the journal
Science.
   The researchers are well on their way to purifying human stem
cells and growing them in the laboratory, an accomplishment that
could make bone marrow transplantation safer and more available,
said Dr. Irving Weissman, a Stanford professor of pathology and
cancer biology who headed the study team.
   Bone marrow transplants are used to replace damaged or diseased
marrow, the substance inside bones that produces blood and provides
immunity from disease.
   Transplant recipients include some leukemia patients, other
cancer patients made ill by chemotherapy and radiation therapy,
people sickened by accidental radiation exposure, and those with
certain disorders of the blood and the immune system.
   Only about one in 20,000 cells in bone marrow is a stem cell,
said Weissman. But the rare cells are ultimately responsible for
making and replacing other short-lived blood cells, including red
cells, platelets and the B and T types of white blood cells
responsible for immunity.
   As a result, stem cells are the most important part of
transplanted bone marrow. But such transplants often fail unless
the donor and recipient are matched closely. That's because some
white blood cells in donor marrow attack the recipient's tissues in
a sort of reverse rejection called graft-versus-host disease.
   If human stem cells can be purified, they might be transplanted
without other cells in bone marrow, thus avoiding the failure of
the transplants, Weissman said.
   Purified human stem cells also could eliminate the need to find
closely matched marrow donors, making marrow transplants more
widely available, he added.
   Pure stem cells also could make it safer for leukemia patients
to have some of their own marrow removed and then have it replaced
later after they have been subjected to radiation therapy.
Radiation kills the remaining marrow at the same time it kills
cancer cells in marrow, he said.
   When leukemia patients have some marrow removed and later
replaced, it can contain some cancer cells, which spur recurrence
of the leukemia, or blood cancer. By separating stem cells from the
extracted marrow, the stem cells can be reimplanted free of any
cancer cells, preventing the cancer from recurring, Weissman said.
   The researcher also said that in several years, purifying human
stem cells could speed development of gene therapy for inherited
blood diseases. Gene therapy involves the replacement of
disease-causing genes _ the basic units of heredity _ with healthy
genes.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Prosecutor Hits North for `Disrespectful' Tone With
Judge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iran-Contra prosecutor on Thursday took a
swipe at lawyers for fired White House aide Oliver L. North for
filing ``increasingly disrespectful'' pleadings with the judge in
the case.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh challenged North's request
to U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell that the judge reconsider
his ruling that congressional immunity given three defendants in
the case does not compromise the case.
   North's ``motion merely reflects the defendant's continued
frustration at this failure to force the court to afford him a full
pretrial ... hearing to which he is not entitled,'' Walsh said in a
one-page reply to North's motion.
   ``Apart from their increasingly disrespectful tone, the
pleadings raise no additional issues that have not already been
fully briefed by the parties,'' Walsh said.
   In their motion filed Monday, North's lawyers said the
procedures and reasoning that Gesell used to reach his decision
about the immunity issue ``are most notable for their
arbitrariness, their superficiality and their unprecedented denial
of due process.''
   A failure to reconsider the ruling ``would signal to the defense
and the nation the fundamental unfairness of this proceeding, and
the court's single-minded goal of overcoming or ignoring the
extraordinary legal and factual obstacles to trial of this case,''
the defense said in its brief.
   Gesell ruled last month that the immunity Congress gave North,
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer
Albert Hakim did not prevent them from being tried on Iran-Contra
conspiracy charges.
   The three are charged along with Hakim's former partner, retired
Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, of conspiring to illegally divert
U.S.-Iran arms sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The judge ordered four separate trials to deal with the problems
imposed by the congressional immunity and said he would defer
further consideration of the issue until the conclusion of each
proceeding.

   The remains of 28 American soldiers
killed in the War of 1812 were taken from Canada to their native
soil in flag-draped caskets Thursday in the first repatriation
ceremony held between the two countries.
   ``There can be no finer expression of the good relations between
our countries than the reverence we show for these men,'' George
Hees, Canadian minister of veterans affairs, said as he transferred
possession of the remains to U.S. officials.
   The ceremony took place near Old Fort Erie, the scene of some of
the worst fighting of the war. On a shaded lawn where their
predecessors traded musket fire, 230 U.S. and Canadian soldiers
saluted the 28 caskets.
   Among the units participating was the 3rd U.S. Infantry, known
as the Old Guard, which traces its history to the War of 1812.
   ``This is the day these men waited 174 years for,'' said U.S.
Army Lt. Col. Robert Trotter. ``They are coming home.''
   Thomas Niles, U.S. ambassador to Canada, Niles praised Canadians
as good neighbors with a respect for history.
   Niles compared the effort to recover the War of 1812 soldiers to
the American government's search for servicemen lost in Southeast
Asia, pledging, ``We will continue to work on that problem until it
is solved.''
   After the ceremony, 28 hearses carried the caskets over the
Peace Bridge that links Fort Erie and Buffalo, N.Y. Fighter jets
flew by the bridge in missing-man formation.
   The procession continued to Bath National Cemetery in central
New York, where officials dedicated a memorial to the soldiers. The
remains will be buried privately Friday.
   A crowd of more than 500 stood in chilly air and a strong wind
off Lake Erie to attend the Fort Erie ceremony.
   ``We're all Americans really, North Americans. That border
doesn't really mean that much,'' said Hugh Lyrea, a Canadian
veteran.
   Heinz Hummel, mayor of Fort Erie, said the soldiers' sacrifice
paved the way to an undefended border between the two nations.
   ``Their death was the beginning of our peace,'' Hummel said.
   The repatriation ceremonies marked the beginning of the annual
Friendship Festival between the United States and Canada, which
celebrates continuous peace between the two nations since 1814.
   ``We could not ask for a more symbolic gesture,'' said Patrick
Mines, a festival organizer from Fort Erie.
   The remains of the servicemen were discovered during residential
construction in Fort Erie in October 1987.
   Archaeologists determined that the skeletons were American but
were unable to make individual identifications. The men are
believed to have been killed during a British siege on a U.S.
position at Snake Hill in 1814.
   Ronald Williamson, head of the scientific team in charge of the
excavation, said the victims ranged in age from mid-teens to 40 and
died gruesome deaths. At least 12 of the skeletons showed evidence
of tremendous wounds, presumably from musket or cannon fire, he
said.
   Historians say many of those who participated in the bitterly
fought Niagara campaign in the closing days of the war were
militiamen from western and central New York.
   Military officials officials said Bath was chosen as a burial
site because it was the closest national cemetery.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
on Thursday called on the leaders of El Salvador and Honduras to
protect their fragile democracies and warned of the dangers of
communist rule.
   Shultz came to Tegucigalpa after a four-hour visit to El
Salvador, during which he urged the government to keep fighting the
leftist guerrillas, but also expressed concern about an upsurge in
politically motivated killings of civilians.
   At an airport arrival ceremony in this capital city, Shultz said
Honduras has advanced economically and socially under its
6-year-old democracy, while in Nicaragua per capita income has
dropped by 50 percent in the past 10 years.
   Shultz's message has been essentially the same since he began
his Central American trip in Guatemala on Wednesday: despite
difficult problems, the region's four democracies are performing
far better than Nicaragua, ``the odd man out'' in the area.
   ``The Sandinistas seek to build totalitarian society on the back
of a massive military machine,'' he said.
   In a show of American support, Shultz signed aid agreements
worth more than $180 million combined for El Salvador and Honduras.
He gave a pep talk to about 250 U.S. servicemen at the air base at
Palmerola, his first stop in Honduras.
   These forces are part of an estimated 1,200 U.S. troops who
stationed in Honduras partly as a deterrent to any potential
military move by Nicaragua, which borders on the south.
   Shultz's three-day trip to the region ends Friday in Costa Rica
and is his longest visit to Central America in four years.
   While criticizing Nicaragua, Shultz has said little about future
steps now that peace talks have broken down between the Sandinistas
and the U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras.
   He has spoken only in vague terms about the failed negotiations,
telling his listeners that pressure on the Sandinistas must be
maintained if the goal of peace and democracy is to be achieved in
Nicaragua.
   But he has offered no specific suggestions and has made only
scant reference to the Contras.
   Shultz scheduled a meeting with Contra leaders Thursday night
during a return trip to Guatemala.
   In El Salvador, Shultz met with acting President Rodolfo
Castillo Claramount and with military leaders.
   About 2,000 university students who marched through downtown San
Salvador to demand greater government spending on education also
protested Shultz's visit.
   ``We repudiate the visit of Shultz!'' shouted the march leader
through a megaphone.
   ``We repudiate!'' the students responded.
   Before meeting the officers, Shultz said: ``I will say to them
that we must see a strong effort, as we have seen, to combat the
terrorist guerrillas, and that's going well.
   ``And of course there must always be vigilance on the question
of human rights, and I will emphasize that as well,'' he told
reporters after meeting with Castillo Claramount.
   U.S. officials said Shultz expressed concern about a rise in
politically motivated killings of civilians in El Salvador to an
average of 34 a month, an increase from a monthly average of 27
last year.
   The administration is worried that a major setback in human
rights performance could jeopardize congressional support for U.S.
aid to El Salvador, which is receiving $400 million in aid this
year.
   Castillo Claramount is acting in place of President Jose
Napoleon Duarte, who is being treated for terminal cancer in
Washington.
   In Honduras, a key ally of the United States in its bid to oust
Nicaragua's government, Shultz said the drive for democracy
contrasts with the situation in Nicaragua. Honduras has for years
provided a safe haven to the Contras.
   During his five-hour stay in Honduras, Shultz had lunch with
Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras and met with President Jose
Azcona Hoyo.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of U.S. counter-terrorism experts
is in Greece to help police investigate a car-bomb explosion that
killed a U.S. defense attache, a senior police officer said
Thursday.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
10-member U.S. team would offer ``specialized assistance'' to Greek
police supervising the investigation. He did not elaborate.
   U.S. Embassy officials declined to comment on the team's
presence in Greece.
   A bunch of pink and white roses lay scattered Thursday over the
twisted metal fence where the explosion on Tuesday lodged the car
of U.S. Navy Capt. William Nordeen.
   Nordeen, 51, died when a car-bomb exploded next to his
armor-plated automobile just 100 yards from his house in Kifissia,
a northern Athens suburb.
   The former Navy pilot's body, now at the U.S. Air Force base at
Athens Airport, will be flown home next Tuesday for burial at
Washington's Arlington cemetery. A memorial service will be held in
Athens over the weekend, diplomats said.
   U.S. Embassy officials said the State Department would offer a
$500,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of Nordeen's killers.
   The Greek terrorist organization November 17 claimed
responsibility for the bomb. The group vowed Wednesday to keep
attacking American targets ``until the last American soldier leaves
Greece.'' The statement appeared in the left-wing daily Ethnos.
   There are 3,500 American military personnel currently stationed
at four U.S. bases in Greece.
   Greek government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos denied foreign
press reports that Greece was unable to take effective measures
against terrorism.
   ``Foreign press reports about the lack of eagerness and
incompetence of the Greek security services are completely
groundless and innaccurate,'' Kostopoulos told reporters.
   The senior police officer said the investigation had made no
headway so far.
   November 17 has claimed 12 political assassinations in 13 years,
including those of three American diplomats. None of its members
has ever been arrested.
   The group is named for the date in 1973 when troops crushed a
student uprising against the 1967-74 military dictatorship.
   According to police, group members placed up to 88 pounds of TNT
inside a stolen car, which they detonated with a remote control
device as Nordeen was driving by. They had stacked bags of cement
on one side of the car to direct the explosion towards Nordeen's
car.
   ``The device is the same as the one they tried to use in their
last attack. They are using them to get around the armor-plating,''
the police official said.
   In January, police acting on a tip found a powerful bomb in a
trash can outside the home of George Carros, an Athens-based
official of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.
   November 17 later claimed in a statement it had called off a
planned attack against Carros.

   A defense contract freeze proposed by
congressmen irate over alleged procurement fraud could raise the
cost of weapons, force plant layoffs and lower the readiness of the
armed forces, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   ``We would be glad to discuss with the Congress the question of
freezing awards of new contracts while the Justice Department is
investigating allegations of procurement fraud,'' said spokesman
Fred S. Hoffman. ``But at this point we feel it would be imprudent
to apply such a freeze or moratorium.''
   The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., said Wednesday that Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci should order ``absolutely no contracts signed for 60 days
(or) six weeks'' with companies implicated in the criminal
investigation.
   If the Pentagon froze new contracts, ``the innocent would suffer
as well as the guilty ... You may be sure that we will take
precautions in any awards,'' Hoffman told reporters in response.
   ``Our contracts have adequate clauses which can be brought into
play to reopen them and take other action to protect the public
interest,'' he said.
   ``However, we wonder whether the members of Congress calling for
a freeze or a moratorium have thought through the possible
consequences, such as higher program costs, production line
shutdowns, widespread plant layoffs and damage to the readiness of
our forces,'' he said.
   But Aspin said late Thursday he had talked to Carlucci and ``I
don't think we're that far apart in what we're thinking. My goal is
to make sure the contracts that are being let now, not the ones
involved in the investigation, are free of any taint. That's his
goal, too.''
   Hoffman said Defense Department officials were looking into
allegations by the coordinating prosecutor in the case, U.S.
Attorney Henry Hudson of Alexandria, Va., that some suspects had
destroyed documents since warrants in the case became public on
June 14.
   The investigation centers on allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of them former military men,
bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details vital in winning
contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Hudson said in court papers that ``the government has already
become aware of several incidents of destruction of documents
related to this case.'' He did not say where.
   Hoffman said he had ``heard of none'' destroyed in the Defense
Department, but ``we are looking into it ... Our people are taking
what we believe to be adequate measures'' to protect critical
documents. He said he could not to specify what measures Pentagon
officials were taking.
   The spokesman also rejected Aspin's assertion the Navy should
have postponed a $960 million contract, announced June 23, to buy
F-A-18 fighter planes from the McDonnell-Douglas Corp, one of the
companies involved in the investigation.
   ``I am informed by Navy officials ... that there is no
suggestion of any taint in conncetion with that contract,'' Hoffman
said.
   Because of the Justice Department action, Pentagon Inspector
General June Gibbs Brown was reopening one contract investigation,
previously closed, and reviewing five other cases to determine
whether any were tainted, he said.
   ``Overall, there were some six matters that are being
examined,'' Hoffman said.
   The office of the Pentagon inspector general, which does not
have the power to prosecute, ``has a longstanding modus operandi
that as investigative matters are developed or made public, its
procedure is to review related cases to see if there are any
potential problems or parallel issues,'' Hoffman said.
   Pentagon officials declined to discuss specifics of the cases
under review. At least one of them is known, however, because of
interest expressed by Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   That case involved a tip to a telephone hotline received last
August, alleging that former Assistant Navy Secretary Melvyn R.
Paisley and two defense contractors had conspired to limit
competition on contracts for a $1 billion radar-warning system used
on Navy aircraft.
   Paisley, who left the Navy job in April 1987 to open a
consulting business, is thought to be one of the central figures in
the current probe. His home and offices were searched two weeks ago.
   After receiving word of the hotline tip, the inspector general's
staff opened what turned out to be a seven-month investigation. The
case was closed on March 14 for lack of evidence to substantiate
the charges.
   It was reopened at Ms. Brown's direction on June 16, two days
after the FBI investigation was publicly disclosed.

<HEAD>Air Force To Hold Hearings in 11 Western States on Rail-Based MX</HEAD>

   Defense Department officials will conduct
hearings in July and August near 11 Western sites that have been
designated as possible bases for the rail-mobile MX missile, the
Air Force said Thursday.
   The Air Force filed a draft environmental impact statement on
the plan, which has been all but sidetracked in Congress and which
is opposed by ecology activists in states where the missile might
be stationed.
   Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said the Air Force filing
initiates a 60-day public comment period on environmental aspects
of the basing plan.
   ``The Air Force will hold public meetings at each of the
communities which could be affected by the proposal,'' Hoffman said.
   Despite opposition, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci on May
18 approved $328.7 million in contracts for the rail-mobile MX, a
missile he says is necessary to counter two mobile missiles already
deployed by the Soviets: the 10-warhead SS-24, based on rails, and
the single-warhead SS-25 on trucks.
   The MX can carry 10 warheads, and Air Force officials call in
the most accurate strategic missile in the U.S. arsenal.
   ``We are not terminating the program,'' Hoffman told reporters
at a briefing. ``We are moving ahead on a plan that we have laid
out.
   ``We live in hope that if not this year, then next year the
Congress will see the wisdom of the approach that we have been
recommending,'' he said.
   The United States never has succeeded in deploying a mobile
intercontinental ballistic missile, in large part because of
community opposition, and had demanded that such weapons be banned
under a proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty now under
negotiation with the Kremlin.
   But at last month's Moscow summit diplomats offered a proposal
to allow a set number of mobile missiles within tightly defined
geographical areas that could be inspected by satellites or teams
from each country. That proposal will be debated when negotiations
resume in Geneva next month.
   The Air Force wants to deploy 25 MX trains, each carrying two of
the ``Peacekeeper'' missiles.
   They would be kept at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne,
Wyo., in peacetime, then scatter along the civilian rail system in
times of East-West tension or war, making them difficult targets
and a deterrence against a surprise Soviet nuclear attack.
   Up to four more trains might be deployed later at as many as 10
other Air Force bases.
   So far, Congress has approved deployment of 50 MXs, to be based
in existing Minuteman silos, but has been cool to putting MXs on
trains.
   The Air Force filed the draft environmental impact statements
after the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis ruled on May 18
that a judge must consider environmental claims against the basing
plan, but could not rule on the relative merits of deploying the
missiles on rails or in silos.
   Besides Warren, the other Air Force Bases at which MX trains
might be deployed are: Barksdale, La.; Dyess, Texas; Eaker, Ark.;
Fairchild, Wash.; Grand Forks, N.D.; Little Rock, Ark.; Malmstrom,
Mont.; Minot, N.D.; Whiteman, Mo.; and Wurtsmith, Mich.
   The Pentagon said copies of the draft environmental impact
statment could be obtained by writing to: AFRCE-BMS@DEV, Norton Air
Force Base, Calif., 92409-6448. And more information about the
program can be obtained by calling the Peacekeeper Rail Garrison
Program, Ballistic Missile Office, at (714) 382-6631.

   Arrest warrants were issued Thursday for
the father and three brothers of a novice nun abducted from a
convent by her family, and the search for her continued, a state
police dispatcher said.
   The warrants for the relatives of Mary Susan Greve, 22, also
called Sister Mary Cecilia, charge them with unlawful imprisonment,
said Winslow Marsters.
   Police in New York and Ohio have been looking for the woman
since her father, James, and brothers Dave, Mark and John pushed
her into a car Sunday as she walked with two nuns near St. Joseph
Novitiate Convent here in the Catskill Mountains.
   ``We've had no contact with them,'' Marsters said.
   John Greve said earlier this week that the family opposed his
sister's decision to enter the ultra-traditionalist convent, which
is not recognized by the Catholic Church.
   State police had said they would not press charges unless the
woman wanted to file them. But the convent's spiritual adviser, the
Rev. Clarence Kelly, said he believed the Greene County district
attorney ordered the warrants.
   The district attorney was not immediately available for comment
Thursday, his secretary said.
   Dave Greve said from the Greves' home in Cincinnati on Wednesday
that the family abducted her because of the family's suspicions of
Kelly.
   He said his sister removed her habit Tuesday and mailed it back
to the convent. But the convent hasn't received such a package,
said Kelly.
   ``One of their rules is that by taking off the habit, it means
you don't want to be a part of it. She gave up wanting to belong to
that order,'' Greve said. ``She didn't give up wanting to be a
nun.''
   Kelly vehemently denied James Greve's allegation that the
spiritual adviser had forbidden Miss Greve from seeing her family.
   ``Our interest is not to get Sister Mary Cecilia back,'' said
Kelly. ``She's still a novice, and novices are free to leave any
time they want. ... We want to know that she is safe and free and
we want to be told that by her, not by the people that abducted
her.''
   The St. Joseph Novitiate Convent, which calls itself a
traditionalist Roman Catholic convent, holds services are in Latin
and rejects the teachings of the Second Vatican Council of the
1960s. Miss Greve joined in 1986.

<HEAD>Excommunication Is Gravest Punishment Under Canon Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lefebvre, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church defines
excommunication as the gravest of all ecclesiastical punishments,
one that canon laws says separates the excommunicate from the
communion of the faithful.
   The penalty deprives an excommunicated Catholic of membership in
the church while still leaving him bound to many of the duties of
that membership.
   An excommunicated Catholic cannot participate in worship or
receive the sacraments and is refused a Christian burial.
   Excommunicated clerics, such as Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and
the four bishops he consecrated Thursday, remain priests but are
forbidden to administer the sacraments except in certain specified
circumstances for the benefit of the faithful.
   In the Roman Catholic Church, the seven sacraments are baptism,
confirmation, communion, penance, holy orders, matrimony and
extreme unction, or last rites.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Thursday that very few
Catholics incur excomunication and that many of the cases today
involve Catholic doctors who perform abortions. However, he noted
that these are matters of individual conscience and no records are
kept.
   The New Catholic Encyclopedia says the term excommunication
first appeared in church documents in the 4th century. In the early
days of the church, it said excommunication was a general term used
to designate all ecclesiastical punishments. In modern times, it
said the punishment is described as a ``medicinal'' penalty
designed to bring the delinquent back to contrition and a sense of
duty.
   In the Roman Catholic Church excommunicants are either
``vitandi'' (to be avoided), or ``tolerati'' (tolerated).
   Canon law states that anyone who lays violent hands on the pope
is automatically ``vitandi.'' No one else is ``vitandi'' unless he
has been publicly excommunicated by name by the Holy See and it is
expressly stated that the person is to be avoided.
   Lefebvre and the four bishops were excommunicated automatically,
or latae senteniae, which means they are ``tolerati.''
   Navarro said in their case only the pope can lift the sanction.

<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz
appealed on Thursday for dialogue with Romania in the steadily
worsening dispute over how the neighboring Soviet bloc ally treats
its ethnic Hungarian minority.
   Istvan Oeszi, deputy foreign minister, summoned the acting
Romanian charge d'affaires and told him that expelling diplomats is
``diametrically opposed to the agreements valid between the two
countries and the norms of European cooperation.''
   It was the first official Hungarian comment on Romania's
decision, announced Tuesday, to close the Hungarian consulate at
Cluj in Transylvania and expel its staff members.
   Grosz, who also is premier, told Western journalists in an
impromptu meeting that he will go ahead with a planned visit to
Romania, because ``if we don't talk to each other we cannot
understand each other.''
   No date has been announced for the trip, but it is believed
Grosz will go to Bucharest after visits in July to Moscow, Warsaw
and Washington.
   The issue of Romania's 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians always has
been delicate, but in recent months Hungarians have become
increasingly vocal about it.
   Romania's announcement came one day after 50,000 people
demonstrated in Budapest against a Romanian plan to level 7,000
villages and replace them with agricultural-industrial centers.
Hungarians claim the project will disperse the ethnic Hungarians,
largely concentrated in Transylvania, destroying their culture and
tradition.
   Hungary claims the minority is discriminated against and Romania
accuses the Hungary of interfering in its domestic affairs.
   Both Grosz and Oeszi, as quoted in a Foreign Ministry
communique, said Monday's protest was not directed against Romania
or its leadership.
   Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian leader, issued a denunciation
Tuesday of ``new actions of a chauvinistic, nationalistic,
anti-Romanian, anti-Socialist nature'' by Hungarians.
   Romania also ordered the closure of a dormant Hungarian cultural
institute in Bucharest.
   Grosz said he does not intend to raise the issue with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev when he visits Moscow next week because
``it is a bilateral issue and not an affair of the Soviet Union.''
   He will be the first East bloc leader to meet with Gorbachev
after this week's Moscow party conference, at which the Kremlin
leader has called for more reforms in his program of
``perestroika,'' or restructuring. Grosz became Hungarian party
chief in May, replacing Janos Kadar.

<HEAD>Electric Boat Wins Final 1988 Contract for Fast-Attack Submarine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy on Thursday awarded this year's third
and final SSN-688 fast-attack submarine contract to the Electric
Boat Division of General Dynamics Corp.
   The $347.4 million contract will go to Electric Boat's main
shipyard in Groton, Conn., and its other plant in North Kingstown,
R.I.
   The submarine contracts traditionally are split between Electric
Boat and the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. in Newport
News, Va., which three weeks ago was awarded the other two
contracts for this year's nuclear-powered, Los Angeles-class subs.
   Electric Boat said in a prepared statement that Thursday's
announcement ``is probably the most welcome news we have received
in some time on this program.''
   Electric Boat and the Metal Trades Council, representing 10,200
workers in Groton, faced a strike deadline of midnight Thursday
over the company's final offer for a three-year contract.
   The shipyard says to remain competitive with Newport News it can
only afford to pay cash bonuses in each of the three years, while
the union is demanding pay raises of 5 percent the first year and 4
percent each succeeding year.
   The Navy said the submarine is scheduled to be completed by
April 1993.
   The SSN-688 submarine, a 6,900-ton vessel as long as a football
field, is designed to hunt down enemy surface ships and submarines.
They are armed with Mark 48 anti-submarine torpedoes, Harpoon
missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles.

<TEXT>
   The government has evidence that Britons held
hostage in Lebanon are alive, but is uncertain about the fate of
Anglican envoy Terry Waite, a Foreign Office spokesman said
Thursday.
   Based on conversations with freed French hostages in May,
British diplomats ``were able to draw encouragement'' that
television journalist John McCarthy, 31, and lecturer Brian Keenan
are alive, said the spokesman.
   ``But so far as Terry Waite is concerned, we've got no hard
evidence about his well-being or whereabouts,'' he said on
condition of anonymity, in keeping with British practice.
   The spokesman said the British diplomats gained no evidence
regarding the nine Americans believed held captive by Shiite Moslem
extremists in Lebanon.
   Waite vanished on Jan. 20, 1987 in Beirut while trying to win
the release of Western hostages.
   McCarthy was kidnapped April 17, 1986.
   Keenan, of Belfast, Northern Ireland, has been missing since
April 11, 1986. He holds dual Irish and British nationality and his
release is also sought by the Irish government.
   In all, 18 foreign hostages are still in captivity in Lebanon,
most of them believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite extremists. The
longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, who was abducted on March 16, 1985.
   Earlier Thursday, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told the
House of Commons the government had received evidence the British
hostages were alive. He did not say what the evidence was.
   Reports earlier had said former French hostages Jean-Paul
Kauffmann and Marcel Fontaine, freed with fellow Frenchman Marcel
Carton on May 4, had provided Britain with such evidence.
   Howe reiterated Thursday that Britain would not compromise its
policy of refusing to negotiate with kidnappers.
   Four members of Parliament recently traveled to Tehran and held
unofficial talks with Iranian leaders about improving relations
between the two countries. One of them, Conservative legislator
Tony Hicks, urged Howe to respond to Iranian overtures aimed at
improving relations with Britain.
   Howe said Thursday, ``The Iranians must come to accept that
there are certain necessary standards of international behavior
which must be observed if they are to have a normal relationship
with the rest of the world.''

<HEAD>FAA Requires `Black Box' Recorders in Most Commuter Aircraft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commuter airlines must have so-called ``black
box'' recorders in most of their aircraft within three years to
help accident investigators determine the cause of a crash or
safety incident, the Federal Aviation Administration ruled Thursday.
   Large jetliners already are required to have the recorders,
which provide information about an aircraft's performance and
provide a 30-minute loop tape of conversation in the cockpit.
   The devices have been crucial in revealing the causes of many
airliner crashes over the years.
   But commuter planes of fewer than 30 seats have not been
required to have the devices.
   Under a final FAA rule announced Thursday, multi-engine,
turbine-powered commuter planes carrying more than six passengers
and flown by two pilots will be required to have a cockpit voice
recorder.
   Slightly larger commuter planes carrying 20 or more passengers
will also have to be equipped with a digital flight data recorder
that stores such information as air speed, altitude, aircraft pitch
and heading.
   No commuter planes are now required to have such equipment.
Under the rule, commuter airlines must have the black box recorders
within three years of the effective date of the rule, which is
expected to be in 90 days.
   The cockpit voice recorder must be included in new aircraft and
retrofitted into planes already in service. The flight data
recorder must be in both new and in-service aircraft when a plane
has 20 or more seats. There is no retrofit requirement on the
flight data recorder in the smaller commuter planes that have fewer
than 20 seats.
   ``Although the FDR and CVR do not enhance safety by themselves,
they have proven to be invaluable accident investigation tools and
have led to numerous improvements in aviation safety,'' said FAA
Administrator Allan McArtor.
   Last year, Congress directed the FAA to expand its requirements
for the ``black box'' recorders to include the commuter airlines
which last year carried about 32 million passengers.
   The National Transportation Safety Board for years has called on
the FAA to require the recorders in commuter aircraft. Earlier this
year, the NTSB cited a number of accident investigations which
would have been much easier had information from such recorders
been available.

   FBI agents Thursday arrested a
woman on charges of kidnapping a newborn by posing as a hospital
employee.
   The infant, 2-day-old Brittany Owens, was returned to Brentwood
Hospital in suburban Cleveland in excellent condition a day after
she was taken from her mother's room by a woman in a lab coat and
scrub outfit, said FBI agent Joseph Griffin.
   Clara R. Horton, a 43-year-old nurse from Cleveland Heights with
a history of miscarriages, was jailed on a charge of kidnapping,
Griffin said. The FBI agent did not give the woman's place of work
but said it was not Brentwood.
   The woman was arrested after two people called authorities in
response to rewards offered by the Warrensville hospital and a
crime fighters' group, Griffin said.
   When agents arrived at her home, they found Ms. Horton with her
common-law husband, the infant and three other children, Griffin
said.
   ``She had no connection to the mother,'' Griffin said. ``She
apparently just picked this hospital indiscriminately.''
   Hospital spokeswoman Nancy Sayre said the baby appeared to have
been well cared for. The infant was undergoing routine tests
Thursday night.
   ``The mother's elated,'' Ms. Sayre said. ``She doesn't want to
let the baby out of her arms.''
   Griffin said officers, in looking for the kidnapper, had worked
out a profile of the suspect. ``We felt that the kidnapper probably
was a nurse who has had a miscarriage or perhaps several
miscarriages in the past,'' he said.
   Ms. Sayre said the kidnapper had entered the maternity ward
during a shift change Wednesday and mingled with family members
visiting the baby. Nurses apparently thought she was part of the
baby's family, Ms. Sayre said.
   At 6:20 p.m., the kidnapper took the baby from the mother,
saying she planned to weigh it and return it to the nursery, the
spokeswoman said.
   The father of another infant saw the woman carrying the baby in
the opposite direction from the nursery and alerted a nurse. Ms.
Sayre said the nurse called security, but the woman disappeared by
time a guard arrived.
   Hospital officials said the mother, Beverly Owens, did not want
to talk to reporters and would not put calls through to her. The
hospital and police declined to release the name of the father or
other relatives.
   The Hospital and Cuyahoga County Crimestoppers had offered
rewards of $5,000 and $2,000 respectively for information leading
to the return of the baby.
   Ms. Sayre said the hospital had its usual three security guards
on duty at the time the baby disappeared.
   ``The obstetrics department is family-centered because families
want access,'' she said. ``We go by standards, and there was a lot
of activity with family visits.''

   President Daniel Ortega extended a
unilateral cease-fire until July 31 and proposed new talks with
rebel leaders.
   Speaking to 1,200 military officers Thursday soon after
returning from a trip to Cuba, Ortega called the moves a
``demonstration of common sense and responsibility because we don't
want to give up the possibility of a negotiated solution.''
   He added, however: ``This does not mean that we are going to let
down our guard ... because we know that they are not going to keep
their word and are infiltrating forces from Honduras.''
   Ortega proposed holding the talks July 27-29 in Managua. There
was no immediate response from the U.S.-backed rebels, known as
Contras, who began fighting the leftist Sandinista government nerly
seven years ago.
   Earlier talks broke down June 9.
   The current cease-fire, announced by the government at the end
of May when a temporary truce declared by both sides expired, ended
at midnight Thursday.
   A March 1 agreement between the Sandinistas and Contras included
a 60-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations on a permanent truce
and democratic reforms demanded by the rebels.
   The government's extension of the truce came during a visit by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz to U.S. allies in Central
America. His three-day visit includes Guatemala, El Salvador,
Honduras and Costa Rica.
   Ortega said Shultz was bringing the region ``a message loaded
with hate for the people of Nicaragua, directed at seeking how to
isolate it and seek more resources in Congress to continue the war
against Nicaragua.''
   Shultz has criticized Nicaragua during his trip, calling it a
totalitarian society.
   In Cuba, Ortega signed a $150 million assistance agreement under
which Havana will pardon a $50 million Nicaraguan debt.
   Cuba also will provide 270,000 tons of oil in the next three
years, food and technical assistance for sugar refineries and
construction of an industrial plant on the Caribbean coast.
   Ortega said the agreement showed ``the willingness of the Cuban
people and government to contribute with the people and government
of Nicaragua to better face the critical situation that North
American aggression is imposing on us.''

   Scientists injected 2,200 corn stalks
with a microbe effective against the destructive European corn
borer Thursday in the first approved outdoor test of a genetically

   Environmental groups did not oppose the tests, which were
approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the

   The tests of the Cxc-Bt at the federal experimental station here
are the first approved of a genetically altered ``plant vaccine,''
said Peter Carlson, chief scientist of Crop Genetics International,
which developed the biological pesticide.
   Cxc-Bt was also injected into an acre of corn owned by Crop
Genetics on Maryland's Eastern Shore, a company spokesman said.
   Only one other genetically engineered crop protector, Frostban,
a frost-inhibiting microbe, has been approved for field testing by
the EPA.
   ``I think the result could be reduced use of chemicals for crop
protection,'' Carlson said. He said that would be ``good for
farming, good for the environment and good for the food supply.''
   The corn borer, a moth larva introduced to the United States in
1908, is one of agriculture's most destructive pests, attacking
about 200 plant species, Crop Genetics said. It costs American
farmers $400 million a year, according to the U.S. Agriculture
Department.
   The Audubon Society and Environmental Defense Fund took a
wait-and-see attitude.
   The important question is whether testing and regulation will be
adequate because Cxc-Bt is just the beginning of a rush of perhaps
hundreds of similiar products, said Maureen Hinkle, the society's
director of agriculture policy.
   Carlson said the main purpose of the test is to determine
whether the pesticide will spread from plant to plant, an
undesireable effect.
   The microbe works by attacking the alkaline stomach of corn
borers, giving them ulcers. It doesn't affect humans, according to
researchers.
   In previous laboratory experiments, the microbe killed the
borers in petrie dishes and sickened them when tested in a
greenhouse, the company said.
   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington-based Foundation on
Economic Trends, said the pesticide hasn't been shown to work in
greenhouse tests and has lowered corn yields during some tests.

   Teamsters President Jackie Presser,
stricken with brain cancer and hospitalized with a lung clot, had a
clot-catching screen implanted in a vein below his kidneys
Thursday, a hospital spokesman said.
   ``Mr. Presser's vital signs are good following his surgery,''
Lakewood Hospital spokesman David Hopcraf said in a statement. ``We
expect him to continue his recovery throughout the evening.''
   Dr. James R. Bekeny, who specializes in blood vessel surgery,
implanted a Greenfield Filter in the 61-year-old labor leader's
inferior vena cava, a vein below the kidneys.
   The screen, shaped like an umbrella, is pushed through an
incision in the neck's jugular vein and is opened and lodged
permanently to catch potentially life-threatening clots moving from
the legs to the lungs.
   ``If he has no more clots it will sit there,'' said Bekeny.
   Bekeny said Presser's size, frequent bed rest and 1987 lung
cancer and open-heart surgery combined to increase the risk of
clots forming in his legs. Presser weighed about 300 pounds before
he was stricken with cancer.
   Bekeny said the danger of the clot in his right lung has passed.
The clot, which made Presser dizzy and weak Tuesday and prompted
his hospitalization, has stabilized and eventually should dissolve,
the doctor said.
   ``He was in good enough spirits to thank me'' following the
45-minute procedure, during which Presser was conscious but
sedated, Bekeny said.
   Presser was hospitalized just hours after the government filed a
lawsuit in New York to break the Mafia's alleged domination of the
1.6-million member Teamsters, the nation's biggest labor union.
   Presser had a brain tumor removed May 17 at a Phoenix hospital
and later was treated for a smaller tumor affecting his pituitary
gland.
   He relinquished his duties as union president May 4 to
Secretary-Treasurer Weldon L. Mathis because of poor health.
   Three weeks ago, a federal judge in Cleveland accepted a request
by Presser's attorney to postpone Presser's July 12 trial on
racketeering and embezzlement charges.

   The man who prosecuted a teen-ager for
murder and the attorney trying to keep her out of the electric
chair applauded the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Thursday to
consider the constitutionality of executing juveniles.
   At the same time, Lake County Prosecutor Jack Crawford and
William L. Touchette, the attorney for inmate Paula Cooper, agreed
that just because the justices will consider the issue next year
doesn't mean they will resolve it.
   Touchette pointed out the court has heard two Oklahoma cases
involving teen-age killers _ one in 1981 and the other on Wednesday
_ ``and neither case has definitively settled anything regarding
the execution of juveniles.''
   He said both cases were decided on narrow grounds, meaning they
affect cases with similar factual situations and state statutes
without addressing the more sweeping Eighth Amendment issue of
cruel and unusual punishment.
   ``If they keep hearing the cases, eventually they won't have
narrow state law to decide it on. It will be the general
constitutional issue,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, the high court overturned an Oklahoma youth's
death sentence but failed to reach the majority needed to resolve
the juvenile death penalty issue.
   Just 24 hours later, the justices announced they will accept
cases from Georgia and Missouri to reconsider the fate of young
killers.
   Court watchers cautioned against reading too much into the
court's willingness to restudy the issue so promptly.
   ``It's foolish to try and predict what the court will do,'' said
Henry Schwarzschild of the American Civil Liberties Union in
Washington.
   Crawford agreed. ``I think it's very premature to assume ...
they're going to strike down the death penalty for all juveniles,''
he said. ``It is significant they're going to hear it, but it
doesn't dispose of the issue.''
   ``We need an answer. It can end a lot of litigation one way or
another,'' Touchette said.
   Cooper, 18, was 15 when she stabbed a 78-year-old Bible studies
teacher 33 times during a 1985 robbery in Gary that netted her
about $10 and a car. She pleaded guilty.
   Three other teen-age girls were convicted or pleaded guilty, but
Cooper was the only one to receive the death penalty.
   ``We'll continue to press for the death sentence for Cooper in
light of the seriousness of the crime and the maturity of the
defendant in the case,'' said Crawford, who described Cooper as a
``vicious killer.''
   ``In my opinion, you can't assess penalties on the basis of age
because of the wide disparity of maturity,'' he said. ``Any time
you consider a factor that is not a part of the crime, you have a
lot of unfairness.''
   An international outcry about Cooper's sentence prompted the
1987 Legislature from 10 to 16 the minimum age at which a person
can receive the death penalty. Cooper was not affected because the
law was not retroactive.

   Boris N. Yeltsin, the former Moscow party boss,
has asked permission to address the Communist Party's national
conference, an official said Thursday.
   Earlier in the day, a conference delegate said the meeting
should hear Yeltsin to be able to decide whether he supports
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform drive, or if his ideas are ``leftist
eccentricity.''
   Gorbachev accused his tough-talking former protege of excessive
ambition and presided over his removal in November. The previous
month, at a closed-door meeting of the party's policy-making
Central Committee, the 57-year-old Yeltsin had criticized the pace
of Gorbachev's program for change.
   A week after his ouster, Yeltsin was named to a job with the
rank of minister in the State Construction Committee. He is
attending the conference as a delegate from the region of Karelia,
near the Finnish border.
   Yuri A. Sklyarov, head of the Central Committee's Propaganda
Department, told a news conference Yeltsin was among the 261
delegates at the 5,000-member meeting who had asked to speak, but
gave no indication when he might be given the floor.
   During the Moscow summit between Gorbachev and President Reagan,
Yeltsin gave an interview to Western broadcast journalists in which
he called for the resignation of No. 2 Kremlin leader Yegor K.
Ligachev, who is reputedly more conservative than Gorbachev.
   Speaking at the conference, German Zagainov, an administrator in
a scientific institute, turned to Gorbachev and said: ``In the
interview with foreign journalists during the summit with President
Reagan, you ... said it would be interesting for you to know what
Comrade Yeltsin said to foreign journalists. For us, ordinary
members of the party, it would also be interesting.''
   In his televised remarks, Zagainov called Yeltsin a well-known
supporter of Gorbachev's reforms, and asked: ``Why didn't he give
an interview to our press? We would like to know his explanation at
the conference. If it is leftist eccentricity, it will get the
appropriate evaluation. If there is something healthy, we'll
consider it.''
   At the 27th Party Congress in 1986, Yeltsin gave one of the most
talked about addresses, in which he condemned excess privilege for
the Soviet elite.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Lords, the nation's highest court, on
Thursday upheld an equal pay claim by five women who complained
that male co-workers were earning more for doing the same job.
   The five Law Lords dismissed an appeal by Freemans mail-order
company of Peterborough, northern England, which argued that at
least one of its male employees is paid the same as the women as
warehouse operatives.
   The women had argued that male workers earned an extra $7.20 a
week to do ``work of equal value.'' The women earn $131 a week.
   It is the third House of Lords victory in three months for
British women fighting sexual discrimination at work.
   In April, Maria Brown, 35, won a ruling that she had been
unfairly chosen to be laid off from her job with Stockton-on-Tees
borough council in northeast England because she was pregnant.
   In May, a 28-year-old cafeteria cook, Julie Hayward, won her
pioneering fight for equal basic pay _ regardless of fringe
benefits _ with male colleagues at Cammell Laird shipyard in
Birkenhead, northwest England.

<BYLINE>Some Parts of Midwest Go From Drought to Flooding; Cooler Air
Prevails
^By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Parts of the Midwest went from drought to flood conditions
Thursday, while the Northeast saw temperatures plummet to record
lows.
   Parts of Kansas and Nebraska were hit by downpours Wednesday
night and Thursday that flooded roads, filled ponds and sent rivers
rushing.
   Worden, Kan., received 12 inches of rain Wednesday night, and
several other locations about 20 miles south of Lawrence and
Topeka, Kan., received more than eight inches.
   The rain swelled the Wakarusa River at Lawrence to six feet
above flood stage. In Nebraska, up to 10 inches fell 10 miles
southwest of Callaway, and more than five inches were measured six
miles west of Broken Bow.
   On Wednesday, Gerald Martian of rural Trail City, S.D., had
never seen it so dry. On Thursday, he had never seen it so wet
after an estimated 11 inches of rain drenched his farm.
   ``It's too much for one time,'' said Martian, who has been
farming for nearly 30 years.
   Cool weather prevailed in the Northeast as afternoon
temperatures were in the 50s and 60s from New England across New
York and northern Pennsylvania to the northern Great Lakes.
   Readings were in the upper 60s and 70s from the mid-Atlantic
states to South Carolina.
   The Missouri Valley also cooled off, and temperatures were in
the 50s and 60s from western parts of the Dakotas across Nebraska
to northern Missouri.
   Record low temperatures for the date included 48 degrees at
Allentown, Pa.; 50 at Atlantic City, N.J.; 52 at Baltimore; 48 at
Binghamton, N.Y.; 38 at Boise, Idaho; 48 at Cleveland; 38 at
Concord, N.H.; 36 at Duluth, Minn.; 37 at Elkins, W.Va.; 49 at
Harrisburg, Pa.; 44 at Hartford, Conn.; 43 at Madison, Wisc.; 46 at
Mansfield, Ohio; 46 at Pittsburgh; 48 at Syracuse, N.Y., and 44 at
Youngstown, Ohio.
   Thunderstorms extended across parts of the Carolinas and Georgia
and from Alabama and Georgia to Florida.
   Strong winds accompanying thunderstorms toppled trees onto power
lines north of Dothan, Ala., and in northeast Georgia. Winds turned
over a small pumphouse and blew a tree onto a road south of Dothan.
   Severe thunderstorm watches were in effect Thursday night for
parts of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Arkansas,
Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma.
   Showers extended across parts of New York and northern New
England. Rain extended across eastern North Carolina, and from
central South Dakota to western Nebraska. Thunderstorms developed
in southeast Colorado.
   Temperatures reached the 90s in much of Florida, parts of the
Gulf coastal states, the southern Plains and the desert southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 50
degrees at Ithaca, N.Y., and Utica, N.Y., to 106 degrees at Palm
Springs, Calif.
   The low for the nation Thursday morning was 29 degrees at
Yellowstone, Wyo., and West Yellowstone, Mont.
   The forecast for Friday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms extending from the southern Atlantic Coast across
Florida, the Gulf Coast region, the central and southern Plains,
and the southern Rockies to northern Arizona.
   Showers and thunderstorms also are expected in northern Florida
and parts of western Missouri and eastern Kansas. Showers also were
forecast in New York, northern New Jersey and New England.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s or 80s in most of the
nation. Highs will be in the 90s from Florida across the lower
Mississippi Valley and Texas to much of Arizona, Utah, Nevada and
California. Temperatures will hold in the upper 50s and 60s in New
York and New England.

<HEAD>Jane's Says U.S. F-111s With Cruise Missiles To Be Based In
Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jane's Defense Weekly says the United States will
deploy 51 F-111 bombers in Britain armed with cruise nuclear
missiles, but the Pentagon on Thursday denied any such plans.
   The British weekly, viewed as being authoritative on defense
matters, said in its issue published Thursday that the jets armed
with cruise missiles would replace land-based missiles banned under
the superpower arms control agreement.
   Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said in Washington on Thursday,
when asked about the report: ``There are no plans to equip F-111
aircraft with any type of cruise missile in the future.''
   ``Replacement of the aging F-111 force is one of several force
modernization plans that are currently under consideration,''
Hoffman added.
   ``The recently upgraded F-B-111-A will be transferred to the
Tactical Air Forces in the early 1990s and will be redesignated the
F-111-G. The final determination of basing will be fully
coordinated with all relevant parties, including foreign
governments.''
   On Wednesday, the British Defense Ministry acknowledged in a
statement that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was
considering transferring U.S.-based, long-range aircraft to Western
Europe. It did not elaborate.
   However, the ministry said deploying air-launched cruise
missiles in Western Europe ``is not under consideration.''
   A spokesman at U.S. Air Force European headquarters at Ramstein,
West Germany, Lt. Col. Ed Neunherz, said plans have been under
consideration for years to adapt F-111s to carry cruise missiles,
but no NATO go-ahead was given.
   Jane's said Gen. William Kirk, commander-in-chief of the U.S.
Air Force in Europe, said the 51 F-111s ``would augment the
capability of striking targets deep in the Soviet Union from their
new bases in the U.K. (United Kingdom) when armed with nuclear
cruise missiles.''
   The Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty between the United States
and the Soviet Union, signed in December and ratified last month,
provides for elimination of 1,800 Soviet and 800 Allied
medium-range missiles over three years.
   Jane's said F-111s will be transferred from Strategic Air
Command bases in New York and New Hampshire late next year or early
in 1990 to ``bolster NATO's flexible response strategy.''
   The INF treaty covers only land-based missiles with a range from
300 miles to about 3,100 miles.
   The U.S. Air Force said Wednesday that Kirk confirmed in a June
2 interview with the Omaha, Neb., World-Herald that the 51 F-111s
will be transferred on the basis of a one-for-one swap with F-111s
already in Britain.

<TEXT>
   With Gov. Michael Dukakis out of state campaigning
for president, Massachusetts ended the fiscal year with a nearly
$400 million deficit Thursday and headed into the new fiscal year
without a budget.
   Dukakis awaited final action by the Legislature on his plan to
close the books on fiscal year 1988 and on a compromise spending
plan for 1989.
   At the same time, a series of tax bills and fee-raising measures
to help the state pay for expanded spending in fiscal 1989 neared
enactment.
   The Revenue Department, meanwhile, was busy opening envelopes in
a drive to collect every possible tax dollar that can be attributed
to fiscal 1988.
   The agency will not close its books before next week, but one
administration official said Thursday that there was ``no good
news'' in the final month of the fiscal year.
   The Dukakis administration has acknowledged that state
government is technically $397 million short for 1988.
   To deal with that shortfall, the governor has filed the final
supplemental budget of the year, a proposal that includes a plan to
tap cash reserves and make bookkeeping adjustments to close the
gap. State law requires a balanced budget.
   In recent years, Massachusetts has often gone several days or
even weeks into a new fiscal year without a budget.
   House Minority Leader Steven Pierce charged Thursday that it was
``inconceivable'' that the governor would be out of state
campaigning with the budget crisis unresolved.
   Dukakis spokesman Steve Crawford said the government would be in
his office Friday, Saturday and possibly Monday.
   ``He is in constant contact with his office. His chief of staff
and his secretary of administration and finance are regularly
discussing the budget process with legislative leaders,'' Crawford
said.

   A fifth worker died Thursday from cyanide
fumes released when a cleanup job at a metals-plating company went
awry.
   The worker, Craig Fogle, 19, had collapsed in Tuesday's accident
while trying to rescue co-workers, authorities said. He died at
Parkview Memorial Hospital in Fort Wayne, said Westley Falcaro, a
hospital spokeswoman.
   The four other deaths occurred when a worker collapsed while
cleaning the inside of a plating tank at Bastian Plating Co. and
three co-workers either entered or fell into the tank in a rescue
effort, investigators said.
   Hydrochloric acid used in the cleaning mixed with sludge in the
tank to release the cyanide gas, investigators said.
   In addition to the five dead, 24 people, mostly employees and
rescue workers, were injured. One remained hospitalized, a police
officer listed in satisfactory condition at DeKalb Memorial
Hospital, a spokeswoman said.
   The accident raised questions about the training workers receive
in handling chemicals.
   Chemical training ``is extremely important for all employees,
because if something like this happened, they would have the
information so they could react,'' said Sonny Painter, an inspector
for the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   Kirk Carpenter, an attorney for Bastian Plating, said he
believes the company met government safety standards.
   Lance Baughman, who has worked at the plant five years, said he
was required to pass a written test before he began. He said the
test dealt with proper clothing to wear around chemicals and a
coding system for identifying the degree of hazard presented by
particular chemicals.
   But he said test ``basically doesn't tell you anything about the
chemicals themselves. I've been there for five years, and I
basically have had to learn everything on my own, just trial and
error.''

   The first official report to acknowledge that a
peasant protest took place last week in a village near Beijing said
Friday that police who broke it up were unarmed and denied that
anyone was killed.
   The Xinhua News Agency did not comment on statements by Chinese
witnesses that 60 to 70 protesters were seriously hurt by police
using electric cattle prods and clubs and that at least 10 people
remain under arrest.
   Peasants in Guce, 37 miles southwest of Beijing, told The
Associated Press on Thursday that more than 1,500 villagers clashed
with thousands of armed police before dawn June 21.
   Some villagers told Western reporters that three people were
killed, but those who spoke to the AP said they could not confirm
this.
   The peasants were trying to stop a local petrochemical plant
from releasing contaminated water from a reservoir into a stream,
poisoning their wells.
   The peasants gathered at the reservoir to try to halt the
release of water, but police beat them and used cattle prods
indiscriminately, witnesses said.
   Xinhua gave the number of villagers involved as ``hundreds,''
and said most left when officials explained that the water level
was dangerously high and the dam might collapse, causing a flood.
   ``The rest who refused to leave were led away by unarmed
police'' and the water was released, the report said. It gave no
number nor did it say what happened to those led away.
   ``Nobody was killed,'' Xinhua quoted local party secretary Wang
Zuosheng as saying. He made no comment on injuries.
   Peasants told the AP that about 150 people were arrested, but
that all but 10 were released within 48 hours.
   On Thursday, workers were digging trenches down the main village
road to install water pipes to hook up alternate water sources. The
villagers said their well water was made undrinkable by the release
of contaminated water and claimed some people had been sickened by
it.
   Officials have refused to say what chemicals were dumped in the
reservoir, and the Xinhua report did not say. It confirmed that
work was under way to provide drinking water and said 110 tons of
flour were distributed as compensation to about 4,000 affected
farmers.
   The report quoted an official of the Yanshan Petrochemical
Corp., which released the contaminants, as acknowledging the water
contained ``more pollutants than the amount permitted by state
regulations.'' He said the company was installing new equipment to
process waste water in the future.

   Cheering Cambodians lined an airport
road Thursday as Vietnam pulled its military leaders out of
Cambodia, loosening its grip on this long-suffering country after
nearly a decade of combat.
   Vietnam disclosed its casualties in the war for the first time.
It said 55,000 of its troops had been killed since 1977, when
Vietnam began clashing with the China-backed Khmer Rouge regime
which then ruled Cambodia.
   On Thursday, Vietnam officially turned over control of its war
against anti-Vietnamese insurgents to Cambodian commanders.
   ``We think the Cambodian armed forces can shoulder their
responsibilities themselves,'' said Lt. Gen. Le Kha Phieu, a former
deputy commander of Vietnamese forces in Cambodia.
   Gen. Le Ngoc Hien, the Vietnamese commander in Cambodia, and
about 300 of his officers were greeted by thousands of Vietnamese
after flying from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City, once known as
Saigon.
   Earlier in Phnom Penh, an estimated 50,000 Cambodians lined the
city's broad boulevards and the road to the airport as the
Vietnamese officers departed aboard Soviet-made aircraft for the
short flight to Vietnam.
   Robed Buddhist monks offered blessings for a safe journey.
Onlookers waved both Cambodian and Vietnamese flags.
   The military commanders are among 50,000 Vietnamese troops that
Hanoi says will head home by the end of the year in the largest of
seven annual pullouts from Cambodia.
   Officials said 3,000 soldiers also returned to Vietnam Thursday
by buses and trucks.
   The Vietnamese have been fighting a coalition of guerrilla
forces in Cambodia that includes the communist Khmer Rouge, the
non-communist Khmer People's Party and followers of former leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   Cambodian Premier Hun Sen played down fears that a total
Vietnamese withdrawal _ promised by 1990 _ would lead to a return
to power of the Khmer Rouge.
   In Washington, the State Department's top official for Asia said
the world would not accept a Khmer Rouge resurgence.
   ``We do not believe that that can happen ... and we are fully
confident that the international community will never accept
that,'' said Gaston Sigur, assistant secretary of state for East
Asia and Pacific affairs.
   As part of recently intensified efforts to find a political
solution to the Cambodian conflict, U.N. Special Envoy Rafeeuddin
Ahmed was coming to Phnom Penh for talks with Hun Sen. It would be
the first time a U.N. envoy would hold formal talks with the
Cambodian government, which the United Nations does not recognize.
   Knowledgeable Thai sources said the envoy last weekend traveled
to the Thai-Cambodian border to meet Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
leader of the three-party, anti-Vietnamese coalition that is
recognized by the U.N.
   Phieu disclosed that 30,000 Vietnamese died in border clashes in
1977-78 with the Khmer Rouge, who killed more than a million
Cambodians between 1975 and 1978. Phieu said an additional 25,000
Vietnamese troops were killed in Cambodia since Vietnam invaded in
1978.
   He said Hanoi's troops have been sustaining fewer casualties in
recent years, indicating that the guerrilla forces were becoming
weaker. The three-party coalition, backed and supplied by China, is
said by Western analysts to field about 50,000 fighters.
   The Khmer Rouge ``remain a force in Cambodia but are in decline
because they receive no support from the Kampuchean (Cambodian)
people,'' Phieu said.
   He said 13,000 troops have returned home so far this year,
leaving less than 100,000 in the country. All military advisers and
experts had also been pulled out, he said.
   Analysts attribute the withdrawal to crushing domestic economic
problems and pressure from Moscow, Hanoi's chief backer.
   At a departure ceremony, Cambodian Defense Minister Koy Buntha
pledged to strengthen his forces _ said to number about 35,000 _ to
replace the Vietnamese, whom he thanked at the airport for ``your
blood and sacrifice.''
   Hien and his party were presented with garlands by Cambodian
girls dressed in ancient dress as they boarded the aircraft at
Pochentong airport.
   More than 70 foreign journalists followed the departing command
on a separate airplane.
   On arrival in Vietnam, a band played while Hien, sweat rolling
down his face under a scorching sun, shook hands and accepted
flowers from youths dressed in white uniforms and red kerchiefs.
   Deputy Defense Minister Tran Van Quang saluted and embraced the
officers.

<TEXT>
   Greece's 45,000 high school teachers
returned to the classrooms Thursday, ending a five-week strike over
pay and working conditions and allowing senior students to begin
yearend examinations.
   The walkout ended after Education Minister George Papandreou
pledged a special wage supplement of $200 every three months for
work on extracurricular activities. He also promised the teachers
they will get a $112 book allowance.
   Fiercely competitive examinations for entrance to Greece's 17
state-run universities will start July 14, one month later than
scheduled.
   Papandreou, son of Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou, managed
to end the strike after just seven days in office.
   ``I feel tremendously relieved, but a lot still has to be sorted
out,'' the 36-year-old sociologist told The Associated Press.
   Educators have staged intermittent work stoppages throughout the
school year.
   According to European Community statistics, Greek public school
educators are the lowest paid in Western Europe.
   A department head with over 30 years' teaching experience earns
each month the same amount as an Athens taxi driver takes home,
just over $600.

<HEAD>Jackson Says He Will Respond To Dukakis Veep Questionaire</HEAD>

   Jesse Jackson said Thursday he intends to respond
to a request from the campaign of Michael Dukakis for detailed
background information being sought from prospective running mates.
   Jackson, talking to reporters on the front lawn of his home
here, also said he and his wife, Jackie, accepted an invitation
from Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, to dine with the Democratic
nominee-to-be on Monday and attend at Fourth of July concert in
Boston.
   But Jackson refused to comment on whether he would use the visit
to disclose whether he wants to pursue the second spot on the
ticket.
   ``We are quite serious in our quest for consideration and our
request for information as to what are the standards ... the
guidelines,'' Jackson said.
   ``At this point, I will simply pursue the process and convey my
private conclusions to Gov. Dukakis'' later, he said.
   Ron Brown, a top Jackson campaign official in Washington, has
been holding talks with Paul Brountas, Dukakis' campaing chairman
who is coordinating the screening process for the Massachusetts
governor, Jackson said.
   ``There's no reason at this point not to substantially respond''
in person or in writing to requests for information, he said.
   ``It's not very difficult for us,'' Jackson said. ``I'm the only
one under consideration who has passed the same tests as Mike
Dukakis has passed.''
   Jackson said he had already been put under scrutiny by the
Federal Election Commission, the news media and the millions of
people who voted for him during the primary season.
   ``My basic request of Mr. Dukakis ... is to let me know what the
rules are,'' Jackson said. ``I know that tradition leaves out most
American people. Therefore, there must be a new tradition for fair
consideration.''
   Jackson also said he had meetings Thursday to discuss financing
for Keep Hope Alive, a political action committee he plans to
organize.
   He said the committee would ``continue to build a progressive
movement in our country'' by financing voter registration drives
and campaigns in key districts.

   The Air Force Logistics Command on Thursday
said Washington had shifted around enough money to meet its payroll
and avert a money-saving, four-day furlough of 82,500 civilian
workers nationwide.
   The agency is in charge of repairing and supplying Air Force
weapons and has its headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
near here.
   ``We just got word from the Pentagon; we got the money,'' said
Col. Alan V. Cummings, command spokesman. ``That means we have no
need to furlough our work force to make up a civilian payroll
shortfall.''
   The unpaid furloughs had been scheduled to begin sometime after
Aug. 1.
   The House Armed Services Committee approved the shifting of
$36.3 million in maintenance funds into payroll accounts, said Mary
Beth Carozza, spokeswoman for Rep. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, whose
district includes Wright-Patterson.
   The committee's action is final in such matters. The Senate
Appropriations and Armed Services committees and the House
Appropriations Committee also had approved it.
   ``Terrific, terrific. Now maybe we can go back to work with this
anxiety lifted,'' said Paul Palacio, head of a union representing
about 73,000 non-management employees.
   The logistics command has about 7,300 civilian workers at
Wright-Patterson and 2,700 at Newark Air Force Base in Ohio.
   It also operates major centers at Ogden, Utah; Sacramento,
Calif.; San Antonio, Texas; Oklahoma City; Warner Robins, Ga.;
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, and Battle Creek, Mich.
   Gen. Alfred Hansen, AFLC commander, announced in January that
civilians faced furloughs of up to 10 days to make up a $90.6
million payroll shortfall and cuts in the budget.
   But the Air Force found additional money, cutting the proposed
furloughs to four days.
   ``I think what Congress was doing was playing games going into
it,'' DeWine said. ``I think that if Congress comes up with some
realistic figures, we won't go through this again.''

   Church leaders deliberately
violated the law Thursday, and a banned newspaper resumed
publication with a fierce attack on government policies. A bombing
in Johannesburg meanwhile wounded 14 people.
   The bomb exploded in a shopping arcade just after 1 p.m. Shortly
before midnight Thursday, police said they found the mutilated body
of a man believed to have been killed in a second explosion while
trying to set a bomb.
   The government published three bills Friday that would make
possible the first legal multiracial residential areas in South
Africa but also would tighten segregation elsewhere and increase
penalties for violating it. The bills will be debated in August.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary-general of the South African
Council of Churches said leaders of the 26 affiliated churches
``feel we are not obliged to obey apartheid laws _ unjust laws.''
   He and other leaders issued a statement urging Christians to
boycott the Oct. 26 municipal elections on grounds that
participation in structures that perpetuate apartheid is a sin. The
elections are segregated by race.
   Apartheid is the policy of race segregation that preserves power
and privilege for South Africa's 5 million whites and denies rights
and a voice in national affairs to the 26 million blacks.
   New regulations President P.W. Botha imposed June 10, in
extending the state of emergency for a third year, prohibit both
calls for election boycotts and publication of such ``subversive''
statements. About 20 local and foreign journalists covered the news
conference and many reported the statements.
   Violating the regulations carries a maximum penalty of 10 years
in prison or a fine of $8,600.
   ``Each one of the church leaders took into account the possible
implications of their action,'' said the Rev. Beyers Naude, a white
clergyman who is honorary vice president of the council of
churches. ``We felt very strongly we have no option but to be
obedient to the law of God.''
   At least 14 people _ 13 whites and one black _ were hurt by a
bomb that exploded outside a fast food restaurant in the arcade of
the Poyntons Building, which houses the air force and prison
service headquarters on upper floors.
   Hospital officials said none was hurt seriously. Two of the
injured whites were children.
   The sound of a second explosion at about 9:45 p.m. in the city's
Joubert Park area drew police, soldiers and ambulances, but no
damage was found.
   About two hours later, police said they found the mutilated body
of a man near the park's Johannesburg Art Gallery. They said they
believed he was killed by a bomb he was trying to set.
   No further information was immediately available.
   The New Nation newspaper, which Home Minister Stoffel Botha had
banned for three months as a threat to public safety, published a
front-page editorial Thursday saying: ``We are back. Back to
continue writing about the aspirations and desires of the voteless
majority.''
   New Nation, a 2-year-old paper published by the Southern African
Catholic Bishops Conference, has a circulation of 50,000 and is
aimed at the black community.
   It was suspended March 22 under the minister's nearly unlimited
emergency power to close newspapers or restrict their content, and
he is free to reimpose the ban.
   Signers of the statement opposing the elections included
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu; leaders of Presbyterian,
Methodist, Baptist and Evangelical churches, and the Rev. Allan
Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   ``We cannot participate in the elections and we call on all
Christians not to participate in the implementation of their own
oppression or the oppression of others'' by voting or by seeking
office, it said.
   ``These elections cannot be free and fair. ... Many of the
leaders of the people ... are in detention and the people's
organizations are banned.''
   It was the clearest act of civil disobedience by church leaders
since February, when several were arrested trying to march on
Parliament with a petition protesting the banning of 17 major
anti-apartheid groups.
   Clergymen said at the time they would try to fill the gap
created by the banning orders and subsequently have pledged direct,
non-violent action against apartheid laws and emergency regulations.
   The council of churches, which is holding a five-day national
conference this week at St. Barnabas College in Johannesburg,
represents all major Protestant denominations in South Africa
except the white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church, to which most
of the governing Afrikaners belong.

   A military prosecutor charged three
Slovenian journalists and an army officer with revealing military
secrets, it was reported Thursday.
   Janez Jansa and David Tasic, both columnists of the liberal
Mladina youth weekly, and Sgt. Maj. Ivan Borstner, were indicted
``for possessing and revealing a military secret,'' the official
Tanjug news agency said.
   All three have been in military custody since the end of May,
when a police search of their homes and offices uncovered photostat
copies of a classified military document allegedly dealing with the
Yugoslav army's command structure and the combat readiness of some
units.
   The same charges were filed against Mladina's outspoken chief
editor, Franci Zavrl, the agency said, but he has not been
detained. Tanjug cited a statement released by military prosecutor
Col. Zivko Mazic.
   Supporters of Jansa said Thursday he had started a hunger strike.
   ``Jansa started a hunger strike Wednesday that he said will last
until he is set free,'' Bojan Korsika, spokesman for an unofficial
human rights committee, told The Associated Press by telephone from
the city of Ljubljana.
   The arrests have sparked an unprecedented wave of public protest
in Slovenia, where at least 60,000 people have signed a petition
demanding the release of the three.
   About 400 church groups, unofficial forums, trade union
chapters, companies and Communist Party cells have donated money to
a special defense fund.
   Some 30,000 people recently attended a cultural gathering in
Ljubljana which featured a rock concert and speeches by prominent
Slovenian public figures.
   All three journalists have in the past sharply criticized the
Yugoslav army and former Defense Minister Branko Mamula, accusing
him of misappropriating public funds.
   Borstner was accused of having leaked the top-secret military
document to the journalists. The Tanjug statement said he cut off
the top part of the document, which contained the ``classified''
stamp before handing over the paper.
   Jansa and Tasic were arrested soon after Mladina published what
it said was proof the army was plotting to stage a coup in Slovenia
on behalf of conservatives in Yugoslavia's southern republics in
order to quell growing dissent.
   Although Slovenia's leadership has refuted the allegations, it
has demanded that the group be tried by civilian courts.
   Slovenia is the country's economically most developed region.
Its liberal, market-oriented communist leadership has been the
target for frequent attacks from party hardliners in the country's
southern republics, for allegedly not cracking down on
non-conformist tendencies.
   The date of the trial was not disclosed.

   The son of former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro will begin a four-month sentence for
selling a quarter-gram of cocaine Friday after gaining preliminary
approval to serve it under house arrest.
   John Zaccaro Jr. was sentenced two weeks ago, but the sentence
was stayed 30 days pending appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court. If
an appeal had been granted, it may have been a year or more before
the court decided the case.
   But in a surprise move, Zaccaro's lawyers dropped the request
for the stay and asked that Zaccaro, 24, begin serving his sentence
Friday. Judge Francis McCaffrey agreed, deputy court clerk Kathy
Moore said Thursday.
   Zaccaro probably will spend his first 24 hours in maximum
security at Chittenden Community Correctional Center in South
Burlington, standard procedure for new inmates, said Addison County
State's Attorney John Quinn.
   McCaffrey, in sentencing Zaccaro to four months in jail, had
suggested he be allowed to participate in a new state program under
which he would live in a Corrections Department-approved apartment
and could leave only with permission.
   Corrections Department spokesman John Perry said Zaccaro had
gained preliminary approval for the program. Ordinarily, people
accepted into the program check in at the jail and then begin their
sentence, Perry said.
   The program is open to non-violent offenders sentenced to four
months in jail in less. To be accepted, they must be screened by
parole and probation officials, who make the decision along with
the Corrections Department.
   Under the program, Zaccaro could begin the 300 hours of
community service his sentence entails. The judge fined Zaccaro
$1,500 as well.
   Zaccaro was arrested two years ago on charges of selling $25
worth of cocaine to an undercover officer at Middlebury College,
where he was a student. Trooper Laura Manning testified she went to
Zaccaro's off-campus home and inquired about buying cocaine. She
said Zaccaro produced a tray of cocaine packets from underneath a
sofa. Zaccaro was arrested later that night.
   Defense attorney Charles Tetzlaff claimed Zaccaro had been
entrapped by a pretty woman. The defense also had contended Zaccaro
was singled out for prosecution because of his famous mother.

   A TV station broadcast a closed-captioned
message promising deaf viewers, in vulgar terms, a glimpse of
breasts and buttocks at the Miss Wisconsin beauty pageant.
   WISC news director Tom Bier said the caption was mistakenly
aired after it was filed on the department's computer. The female
employee responsible was suspended for five days, said station
manager David Banks.
   ``There was no intention for this to get on the air. It
shouldn't have happened, but it did,'' Bier said. ``We do apologize
for it.''
   The offending phrase was broadcast Saturday. Deaf viewers, who
use decoders to receive captions on the screen, were told to expect
scenes from that day's pageant on the 10 p.m. news.
   ``To my knowledge we've only had one call about it today,'' Bier
said Thursday.
   Sue Captain, co-director of the Miss Wisconsin pageant, called
the message ``completely demeaning _ not only to the pageant, but
to the deaf community as well.''
   Bette Mentz-Powell, coordinator of interpreter services for the
state Office of the Hearing Impaired, said she was unaware of any
complaints.
   ``If I'd have been tuned in, I would have screamed. It is
offensive to all women,'' she said. ``It doesn't matter whether it
was broadcast'' over the closed-caption system or read aloud.

   Federal programs that encourage farmers to
produce less and export more could be cut back because of the
drought gripping the Farm Belt, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
E. Lyng said Thursday.
   ``I think we will continue to export crops,'' Lyng said. ``But
we may not be as aggressive as we have in the past because it looks
like we will have a reduction in surplus stocks.''
   Lyng told a meeting of producers, processors and retailers that
the Agriculture Department is working with Congress to devise a
drought-relief plan, adding that it was too early to tell how
damaging the drought will be.
   ``During July we'll look at the status of each crop to see if we
need to make changes in any government programs,'' Lyng said.
   Lyng said the department had begun several emergency programs to
help farmers and ranchers locate hay and forage for livestock.
   Several officials at the meeting predicted consumers would soon
be paying less at the meat counter because the drought, by drying
up pastures and driving up feed prices, has forced producers to
sell off cattle early and at reduced prices.
   ``Beef prices should be going down right now,'' said Dean
Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau. ``If the consumers
don't see lower prices in the supermarket within the next few
weeks, it's time to ask the store manager why not.''

<HEAD>Workers Strike To Protest Killing Of Six Coca Leaf Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MCFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 48-hour general strike called to
protest the killing of six coca leaf farmers shut down many
factories, mines, trains and domestic airline flights on Thursday.
   But in this capital city and other major towns, banks,
businesses, government offices and city transportion operated
normally.
   The strike began Thursday and was organized by the Workers
Central, which represents most of Bolivia's labor force.
   The labor federation also called on farmers to block roads and
suspend providing food supplies to the cities, but there were no
reports of roadblocks in the vicinity of La Paz or other major
cities.
   Workers Central said in a statement that it organized the strike
because ``we can no longer support the abuses, crimes and social
injustice committed by the government.''
   The statement criticized police for the deaths and demanded the
removal of U.S. military and Drug Enforcement Administration agents
operating in the Chapare, a tropical region to the east of La Paz
where Monday's confrontation took place.
   The six men were killed by Bolivian police gunfire Monday when
thousands of coca leaf farmers surged toward a police and DEA camp
trying to take it over. They were protesting U.S.-backed bills in
the Bolivian legislature that would outlaw most of the Chapare coca
plantations.
   At least 300,000 Bolivian farmers depend on coca leaf farming
and cocaine processing for their livelihood. Coca leaf is the raw
material for cocaine.
   The country's conservative government attributed the violence to
``cocaine traffickers and politicians who are trying to prevent the
approval of the law.'' The U.S. government is conditioning part of
its economic aid to passage of the measure, which would also impose
stiff penalities on traffickers.
   A joint session of Congress that was meeting this week to pass
the bill postponed consideration of the measure after Monday's
violence until a new session of congress convenes Aug. 6.
   Bolivia, an impoverished country of 6.7 million in the heart of
South America, produces an estimated one third of the cocaine that
reaches U.S. and European markets, the DEA says.

<TEXT>
   Time ran out Thursday for 19- and
20-year-old drinkers in Wyoming, which capitulated to what the
governor called ``federal blackmail'' and became the last state to
raise its drinking age to 21.
   A Casper bar promoted discounted drink prices Thursday night and
free T-shirts during ``The Final Countdown.''
   After several years of bucking the government's dictate that
Wyoming raise the age limit to 21 or lose a percentage of its
highway funds, the Legislature earlier this year reluctantly
acceded.
   Gov. Mike Sullivan issued a plea this week for a smooth
transition when the law took effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
   ``We were the last state in the Union to adopt the national
21-year-old drinking age, and now the attention of the country is
focused on us briefly,'' he said Wednesday.
   ``Let us make this change go smoothly and effectively, and let
us hope that it brings the results for which it is intended _ a
reduction in alcohol-related deaths and injuries on our highways.''
   The Democratic governor urged 19- and 20-year-old drinkers to
observe the change ``with the maturity that you have shown
consistently throughout this debate.''
   Many 19- and 20-year-olds voiced their opposition to the law
Thursday night.
   ``Just when my friends all turn of age, they smack it to me,''
said 19-year-old Tom Evans. ``If I get arrested for drinking under
age, I'm going to raise hell. They shouldn't be taking our rights
away. If I'm old enough to go to war, I'm old enough to drink.''
   Wayne Hassinger, a 20-year-old at a bar in Cheyenne, agreed.
``Once you've given someone a right, I don't think you ought to
take it away,'' he said.
   ``I'll just drink at home,'' said 19-year-old Jim Satorius.
   While Sullivan said the state would not tolerate drunken drivers
at any age, he expressed displeasure with the way the state was
forced to raise the limit.
   ``To the nation, I say that Wyoming has complied, somewhat
reluctantly, with the edict that the national drinking age be 21.
Many of us did not and do not agree with the manner in which this
came to pass,'' he said. ``Federal blackmail should not be

issues.''
   While the Legislature raised the age limit, it did not ban
19-and 20-year-olds from bars. Some communities passed ordinances
banning them as of Friday. In other communities, liquor
associations decided on bans of their own.
   The Natrona County Liquor Dealers Association voted unanimously
Wednesday to ban 19- and 20-year-olds from its watering holes after
the Casper City Council failed to institute such a ban.
   ``I'd rather not serve'' a 19- or 20-year-old than see him get
killed in a wreck afterward, said Nick Kamboris of the Paradise
Lounge in Casper.
   Cheyenne tavern owners also agreed to ban the younger customers.
   ``We'd really like to be able to keep them in,'' said K.C. Ryan,
assistant manager for Mingles. ``A lot of that age group are really
good, regular customers. We'll lose a lot of business. But with the
fines and insurance rate problems, we just can't let them in.''

<HEAD>Military Announces Sweeping Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military announced a
shake-up on Thursday, reassigning three generals and 27 colonels
during a time of growing instability.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte is dying of liver cancer, his
governing Christian Democratic Party is divided, and a leftist
insurgency persists into its eighth year.
   The changes Thursday, the most sweeping in five years, were
announced hours after U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz met
top officers at the Defense Ministry to discuss the civil war and
allegations of human rights abuses by the military.
   Gen. Adolfo Blandon, head of the joint chiefs of staff,
announced the changes at a news conference at his headquarters.
   Last week, Blandon and acting President Rodolfo Castillo
Claramount acknowledged there had been talk of a military coup, but
they dismissed it as idle musing.
   The armed forces, which have great power and influence under the
civilian government, called Thursday's changes routine.
   ``The changes are comparable in scope to those of 1983, when
what was achieved was a more dynamic army,'' Blandon said.
   The commanders of the brigades based in Chalatenango and Morazan
provinces _ the two zones where the insurgency is strongest _ were
among those replaced.
   Shultz told reporters he planned to tell the military brass
``that we must see a strong effort, as we have seen, to combat the
terrorist guerrillas.''
   The United States has poured huge amounts of aid into El
Salvador, but the army has been unable to end the civil war that
has killed an estimated 65,000 people since 1979.
   Blandon also said it was ``probable'' he would retire in the
coming months. He has headed the joint chiefs since 1983.
   He said several senior officers had retired after completing 30
years of service, ``making way for younger officers to rise.''
Recent armed forces unrest has been blamed on unhappiness among
younger officers, who believed their careers have been stagnating
since the 1983 shake-up.
   Security forces were blamed for the murder of tens of thousands
of suspected leftists in the early 1980s.
   The record improved markedly after Duarte took office, but
politically motivated killings have been rising this year. Many
were blamed on security forces or right-wing death squads.
   Duarte's diagnosis early in June added to the general climate of
instablity in El Salvador.
   The president is now in Washington for treatment. His doctors
say he probably has a few months to live. His party has split over
chosing a candidate for the March 1989 presidential elections.

<HEAD>Tiny `Star Wars' Rocket Tested Successfully</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a rare public demonstration of Star Wars
technology, Rocketdyne on Thursday tested what it calls the free
world's most efficient rocket engine, a 2-ounce thruster designed
for use on a missile-killer.
   The engine tested at a company laboratory in the hills above
suburban Simi Valley was designed for use as a ``divert thruster''
for a space-based interceptor in the proposed Strategic Defense
Initiative, Rocketdyne said.
   It would guide the interceptor, also known as a kinetic kill
vehicle, from its base on a satellite toward an incoming nuclear
missile, the company said in a statement. The KKV would then
destroy the incoming missile, Rocketdyne said.
   A KKV would destroy targets through force of impact and is
conceived as a non-nuclear device, the company said.
   Officials from the Air Force Space Division, Rocketdyne and its
parent company, Rockwell International, deemed the test successful.
   With a weight-to-thrust ratio of 1-to-1,200, the thruster is the
most efficient ``in the free world,'' Rocketdyne said.
   ``The engines we were running with around five years ago were
1-to-20,'' said Ernie Bunch, a Rocketdyne engineer in the
space-based interceptor, or SABIR, program.
   Officers from the Air Force Space division in El Segundo and
managers from Rockwell International watched the demonstration.
   Rocketdyne officials did not put a price on each engine but said
the company's contract to develop it was worth about $30 million.
   The engine was fired, or pulsed, for five milliseconds while
fixed on a stand and then was shut off for a tenth of a second.
This cycle was repeated dozens of times. The result sounded like
machine gun fire.

   A Cuban professor said Thursday he defected to the
United States on the pretext of visiting Nobel Prize-winning author
Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
   Antonio Ricardo Valle, a 32-year-old professor of
Marxist-Leninist studies at the University of Havana, revealed his
defection at a news conference here.
   He defected June 10 in the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, Colombia, and
was given permission from the State Department to fly to Miami last

   ``He didn't know, essentially, my political views,'' Valle said
of Garcia Marquez, who helped him obtain travel papers to Colombia.
``He didn't know I didn't conform to Castro's system.''
   Valle, who met Garcia Marquez at the home of a mutual friend in
Havana, said the 1982 Nobel laureate is a ``very close friend of
Castro's.''
   Garcia Marquez called two or three times a week to speak with
the leader of the communist nation and visited Valle on trips to
Cuba, the defector said.
   ``He encouraged me not to fear being critical,'' Valle said.
``But I would explain to him I had hundreds of pages hidden in my
home I knew would never be published because of political
censorship.''

   Two members of Congress said they expected
``many indictments'' in the investigation of fraud and bribery in
Pentagon contracts after they were briefed in secret session
Thursday by the director of the Naval Investigative Service.
   The officials ``are very, very sure of their case,'' Re. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., said after Rear Adm. Ted Gordon met with members
of the House Armed Services Committee.
   ``It's pretty iron-clad,'' she said, adding that she expects
``many indictments.''
   Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., said, ``many, many indictments will
be forthcoming.... I don't think it will be too long before the
first of them will be coming down.''
   Hopkins cautioned that ``this case has a long, long way to go.
But when it's finished, people are going to go to jail.''
   Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., sounded an even more
cautious note, saying, ``The information collected so far is not
much of an investigation. It's been more like an
information-gathering process. From now on, with the subpoenas, the
search warrants, the investigation is just beginning.''
   The real test of the system, said Aspin, ``is how many
indictments there are.''
   Under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and
consultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagon
officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning
contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Aspin's call Wednesday for Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
to order ``absolutely no contracts signed for 60 days (or) six
weeks'' with companies implicated in the criminal investigation was
rejected Thursday by the Pentagon.
   ``We would be glad to discuss with the Congress the question of
freezing awards of new contracts while the Justice Department is
investigating allegations of procurement fraud,'' said Pentagon
spokesman Fred S. Hoffman. ``But at this point we feel it would be
imprudent to apply such a freeze or moratorium.''
   If the Pentagon froze new contracts, ``the innocent would suffer
as well as the guilty.... You may be sure that we will take
precautions in any awards,'' Hoffman said.
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported in Friday's editions
that a company headed by two representatives of defense contractors
intervened in a foreclosure case to relieve Rep. Bill Chappell,
D-Fla., and his companies of $266,322 in unpaid debts related to a
failed health club in Florida.
   The intervention by Racquet Club of Ocala Inc. canceled
Chappell's and his partner's personal liability for a large part of
their indebtedness and removed them from a lawsuit related to
foreclosure, the newspaper said, citing court papers, other
documents and interviews. The Racquet Club's principal officers
were Leonard Kilgore, a former Chappell aide who then was an
official of rocket manufacturer Avco Corp., and George Dalferes, an
employee of Martin Marietta.
   Chappell, chairman of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee, told the newspaper that Kilgore learned of his
financial problems and put together a deal to buy out a bank's
outstanding notes on the health club. Chappell said no one had done
him any favors, and that the deal was an independent transaction
between the bank and an investors' group.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson has said no members of Congress are
under investigation in the defense fraud and bribery probe.
   In California, The Orange County Register reported Thursday that
it had obtained documents in the probe showing that investigators
who conducted a series of searches June 14 were looking for
documents tying defense contractor consultant Fred Lackner to
Stuart Berlin, a civilian Navy official who drafts contracts for
electronics systems.
   Lackner's home and office in the Woodland Hills section of Los
Angeles and Berlin's office in Arlington, Va., just outside of
Washington, were searched by FBI agents June 14, when the
investigation became public.
   Berlin, an executive with the Naval Air Systems Command, is one
of six Pentagon officials who have been transferred to other duties
since the probe became public.
   The newspaper obtained documents listing items sought in the
June 14 searches of Lackner's office and home, the offices of
Litton Data Systems in Van Nuys, Calif., Northrop Corp.'s Ventura
division aircraft group and Teledyne Electronics. The Northrop and
Teledyne facilities searched are in Newberry Park, Calif.
   Lackner's attorney, William Dougherty, told the newspaper
Lackner had known Berlin for ``10 or 12 years'' and that both have
worked for Litton Industries Inc., of which Litton Data Systems is
a division. Lackner was once a contract administrator for Litton.
   According to the documents, investigators searching Lackner's
home and office sought documents relating to ``any business
relationships and@or contacts'' with Berlin, Northrop consultant
William Parkin, and Michael Savaides, a Washington marketing
representative for Teledyne Electronics.
   Parkin's office in Alexandria, Va., also was searched June 14.
   The investigators also sought financial and bank records that
would show payments to Lackner or ``payments from him (that) may
have been withdrawn in connection with Lackner's transactions with
Parkin, Berlin and Savaides for the years 1986, 1987, 1988,'' the
documents said, according to the Register.
   The documents revealed that Teledyne employed Parkin for
$150,000 in late 1987 or 1988.
   Parkin worked for the Navy's Joint Cruise Missile Project Office
from 1977 to 1983, as chief of the contracting division and as
deputy for acquisition, before becoming a consultant.
   In the searches involving Lackner, investigators also sought a
communication from Berlin regarding the disqualification of
Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp., a small New Jersey-based
manufacturer, in the competition for a contract for a radar-testing
device for the Navy known as the AN@APM 424.
   Teledyne has a contract to produce the device, which is used to
test electronic ``friend or foe'' systems used in thousands of Navy
ships and aircraft.
   The documents sought in the searches, according to the
newspaper, included an 11-page Marine Corps report, which
investigators believe Litton Data Systems had obtained, on a
battlefield computer system still on the drawing boards.
   In searching Northrop's offices, agents looked for ``contracts
or agreements'' between that company and Parkin or Washington
consultant William Galvin, and documents pertaining to Northrop's
efforts to obtain a contract to build a pilotless airplane, or
drone. Northrop has a contract to build 100 drones for the Navy for
$33.5 million.
   Galvin's office in Washington was searched June 14.

   But the department is by no means alone in having a dismal

sexual harassment is ``pervasive, costly and systemic'' in the

   In a report issued Wednesday, the board said 42 percent of women

   The United States' foreign debt burden climbed
to $368.2 billion in 1987, a sharp 36.8 percent rise over the
previous year, as the country lengthened its lead as the world's
largest debtor nation.
   The Commerce Department said the new debt total was $99 billion
higher than the $269.2 billion in debt to foreigners that the
United States owed at the end of 1986.
   The debt means that foreigners now own more in U.S. assets than
Americans own abroad. For 1987, the government reported that
foreign holdings in the United States increased to $1.54 trillion
from $1.34 trillion at the end of 1986. American investments

   A courtroom decision made by flipping a coin
often can be more accurate than one based on the judgment of
psychologists and psychiatrists, according to a study.
   David Faust, an associate professor of pscyhology at Brown
University, and Jay Ziskin, a California lawyer and psychologist,
said in a Science article for publication Friday that jurors or
other citizens can make psychological judgments as accurately as
the professionals, ``thus raising substantial doubt that
psychologists or psychiatrists meet legal standards for expertise.''
   Psychological experts often are used in criminal trials to
assess the mental health and the potential for violence of
defendants. In many states, the punishment phase of capital murder
trials takes into consideration a prediction of the continued
violent behavior of the defendant. Often the state calls on
psychologists or psychiatrists for opinions.

   On Thursday, it officially turned over control of its war
against anti-Vietnamese insurgents to Cambodian commanders.

   The withdrawal of Vietnamese forces
from Cambodia has conjured fears of a comeback by the dreaded Khmer
Rouge, one of the most brutal regimes of modern times.
   Although it has been nearly a decade since the Khmer Rouge were
toppled by the Vietnamese invasion, there is a fear in southeast
Asia of a reprise of their 1975-78 reign of terror in Cambodia.
According to some estimates, up to 3 million people died.
   ``One has to be either naive or an idiot to believe that the
Khmer Rouge in the '80s can be different from the Khmer Rouge of
the '70s,'' Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former leader, said
recently.

   Convicted sex offenders in Georgia and Washington will be
required to submit to AIDS tests under laws effective Friday, while
Colorado apparently is the first state to require such a test for
those charged but not yet convicted of sex offenses.
   Of dozens of new state laws taking effect July 1, many are
efforts to deal with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a deadly
disease for which there is no cure and which is spread mainly
through sexual contact and the sharing of needles by drug abusers.
   Colorado's law would make test results available ``to any victim
of the sexual offense who requests such disclosure,'' but those
victims would face fines or jail terms if they disclosed the
information to unauthorized people.

   Europe's ancient cities built on waterways know
well the hazards of depending on bridges. Some have experienced the
kinds of problems New York City and other areas of the United
States are now beginning to recognize.
   The oldest bridges in Europe, cared for over the centuries as
treasures of heritage, have fared very well _ some for a thousand
years. Some bridges built in Roman times in Italy still stand,
virtually in their original form.
   Most of Europe's older bridges are small and not burdened by
heavy traffic. But the modern spans that carry heavy trucks and
cars are a constant expense and a frequent inconvenience at
maintenance time.
   The U.S. Federal Highway Administration said last year that of
575,607 American bridges at least 20 feet long, 243,646, or 42.3
percent, were in need of some kind of repair. No comparable figures
are available for Europe.
   In New York City, the Williamsburg suspension bridge between
Brooklyn and Manhattan, which carried some 400 subway trains and
100,000 motor vehicles a day, was found to be dangerously eroded
and closed in April, creating a massive traffic dislocation. The
Williamsburg, built in 1903, has since reopened but only for cars
and subway trains.
   One of Western Europe's relatively newer bridges did fall down
12 years ago. The Reichsbruecke (Empire Bridge) in Vienna, Austria,
caved in Aug. 1, 1976, tossing a city bus and a passenger car into
the Danube. But it was a Sunday morning and the bus was empty. The
bus driver saved himself but the motorist died.
   A 1,500-foot stretch of bridge fell, a commission said, because
of a defective pier and shortcomings in its construction less than
50 years before.
   In Copenhagen, Denmark, authorities are trying to decide whether
to repair or replace the landmark Knippelsbro drawbridge, one of
three links between the capital and Amager island, site of the
airport and major industries.
   The first, wooden, Knippelsbro was built in 1618 but the
existing iron bridge went up in 1937, designed for 9,000 cars a
day. By 1986, 40,000 vehicles and about 20,000 bicycles were
crossing daily. The drawbridge opens about eight times a day with
frequent breakdowns.
   ``I don't like being responsible for that wreck,'' said city
engineer Jens Boerbach. ``Something's got to be done about it soon,
because someday the bascules maybe will get stuck and then we'll be
in trouble.''
   Bascules are counterweighted seesaw-like devices that make
drawbridges go up and down.
   Boerbach said renovation would cost $17 million. Replacement
would cost $5 million dollars more.
   Stockholm, Sweden's capital, is built on the water and regular
maintenance of its more than 100 bridges causes long detours,
forcing drivers into a confusing one-way maze.
   Europe's longest bridge, the 3.7-mile Olandsbron running from
Sweden's southeast coast to the island of Oland, is about to
undergo a five-year repair project costing $10 million to $15
million.
   Although only 16 years old, steel reinforcements in the bridge's
concrete pillars are corroding.
   The Dutch, having wrested more than half their lowland country
from the sea, have developed bridge maintenance into an art.
   The 3,300-foot Moerdijk Bridge spans the Hollands Diep, a branch
of the Rhine estuary, and when completed in 1936, it overcame a
formidable water barrier between the northern and southern
Netherlands.
   But as it became a bottleneck in the Rotterdam-Antwerp highway,
the Dutch managed to widen it from two to six lanes while retaining
the nine original brick and concrete piers.
   In 1978, its 10 steel-girded parts, each 330 feet long, were
removed one by one over 10 consecutive weekends and replaced by a
six-lane concrete highway resting on the old piers, which were
adapted for the extra width. During the three-month project,
traffic used the bridge on weekdays.
   The thrifty and resourceful Dutch even sent two of the old
segments to Hoogvliet near Rotterdam to serve as a local bridge.
   West Germany lost most of its bridges in World War II and 90
percent of the existing ones are about 30 years old.
   The West German government spends about $176.5 million annually
maintaining thousands of bridges on its highway system. By 1995, it
expects to be spending about $470 million a year to keep the
bridges in top shape, says Heinrich Poppinga of the West German
Transport Ministry.
   England will get $91.7 million for bridge maintenance in 1988-89
of which $38.5 million will go to 33 bridges. The pound-sterling
equivalent of $8.75 million is earmarked for some of the oldest
bridges, but not for London's 25 Thames River spans, whose upkeep
is financed by the capital's boroughs.
   The massive Tower Bridge, as evocative a part of London's
skyline as Big Ben, is not nearly as old as its mock-Gothic style
suggests.
   Opened in 1894, it is a drawbridge, raised by Victorian
state-of-the-art hydraulics until 1976 when it was electrified. The
stone-clad steel towers contain elevators that carry pedestrians _
mostly sightseers nowadays _ to high-level walkways.
   The great Victorian bridge pile shrugs off serious damage when,
from time to time, a wayward tidal current smashes a ship into it.
   The City of London spent $7 million fixing it up in 1982. It
still opens about five times a week for tall ships.
   The latest London Bridge was built in 1971 after the 1831
version was shipped stone by stone to Lake Havasu City in Arizona
as a tourist attraction.
   Europe's ancient bridges do not usually carry heavy traffic.
   An exception is Paris' Pont Neuf (New Bridge), completed in
1608, which endures thundering car traffic in the city center as
one of the French capital's 35 bridges across the River Seine.
   Pont Neuf has been restored many times, but its basic
construction is unchanged. All material used in repairing it and
the four others classed as historic monuments is scrupulously
chosen to respect its character.
   No city depends more on its bridges than Italy's Venice, built
around a network of canals. The absence of cars is a help, and only
one bridge, the 408-year-old Ponte delle Guglie over the Canale di
Cannareggio, is undergoing some restructuring, forcing the
suspension of one waterbus route.
   Cement and resins are being injected into the bridge, which was
showing signs of structural weakness. It was restored once before,
in 1776.
   The Ponte Fabricio, built in A.D. 62 between central Rome and
Tiberina island, is entirely original. But it takes no vehicular
traffic. Ponte Cestio, linking the island to the Trastevere
district, was built in 46 B.C. and restored in 1892 with a new
central arch. Its car traffic is restricted to those using the
island's hospital.
   The Ponte Vecchio, crossing the Arno in Florence, was built in
1345 and underwent major structural restoration because of World
War II damage in the early 1950s and again in the 1960s, when iron
bars were inserted in the pylons. It now takes only pedestrian
traffic.
   ``They really don't make bridges like they used to,'' said Paolo
Mazzoni, Florence's environment commissioner. ``If it wasn't for
the World War II blasts, there would never have been a need for
structural renovation of the Ponte Vecchio.''

<HEAD>Popular Hispanic Leader Moving to Sidelines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a decade Henry Cisneros has been
the pre-eminent Hispanic leader _ a successful mayor, an articulate
speaker, a thoughtful politician, a powerful role model.
   At the height of his prestige, he is moving to the sidelines,
maybe even getting out of politics.
   He's turned down an offer to speak at the Democratic National
Convention, quashed any talk of the vice presidency and ruled out
trying to spread his ``San Antonio Miracle'' with a statewide race
in Texas in 1990.
   Even as national attention turns to the power of Hispanic
political clout this year, Cisneros says he may not seek
re-election as mayor.
   Cisneros said of his move out of the national arena, ``It's a
decision that I've made.''
   ``For the moment my total and exclusive focus is on San Antonio
issues,'' he said. ``We're in a period of tremendous resurgence in
San Antonio after the Texas slump and we have many, many
initiatives here that are setting this city in position for the
long run.''
   His attention is also focused on a year-old son with a
congenital heart defect who will require extensive surgery at about
the same time as the 1990 campaigning season.
   Cisneros also talks regularly with two businessmen about joining
them in a corporate venture.
   To other Hispanics leaders across the country, not having Henry
Cisneros out front carrying the torch will be a setback.
   ``He leaves a huge vacuum,'' said Los Angeles City Councilwoman
Gloria Molina. ``His soft-spoken yet direct way is what we need and
I don't know if anyone else can sit down with presidential
candidates, labor leaders, or whoever and look them in the eye and
not give in.
   ``As he steps to the sidelines, he'll be sorely missed,'' Molina
said.
   ``Everyone thinks it's a shame but they respect his
priorities,'' said Harry Pachon, director of the National
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.
   Cisneros, interviewed four years ago by Walter Mondale as a
possible running mate, says he'll campaign for Democrat Michael
Dukakis this fall, and he'll announce Sept. 15 his decision on a
possible fifth term as mayor.
   He often points out he's never put himself forward as any sort
of official Hispanic spokesman or leader, and says he turned down a
chance to address the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta
because he just didn't have the time.
   ``To take weeks off to prepare a quality major speech and then
deliver it just adds to the weight of what I need to do here on
things I have promised to do,'' including projects on water,
education, drugs and a domed stadium, he said.
   He says he doesn't see a gap in Hispanic political leadership.
   ``I can see from the Jesse Jackson experience that it might be
useful to have someone who could bring people together and speak
for people in a way that Jackson is doing,'' Cisneros said.
   ``But frankly, the Hispanic community doesn't lend itself to
that. There are more differences in the Hispanic community than
there are in the black community. ... My sense is what is happening
is very productive and that is a lot of leadership is being
developed across the country.''

   Projectionist Willie Brewer flipped a switch
at the Mountain View Drive-In, sending a stream of film into some
humming equipment that quickly shot a powerful beam of light over
car roofs to a huge screen.
   The Warner Brothers logo that appeared was visible to motorists
driving up the Mountain Parkway into eastern Kentucky, where, as in
other parts of the country, only a handful of drive-in theaters
survive in an era of video rentals and high land values.
   ``I don't know why people aren't coming now like they did two
years ago,'' said David Baker, who has owned the theater since
1957. ``Business is down. VCRs have hurt us more than anything else
that has come down the pike.''
   Baker frowned. About one-third of his grassy parking spaces were
filled _ a disappointing turnout for a Saturday night, especially
considering that the Mountain View was showing family-oriented
first-run films.
   Baker's frustrations are shared by the owners of other drive-in
theaters across the country. The New York-based National
Association of Theater Owners reports 2,074 drive-in movie screens
were in operation last year.
   That compares to 3,670 drive-in theaters operating 20 years ago,
including hundreds that had two or more screens, and the peak of
4,063 drive-in theaters in 1958, according to the association.
   Malcom Green, president of the theater owners group, said
several factors have prompted the decline in drive-ins, including
suburban real estate development, the faded novelty of automobiles,
smaller numbers of traditional families and competition from
multi-screen theaters in shopping malls.
   ``I can't see where there's much hope for a turnaround,
especially with the high land values,'' said Green, who is senior
vice president of Hoyts Cinemas Corp., a large East Coast theater
chain based in Boston.
   Drive-in theaters were highly popular immediately after World
War II, Green said, adding that their ``golden age'' lasted from
around 1950 to about 1970, when the industry entered slow but
steady decline.
   Most of the outdoor theaters were built before 1960 on plots
larger than 12 acres, usually far outside of a city on
well-traveled highways, Green said. In the 1960s and 1970s, cities
expanded and land values increased, but the outdoor theaters only
generated money after dark and in good weather.
   ``Drive-ins became suburban,'' Green said. ``The land became
valuable. It became too valuable to devote to a seasonal
operation.''
   Loading the kids into the family car for an outing to the
drive-in _ or just for an aimless drive _ were common evening
activities in the 1950s and early 1960s, Green said.
   ``People now are less devoted to driving around in a car,''
Green said. ``The idea of just sitting in a car has dwindled.''
   Drive-ins, which often show the same films for one to three
weeks, also have a tough time competing with indoor theaters with
multiple screens that offer several films at the same time, Green
said.
   Many drive-ins lost their qualifications to show first-run
movies in the 1970s and switched to ``action-oriented'' films,
frequently with sexual themes, Green said. As a result, parents
stopped taking children to drive-ins and a generation has missed
the outdoor movie experience, he said.
   Jack Absher, who owns indoor theaters with 15 screens in eastern
Kentucky, closed the Prestonsburg Drive-In, the last of three
drive-ins he once owned, two years ago. Unlike Green, he sees only
one reason for the decline of drive-ins.
   ``I blame it solely on daylight-savings time,'' Absher said.
   When daylight-saving time was introduced permanently in the late
1960s, the starting time for summer drive-in movies went from about
8 p.m. to around 9 p.m. Many people, Absher said, found they could
no longer attend and then get up in time to go to work in the
morning.
   But in Stanton, children can still watch the movies on blankets
next to their parents' car. The smell of popcorn continues to fill
the night air as shadowy figures make their way to the concession
stand amid the soundtrack echos from hundreds of window speakers.
   And Baker says he plans to hold out until the drive-in movie
business booms again or outdoor theaters become so scarce that
people will drive long distances to view his big screen.
   ``People will come back,'' he predicted. ``I think one of these
days people will go out looking for a drive-in movie.''

   If California and New York were nations, they'd
be among the world's 10 richest.They're first and second in
population among the 50 states. From Wall Street and Hollywood,
Madison Avenue and Silicon Valley, they often set an agenda
followed by the rest of the country, sometimes grumblingly. Here,
AP writers in Albany, N.Y., and Sacramento Calif., respectively,
look at the ways and means and myths of the Empire State and the
Golden State.

   California and New York, bi-coastal dynamos that generate much
of the nation's intellectual, financial and social energy, are far
apart in tradition, outlook and image.
   New and old. L.A. cool and Manhattan brash. Hollywood hipster
and Madison Avenue huckster.
   New York and California have long been targets of the nation's
wisecracks. Yet the profound influence they exert over Americans'
way of life, finances and collective consciousness is no joke.
   Nearly one-half of those who made Forbes magazine's list of 400
richest Americans live in the two states.
   Those who make it big in either place _ from Ronald Reagan and
tax rebel Howard Jarvis to Mario Cuomo and real estate mogul Donald
Trump _ usually end up as familiar figures in the rest of the
United States.
   In economic terms, California is riding the crest of a boom as
America's gateway to the thriving Pacific Rim. New York, which grew
to dominance as America's chief port-of-entry from Europe, is
enjoying an upswing itself.
   But the Empire State is also struggling to phase out its
decaying manufacturing industries and replace them with the kind of
high-technology and defense-oriented companies that have become a
mainstay of California's economy.
   While New York's metropolitan area is still the largest in the
country with 18 million inhabitants (including many in New Jersey
and Connecticut suburbs), metropolitan Los Angeles' estimated
population in 1986 was 13.1 million and growing so fast it could
have more people than New York by early next century.
   The ports of Los Angeles and San Diego have already surpassed
the Port of New York and New Jersey in cargo volume.
   ``We're No. 1 in everything from peaches to Ph.D.s,'' said
California Gov. George Deukmejian. ``California is home to more
engineers, more scientists and more Nobel laureates than any state
in America.''
   Cuomo reacts defensively, noting that California's governor is
himself a New York native.
   ``If you compare us to California, we do better everywhere,''
said New York's governor. ``They say they have more computer chip
companies. Who cares? I mean, so what? You took one category,
computer chips. ... We have more bowling ball manufacturers.''
   Rivalries aside, if they were independent countries, California
would have the sixth richest economy in the world and New York
would be about two places back.
   New York's Wall Street continues to be the financial nerve
center of the globe.
   California's television and movie industries have long showed
Americans how to walk and talk, what to wear and even how to hold
their cigarettes. New York's Madison Avenue advertising firms have
told Americans what to buy, and where, and sometimes why.
   New York and California project styles so distinct that many
Americans are repelled without ever visiting either place. Are the
stereotypes of laid-back Californians and gruff New Yorkers really
true?
   On a recent sunny day in West Hollywood, a friend of Jane Thorne
told the transplanted New Yorker he was going whale-watching. ``I
said, `What?''' Thorne recalled, finding it hard to believe that
someone would go to sea simply to eyeball a whale.
   And Janet Lowry still thinks about her first visit to a pizza
parlor after moving to New York from her native Los Angeles a few
years ago.
   ``Whaddya want?'' snarled the counterman.
   ``I'm thinking,'' replied Ms. Lowry.
   ``Next!'' the counterman yelled.
   Political consultant David Garth has handled campaigns on both
coasts and saw a clear difference in approach _ but keep in mind
he's from New York.
   ``In New York when they stab you, they stab you in the
stomach,'' he said. ``In California when they stab you, they stab
you in the back. They rub your back first and then they put a knife
in it. They're all nice.''
   California's political system produced President Reagan and
before him Richard Nixon; New York's produced Theodore and Franklin
Roosevelt, among other presidents.
   And yet the two states' political systems could hardly be more
different.
   In California, voters have directly enacted laws creating new
regulatory agencies and have used the state's unusual voter
confirmation process to oust their chief justice and change the
direction of their highest court. California's Proposition 13,
pushed by Jarvis in 1978, cut local property taxes in half, chopped
$7 billion a year out of the local government tax base, and set off
a national tax revolt movement.
   In New York, where there is no initiative process, only the 211
state legislators vote on such issues.
   Misconceptions about the two states abound.
   Electronics and tourism, not entertainment, are California's
biggest industries. Farming remains a key component of the economy.
   Despite being the nation's most populous state with more than 28
million people, California still has stretches that remain sparsely
settled. When fires swept over nearly 1,200 square miles of
California's mountains last year, an area larger than Rhode Island,
only 31 homes were destroyed.
   And for all of New York's urban image, the state is home to the
6 million-acre Adirondack Park, the largest wilderness area east of
the Mississippi. Three million of the state's nearly 18 million
inhabitants live in ``rural'' areas. New York's Department of
Economic Development classifies agriculture as the state's No. 1
industry.
   ``They have strengths we don't have,'' Cuomo said of
Californians. ``They have a defense industry we don't have. We have
the financial industry.
   ``We're both very strong states.''

<HEAD>CNN Anchor Surprised to Find Herself a Polish Star</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every night about midway through
``Panorama of the Day,'' one of Poland's most popular news
programs, a pert, blond American pops up on the screen and says, in
English, ``This is Headline News, I'm Bobbie Battista.''
   That one line has been enough to make the CNN anchor the
best-known American television personality in Poland, as she
learned as the official guest of Polish television recently.
   In Krakow, children clamored to find out the name of her
favorite rock star. In Czestochowa, monks lined up for her
autograph. And everywhere, her Polish fans wanted to know much
money an American anchor makes.
   Her celebrity status has both pleased and baffled the seven-year
CNN veteran. ``The viewers don't even see me that much every night
_ like for two minutes and I barely say anything,'' Battista said.
   Rarely, it seems, has the global network gotten so much for so
little.
   ``We're on in 60 countries at this point and we get letters from
all over the place, but nowhere has the impact been greater than in
Poland. ... I think it just goes with their fascination with
anything Western,'' she said.
   This April, CNN signed a deal with Poland under which its
broadcasts will be carried regularly on state-run television. Poles
privileged enough to own satellite dishes have been able to pick up
CNN in English for several years.
   Under the agreement, Polish television can use CNN's
international feed for domestic broadcast. The six-hour time
difference makes Battista's midday anchor shift in Atlanta an ideal
pickup for Panorama, which airs nightly at 9:30 p.m. in Warsaw.
   Each day, ``Panorama'' uses one CNN Headline News report, which
it intersperses with a similar report from the Soviet evening news
program, ``Vremya,'' in addition to clips from Polish TV.
   ``Above all, `Panorama' is able to present different points of
view of what is going on in the world. Even if the subjects are the
same, there is a different point of view,'' said Jozef Wegrzy, the
director of Polish television's second channel, which produces
``Panorama.''
   The international angle and the program's fast-paced formula
have earned it an average of 12 million viewers a night since it
went on the air just over a year ago.
   Polish TV tapes and translates the CNN report daily and has the
right to edit it. While still in Atlanta, Battista received a
couple of tapes of the program which the Poles had retranslated in
English and sent back to her.
   ``I was suprised a couple of times because I kind of looked at
the screen and thought, `That's not what I said.' So that's of some
concern. But for the most part, they're being pretty
straightforward with it,'' she said.
   On a recent visit, Battista the journalist became Battista the
CNN diplomat. She taped a talk show with Daniel Passent, editor of
the weekly Polityka and the show ``Closer to Your World,'' a
round-table discussion program that includes foreign journalists.
   It was a new role for a woman used to asking the questions, and
one that precluded her from making a pilgrimage to Gdansk to
interview Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, one person most first-time
journalists to Poland try to see.
   Despite her success as a television personality, Battista
appeared eager to get back on the other side of the camera.
   No doubt her Polish fans were eager as well. While she has been
visiting, ``Panorama'' was obliged to air its CNN segments without
her.

   FINALLY! MUGS GO NATIONWIDE _ NBC, which operates a popular and
lucrative souvenir store in Rockefeller Center in New York, is
planning to retail such memorabilia as ``Late Night'' T-shirts and
``Today'' show coffee mugs nationwide through its newly established
marketing branch, Peacock Enterprises. NBC began testing the idea
in April with an NBC store at Union Station in Indianapolis. NBC
also plans to make movable kiosks available to affiliates for
promotional use in places like shopping malls. ...
   NBC NEWS NUGGETS _ NBC is launching a service for daytime
viewers _ 30-second on-the-hour headlines from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
EDT. NBC News President Lawrence K. Grossman promised affiliates
meeting in Hawaii that the news nuggets, to begin in August, will

   If the economic news scares you, accompanied as
it usually is with ominous commentary from the ``experts,'' you
might consider the undistinquished record of worry over recent
months.
   You can pick your time period, but this one begins last October,
when those who claim to know told you the stock market crash would
scare business and consumers into retrenchment.
   Neither retrenched, they barely flinched. Business actually
added more to its spending plans for better production facilities.
Consumer spending slowed, but not by much. Whatever, it was
destined to slow anyway.
   Meanwhile, the stock market has recovered about $400 million of
the trillion dollars lost in the crash.
   The anticipated recession didn't come. Those who claim to know
still say it is coming. Someday they'll be correct, of course,
because recessions eventually come. But the ``imminent''
descriptive is out. Wait 'til next year.
   The market crash, the recession to come and inflation and the
big budget and trade deficits and all those other bad things would
cause the dollar to free-fall and cause foreign investors to flee,
the experts warned. It didn't happen.
   Neither did the budget deficit continue to grow to the heavens.
It slowed, and now it appears the deficit next year might decline
to 2.9 percent of gross national product, down from 3.3 percent
this year.
   The trade balance didn't continue to worsen; it improved. The
savings rate didn't continue to decline; it has risen since last
fall. The consumer debt position hasn't continued to rise in a
straight line; the rate of growth has turned down.
   You may recall that the level of factory utilization was rising
into very dangerous territory, according to some warnings, because
with little idle capacity available there would be production
snafus and higher prices. ``Dangerous territory'' became a summer
meadow.
   Rising employment would mean fewer workers available to operate
the nation's factories. That, said the people who know, would mean
upward pressure on wages. But recent wage agreements have been
below the inflation rate.
   Lots of the old problems are still there, and most likely they
will remain a threat for a long time to come. And there is a big
new one _ the drought, which is likely to force up prices of some
commodities.
   But now the popular economic analysis is one that shows
differences instead of similarities between the crash of 1987 and
the stock market debacle of 1929 that ushered in the Great
Depression of the 1930s.
   A typical one: Commodity prices plunged after the 1929 crash but
rose after the 1987 crash. Industrial production fell steeply in
1929 but rose in 1987. Employment fell in 1929 but rose in 1987.
Business spending fell in 1929 but rose in 1987. Federal Reserve
policy tightened in 1929 but became looser in 1987.
   The people who claim to know are quieter now. They are less
inclined to extrapolate into infinity the latest negative change in
prices or interest rates. Besides, they have fewer listeners.
   Given time, there will be new things to worry about because that
is the way it has always been. Oddly, a period of good economic
news is a fertile field for the growing of fears.
   But now we know that some of the fears are fiction, and that _
given the great volume of them that are presented to us by the
folks who claim to know _ relatively few of them come to pass.

<HEAD>Algerians Plan to Revive the Casbah</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEJLA SAMMAKIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many old houses in the Casbah are in
danger of collapse and authorities are moving people out of them
under a plan to turn the famed district into a luxury neighborhood.
   People whose houses are condemned are being moved to the
low-income apartment blocks on the outskirts of the city.
   The massive urban-renewal project may ultimately cost hundreds
of millions of dollars. The goal is to convert the Casbah into a
luxurious haven that few present inhabitants will be able to afford.
   While some residents are happy to get out, others say they would
prefer to stay with the Casbah, squalor and all, as it is.
   Every house in the steeply sloping district has a roof terrace
with a clear view of the Mediterranean. People who want to stay say
they prefer the vermin, the sagging floors and the virtually
non-existent plumbing to a modern but featureless housing
development with no view beyond the next building.
   The Casbah still has a friendly, intimate atmosphere unknown in
the new developments.
   Low-income residents do not qualify for the outside housing
until their homes are condemned or collapse. Thousands are
squatters who live as many as 10 to a room, sharing one communal
washroom on each floor. Yet many inhabitants own color television
sets, refrigerators and ovens.
   ``I think we must improve the social conditions here,'' said an
official of the rebuilding project, who under government rules can
only speak on condition that he remain anonymous.
   ``To really preserve the place, there must be a higher level of
wealth. If we keep the same type of people, we will get the same
problems in 20 years.''
   Most houses in the Casbah date back to the 16th-century Turkish
pirate-conqueror Barbarossa. The French added a few buildings in
the 19th century, but kept the narrow alleys intact. During the
Algerian war for independence against the French, the Casbah was
the scene of the Battle of Algiers when French paratroopers routed
the concealed nationalist insurgents in months of bloody
house-to-house fighting.
   The yellowed, peeling facades contrast sharply with the
sparkling coastline below. Children jump over puddles of leaking
drainage water in alleys teeming with half-starved cats. Garbage is
occasionally carried off in hampers strapped to the backs of mules.
   Workmen in dark workshops fashion leather soles for shoes or saw
wood. Women wearing veils of white lace carry their meager
groceries into homes that still have long, vertical slits in the
walls. The slits once gave harem women their only view of outside
life.
   Some of the collapsed or demolished houses have given way to
paved, empty lots now used by children to kick soccer balls around.
   ``The state is beginning to realize that people live in terrible
conditions here and that the area is a national heritage,'' the
project official said.
   He admitted the project is moving slowly bcause money is tight.
Around 15,000 people have been moved out since 1985, he said, and
the planners want to remove at least 10,000 more of the
approximately 60,000 remaining residents.
   Detailed plans for the reconstruction have not been published
and no overall budget has been allocated for a project, which could
take decades to complete.
   Authorities have no systematic program for the future occupation
of renovated houses, the official said, but the Casbah's old
occupants, relocated in new houses in Algiers' outskirts, are not
likely to return.
   Government-controlled rents on renovated buildings are about 40
times higher than on the old homes.
   Dr. Fadila Bastandji, a physician, recently set up a clinic in
one of a handful of fully restored houses. In an interview, she
said she constantly has to keep out tourists who think the
building, rented from the government, is open to the public because
of its authentic structural design.
   Under rules set by the government, reconstruction must follow
the style and outline of the old buildings. Modern materials,
particularly concrete, are banned.
   Art historian Ben Dabbagh inherited a French-built 19th-century
Casbah house from his grandparents.
   ``People have different values nowadays,'' he said. ``They have
less pride and dignity than they used to have. It's only by
evacuating the Casbah that it will live _ unless the dead return.''

   The French have croissants, the
English their kidney pie and Italians their ice cream. Argentines
have their alfajors.
   Alfajors simply are cookie sandwiches, usally filled with a
caramel-like spread called dulce de leche and covered with white or
dark chocolate.
   They're equally popular with grownups and children.
   ``Delicious, veI never get tired of
them,'' Trassens said, fingering an inch-thick alfajor.
   Alfajors remain almost exclusively Argentine because of the
popularity of dulce de leche, a widely used substance that is made
by boiling down milk and adding sugar. Dulce de leche is used on
everything from ice cream to pancakes, toast, cakes and pies.
   ``Nobody in the world consumes dulce de leche like the
Argentines,'' said Abel Ayala, deputy director of the business,
industry and production union.
   Trassens first began making his alfajors by using his
great-grandfather's cookie recipe and dulce de leche in 1946 at his
cafe in Azul, a farm community not far from Mar del Plata. Two
years later, he moved to Mar del Plata.
   Now the nation's sixth largest city with 475,000 residents, Mar
del Plata makes alfajors for everyone, except for those who buy
them from a small factory in nearby Uruguay. Much of Mar del
Plata's alfajors are bought by the 2 million or so vacationers who
come every year for the beaches and casinos.
   Trassens said investors from the United States and Brazil have
tried to woo him to begin production in their countries of his
brand of alfajors, which sell for about 20 cents each _ less by the
dozen.
   Trassens said he is considering expansion, noting in particular
the rising numbers of Hispanics in the United States who might have
heard of the alfajor. But he added special problems might arise
with the dulce de leche, which goes dry in about three weeks.
   Virtually all alfajors are eaten within two weeks or so in
Argentina and they contain no preservatives, which Trassens said
would be required to manufacture them in the United States.
   Packaging _ most are sold in aluminum wrappers _ would have to
change too, he said.
   In Argentina, industry statistics indicate that about 300
businesses make alfajors, from round-the-corner sweetshops to
Havanna, which began four decades ago when a Greek cafe owner _
``who probably couldn't spell Cuba's capital,'' Morales said in
reference to the company's name _ offered them to customers.
   Outside Mar del Plata, Terrabusi and Bagley of Buenos Aires are
major sellers of alfajors, while smaller, drier-style fruit
alfajors are made in large quantities in the interior cities of
Cordoba and Santa Fe.
   Others use variations that contain mint, marmalade, coconut, rum
or nuts.

<HEAD>Episcopalians Grappling With Sexuality And Declining Membership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Episcopal Church is struggling through a
quagmire of controversy over sex, while also straining to reverse a
gradual decline in membership.
   Efforts to increase adherents through greater evangelism had
wide support as the the denomination this Saturday begins its
triennial governing convention in Detroit.
   But conflict over sexuality was rippling through the
2.7-million-member denomination on several fronts _ regarding
inclusive liturgical language, abortion and sexual relationships.
   At the center of the controversy is a report on sexual morality
from the church's commission on human affairs and health, directed
three years ago to examine the issue.
   Also firing up the conflict has been a 110-page study guide,
``Sexuality: A Divine Gift,'' issued by a church headquarters unit.
Several bishops have charged it ignores church standards of
celibacy in singleness and sex only in marriage.
   Further exacerbating the issue was action early this year by the
Newark, N. J., diocese encouraging ministry to those ``living out
alternate patterns of sexuality.''
   This was interpreted as condoning clergy blessings of committed
homosexual unions.
   However, the church-wide study commission, headed by Bishop
George N. Hunt of Rhode Island, makes no such recommendations, but
expresses differences over the morality of some sexual unions apart
from marriage.
   It affirms that ``life-long, monogamous marriage is the normal
or ideal context for intimate sexual expression between
Christians'' and says extra-marital sex is immoral because it
violates the marital bond.
   However, the report adds that some pre-marital and post-marital
``sexual relationships intend to mirror, at a significant level,
the faithfulness of marriage.
   ``Some of them surely have the potential to be life-giving and
not life-draining. However, a widespread and increasing number of
these relationships appear to us to witness more to promiscuity
than to fidelity...''
   Consequently, such relationships should not be affirmed by the
church as acceptable, the commission says, although it could not
agree on whether some sex relations apart from marriage are moral.
   The commission, which heard testimony at seven meetings during
the past triennium, says the ``debate is perhaps even more
important than the conclusions. The moral standards of our society
are in flux.
   ``Old standards may yet prevail in the future. New standards may
well be the traditional standards adapted and redefined to meet new
circumstances...One thing of which we are certain is that
yesterday's standards are being challenged profoundly in this
generation.''
   The ``conventional moral stance of the church proclaiming
faithful marriage or celibacy as the only moral options open to a
Christian has been weakened considerably in the practice of our
people,'' the report says.
   It says ``the majority of our church is committed to an attempt
to call society to traditional sexual standards,'' but ``a
significant minority...is convinced the time has come to begin a
process that will enable Christians to think through new moral and
sexual options in the light of new realities.''
   Citing the AIDS epidemic, the report says ``society is painfully
learning that sexual activity is not an individual matter. One has
sex, with life and death consequences, with everyone who has slept
with one's sexual partner...
   ``We are once more realizing that sexual activity has both
private and coporate significance.''
   The report recommends stiffening the church's stand on abortion,
condemning it ``as a means of birth control, family planning, sex
selection, or for any reason of mere convenience.''
   Abortion ``always has a tragic dimension,'' the report says,
deploring the numbers of abortions, but saying legislation should
not prohibit all abortions but should protect individual conscience
about it.
   In regard to the church's loss of about 500,000 members in the
last 25 years, a report by a commission on evangelism and renewal
says:
   ``It is obvious to us that if nothing is done to remedy this
situation, the Episcopal Church is in very real danger of becoming
an exotic fossil.''
   Quoting the church's presiding bishop, Edmond L. Browning, the
report says: ```The time has come for active evangelism. We
Episcopalians are often accused of talking to much of our heritage
and too little of God and God's work among us.'''
   A blurred ``theological vision'' has sapped the church of
evangelistic drive, the report says, adding:
   ``Much of the contemporary theology of our church has espoused
philosophical skepticism, which is opposed to certainty, commitment
and conversion. A historical God may be affirmed, but not an
empowering God who leads to life-changing renewal...
   ``We have become a trendy people, `tossed to an fro and carried
about with every wind of doctrine.''...The result is a witness
shorn of power.''
   The report cites this attitude: ``Evangelize? We Episcopalians
don't do that.''
   But the report says they've got to get at it, and recommends
actions rallying all members to work at sharing their faith with
others and urging congregations to be centers for extending the
gospel.

   A commission of the Seventh-day Adventist
Church wants more time to study whether to allow ordination of
women as full ``ministers of the Gospel.''
   Neal Wilson, denominational president, told the 80-member
commission that ``fairness requires that this issue be given
priority treatment, and it must not go on forever.''
   The denonations's annual council is to consider the issue in
late 1989, with recommendations about it to go to a 1990 general

   Proliferating Holocaust memorials about the Nazi

guise of memorializing it,'' says Dennis B. Klein.
   Klein, director of the International Center for Holocaust
Studies of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, says ``any
reconstruction of the past mediates if not erases history'' because
``memory is selective.''
   The Holocaust particuarly ``lends itself to historical
revision'' because it is so repellent, he says. He says all the
memorials being constructed to it ``often serve as evasions of the

   If Disney can build fantasy parks
glorifying a make-believe mouse, Melvin Wilcox says Christians
should be able to re-create Jerusalem in West Texas to tell the
good news of Jesus Christ.
   Wilcox of West Palm Beach, Fla., has formed ``Jerusalem 30 A.D.
International Ministries,'' and wants to raise $2.5 billion to
build the project on 25,000 acres of arid land 60 miles south of
Midland.
   He says the Texas ``holy city'' will be a place of reflection
and learning, will employ 10,000 people, allow no cars and that
employes and visitors will wear biblical-era garb.
   He says it will feature a seminary, museums, art galleries, a
Roman theater, a sports arena with chariot racing, marketplaces,
palaces and medical facilities.
   Midland Mayor Carroll Thomas has some doubts about the plan,
saying, ``I don't think it's economically viable at all or
realistic. It's got some romance to it and I think people are
latching on to that.''
   Wilcox says skeptics will prove wrong. ``As for doubting
Thomases, they laughed at Walt Disney when he came up with Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs.''

   Henry Kissinger was shocked. George Bush had
been a loyal soldier as chairman of the Republican National
Committee in the aftermath of Watergate, and now in late 1974
President Ford was offering a choice of glittering rewards: London
or Paris.
   No thanks, Bush said. How about the ambassadorship to China?
   ``When Henry heard I'd turned down the ambassador's posts in
London and Paris in order to go to Beijing, he was baffled,'' Bush
wrote in his memoirs. ``There'll be some substantive work from time
to time,'' Bush remembered Kissinger as saying, ``but for the most
part you'll be bored beyond belief.''
   Kissinger may have been right. According to Bush and several
people who worked with him those 13 months, the U.S. Liaison
Mission in Beijing was set up in the early 1970s to exist, not to
do anything in particular.
   Kissinger himself handled the tricky diplomacy. There were few
bilateral cultural, military or economic ties and there wasn't much
of a social whirl _ not at a time when Chinese leaders were still
wary of the West. Bush's predecessor, David Bruce, rarely left the
U.S. compound.
   Boring or not, the time Bush spent in Beijing and as U.S.
representative to the United Nations from 1971 to 1973 gave him
something rare on a presidential resume: service as an ambassador.
Only former President William Howard Taft came close with service
as governor general of the Philippines.
   Bush, now set to become the Republican presidential nominee,
became a member of the diplomatic set in 1970 after he lost a
Senate race in Texas to Democrat Lloyd Bentsen. The consolation
prize was an appointment to the United Nations by President Nixon,
who took a lot of heat for putting a diplomatic rookie like Bush in
the prestigious post.
   The major controversy during Bush's tenure was the fight over
Chinese membership in the world body.
   Kissinger and Nixon, eager to foster good relations with China
without appearing to abandon longstanding allies in Taiwan, favored
``dual representation'' that would permit both Chinas to stay.
   Bush lobbied for dual representation, but on Oct. 25, 1971, the
proposal was defeated by the U.N. General Assembly and Taiwan was
expelled.
   Bush said later that when he left the United Nations in January
1973 to head the Republican National Committee he was more critical
of the world body than he had been before, having seen its ``flaws
and limitations first hand.''
   In September 1974, Bush, his wife Barbara, and their newly
acquired cocker spaniel, C. Fred Bush, headed for Beijing where
they spent the next year and a month living in a walled compound
guarded by green-uniformed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.
   ``The PLA guards were really there to keep an eye on us and to
make sure no Chinese people could get in to talk to us,'' a member
of Bush's Beijing staff said in a recent interview. The diplomat,
who still works in the U.S. government, spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``I remember one time a U.S. ambassador to another country came
to visit and the guards wouldn't let the ambassador's wife into the
compound because she was Asian _ they wouldn't believe she wasn't a
Chinese citizen,'' the diplomat said.
   ``Bush found out about it and went crazy. He called up the
foreign ministry and demanded an apology. I think if he had an
AK-47 he would have gone down there and shot up the ministry. It
was the only time I saw him lose his temper.''
   According to the diplomat and others who worked on Bush's staff,
including John Holdridge, the deputy chief of mission, there was
little contact between American diplomats in Beijng and the Chinese
government.
   For one thing, it was not until the Carter administration that
full diplomatic relations were exchanged. And in the waning days of
Mao Tse-tung, Chinese officials cautious about the succession were
not eager to stick their necks out and become friendly with any
Western diplomats, much less Americans.
   ``We were very much isolated,'' said Holdridge, who later became
ambassador to Indonesia. ``We tried to keep busy, to make contacts
and to carry on diplomacy, but there was very little interraction
with the Chinese.''
   ``It was tough duty,'' said Peter Bergin, a member of the
mission staff. ``There really wasn't very much to do.''
   By all accounts, Bush spent much of the time improving his
already-good tennis skills. He played on courts at Beijing's
International Club with other diplomats and a ``club pro'' provided
by the Chinese government.
   The envoy and his wife also spent hours cycling through the
dusty and windy streets of Beijing, drawing stares from Chinese
citizens unaccustomed to Westerners. The sight of Bush's dog was
also a novelty in a country where canine was as common on a menu as
on a leash.
   ``Bush used the time very wisely, in a political sense.'' the
diplomat who spoke privately said. ``In those days, it was nearly
impossible to get a visa to visit China, but you could get around
it by getting an invitation from the head of the liaison office.
   ``Bush used it like a political plum and there was a steady
stream of important visitors from the States. It was his way of
keeping his hand in U.S. politics.''
   Bush wrote that one of the highlights of his tour was a meeting
with Mao, who lived in seclusion and died the next year.
   ``I am going to heaven soon,'' Bush quoted Mao as saying. ``I
have already received an invitation from God.''
   Bush soon got an invitation too. Ford asked him to run the
Central Intelligence Agency and his diplomatic career was over.

<HEAD>For Release Tue AMs, Jay. Some tours are</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   available at plants in nearby Flint, Pontiac and Ypsilanti.
   That is a letdown for visitors to the automotive capital of
North America.
   ``I think they're surprised and somewhat disappointed,'' said
Mary Ellen McCormick, program planner for Detroit Upbeat, a company
offering tours of the area. ``So we attempt to show as much of the
auto influence by showing the auto baron mansions and by driving
past some of the plants.''
   Plant closings in the area have left little for visitors to see.
   Tours at General Motors Corp.'s Fleetwood Cadillac plant were
discontinued before it closed in December and tours at GM's Fiero
plant in Pontiac will end soon because that facility is scheduled
to close this year.
   One of the area's most popular auto plant tours used to be Ford
Motor Co.'s massive Dearborn Rouge complex. The tours were the idea
of company founder Henry Ford. There, visitors could see raw
materials entering one end of the plant and the finished product
driven out the other.
   ``You could see the ore boats pull up and the steel being made
and then go to the assembly plant and see it put together,'' said
Tom Kish, Ford special projects administrator.
   Rouge tours were discontinued in the early 1980s, but that
hasn't ended requests for a look-see at the facility, which now
produces the Mustang.
   ``I get people who call and say, `I toured your Rouge plant
years ago and it was wonderful. Now I want to show my
grandchildren,''' Ford spokeswoman Judith Muhlberg said.
   Ford is considering resuming tours at Rouge and at assembly
plants near Detroit in Wayne and Wixom, Ford spokesman Jim Maxwell
said.
   Most Detroit visitors looking for an auto plant tour are
directed to GM's Buick City plant in Flint, said Colleen Robar, of
the Metropolitan Detroit Convention & Visitors Bureau.
   There visitors can see the Buick LaSabre assembled during a
90-minute walking tour that includes stops at the stamping area,
trim shop, body shop and final assembly area.
   About 50,000 people a year tour the plant, said Marcia McGee, of
GM's Flint Automotive Division.
   Outside Detroit, General Motors maintains an aggressive tour
program. About six months ago, 30,000 people toured the Linden,
N.J., plant in two days after a $300 million, one-year
modernization was completed.
   Family members of plant employees, neighbors of the facility and
auto dealers were invited to visit the plant, which had been
converted to build the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta, said Mark
Leddy, spokesman for GM's Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada group.
   He said all of the 26 plants in the C-P-C group offer some form
of public tours.
   Chrysler plant tours were a victim of spending cutbacks in the
late 1970s and early 1980s, Chrysler spokesman Douglas E. Nicoll
said.
   The No. 3 automaker still arranges tours for automotive-related
groups, including representatives from competing car companies.
Occasional groups of students from abroad also visit Chrysler
plants, he said.
   No tour policy has been established at the Detroit area's only
Japanese auto plant, owned by Mazda Motor Corp. Some community
groups have toured the plant, which opened in September in Flat
Rock, south of Detroit, company spokesman Jim Gill said.
   Those who help organize tours say they polish a company's image
and boost employee morale in plants hosting visitors. Ford and GM
use volunteers from the factory floor to conduct many tours.
   ``There's a great deal of pride in opening up your plant,''
Ford's Muhlberg said.

<HEAD>The World of Suzie Wong Vanishing from Hong Kong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAM HVAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soaring land prices and commercial developers
have transformed Hong Kong's notorious ``Suzie Wong'' red-light
district into a complex of office buildings, international hotels
and cultural centers.
   In a few years, developers predict, many of the honky-tonks in
the Wanchai waterfront area will be memories, driven away by
dwindling business, higher rentals and the popularity of classier
nightspots elsewhere in this British colony.
   The transformation of Wanchai from aging low-rise buildings to
commercial and residential skyscrapers _ and new respectability _
began slowly a decade ago. The pace has quickened and today there's
a construction project on almost every block.
   ``Many companies are moving to Hong Kong to establish a base for
their China and regional markets and they need offices,'' explained
Richard Cheung, associate director of Jones Lang Wootton, a real
estate agent and property consultant. ``The traditional Central
business district is full and it is natural to move east toward
Wanchai.''
   Wanchai was a popular hangout for sailors in the 1940s, but its
dingy, dark and small girlie bars became internationally famous 10
years later when author Richard Mason chronicled the life of a
gentle-hearted prostitute in his bestseller, ``The World of Suzie
Wong.''
   The book was made into a movie starring William Holden and the
Hong Kong actress Nancy Kwan.
   Suzie Wong and Wanchai became synonymous.
   During the Vietnam war, action in Wanchai peaked. Thousands of
U.S. servicemen on rest and recreational leaves spent freely on
women, liquor and temporary solace in the numerous bars crowding
the district.
   With the end of the conflict in 1975, Hong Kong lost its role as
a regular leave center for the servicemen. Business suffered and
many of the girlie bars and hostess clubs closed.
   Despite Wanchai's fading reputation as a raunchy and exotic vice
den, the district remains an attraction. Tour buses still bring
curious foreigners eager for a glimpse of Suzie Wong's world where
bars are staffed by topless hostesses or waitresses in mini-skirts,
shorts or the Chinese cheongsam side-split dress.
   The U.S. Navy also visits occasionally, but veteran hostesses
say the new generation of servicemen spends less on the girls and
more on shopping and sightseeing.
   Suzie Cheung, the mama-san at the Suzie Wong Bar _ ``We just use
her name'' _ said the bars now depend more on the locals and
tourists.
   In June a convoy of 11 U.S. Navy ships led by the aircraft
carrier Enterprise spent five days in Hong Kong. U.S. Consulate
officials said its 9,000 personnel converted about $500,000 into
Hong Kong dollars, but only a fraction of that was spent in Wanchai.
   ``During the (Vietnam) war, business was much better,'' said
Selina Chin, wife of the owner of the San Francisco Cafe and Bar.
``Fifteen years ago we had about 40 girls. Now there are seven who
dance and 10 who sit at the bar.''
   The club, in the middle of the red-light district, is open from
7 p.m. to 3 a.m. Starting at 8 p.m., dancers in cutaway leotards
perform on a small stage in the center of the circular bar.
   ``We used to have them dance topless, but nobody likes that
anymore,'' said Mrs. Chin.
   Lily, who declined to give her full name, has been a bar girl
for nearly 20 years and she recalls the big spenders, big ships and
big days and nights of the Vietnam years.
   ``There was the Midway, the Constellation, the Coral Sea, the
Kitty Hawk, and they came twice a year,'' she said. ``Many sailors
... big business.''
   With Wanchai's metamorphosis, the price of land has soared. A
prime site, measuring 12,000 square feet, that sold for the
equivalent of about $8.3 million in 1986 went for $31.1 million a
year later, said Cheung of Jones Lang Wootton.
   But this has not deterred the area's development. Last year, the
U.S. chain Ramada Inn opened a 21-story hotel in the red-light
district, near The Academy for the Performing Arts. The hotel cost
$47.4 million and has an open-air theater.
   Two other hotels belonging to U.S. chains _ the 573-room Grand
Hyatt and the 609-room Marriott _ are under construction, as is a
$28.8 million convention and exhibition center that developers say
will be one of the best in the world for meetings and exhibitions.
   Alice Fok, director of sales for Ramada Inn Hong Kong, said the
U.S. chain decided to locate in Wanchai because the district is
convenient for ``business-class, budget-minded travellers.''
   She added: ``The bars actually complement the hotel and add a
certain color.''

   The 12,000 residents of Port Angeles
fretted that the Olympic Peninsula's persistent rain would dampen
Franklin D. Roosevelt's visit, to see for himself the craggy
mountains and ancient forest proposed for America's newest national
park.
   They needn't have worried, for as the president told them that
September day in 1937, the park was needed for the old and young
then but also ``for a whole lot of young people who are going to
come along in the next hundred years.''
   On June 29, 1938, FDR signed a bill setting aside 634,000 acres
to be preserved as Olympic National Park.
   Today, the park is 922,000 acres of glacier-capped mountains,
alpine meadows, temperate rain forest and ocean coastline. The
nation's third-most-visited national park, with more than 3 million
visitors a year, Olympic also remains one of the wildest and has
won distinction from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization as an international biosphere reserve and
World Heritage Site.
   Park officials are gearing up for a series of 50th anniversary
events this summer but are also focusing on resource-management
issues ranging from pesky mountain goats and vanishing salmon runs
to animals of the two-legged variety _ the burgeoning population of
human visitors.
   ``The one (issue) we're going to have to address in the long
haul ... is human impact, particularly in the backcountry, but also
in the frontcountry,'' said assistant park superintendent Don
Jackson.
   The park's crown, 7,965-foot Mount Olympus, was named in 1788 by
John Meares, an English voyager who thought it an appropriate home
for the gods, like Greece's Mount Olympus.
   While the presence of gods has not been established by
researchers, the park does boast some rare natural creations:
   _ Twelve feet of rain a year bathe the Western Hemisphere's
largest expanse of temperate rain forest, composed heavily of giant
Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, hemlock and western red cedar.
   _ The Olympic Mountains, drained by 14 major rivers, are home to
more than 60 glaciers, and in the alpine meadows just below the
peaks grow numerous wildflowers, including some unique to the park.
   _ The world's largest herd of Roosevelt elk, estimated at 5,000
head, lives within the park, along with such other scarce species
as the bald eagle and peregrine falcon.
   Lt. Joseph O'Neil, leader of an 1890 expedition to explore the
Olympics, concluded that ``the interior is useless for all
practical purposes,'' although the heavily forested outer slopes
were valuable, an assessment that loggers then and now would agree
with.
   Today, ``there are some people _ a few _ that would just as soon
see parts of the park dismantled for timber interests or
whatever,'' Jackson acknowledged.
   Standing watch and arguing in favor of preservation are such
groups as the Sierra Club and the Olympic Park Associates.
   Associates president Polly Dyer describes group members as
``park supporters as long as the park (management) is not doing
things that we think are contrary to protecting the park.''
   The Associates think they can take some credit for having Shi
Shi Beach and intertidal zones added to the park's coastal strip,
for discontinuing Olympic Hot Springs as a resort and, more
recently, for reducing the size of right-of-way that was cleared in
building a new road to Sol Duc hot springs, she said.
   Charlie Raines of the Sierra Club said the hot springs project,
in which the road was straightened and improved, was an example of
the national parks' ``perhaps overzealous road construction program
... where under the guise of safety and visitor convenience we end
up cutting down giant old-growth trees.''
   ``Why not let people know that this is an old wagon road ... and
you're only going to be going 25 miles an hour and driving around
trees, not through them?'' he asked.
   The watchdog groups and the park don't see eye-to-eye, either,
on what to do about non-native mountain goats. Introduced to the
Olympics 60 years ago, the goats are blamed for damaging the
sensitive high country.
   The Park Service is carrying out a plan to capture 800 to 900 of
the estimated 1,000 goats and relocate them to areas where they are
native, such as the Cascade Range. If, after a few years, the plan
is found not to be working, rangers would move in with guns to kill
the goats.
   Ms. Dyer said she thinks leaving even a few goats is a ``major
mistake,'' since their current population grew from only a dozen
animals to begin with.
   While goats have become pests, Olympic so far has been fairly
successful at dispersing humans, Jackson said.
   Only two spots _ Lake Constance and Flapjack Lakes, both easily
accessible to hikers who have only a weekend to reach the
backcountry _ currently have limits on the number of campers
allowed.
   ``This park is behind the curve, so to speak, in that the volume
of human impact has not begun to overrun the resource,'' Jackson
said.
   Increasing human pressure, however, has caused concern to the
Wilderness Society, which recently listed Olympic among what it
considers the 10 most-threatened national park sites. Concerns
range from the potential for offshore oil drilling to logging
around the park's boundary _ a practice that critics say disrupts
everything from scenic views to the continuity of the ecosystem.
   Meanwhile, others are thinking not only about preserving the
park, but also expanding it. The non-profit National Parks and
Conservation Association has proposed about 180,000 acres be added
to Olympic to further protect important watersheds and habitat.
   But even as such goals are set, the association warns against
complacency in thinking the existing park lands are necessarily
safe, particularly from timber companies that find old-growth
timber becoming ever scarcer.
   ``Rarely a Congress goes by when a senator or congressman
doesn't propose deletions of some parkland somewhere for reasons
for development,'' said Destry Jarvis, vice president of the
association. ``It's not inconceivable in Olympic.''

   The Rev. Ellwood E. Kieser, producer
of the movie ``Romero,'' believes he is telling the tale of a 20th
century hero.
   ``I'm not doing a political tract; I'm not preaching a sermon,''
Kieser said in a recent interview on the set.
   But he clearly sees the story of assassinated Archbishop Oscar
Arnulfo Romero of El Salvador as an audience-grabber with
impressive moral overtones.
   ``I feel he is for the latter part of the 20th century what
Mahatma Gandhi was for the first part,'' Kieser said.
   The movie, starring Raul Julia in the title role and an almost
completely Hispanic cast, may well be the first commercial feature
by a Roman Catholic order. Its budget is in the $2 million range.
   Kieser's company, Paulist Pictures, is associated with the
Paulist Fathers. He produced their television program, ``Insight,''
for 23 years until it was discontinued in 1983.
   Last year, he produced the television movie, ``We Are the
Children,'' starring Ted Danson and Ally Sheedy, about the famine
in Africa.
   ``Our whole thing is to combine entertainment with audience
enrichment,'' he said.
   Although he prefers to be called Bud, greetings of ``Hello,
Father,'' can be heard as he moves about the set. He also has
learned enough Spanish to be able to say Mass for anyone involved
in the production who wants to attend.
   To Kieser, Romero was a mouse transformed into a tiger, a
withdrawn intellectual who gathered courage in response to the
horrors around him until he was silenced by an assassin.
   ``I have the chance to tell the story of Oscar Romero to a
couple of hundred million people,'' the producer said.
   Julia, however, believes the archbishop's courage always was
there.
   ``His change came about as he realized the circumstances _
outside of his world of editing, writing and studying,'' the actor
said in an interview in his trailer.
   Julia groped for the right words to explain Romero's emergence
as a vocal human rights advocate as the situation deteriorated in
El Salvador and emerged in a full-scale war that still persists
between leftist rebels and the U.S.-supported government.
   ``He started seeing that other reality,'' Julia said, costumed
in priestly garb. ``But I think he always was a committed man, a
religious man, an honest man.''
   Julia also insisted that the movie is not a political one but
rather ``a movie about people.''
   Yet the film's script quotes extensively from Romero's homilies
as the violence escalates before the outset of the war in late 1979
and as the rightist death squads that claimed thousands of victims
take their toll.
   Salvadorans jammed the unfinished metropolitan cathedral to hear
Romero conclude his homily each Sunday with his report on the
week's grim events. Loudspeakers were set up outside so the
overflow crowd could hear and, as the movie dramatizes, the sermons
also were broadcast nationally.
   ``When you hear the words of a man telling you to kill, remember
instead the words of God,'' Romero said the day before his
assassination. ``No soldier is obliged to obey an order contrary to
the law of God.
   ``I beseech you, I beg you _ I order you: Stop the repression.''
   A lone gunman killed the archbishop as he said Mass at the
Divine Providence Chapel in San Salvador on March 24, 1980.
Although no one has ever been arrested, it is widely believed to
have been ordered by the death squads.
   ``He was an ordinary person who brought forth his courage,''
said Julia, who has listened to many of the archbishop's sermons
and even his tape-recorded musings.
   John Duigan, making his first movie outside his native
Australia, is directing. The script is by John Sacret Young, who is
involved in the critically praised TV series, ``China Beach.''
   Unlike previous movies about Central America such as ``Under
Fire'' and Oliver Stone's ``Salvador,'' ``Romero'' does not dwell
on an American venturing into the region but instead concentrates
on the native situation.
   ``The story just didn't call for an American,'' Sacret Young
said. ``None of them were major enough. Our choice was, not to
leave them out, but to tell it the way Romero might have thought
about it.''
   He also describes the archbishop in heroic terms.
   ``If you told it as fiction, it would be unbelievable,'' the
writer said. ``Eventually, in that crucible, he changed, so he was
not following events, he was leading events.''

   My, how things have changed. The Chevrolet
Cavalier _ a hum-drum compact first introduced in the 1982 model
year as an import fighter _ has been transformed into a latter-day
muscle car in a new-for-1988 model, the Cavalier Z24.
   Listen to the rumble of the 2.8-liter, fuel-injected V6. Feel
the power as the Goodyear Eagle GT + 4 tires grab the road. Hear
them squeal as the car races ahead.
   Hunker into the comfortable, somewhat sporty seats. And get
ready for a fine ride in a reasonably priced car _ $13,209 out the
door for the test car.
   Chevrolet first tried out the sporty Z24 concept on the Cavalier
two years ago. But it's only in the 1988 model year that the
General Motors Corp. division has started to hit the mark.
   The 1988 Cavalier Z24 Coupe is a nice mix of sport styling _
including air dam on the front and rocker extensions _ and old-time
American car performance. The V6, coupled with a five-speed manual
transmission in the test car, was responsive.
   However, the transmission could feel a bit notchy. It was easy
to drive the car hard, feel the responsiveness, but those quick
starts took a toll on fuel economy.
   The suspension _ firm but still offering a nice ride _ was
commendable.
   Exterior and interior fit and finish was excellent. Seats were
comfortable, though not fitted with all the gadgets, such as
adjustable lumbar support, that are found in some other sporty cars.
   The dashboard was easy to read with traditional gauges, though
an electronic instrument cluster is available. A light came on to
tell the driver when to shift _ slightly annoying until you get
used to it.
   Interior leg room was fine in the front but could be miniscule
in the rear if the front seats were moved all the way back.
   The rear deck lid was a bit heavy, but was designed so that
anyone hoisting items into the trunk would not have to lift them
over the car body _ just ease them over the bumper. Inside, the
trunk was flat and spacious.
   Chevrolet reports that sales of the Z24 have been going well.
The division had a 50-day supply in early May compared with a
70-day supply a year earlier, and a second shift at one of the Z24
plants has been requested in anticipation of additional demand.
   Chevrolet said competitors include the Ford Mustang, which has a
GT versions with eight-cylinder engine and base price of around
$13,000, and the Toyota Celica ST, which starts around $12,000.
   Besides the base-priced $10,725 Cavalier Z24 _ also offered in a
$15,990 convertible _ the Cavalier line includes a two-door value
leader with a base price of $6,995, a sedan at $8,195, a four-door
station wagon at $8,490, and a four-door RS sedan with a base price
of $9,385.
   Typical Cavalier buyers are 25 to 34 years of age with
elementary school-aged children, Chevrolet said, adding that a
growing number of buyers are young couples and singles under 30.
   Most buyers have high school educations, and occupations are
typically blue collar. Household income is in the $25,000 to
$50,000 range, with a high concentration around $35,000, the
division said.
   Top sales for the Cavalier line came in the 1986 model year,
with 388,722 sold. In 1987, sales dipped to 295,316, but the new
Z24 should help the 1988 model year tally.
   Consumer Reports said the 1985 and 1986 Cavalier V6 cars ranked
worse than average and much worse than average, respectively, in
their report from owners about trouble spots.
   Both models suffered from suspension problems, but the 1988 Z24
has a new suspension system. The 1986 Cavalier V6 also was faulted
for engine problems, but the V6 in the Z24 has been redesigned,
Chevrolet spokesman Ed Lechtzin said.

   Socialist Guyana has changed course
dramatically and declared a moratorium on nationalizations while
opening doors to private business and foreign investment.
   ``It's a matter of life or death, a very obvious move that
should have been made years ago,'' Anglican Bishop Randolph George,
an outspoken critic of the government, said in an interview at his
wooden, Victorian residence.
   ``We've come full circle,'' agreed George C. Fung-On, executive
secretary of the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
   President Desmond Hoyte wants the world's investors to know that
Guyana, on South America's northeastern bulge, recognizes it needs
private capital to stimulate what his planners call a ``quantum
leap'' in economic growth.
   Hoyte, victor in government-controlled elections in December,
1985, has dropped much of the nationalist and socialist rhetoric of
President Forbes Burnham, the leader of the People's National
Congress government from 1964 until his death on Aug. 6, 1985.
   Hoyte told Canadian businessmen last year Guyana's
nationalization of private enterprise was ``a chapter in our
history which we now consider closed.'' After that, he told
potential investors in Miami, Fla., ``There is business to be done
in Guyana now and Guyana is willing to do business.''
   He carried the appeal to London this past May.
   Hotels are jammed with Canadian and U.S. miners, Brazilian and
Texas oilmen, Japanese traders and assorted entrepreneurs checking
out the investment opening.
   Already, Canadian gold mining companies and U.S. oil companies
have signed exploration agreements.
   ``There are some indicators of a great deal of foreign
interest,'' said Raymond Ackloo, manager of the National Bank of
Industry and Commerce, which was the Royal Bank of Canada before it
was nationalized.
   But Ackloo, in an interview, predicted ``a considerable lag time
before one sees any real impact'' on the economy.
   Hoyte's speeches acknowledge that Guyana must overcome its
reputation under Burnham as ``a bad investment risk.''
   Guyana is South America's only English-speaking country and as a
former British colony has close ties to the nearby Caribbean
island-nations. Its 780,000 people occupy an 83,000-square-mile
area, about the size of Idaho.
   Hoyte is negotiating an agreement with the United
Nations-affliated International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington
to help Guyana resume payments on its crushing foreign debt and to
free foreign aid suspended because of the arrears.
   The foreign debt exceeds $1.3 billion, or some $2,000 for each
man, woman and child in a country where the minimum wage is the
equivalent of $2.50 a day.
   The IMF suspended aid in 1985, the World Bank in 1986. Others
dropping direct aid include the United States, Britain and the
Caribbean Development Bank. The United States donated $4.4 million
worth of wheat and $3.2 million in soybeans and dairy products in
1987.
   In an interview, Prime Minister Hamilton Green rejected the
notion that Guyana is replacing socialism with private enterprise.
   The 1980 Constitution, which establishes a cooperative republic
``in transition from capitalism to socialism,'' recognizes a
tri-sector economy: public, private and cooperative.
   ``It is our view that at this stage the private sector can play
a more dynamic role,'' Green said.
   He said nationalization had strengthened the public sector.
   ``We have passed that stage. We're marching on, and we make no
apologies for what we did in the past,'' he said.
   The country's foreign exchange reserve is practically depleted,
probably the equivalent of less than $10 million.
   Economic growth is stagnant, although sugar and bauxite, which
bring in more than 80 percent of foreign exchange, are expected to
earn a small profit this year. Bauxite is the source for aluminum.
   Inflation estimates range from 37 to 50 percent. Unemployment
and underemployment are 25 to 35 percent.
   Workers earning the minimum wage 25 Guyana dollars a day ($2.50
at the official exchange rate but only 83 U.S. cents on the black
market), face prices of 10 Guyana dollars a day for transportation,
25 for a pound of chicken, 17.50 for beef, 1.70 for a single egg,
2.50 for a pint of milk, 10 dollars for the gallon measurement of
rice used here and 3.50 for a pound of wheat.
   Fuel supplies are sporadic _ bauxite is traded for petroleum
from neighboring Venezuela _ and housewives wait in line all day
for a can of cookstove kerosene.

   The country is rich in potential exports such as lumber and wood
products, shrimp and precious metals. Diamonds, gold, and even
prawns are smuggled abroad and sold for U.S. dollars that then feed
a thirsty black market.
   Economists believe the black market is what keeps Guyana alive,
accounting for 80 percent of the country's business activity, a
parallel market not reflected by official statistics and a safety
valve that makes consumer goods available to the people.
   One U.S. dollar buys 30 Guyanese dollars on the street.
   Stores and sidewalks are jammed with contraband, everything from
toothpaste to 15-speed, off-road bicycles. This is in sharp
contrast to life under Burnham, whose insistence on self
sufficiency went to the extremes of banning the sale of wheat flour
and bread, to encourage the use of flour made from rice, which is
locally grown.
   The government now looks the other way, even allowing government
stores and the Defense Department to buy smuggled goods.
   The investment opening has not been accompanied by political
reform.
   Bishop George and other government critics say that if free and
open Parliament elections were held today, the now-governing
People's National Congress party would be forced to share power
with a coalition.
   ``There is no democratic opening; there is an opening to
investment ... especially to foreign investment,'' said Eusi
Kwayana, a member of Parliament and founder of the mixed-race,
left-of-center Working People's Alliance.
   Kwayana said the Patriotic Coalition for Democracy, formed after
the 1985 elections by five opposition parties, has unsuccessfully
demanded that the government ``democraticize'' the country. The
coalition declared the 1985 national elections fraudulent and
boycotted municipal elections in 1986.
   Cheddi Jagan, a former prime minister and now minority leader in
Parliament of the Marxist People's Progressive Party, a coalition
member, said in an interview Hoyte's program is making living
conditions worse for the people. He maintained that public protests
would bring repression and ``the death of democracy.''
   ``Burnham died and Hoyte is now moving backwards, back to the
position where he and Burnham put us in 1978, back with the IMF,''
Jagan added in an interview.
   Race plays an important role in determining political party
affiliation. Hoyte's party is supported by urban Afro-Guyanese, 43
percent of the population. Jagan's party base is among the the
mostly rural East Indians, 51 percent of the population.
Indo-Guyanese merchants dominate the country's commercial life.
   Michael McCormack, executive secretary of the Guyana Human
Rights Association, said in an interview Burnham-style political
violence and surveillance of opponents have disappeared.
   ``I can't think in the last couple years of any act of political
violence,'' McCormack said. ``That's a plus under Hoyte.''
   The association advocates free and fair elections.
   The government has tolerated the establishment of a privately
owned, secular newspaper, the Stabroek News, often critical of
Hoyte's administration.
   Prime Minister Green described relations with the United States
as ``good,'' and a recent U.S. embassy report on Guyana reflects
U.S. pleasure with economic developments, but added that ``while
the business climate has been buoyed by the government declarations
... investors are still wary and want others to test the waters
before they jump in themselves.''

   Some facts and figures on Guyana.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The Guianas, a region that today includes Suriname,
French Guiana, Guyana and parts of Brazil and Venezuela, was
sighted by Columbus in 1498, but Guyana was not settled until late
in the next century by the Dutch. The British became the rulers in
1796 and established British Guiana in 1831. Independence was
granted in 1966. Guyana, which means ``Land of Many Waters,''
became a Republic in 1970 and was declared a cooperative republic
``in transition from capitalism to socialism'' by the 1980
constitution.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Guyana is a tropical country on the northeast coast
of South America. Its 83,000-square-miles area is about the same as
Idaho. Guyana is inhabited mostly along the coast. The rest of the
country is tropical savanna and dense rain forest, rich in rivers,
ricelands, wildlife, gold, diamonds, silica sand and semi-precious
stones.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The majority of Guyana's population of 780,000 is
made up of English and Creolese-speaking people. They are highly
literate _ about 94 percent. Most of the people are descendents of
African slaves or indentured servants, mostly from India and a few
from Portugal, after slavery was abolished in 1833.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE GOVERNMENT _ Guyana has a modified parliamentary system,
with legislative power in a unicameral National Assembly. The
president, who is the leader of the majority party, is the chief
executive and appoints a prime minister, who is first vice
president, and a cabinet.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POLITICS _ Politics are based more on ethnics than ideology,
with the ruling People's National Congress supported by urban
blacks and the People's Progressive Party of Cheddi Jagan backed by
Indo-Guyanese, most of them farmers. The National Congress, first
under the late President Forbes Burnham, and for the last two years
under President Desmond Hoyte, has governed Guyana since 1964.
Opposition parties, Western governments and human rights
organiations have accused the National Congress of maintaining
power by election manipulation. National elections were held in
1985. The next elections must be held no later than December, 1990,
although President Hoyte could call them earlier.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ The government has launched a major drive for foreign
investment to spur the economy, which is nearly at a standstill and
dominated by a black market created by the country's nearly
depleted foreign exchange account. Economists estimate black market
transactions account for 80 percent of the country's economic life.
The country has a foreign debt exceeding $1.3 billion, 37 to 50
percent inflation, and 25 to 35 percent unemployment or
underemployment.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the aftermath of labor unrest this past
spring, the government is moving to hasten economic reform,
increase supplies of consumer goods and legalize some independent
groups in hopes of heading off more outbursts.
   But some opposition quarters doubt the government will succeed
and that more strikes are inevitable.
   An unknown factor, however, is Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
reformist Soviet leader who is scheduled to visit Poland sometime
soon.
   Five strikes in Poland from April 25 to May 10, and brief
stoppages or strike threats in 25 more workplaces, constituted the
worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martial-law
crackdown on the Solidarity independent trade union.
   The spring strikers demanded the legalization of Solidarity and
wage increases to counter price increases of 45 percent so far this
year.
   The rising prices are part of the government's multifaceted
program to reform the moribund economy.
   The program calls for introducing market equilibrium through
higher prices, encouraging private and managerial enterprise and
reducing central economic controls _ all similar to what Gorbachev
is attempting in the Soviet Union.
   ``The recent events produced an impulse to think deeper and move
faster,'' said one senior Communist Party activist, speaking only
on condition of anonymity. ``There is no way back. The only way is
forward and forward with much bigger steps.''
   The Polish leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, emphasized the need
for quick improvements in production in an unusual, eight-hour
meeting June 5 with the directors of the country's 41 largest
enterprises.
   Jerzy Malkowski, spokesman for the economic reform program, said
the government plans to introduce some steps ahead of schedule.
Long-awaited laws on setting up private businesses and easing
limits on foreign investment were approved by the government
shortly after the strikes and are expected to be enacted by the
Sejm (parliament).
   In one of the first uses of new special economic powers, the
government cut off tax benefits for companies that increase exports
at the expense of supplies for the domestic market, Malkowski said.
   On the political front, the government has signaled that it will
grant legal status to several independent groups, including the
Economic Society whose aim is to promote and aid private
businesses, a Warsaw political discussion club and the dormant
Polish chapter of the PEN writers' club.
   But authorities remain firmly opposed to legalizing Solidarity,
an issue that many in the opposition regard as the litmus test of
officials' sincerity in reaching an accord.
   The Communist Party activist said legalizing Solidarity would
lead to an escalation of pay demands in the factories, which he
maintained Poland cannot afford in its current economic condition.
When the economy improves, he argued, authorities can then think of
allowing union pluralism.
   The answer does not satisfy Solidarity activists.
   ``The basic question at the moment is whether, on the part of
the authorities, there is political willingness for deep changes in
the system,'' said Bronislaw Geremek, a historian and leading
adviser to Solidarity. ``Poland at the moment needs a spectacular
change so that it could create a psychological shock.''
   Otherwise, he added, ``there is no possibility of launching
political and economic changes.''
   Legalizing groups like PEN would have been signs ``of
extraordinary political significance'' a year ago, before the
strikes, said Geremek. But now they are ``too little, too late''
because they are addressed to a limited circle of intellectuals and
do not try to answer worker frustrations, he said.
   Malkowski acknowledges that the average Pole has seen very few
benefits of the economic reform program so far and contends that is
hindering public support.
   ``Obviously one does not convince people by rhetoric and words,
but by facts. This is why I say this year the problem is that we
have too few facts.''
   The situation should be better next year when, he said, people
will see the effects of a freer marketplace and greater competition
and supplies.
   ``Now we have the paradoxical situation in which an item is more
expensive and not available,'' he added. ``I think this is one of
the more significant factors arousing social frustration. As long
as the warehouses and stores do not get filled with goods, society
will question the sense of price increases.''

   But Halina Bortnowska, a Roman Catholic intellectual and
journalist, expressed deep skepticism about economic reforms in the
absence of any popular control of the program.
   ``There is something in the system that does not tolerate real
public control, and without this control, how can we change the
economy?'' she said. ``We are expected to pay (in higher prices and
austerity), and where are the guarantees that this will not be
wasted again?''
   Malkowski argued the system contains checks against economic
abuses by authorities. He mentioned the Constitutional Tribunal, to
which citizens can appeal, and a much freer and critical press
compared to previous decades.
   ``I can accept the criticism that it is not all that you or I
could imagine in central Europe, but it is due to the reform to a
large extent.''
   He added that authorities planned to move further ``in the
direction of democratic changes.''
   Geremek said he is convinced ``that if an essential change in
the way of exercising power by the Communists does not take place,
the situation will become more and more inflamed, less and less
stable.''
   ``Any kind of normalization of Poland's place in Europe without
such a change is impossible. I think this a problem for the Poles,
it is a problem for Gorbachev and a problem for Europe.''
   Geremek said he sees Gorbachev's visit as a key to Poland's
future.
   ``The April-May events in Poland have apparently created a
certain curve in Poland's evolution,'' he said. ``In the next few
weeks it should be determined what the direction of Poland's policy
will be. ...
   ``One may assume that (during Gorbachev's visit) certain key
decisions for future evolution will be made,'' Geremek said. ``It
will either be a new policy or a new team.''
   A Catholic journalist also closely linked to Solidarity said he
too sensed a new mood since the strikes.
   ``There has been a political change once again,'' said Krzysztof
Sliwinski. ``The mood of martial law is finished right now.
Something new is going on.''
   But he added that he doubted the country's leaders were ready to
take the big step of offering power to its opponents.
   ``They are deadly anxious about sharing power because they don't
believe in it. ... They think that if they share power, they will
lose it.''
   He maintained Polish society is demanding a greater say in its
affairs, comparing it to the American Revolution slogan: ``No
taxation without representation.''
   Another thing that has changed is the people's attitude toward
the Soviets, he said.
   ``Active people in Poland have abandoned totally their
anti-Soviet mood. Rather they are in a mood not to make too much of
a problem for Gorbachev.''
   Several statements from officials have indicated the government
is interested in increasing dialogue, perhaps along the lines of an
``anti-crisis pact'' in which both sides would unite behind a
program for the economy.
   The government spokesman, Jerzy Urban, has spoken of creating
new ``institutional'' forums for dialogue.
   He has proposed a price-wage commission on which consumers and
workers would be represented, and a ``round table'' of
representatives of associations, including groups not yet
officially registered.
   But young workers interviewed at the Ursus tractor factory
outside Warsaw say they put little stock in the government moves
and are expecting another round of strikes.

<HEAD>When It Comes to Drought, USDA Says It's in Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says it has been on
top of the drought since March 1, monitoring the situation, setting
up hotlines to handle worried callers and issuing enough statements
to paper a thousand bird cages, easy.
   One of the latest informational gimmicks is a ``USDA
Backgrounder'' listing the department's ``drought-related actions''
since the blotter-like furnaces began roaring across most of the
nation.
   ``It was my idea, my memory isn't what it used to be,'' quipped
Sally Michael, the department's deputy director of information.
``This helps me keep track of what we've done.''
   Michael agreed during questioning by a reporter that the action
list is lean on actual dollars going into the drought aid. Only two
items had dollar amounts. One involved meat purchases for school
cafeterias and the other a credit deal for the sale of meat to
Mexico.
   The backgrounders will be updated every two weeks. The first
lists 22 separate drought ``actions'' by USDA or its people,
beginning more than four months ago.
   First item:
   ``March 1. Secretary of Agriculture Richard E. Lyng establishes
USDA Drought Task Force under the chairmanship of Deputy Secretary
Peter C. Myers. Members _ agency administrators and key USDA
personnel _ will constantly monitor the potential drought
situation.''
   The blurb also gave the number of the USDA press release that
formally announced the task force creation, but not its date. In
reality, though the drought panel was set up by Lyng on March 1,
the press release announcing the action was not issued until April
22.
   Department officials questioned at the time said they attached
no significance to keeping the task force secret for seven weeks
before announcing it.
   Excerpts from other USDA actions cited by the report:
   _May 31. Counties found to be suffering from drought will be
allowed emergency haying and grazing of Acreage Conservation
Reserve (ACR) and Conservation Use Acreage (CUA). At this time,
haying and grazing do not apply to Conservation Reserve Program
(CRP) acreage.
   _June 9. Standing hay on farms held in inventory (taken over) by
the Farmers Home Administration can be sold at a reasonable cost to
help feed livestock in drought counties where state offices of the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service have authorized
release of set-aside acres for haying and grazing.
   _June 14. Lyng briefs Senate and House Agriculture Committees on
the drought and offers to cooperate with the Congressional Relief
Task Force announced by Sen. Patrich Leahy, D-Vt., and Rep. Kika de
la Garza, D-Texas.
   _June 15. The White House announces a new Interagency Drought
Policy Committee made up of USDA, Interior, the Office of the Vice
President and several other agencies. Departments of State and
Transportation, and the Council of Economic Advisers were
subsequently added.
   _June 16. Lyng announces that farmers in designated drought
counties will be authorized to harvest hay from land in the
Conservation Reserve Program. Haying will be allowed for 30 days if
farmers give up part of their CRP payments. Livestock grazing of
CRP land was not authorized.
   _June 20. The Interagency Drought Policy Committee meets for the
first time.
   _June 20. USDA begins making daily audio tapes of weather
updates available to news media.
   _June 21. Lyng announces haying will be allowed on CRP land if a
county has been approved for emergency haying and grazing of ACR
and CUA land due to drought.
   _June 22. Lyng meets with the Congressional Drought Relief Task
Force, which issues a ``statement of general agreements'' calling
on the secretary to implement various forms of disaster assistance.
   _June 23. Lyng and other USDA officials meet in Chicago with the
National Governors' Association Committee on Agriculture and Rural
Development.
   _June 23. While in Chicago, Lyng announces a toll-free hotline
to answer questions about federal services available in drought
areas.
   _June 23. Returning to Washington, Lyng briefs the president and
vice president on the drought and says that there is agreement
among congressmen, senators, farm groups and governors that it is
too early for emergency relief measures.
   _June 23. After the White House meeting, the Interagency Drought
Policy Committee meets for the second time at USDA.
   _June 24. In its first day of operation, USDA's hotline logs
more than 600 calls in 10 hours. Lyng orders another eight lines
installed, raising total to 18 lines. Greatest number of calls the
first day are from Iowa, Wisconsin and North Dakota.
   _June 27. USDA announces that special crop surveys in several
states and other steps will be taken to update the department's
July 12 crop report and supply-and-demand projections for fall
harvets, including corn and soybeans.
   _June 27. An additional $50 million has been set aside to buy
bulk ground beef for donation to schools lunch and other feeding
programs, to help cattle producers hurt by drought.
   _June 27. Lyng authorizes additional emergency provisions in
drought counties, including permission for selling hay to anyone,
and the harvest of ACR, CUA and CRP land as green chop for
immediate feeding to livestock or silage.
   _June 27. Intragency Drought Policy Committee meets for the
third time.
   _June 28. Federal and state officials set up a national hay
information network, or HayNet, to assist in locating forage
supplies.
   _June 29. Department will hold news conference July 12 following
release of crop report and supply-demand projections.
   _June 29. Mexico can buy $40 million worth of meat under an
amended credit arrangement. The purchases are intended to help
bolster livestock markets depressed by drought liquidation of herds.

<HEAD>Santa Fe To Keep Real Estate Assets Previously Earmarked For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. said Wednesday it
will retain certain West Coast properties it previously planned to
sell as part of a corporate restructuring.
   The decision is expected to boost the company's real estate
assets nearly $1 billion over the next five years, Santa Fe said.
   Santa Fe had intended to sell the properties in order to help
pay a $3.66 billion restructuring debt incurred in a restructuring
aimed at thwarting a takeover bid by Henley Group Inc., of La
Jolla, Calif.
   Instead, the company said it plans to borrow against a large
number of the developed properties and continue major building
projects in the San Francisco and San Diego areas.
   Robert D. Krebs, chairman of the Chicago-based company, said the
revised plan reflects the progress the company has made in
implementing its restructuring plan.
   ``So far this year the combined income of the operating units is
better than anticipated, and we have made the debt repayments on
our bank financing ahead of schedule,'' he said.
   ``This has given us greater flexibility in our real estate
program, permitting retention of properties previously scheduled
for sale.''
   Under the new plan, the company will generate cash to pay off
its bank debt and still gain from any future appreciation of the
property values, Krebs said.
   Krebs said the new strategy was approved by the company's board
of directors Tuesday. He anticipated the plan would receive the
required approval from a bank group holding the restructuring loans.
   The properties to be financed include low-rise office,
distribution and warehouse space located primarily in California
and Arizona, as well as 5,800 acres of ground leases. The company
plans to build about 1 million square feet of buildings next year.
   Santa Fe said it intends to sell about $300 million in real
estate assets in 1988, about the same amount as in previous years.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge dipped slightly in May, the first setback since January, but
analysts shrugged off the tiny downturn as no threat to prospects
for the rest of the year.
   The Commerce Department reported a 0.1 percent decline last
month in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, primarily
reflecting weakness in the stock market, manufacturing orders and
the labor market. At the same time, the department on Wednesday
revised upward, from 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent, the gain it had
initially reported for April.
   Economists dismissed the decline, saying growth would continue
at least through the remainder of 1988 with no danger of recession.

   The high court also issued a key civil rights ruling allowing
employees to use statistical evidence to prove their bosses are

   The union ruling could deprive many unions of significant

   The agency said Wednesday it was unable to estimate how many
worker poisonings would be avoided as a result, because no one

   Farmers using hired labor, chemical manufacturers and others

said Louis True, head of program management and support in EPA's

contract for home heating oil slipped 0.79 cent to 41.52 cents a
gallon.
   ``This is the peak season for gasoline,'' said Peter Beutel, an
oil analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   Beutel said a recent American Petroleum Institute report showed
demand for gasoline was at its highest point in about 10 years.
   The report said an average 8.53 million barrels of gasoline were
transferred from refineries to distributors each day for the week
ending June 24. That surpassed the previous highest level of 8.48
million barrels in July 1978.
   ``Because prices have been so low lately, a lot of people are
driving more,'' Beutel said.
   The API report also showed stocks of gasoline were down 7
percent from a year ago, and that helped send gas prices higher
Wednesday, Beutel said.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude oil, fell 35 cents to $15.43 per barrel.
   ``Most people still perceive an oversupply of crude oil,''
Beutel said.

<HEAD>IBM To Consolidate Operations In $600 Million Cost-Cutting Move</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major consolidation by International Business
Machines Corp. is expected to lead to the resignations or early
retirements of 3,000 to 4,000 employees, the giant computer maker
says.
   The $600 million consolidation by the world's biggest computer
company is intended to ``further reduce costs, provide for future
growth and speed new products to customers,'' IBM announced
Wednesday.
   ``This is a major, major restructuring,'' Terry Lautenbach, IBM
senior vice president and general manager of IBM United States,
said in an interview.
   In its last big move to cut costs, IBM offered incentives that
resulted in the early retirement of 13,000 employees in the United
States and 2,000 outside the United States in 1986 and 1987.
   IBM said it would cut 1,600 jobs in Boca Raton, Fla., the
birthplace of the original Personal Computer, by eliminating
manufacturing there, and 2,800 jobs in Tucson, Ariz., where it will
phase out manufacturing of data storage products.
   IBM also will close two plants of Rolm Systems that manufacture
telecommunications equipment, moving work from the Santa Clara,
Calif., operation to a nearby San Jose plant and from the Austin,
Texas, site to IBM's nearby main Austin site.
   Jobs will be added in other places such as IBM's Research
Triangle Park near Raleigh, N.C., which will take over the
manufacturing of Personal System-2 computers from Boca Raton.
   IBM will offer jobs to all employees displaced by plant
closings. But in an apparent effort to cut employment, it will
offer two years' salary and a $25,000 bonus to any employees in the
Boca Raton and Tucson sites who choose to resign or retire.
   Lautenbach characterized the payments as a form of assistance to
people who chose to leave, rather than as an incentive to get them
to leave.
   IBM also intends to try to cut its headquarters staff in
Westchester County, N.Y., and elsewhere by offering eligible
employees four weeks' salary for every year of service as
separation bonuses.
   The cuts will result in a charge of $600 million against pre-tax
earnings in the second quarter, IBM said. However, the impact on
first-half earnings largely will be offset by an accounting change
related to treatment of deferred income taxes.
   IBM's stock closed unchanged at $127 a share in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Lautenbach said improvements in manufacturing technology left
the company with more plants than it needed. He said the closings
had nothing to do with slow growth, saying, ``Our business is
growing satisfactorily.''
   IBM said the key elements of the moves, expected to be completed
by the end of 1989, were as follows:
   _Personal System-2 manufacturing in Boca Raton, Fla., will move
to IBM's Research Triangle Park plant near Raleigh, N.C., where
much Personal System-2 manufacturing already takes place. All other
operations related to the Personal System-2 in Boca Raton will
remain there.
   _Manufacturing operations at the Tucson storage products plant
will be phased out and the work moved to IBM plants in San Jose,
Charlotte, N.C.; and Poughkeepsie, N.Y. The Tucson development
laboratory will continue its operations there.
   _Rolm Systems telecommunications manufacturing in Santa Clara,
Calif., will be moved to IBM's nearby San Jose facility. Rolm
Systems manufacturing and development in Austin will be
consolidated with IBM's main Austin site.
   _IBM plants in Charlotte and Austin will take over some of the
assembly work now done in Toronto. Also, an IBM laboratory in
Toronto will get more programming development responsibility.
Manufacturing of memory cards and power systems will continue in
Toronto.
   _A plant in the New York City borough of Brooklyn will diagnose
and process electronic components, work formerly done in locations
across the country. Brooklyn's assembly operations will be
consolidated in Poughkeepsie.
   IBM plans to turn its Tucson manufacturing plant into an
industrial park that would attract high-technology companies to the
area.
   Alberta Charney, an economics and business research specialist
with the University of Arizona, said the job cuts probably would
have a ripple effect resulting in a total loss of 7,000 jobs in the
Tucson area over the long run.
   Ms. Charney estimated the payroll of the 2,800 affected
employees would be close to a $100 million income loss to Pima
County.
   In Boca Raton, IBM will remain the area's largest employer,
spokeswoman Marti Easterbrook said. She noted employment at the end
of 1989 still will be 30 percent higher than it was in 1980, before
the company tooled up for production of personal computers.
   The Boca Raton area ``cannot lose these type of jobs without
feeling it,'' said M.J. ``Mike'' Arts, executive vice president of
the Greater Boca Raton Chamber of Commerce.
   But he said, ``It will be a benefit to us since it will be a
talented labor pool in the area. I suspect many of them will stay
here and this may help us in attracting employers who need these
workers.''

   Prices of grain and soybeans jumped sharply
this month, a bittersweet reminder that drought can deal a stacked
deck to farmers _ those whose crops survive can rake in their
winnings as others leave the game broke.
   Overall, prices farmers got for raw products rose 3.7 percent
from May, a jump that carried the overall index up 6.9 percent from
a year ago, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Higher prices for soybeans, corn and wheat contributed most to
the June increase, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board
said. Lower prices for cattle and peaches partly offset the rise in
other commodities.
   ``Most grain prices moved up sharply in June, reflecting the
widespread drought,'' the report said. ``The average soybean price
was at the highest level since May of 1977 and the fifth highest on
record. Corn and wheat also moved up sharply to the highest levels
since August of 1985 and May of 1984, respectively.''
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
Before the drought took hold, USDA was predicting a 1988 food price
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
   No forecast has been made by the department for 1989.
   According to the preliminary June figures, based mostly on
mid-month averages, the index for crop prices was up 10 percent
from May and averaged 18 percent more than a year ago.
   The livestock price index dropped 2.6 percent from May and
averaged 1.3 percent below the year-ago level.
   In a related action, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng
announced that Mexico will be able to buy $40 million worth of U.S.
meat under a special credit arrangement designed to help
drought-stricken American livestock producers.
   It was the second action this week by Lyng to help bolster
livestock market prices. On Monday he announced $50 million has
been authorized to buy an estimated 45 million pounds of frozen
bulk ground beef for donation to school lunchrooms in the fall.
   As a commodity group, prices of feed grains and hay _ in great
demand for livestock in the stricken drought areas _ rose 20
percent from May to June, averaging 40 percent above a year ago.
   Prices of food grains, mostly wheat but also including rice,
rose 14 percent during the month and averaged 14 percent higher
than in May. The June index was up 49 percent from June 1987. All
of the May-June rise was due to higher wheat prices, while rice
prices declined during the month.
   The index of prices for oil-bearing crops, which mostly involves
soybeans, jumped 19 percent from its May average and was 48 percent
more than in June 1987. Preliminary figures showed soybean prices
averaged $8.56 per bushel, up $1.57 from May.
   Lower prices for cattle and calves were mostly responsible for
the June decline in the livestock price index. Prices of beef
cattle, generally, fell to an average of $65.20 per hundredweight
in June from $69.30 in May. Calf prices dropped $6.70 to $86.70 in
June.
   Many farmers and ranchers have been forced by drought to send
cattle to slaughter or to feedlots as pastures and ranges continue
to burn up. That has put extra animals on the market and depressed
prices.
   The price index for poultry and eggs, collectively, rose 7.5
percent from May to June and averaged 11 percent more than a year
ago.
   Besides the decline in livestock prices, the fruit index dropped
6.7 percent from May and averaged 7.1 percent lower than in June
1987. ``Prices for peaches, grapefruit, oranges and strawberries
were lower than the previous month,'' the report said.
   Although the projections are subject to review as more is known
about 1988 crop and livestock production, USDA economists say now
that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $53 billion
to $59 billion this year, compared to the record level of $56
billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts and
cash expenses during the calendar year.
   No new figures for farm production costs were included in the
report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages because of
budget cutbacks.
   In April, however, farm expenses were up 1.8 percent from
January and averaged 3.7 percent above a year earlier. The April
figures were carried forward into June, with the next revision
scheduled in July.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $65.20 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, down from $69.30 in May but up from $62.50 reported for
June 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $47.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $46.30 in
May and $59.20 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.43 a bushel, was up from $1.95 in May and the
average of $1.69 per bushel a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.50 per bushel, compared with $2.99 in May and $2.44 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.31 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.71 in May
and $3.62 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $8.56 per bushel, compared with $6.99 in May and
$5.36 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 60.4 cents per pound, compared
with 58.9 in May and 66.2 cents in June 1987.
   _Eggs were 45.7 cents per dozen, compared with 43.1 cents in May
and 50 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $11.30 per 100 pounds, compared with $11.40 in May and
$11.90 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 36.7 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
33.5 cents in May and 27.6 cents a year ago.

   Hundreds of Teamsters-related prosecutions show
that union officials made a ``devil's pact'' with the Mafia, the
government says in a 105-page memorandum in support of its lawsuit
to oust the union's leadership.
   ``Since approximately 1970,'' said the memo, ``the government
has successfully prosecuted well over 300 persons associated with
the Teamsters for Teamsters-related crimes.''
   The memo accompanied the government lawsuit filed Tuesday
seeking a court order placing restraints on the 18-member General
Executive Board of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
   The document is crammed with details of ``a recent series of
successful criminal and civil prosecutions'' that show the Mafia
has gained control over the Teamsters.
   The government's court papers noted that ``four of the last five
Teamsters presidents have faced federal felony charges'' and three
were convicted: David Beck for embezzlement; James ``Jimmy'' Hoffa
for obstructing justice and mail fraud and Roy Williams for trying
to bribe a U.S. senator.
   Among 26 alleged mob figures named as defendants in the lawsuit,
25 have been convicted of Teamsters-related crimes such as
extortion through threats of union problems, embezzlement of union
funds and illegal labor payoffs.
   From 1970 until now the Teamsters' executive board ``has rarely
taken disciplinary action against, or even investigated, corrupt
Teamsters officials or subordinate entities,'' the government said.
   The memorandum of law that claimed the union's leadership ``has
made a devil's pact with La Cosa Nostra.''
   Prosecutors noted that Maurice Schurr, a vice president and
member of the executive board, ``was recently convicted of
receiving illegal labor payments from Teamsters employers.''
   U.S. District Judge David Edelsten issued a temporary court
order that bars the board from making large expenditures of union
funds or destroying union records. The order also banned the 25
previously convicted mob defendants from participating in union
affairs.
   When he announced the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani
quoted what the late Robert F. Kennedy and the President's
Commission on Organized Crime had to say about the Teamsters.
   The report of the President's Commission, said Giuliani,
described the Teamsters ``as the union `Most Controlled' by
organized crime.''
   Giuliani also quoted at length from ``The Enemy Within,'' Robert
Kennedy's 1960 book about a Senate probe into ``the sordid
dishonesty'' of organized crime's infiltration of the Teamsters.
   ``He was ridiculed. He was vilified. He was hated irrationally _
but he was right,'' Giuliani said of Kennedy.
   The Teamsters' executive board, which is holding its quarterly
meeting in Montreal, sharply criticized the government's lawsuit as
``a vicious antilabor attack'' and said allegations of ties to
organized crime were ``pure myth.''
   In another development Wednesday, a Canadian board member denied
any connection between the 91,500-member Canadian branch of the
Teamsters and the Mafia.
   Edward Lawson, 59, of Vancouver, a member of Canada's appointed
federal Senate, said the U.S. lawsuit ``links every honest Canadian
Teamster with a bunch of gangsters we know nothing about.''

   General Electric Co. has released the terms of a
tentative contract agreement in the hope that it will quell
rumblings of possible rejection when workers vote on it July 6.
   ``We believe that once union members understand the contract and
its improvements, they will ratify it,'' GE spokesman Jack Batty
said Wednesday.
   Tentative agreement on a three-year pact was reached Sunday
night after five weeks of talks. On Tuesday, union delegates from
locals across the country unanimously called for the 47,000 workers
to reject it.
   Approval had been recommended by the unions' bargaining
committee and the international officers of the largest union, the
International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine
and Furniture Workers (IUE).
   As presented by GE, the contract calls for:
   _An immediate wage increase of 2.5 percent and 1.5 percent
increases in June 1989 and June 1990; also, lump sum payments of
$165 in July and $900 in June 1989.
   _Five cost-of-living adjustments over the term of the contract
at the current formula of 1 cent an hour for each 0.15 percent rise
in the Consumer Price Index.
   _Improved retirement options and bonuses, especially for workers
affected by plant closings, product-line discontinuation,
automation and layoffs.
   _Increased retraining assistance from $3,000 over two years to
$5,000 over three years.
   _Waiving of the employee's contribution to the retirement plan
for the first $25,000 in annual income, up from $14,000; and
increased pension payouts.
   ``Obviously we did not get everything we went after. You never
do,'' IUE President William Bywater said. ``But the agreement is
solid and it will leave union members and their families better off
both in the short and the long run.''
   The IUE represents about 40,000 workers in 75 locals at about
100 factories around the country.
   The pact negotiated by the IUE forms the basis for GE's other
national contract with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine
Workers of America (UE), which covers 6,300 employees, and with 10
other unions that represent another 21,000 workers.
   Batty noted that the local delegates who recommended rejection
did not attend any bargaining sessions and may not have had time to
fully understand the pact.
   But IUE spokesman Jerry Borstel said, ``They just felt it fell
short of what they ought to get.''
   ``If they don't ratify, it might mean a strike,'' Borstel said.
``I don't know. The union is free to strike at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
We have given them the 10-day notice as required by the contract.''

<HEAD>SEC Expanding Probe To Switzerland in Latest Insider Trading
Inquiry</HEAD>

   The government's latest major insider trading
case is just one of many it is investigating that involve
foreign-based transactions, officials of the Securities and
Exchange Commission say.
   The $19 million insider trading case that became public this
week has expanded to Switzerland, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder told
Congress on Wednesday. Ruder said authorities have learned that
Fred C. Lee, the Hong Kong trader accused in the case, traded some
U.S. securities from the European country.
   ``We're now seeking information from Swiss authorities, and
trying to get a freeze on assets he has there,'' Ruder told
reporters during a break in the hearing by the Senate Banking
Committee's securities subcommittee.
   Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, told the lawmakers that
the Lee case is one of 40 or 50 investigations under way in which
foreign trading is involved. He said at least one of the
investigations involves ``very large dollar amounts,'' and that
others range down to as little as $40,000 to $50,000 or less.
   Ruder declined to say what the value of Lee's Swiss trades or
assets might be. But Lynch said the trades Lee made from the
European country were part of the $19 million Lee allegedly earned
by trading on inside information.
   The SEC has accused Stephen Wang Jr., 24, a securities analyst
for Morgan Stanley & Co., of providing Lee with privileged
information on at least 25 corporate takeovers that Morgan Stanley
handled. The agency says Lee made at least $19 million using the
information and gave $200,000 to Wang.
   Lee, 38, is based in Hong Kong, but also has a home in the
Washington suburb of McLean, Va. Lynch said Lee, a native of
Taiwan, has claimed Canadian citizenship with at least one
brokerage firm he used.
   The SEC is seeking $76 million from the two men, which would
cover a repayment of the money they made, plus triple damages. That
reward is surpassed by only the $100 million the SEC recovered when
insider trader Ivan F. Boesky settled with the agency in November
1986.
   Wang's attorney, Ira L. Sorkin, has declined to comment on the
accusations other than to say he is studying them.
   Lee's lawyer, Michael Perlis, said in a telephone interview
Wednesday from his San Francisco office that Lee intended to resist
the SEC's accusations but likely would remain outside this country.
   Asked about press reports quoting Perlis as indicating he might
attempt to settle the accusations for far less than the amount the
SEC is requesting from his client, Perlis said, ``That's just
speculation.''
   But he also said, ``Every case can be settled and should be
settled on terms agreeable to all parties.''
   SEC officials have said Lee did some of the allegedly illicit
trading through a Hong Kong investment management company,
Federated International Investment Management (FE) Ltd., a
subsidiary of Aetna Life and Casualty.
   In Hong Kong today, Federated's managing director, Nigel Lester,
confirmed Lee was an ex-client and the company has been cooperating
with SEC officials. He said no allegations of wrongdoing have been
raised against Federated employees, but declined to discuss details
of the SEC investigation.
   Ruder and Lynch, along with State Department legal adviser Mary
V. Mochary, appeared before the subcommittee to testify in favor of
legislation that would give the SEC more powers to conduct
securities investigations in this country at the request of foreign
countries.
   Currently, the SEC can only force the presentation of evidence
if there are indications that U.S. law has been broken. Sponsors,
including Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the
subcommittee, hope that if that power is expanded, other nations
will cooperate when U.S. authorities need records from overseas.
   Similar legislation was introduced Wednesday in the House by
Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., Edward Markey, D-Mass., Norman Lent,
R-N.Y., and Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J.

<HEAD>EEC Improves Its Economic Forecast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community raised
its 1988 economic forecast Thursday, predicting the economies of
its 12-member nations would grow an average 2.6 percent instead of
falling into recession.
   The EEC Commission, the group's policy-making board, had
predicted negative growth following last October's collapse of
financial markets.
   Growth is expected to slow in 1989 to 2.3 percent due largely to
an anticipated slowdown in the EEC's most dynamic economies _
Spain, Italy, Portugal and Britain. Growth in the eight other
member states would likely stablize at an average 2 percent, the
EEC Commission said.
   The commission said levels of employment would continue
increasing by about 0.8 percent annually. But it said total
unemployment levels were expected to remain high throughout the
trading bloc at 11.3 percent in 1988 and 11.1 percent in 1989.
   The Commission also predicted a 1988 inflation level of ``just
over 3 percent.'' It forecast that only Greece would have a high
inflation rate of about 15 percent.

   Stock prices gained ground today with a boost
from declining interest rates as the markets reached the midpoint
of 1988.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.02 to 2,125.00 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 639 up, 289
down and 467 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 42.64 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Nearly half of that total came in a handful of high-yielding
utility stocks which were involved in trading strategies based on
their impending dividend payments.
   Otherwise, analysts said investors drew some encouragement from
a drop in bond-market interest rates.
   West German authorities raised some of their key interest rates
today, following a similar move in Britain earlier in the week.
   But investors in the U.S markets took the news in stride,
apparently concluding that the Federal Reserve would not
necessarily feel compelled to tighten credit in this country.
   Brokers were expecting the pace of activity to start slowing
today as the long July 4 holiday weekend approaches.
   National Semiconductor fell 1{ to 12~. Analysts noted
disappointment among investors over the size of the quarterly
earnings gain reported by the company after the market closed on
Wednesday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.18 to 153.31. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .05 at 307.20.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average finished with an
8.89 loss at 2,121.98.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's central bank
raised a key interest rate Thursday in a move to shore up the weak
mark and curb inflation.
   The Deutsche Bundesbank increased its discount rate _ the
interest it charges on loans to member banks _ by one-half of a
percentage point to 3 percent.
   The central bank also said it would raise its rate on securities
repurchase agreements to 3.75 percent from 3.5 percent Friday.
However, it left unchanged at 4.5 percent the less-important
Lombard rate, which is the interest charged on loans to other banks
when securities are used as collateral.
   In a statement, the Bundesbank said its 17-member governing
council decided to hike the key rates largely to support the
weakening West German mark. West German officials fear that a soft
mark will spur inflationary pressures and damage progress made in
reversing trade imbalances between the United States and its major
trading partners.
   The boost in West German rates had been widely expected by the
financial markets, mostly because of the recent surge in the
dollar. Foreign exchange dealers said the announcement had little
impact on the dollar since it already had been discounted by the
market.
   Following West Germany's move Thursday was the Austrian National
Bank, Austria's central bank, which raised its discount rate to 3.5
percent from 3 percent and also left its Lombard rate unchanged.

   Congress is so regularly behind schedule,
members find it cause for celebration when the House does something
on time and Speaker Jim Wright held a news conference today to
boast about it.
   ``We think it is probably the most productive Congress in recent
history,'' said Wright, D-Texas. He was joined by two dozen senior
lawmakers in an event staged to make sure reporters noted House
passage Wednesday of the last two of its 13 annual appropriations
bills.
   The last time all those measures cleared the chamber before the
end of June was in President Eisenhower's last year in office.
   Following passage of the Transportation and Interior department
money bills on Wednesday, lawmakers applauded and Wright
interrupted further deliberations to mark what he called a
``historically significant occasion.''
   Rep. Silvio Conte, senior Republican on the House Appropriations
Committee, was more emphatic. ``Hell has indeed frozen over,'' he
said.
   The House action was so swift that ``the only thing quicker was
the Tyson-Spinks bout,'' Conte said.
   The last time the House approved all of its spending bills
before June 30 was in 1960, when the new fiscal year began July 1.
This year's bills are for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   The speedy process this year was made possible by last fall's
deficit-reduction agreement between President Reagan and
congressional leaders, which decided in advance the overall
spending levels for military, foreign aid, and domestic agency
programs.
   ``We have kept the total of appropriations bills below the
president's requests, although we made rearrangements of priorities
of the various bills to continue essential domestic programs,''
said Rep. Jamie L. Whitten, D-Miss., the chairman of the
Appropriations Committee.
   Because of the House's changes in spending plans, some of which
the White House contends are too costly, veto threats hang over
several of the bills.
   But even if just one of the regular spending bills is eventually
signed by the president, the record will be better than in the last
two years.
   For last year and the current fiscal year, all of the
government's spending authority has been wrapped into huge,
catchall money bills. The president has promised never again to
sign one of those omnibus measures, and many in Congress vowed
never to vote for one again.
   The Senate has approved its version of four spending bills. The
House and Senate have reached a compromise on one of those which
could be sent to the White House next week.

   Corporate takeover artists have their pencils
poised, ready to tick off names of targets. Expansion-oriented
companies have their own acquisition plans, and executives nervous
about low stock prices are mulling restructurings.
   But the looming question is just who is on these secret hit
lists for the latter half of 1988, a period ripe for fast-paced
buyouts.
   A relatively cheap dollar is expected to keep luring foreign
investors, while a fear of tighter regulations in the post-Reagan
era should keep domestic-led takeovers rolling.
   Topping it off is a plethora of companies whose share prices
remain depressed in the wake of October's stock market bloodbath,
rendering them relative bargains.
   Most Wall Streeters covet such opportunities and are more than
reluctant to point fingers at potential takeover or restructuring
targets.
   ``People pay us for our opinions,'' said one analyst at Bear
Stearns & Co., ``so I don't want to give them to you for nothing.''
   But the grapevine is abuzz with names like Texaco, Whirlpool,
American Brands, McGraw-Hill and plenty more.
   Using a purely numerical approach to identify targets, Linda
Zimbalist Smith said she searches for stocks that would jump in a
takeover, restructuring or leveraged buyout. And while a company
may appear on her list today, a few ticks upward in its stock price
could render it undesirable in an instant, according to her complex
formula.
   In May, Smith, head of the Greenwich, Conn.-based research firm
Zimbalist Smith, named 28 target companies _ including American
Brands, Monsanto, Whirlpool, Goodyear and Zayre _ but many of these
companies no longer pass her test.
   Still, experts remain keen on American Brands, a company with
far-flung interests from tobacco to biscuits.
   ``It is one of the ultimate consumer conglomerates, with dozens
of separate companies pasted together without any synergy,'' noted
Michael Metz, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.
   That means the company's separate parts could be spun off or
sold to finance a takeover or pay shareholders a handsome dividend.
For the investor, a takeover is not the only way to cash out. Any
kind of restructuring or leveraged buyout is designed to boost
shareholder value and put profits in the pockets of investors.
   Smith conceded that American Brand's break-up value is great and
that its stock price is hampered by the cloud hanging over the
tobacco industry.
   A depressed stock price alone is not the only red flag on a
potential target. Internal forces, such as low debt levels coupled
with higher projected earnings, also can highlight target companies.
   ``You have to look at the financials of a company, the cash
flow, the balance sheet, and you have to look outside directors,
whether they are friends of management,'' said Metz.
   Anti-takeover provisions are likely to be only a slight
deterrent to takeover offers.
   There are even more subtle issues to consider. ``We look for
values as well as a catalyst,'' said Mario Gabelli, who heads the
investment firm Gabelli & Co.
   Among his so-called catalysts are ``things like divorce, death,
big blocks of stock in the hands of octogenarians.''
   For example, Gabelli said he is buying lots of stock in Thomas
Industries Inc., a Kentucky-based lighting manufacturer. The
company's founder, Lee B. Thomas, died in March, and a spokesman
said he does not know what became of Thomas's stake in the company.
   Newell Co., an Illinois home hardware concern, apparently also
likes Thomas. Newell has picked up a 6.5 percent stake in the
company and could serve as an important ally to a potential suitor
_ if it does not make a bid of its own.
   Divorce is taking its toll on R.P. Scherer Corp. Karla Scherer
Fink, who has filed suit to divorce the company's president, has
said she wants to sell the pharmaceuticals company in which she
holds a 33 percent stake. One investor group that controls more
than 13 percent of the company has already held talks with her and
may be jockeying for an acquisition.
   If internal strife is a major criteria, nowhere is such a force
more evident that at Texaco Inc. Despite defeating raider Carl C.
Icahn in a critical proxy battle, the oil giant remains vulnerable.
   Icahn's 14.9 percent stake may be for sale, giving any purchaser
a solid springboard for an offer. In addition, the aggressive New
York investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., which sided
with management in the proxy battle, conceivably could push for a
leveraged buyout and retain Texaco management, with whom they
likely have established a working rapport, Oppenheimer's Metz said.
   One deal often turns the spotlight on an entire industry. ``It
starts a conflagration, and investors and speculators look to
mirror images and clones to see if other potential vehicles could
go the same way,'' Metz said.
   Turmoil at Texaco has turned up the heat on other oil companies,
in particular Unocal Corp. and Phillips Petroleum Co. Both are
``selling at large discounts considering their break-up value as
well as in terms of cash flow and the value of underlying gas and
oil reserves,'' Metz said.
   In the publishing industry, Macmillan Inc.'s announced
recapitalization as a defensive measure against offers from the
Robert Bass group sparked rumors that Time Inc. and McGraw-Hill
Inc. might also be targets.
   Indeed, McGraw-Hill reorganized into three new operating
companies in late June in what some analysts described as a
protective move. The company's stock jumped $3.62{ a share the day
the restructuring was announced.
   And General Electric Co.'s acquisition of Roper Corp. turned
fresh attention to the home appliance market. Since then there has
been plenty of talk about Whirlpool Corp. and fellow appliance
maker Maytag Corp., including rumors that Whirlpool might make a
bid for Maytag.
   Not all undervalued companies are targets. Most drug companies,
for example, are trading at a discount but are not choice
candidates. Metz noted that these companies are undervalued in part
because of the uncertainty surrounding the future of government
health insurance plans and because the revived dollar will not
benefit their overseas sales as it did in the previous year.
   But Smithkline Beckman Corp. is one pharmaceutical company whose
stock is so downright depressed it just might be attractive.
Smithkline's stock recently plummeted from about $54 a share to the
$45 range after the company revised its earnings projections
downward.
   Because of Eastman Kodak Co.'s megapurchase of Sterling Drug
Inc. earlier this year, Zimbalist Smith has the company on her
``watch list.''
   ``It's in line to do something to boost its stock price, and
there's a lot it can do'' now that it has more pieces to sell off,
she said.

<HEAD>Debt Grows 36 Percent in Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's foreign debt soared to $368.2
billion in 1987 as the country lengthened its lead as the world's
largest debtor nation, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the new debt burden was 36.8
percent higher than a revised $269.2 billion debt to foreigners
that the United States was carrying at the end of 1986.
   The deterioration means that the country now has a debt load
greater than the total debt being carried by Brazil, Mexico and
Argentina combined, the Third World countries with the largest debt
burdens.
   Simply put, the U.S. debt means that foreigners now own more in
U.S. assets than Americans own abroad.
   For 1987, the government reported that foreign holdings in the
United States increased 14.6 percent to $1.54 trillion. This
compared to a 9 percent rise in American investments overseas,
which totaled $1.17 trillion at the end of 1987.
   The difference between foreign investments in this country and
American holdings overseas represents the $368.2 billion debt
burden the country is carrying.
   As recently as 1982, the United States was the world's largest
creditor nation with an investment surplus of $136.9 billion. But
America's investment surplus evaporated as the country ran up huge
merchandise trade deficits during the 1980s, transferring billions
of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay for color
televisions, stereo equipment and automobiles.
   These dollars, now in foreign hands, have been reinvested in the
United States in everything from U.S. government bonds to Los
Angeles real estate. The country became a net debtor for the first
time in 71 years in 1985 with an investment deficit of $110.7
billion.
   The new figures showing the country's debt burden widening had
been widely anticipated, but they were certain to heighten the
debate in this presidential election year over what Democratic
critics charge is one of the greatest failures of the Reagan
presidency.
   Critics contend that the country's position as the largest
debtor nation is eroding America's political and economic standing
in the world.
   In a report Wednesday, the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment warned that the United States faced a ``time of
reckoning'' when foreigners would no longer be willing to lend more
money.
   ``As the United States sinks further into debt, foreign
investors and creditors _ central banks, individuals and firms _
will be less inclined to commit ever-increasing amounts of capital
to a $4 trillion economy on a spending spree,'' the OTA report said.
   The rise in foreign investment in this country has sounded alarm
bells and prompted calls in Congress for curbs on foreign purchases
of U.S. companies and American real estate.
   But President Reagan has maintained that the country's debtor
status is a sign of strength, showing the eagerness with which
foreigners want to invest in America.
   The administration notes that the United States was a net debtor
for most of the 19th century with no bad effects as European
capital helped to build railroads and factories.
   But many private economists contend that the country's status as
the biggest debtor had jeopardized U.S. prestige. They said the
decline was evident at last week's Toronto economic summit, at
which the United States wielded less influence and Japan, now the
world's largest creditor country, took more of a lead in the
discussions.
   Private economists say there is a marked difference between the
19th century net debtor period and the present. In the last
century, America was a developing country and needed foreign
capital to become an industrial power.
   But during the 1980s, much of the foreign money has gone to
finance a borrowing binge on the part of the federal government and
consumers rather than being put into investments that would boost
American productivity.
   Because of this, these analysts contend that Americans will face
a declining standard of living in the future as the foreign debt is
repaid. Some economists believe that interest on the U.S. debt will
be running between $30 billion and $50 billion in the 1990s as the
total foreign debt approaches $1 trillion.
   The administration argues that the cost of servicing the foreign
debt is still a small percentage of the country's total economy but
private economists contend that the rate of growth is alarming.
   ``We are losing control over our own economy and our capital
markets,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group, an
economic consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``This money doesn't
come free. The debt servicing needs will suck income out of the
country.''
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said Americans'
standard of living already has suffered because of the foreign debt
burden, with the declines showing up in such things as higher
mortgage rates because U.S. interest rates have to be higher to
attract needed foreign capital.
   ``The U.S. debtor position, along with a huge federal government
debt, are already eating away at our standard of living,'' he said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
sharply higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reversing a
steep, two-day decline as rains ended in the Midwest and drought
fears regained the upper hand in the marketplace.
   ``It's a new day, a new beginning,'' said Joel Karlin, an
analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Wednesday's dramatic losses were pegged to unexpected showers
that brought relief to parched fields in the upper Midwest. But the
National Weather Service's 30-day outlook, issued Wednesday after
the close of trading, quashed any ideas that the drought had been
broken.
   ``They're calling for almost no rainfall from Illinois east to
Ohio and higher-than-normal temperatures in Iowa, Illinois and
Missouri, the three biggest soybean states,'' Karlin said.
   ``We really need above-normal rainfall in July,'' a critical
month for corn and soybean development, he said.
   The long Independence Day weekend is expected to be warm and
mostly dry in the Farm Belt, which added to today's bullish mood,
Karlin said.
   In early trading, wheat was 10 cents to 15 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.63{ a bushel; corn was 6} cents
to 13 cents higher with July at $3.22 a bushel; oats were 6\ cents
to 27 cents higher with July at $3.62 a bushel; soybeans were 6
cents to 34 cents higher with July at $9.65 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .47 cent lower to .85 cent higher with August
at 64.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .95 cent
lower with August at 74 cents a pound; hogs were .23 cent to .90
cent higher with July at 46.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .30 cent to 1.25 cents higher with July at 37.50 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mixed on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Higher Aluminum Prices Fuel Fight With Steel For Cans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The steel industry's perennial offensive
against aluminum for a bigger share of the food and beverage
container market is moving full tilt.
   Whether the latest effort to regain lost glory will fare any
better than wayward sorties of the past depends on whom you talk
to. If nothing else, the maneuvering has a decidedly serious tone
in 1988.
   ``We've had in the last six to eight months as much conversation
around the threat of steelmakers as we've had at any time. It's
because of the runup in aluminum prices,'' said Ronald R. Hoffman,
group vice president for packaging systems at Pittsburgh-based
Aluminum Co. of America.
   Price is the big weapon in the battle for the can, and aluminum
makers ``are going to fight tooth, nail and claw'' to retain their
dominance in beverage cans and break into food cans, said David
Moisen, container industry analyst for Resource Strategies Inc.
   Alcoa, the nation's largest aluminum producer, recently
announced that instead of boosting can sheet prices as expected
July 1, it would hold the price at $1.15 per pound through the
summer beverage sales season.
   Can sheet prices have climbed about 20 cents per pound over the
last year, while the price of the raw material, aluminling helped clear
the nation's roadsides, portrayed
aluminum makers as concerned citizens, provided a source of income
to Boy Scouts, volunteer firefighters and others and saved the
companies great sums on raw material.
   Aluminum prices, however, have outstripped the savings from
recycling, making steel cheaper as a raw material and as the
finished can, said Frank M. Walker, general manager of tin mill
products for USS.
   Nonetheless, steelmakers realize they need their own can
recycling program.
   ``Clearly without a successful recycling campaign of our own,
the steel industry will be hard-pressed to cash in on its
comparative production cost advantage,'' Graham said last September
at a recycling symposium.
   At that gathering, representatives of 19 steel mills agreed to
accept used cans ``as is,'' without being de-tinned, for remelting.
   ``That may not sound like much ... but that was a significant
step,'' said Robert Paxson, manager of tin mill sales and marketing
for Bethlehem Steel Corp.
   The American Iron and Steel Institute also is organizing a $30
million, six-year effort to promote and operate a recycling system
in an attempt to do for the nation's municipal landfills what the
aluminum industry did for the nation's roadsides, Paxson said.
   Steel has a long row to hoe in the beverage container market.
   Aluminum cans accounted for 96 percent of the nearly 74 billion
beverage cans shipped in the United States in 1987, while steel
accounted for 95 percent of the 28 billion food cans shipped last
year.
   Analysts are dubious about steel's chances for changing that
situation significantly.
   ``There will be some beverage can lines that go to steel,'' but
in reality, steel ``is barely holding on by its fingernails,'' said
Cornelius Thornton, a container industry analyst for First Boston
Corp.
   With plastics, paper and composite materials making inroads in
food containers, ``the steel companies might very well be fighting
the last war,'' said analyst Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch.

   For $3,000 a man can get just about any
shoe he wants, no matter if it's to be made from turkey, baby
shark, elephant or plain old cow.
   Shoemakers Domenick DiMeola and Raymond Robinson will handcraft
men's footwear _ from the bizarre to the banal.
   DiMeola and Robinson, among only a few shoemakers still
producing shoes from scratch, work for the Johnston & Murphy shoe
company in Nashville. The 138-year-old firm is the oldest
manufacturer of men's dress shoes in the country, company officials
say.
   Johnston & Murphy sells machine-made shoes for $130 to $290 but
the handmade versions will cost $1,000 to $3,000, depending on the
materials and variations in the foot.
   DiMeola, 62, is the senior craftsman and learned his trade in
Italy where his father and grandfather were shoemakers. He was born
in Newark, N.J., moved as a toddler with his family to Italy and
returned to New Jersey at age 6.
   When DiMeola began plying his trade, scores of shoemakers could
be found. Now they are a rarity and DiMeola considers himself part
of a passing profession.
   In his melodious accented English, DiMeola said he plans to
retire in a few years which means a replacement has to be found.
Robinson, 47, of Woodbury, who has trained under DiMeola for 17
years, will choose DiMeola's successor.
   As they sit in a workroom filled with shoes and the aroma of
leather, Robinson grimaces at the idea of finding a replacement.
Clearly the two men get along.
   On one side of the cavernous plant, the men work in a shop
surrounded by multi-tiered racks cradling a variety of wingtips,
loafers and golf shoes in various stages of production. DiMeola
jumps up from one of the two rectangular workbenches cluttered with
oddly-shaped tools to show off a pair of spiked golf shoes made for
and worn by Arnold Palmer.
   They say their work requires much skill, patience and attention
to detail. DiMeola has made shoes for such luminaries as Presidents
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter, and talk show
host David Letterman.
   DiMeola says his most unusual customer was the late pianist
Liberace. The flamboyant pianist eschewed the standard leather
shoes the men produce and instead sent DiMeola a piece of cloth
embossed with a piano keyboard. DiMeola used the cloth to create a
pair with the keys running across the toes.
   Robinson says his strangest order was from a man who sent in
turkey skins to be made into a pair of boots. ``He wanted them by
Thanksgiving,'' Robinson said.
   ``It was the worst leather we ever worked with,'' DiMeola chimes
in, adding that the skins were very thin.
   The men no longer produce boots. But they still make $3,000
alligator shoes, and the more bizarre special orders from baby
shark (``awful delicate to work with'') to elephant (``tough, but a
good leather'').
   But no matter the materials or the customer, the men say
everyone gets the same treatment.
   ``I still put the same effort, the same material and the same
workmanship for people like you and me,'' DiMeola says proudly.
   In the recession years of the early 1970s, DiMeola said the
inflated cost of importing leather cut demand for handmade shoes.
But in the last two to three years the demand has increased and
DiMeola and Robinson are overwhelmed with orders.
   ``Normally we stay behind 20 to 30 pair,'' DiMeola said. ``Right
now we are behind 200 pair. We can only make one pair a day. It
takes 19 hours to make a pair.
   ``They (customers) have to wait 12 to 16 weeks normally to get a
pair, but now we are seven months behind,'' he said.
   Special orders, particularly for men who suffer orthopedic
problems, are booming. Out of nearly 300 pairs of shoes the men
made last year, 150 were special orders.
   The special orders can be made to the exact specifications of
the customer's foot and make room for corns, raised bones and other
problems. With proper care, including a rest after every two to
three days of wear, the shoes will last longer and look better than
machine-made footwear, DiMeola says.
   Only one pair of shoes was returned last year, DiMeola says, and
about 1 percent of all shoes they've made have been sent back.
   ``We stand behind our product,'' he says.

of 1988.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.06 to 2,123.04 by

impending dividend payments.
   Otherwise, analysts said investors drew some encouragement from
a drop in bond-market interest rates.
   West German authorities raised some of their key interest rates
today, following a similar move in Britain earlier in the week.
   But investors in the U.S markets took the news in stride,
apparently concluding that the Federal Reserve would not

today as the long July 4 holiday weekend approaches.

   A former officer at Continental Illinois National
Bank and Trust Co. and a former Oklahoma banker accused of
contributing to Continental's near-collapse have agreed to plead
guilty to criminal charges, a prosecutor said today.
   A plea agreement between prosecutors and attorneys for the pair,
John Lytle and William Patterson, was to be entered at 1:30 p.m.
today in federal court, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Duffy.
   ``I can't give any details other than what I've given already,''
Duffy said this morning, adding that the pleas were to be entered
before U.S. District Judge Milton Shadur.
   Lytle, a former vice president who once headed Continental's oil
and gas lending operation in Oklahoma, was accused of buying
millions of dollars in poor-quality loans between 1980 and 1982
from the failed Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City in return for
alleged kickbacks.
   Patterson, former head of energy lending at Penn Square, was
accused of arranging the kickbacks, in the form of unsecured
personal loans to Lytle.
   Penn Square failed in 1982 and Continental nearly failed in 1984
before a massive federal bailout.
   Lytle and Patterson were indicted on charges of wire fraud and
misapplication of bank funds, and went to trial in March. But after
seven weeks, the proceeding ended May 3 when the jury became
deadlocked and Shadur declared a mistrial.

<HEAD>Greeks Take Common Market Lead, Following German Successes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Greece assumes the presidency of the
European Economic Community on Friday midway in a year that has
produced some of the biggest successes in the trade bloc's 31-year
history but still faces friction with the United States over farm
trade.
   The socialist government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou,
which often is out of step with the priorities of its 11 partners
in the EEC _ also known as the Common Market _ takes over the
rotating presidency from West Germany.
   Papandreou is expected to put a heavy accent on efforts to
improve the economic prospects of Europe's poorer and less
industrialized regions, most of which are in Greece, Spain and
Portugal.
   But because of its relatively light diplomatic clout _ and its
sometimes troublesome relations with other EEC members _ Greece is
not expected to win much progress on farm policy reform and other
key issues.
   Indeed, conflict between the Common Market and the United States
over liberalizing farm trade is likely to intensify this fall as
both sides prepare for a special trade negotiating session in
December.
   In its six months at the helm, the West German government
managed to take the EEC further toward economic and financial union
than nearly anyone had thought possible at the start of the year.
   Although many problems remain, the EEC under West German
leadership gained a new impulse toward its most basic goal:
creating a true common market where people, goods and money can
move as freely across national borders as they do across state
lines in the United States.
   This goal _ known in EEC parlance as ``completing the internal
market'' _ has emerged during the first half of 1988 as a lightning
rod for the hopes not only of European governments but businesses
as well. The target date for completing the true common market is
Dec. 31, 1992.
   Greece is expected to press for more progress toward that goal,
but it will have a hard time matching the West German successes,
which were more substantial than in any six-month period since the
EEC heads of government first endorsed the project in June 1985.
   Among the major decisions produced by the German presidency were:
   _Phased removal of all barriers to the free movement of money
across national borders, to be completed by the eight most advanced
EEC members by 1990. This will allow consumers to open bank
accounts and obtain other financial services such as loans in any
member country.
   _Mutual recognition of university diplomas within two years,
allowing all professionals to practice freely anywhere in the
Common Market.
   _Liberalization of road transport by the end of 1992. This will
mean the end of existing bilateral quotas on truck journeys, a
system that produced such absurdities as requiring a Greek truck
carrying wine to get permits to cross West Germany or Italy but not
to enter Holland while the wine itself is subject to no border
restrictions.
   _Agreement by EEC leaders this week to set up a blue-ribbon
panel to study ways of achieving greater European monetary union.
   Despite these advances, independent analysts say the EEC still
will be hard-pressed to meet its 1992 deadline for ending all trade
barriers.
   ``A lot more has to be done,'' said Hugh Corbet, director of the
London-based Trade Policy Research Center. He said it is widely
believed in Western Europe that little progress will be made during
Greece's term.
   In the international arena, the major West German success was
completing years of negotiations with the Soviet-led economic
alliance known as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or
Comecon, on a joint protocol. The socialist bloc has agreed for the
first time to formally recognize the EEC, although no trade pact
has been made.
   One of the key failures of the West German presidency was the
setback of efforts to normalize relations with Turkey, which
applied last year for EEC membership. Greece, which nearly went to
war with Turkey in April 1987 over mineral rights in the Aegean
Sea, is firmly opposed to allowing its ancient enemy to become the
EEC's 13th member.
   The last Greek presidency of the governing EEC Council of
Ministers was marked by bitter disappointment at the failure to
resolve a long-running dispute over Britain's contribution to the
EEC budget.
   This time the Athens government is likely to be spared an acute
budget problem.
   Against seemingly long odds, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
at a special EEC summit in February, forged agreement on a
five-year plan for injecting new funds into the organization and
setting strict limits for the first time on increases in farm
spending.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was narrowly lower in Europe Thurdsay
despite a concerted round of interest rate hikes in several
European countries and continued intervention by the Deutsche
Bundesbank. Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said Thursday's actions appeared to have placed a
near-term cap on the dollar at about 1.8250 West German marks.
   Trading was thin, which exaggerated price movements. Dealers
said that because Thursday was the final day of the first half of
the year, many market players had already closed their books.
   The dollar attracted strong buying interest in early trading and
rose despite interest rate hikes in West Germany, Switzerland,
Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. The increases had been
expected and were already discounted, dealers said.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7085 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7060 late
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8170 West German marks, down from
1.8290; 1.5060 Swiss francs, down from 1.5155; 6.1250 French
francs, down from 6.1635; 2.0530 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0545;
1,350.38 Italian lire, down from 1,350.75; and 1.2126 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2173.
   In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar fell 0.20 yen to a closing
132.20 yen. Later, in London, it rose to 133.40 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $436.40 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's late bid of $433.30. In Zurich, gold
closed at a bid $436.50, compared with $433.50 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 86 cents to close at a bid
$439.18.
   Silver bullion prices were unchanged on the London market where
the metal was trading at a late bid price of $6.66 a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
   A local investment-management company said
Thursday it was cooperating with U.S. officials investigating an
ex-client accused of involvement in a massive insider trading
scheme in the United States.
   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has accused
Taiwanese businessman Fred C. Lee of making $19 million by trading
on tips about impending corporate takeovers given by a junior
analyst on Wall Street.
   Nigel Lester, managing director of Hong Kong-based Federated
International Investment Management (FE) Ltd., said Lee recently
was a client and confirmed that the SEC has interviewed company
employees in the investigation.
   ``The company is cooperating'' with the SEC, said Lester, who
stressed that no allegations have been raised against Federated
International employees.
   SEC officials in Washington said Wednesday that Lee did much of
his allegedly illicit trading through a Federated account. Lester
declined to discuss details of the SEC investigation but said the
company was ``pleased with the way (the talks) are going.''
   Wall Street and SEC sources in the United States have described
Lee, 38, as a wealthy member of a Taiwanese family who had several
trading and bank accounts, interests in real estate, import-export
operations and public utilities. He has homes in Hong Kong and
McLean, Va., a Washington suburb.
   The SEC interviewed Lee in this British colony last Friday but
his whereabouts have been unclear since. ``We can't find Mr. Lee at
the moment. We have no idea where he is,'' Lester said.
   Lester declined to say when Lee became a client. He added,
however, that his company first became aware of the Taiwanese
businessman in 1985, when Lee was briefly general manager of the
newly formed Kuang Hwa Securities Investment and Trust Co. in
Taiwan.
   Federated International, a subsidiary of U.S.-based Aetna Life
and Casualty, has a 10 percent share in Kuang Hwa, said Lester.
   In Taiwan, Kuang Hwa manager Cheng Ming-yuan said Lee resigned
from the company in December 1985 and left for the United States.
Cheng said Lee had helped Kuang Hwa with licence applications and
other start-up work.
   Meanwhile, a leading official of state-run Taiwan Power Co. said
Lee holds shares in the utility worth about $1 million.
   Lee, who is identified as Lee Chuan-hong in Taiwan, is now on
the power company's board and holds about 380,000 shares, according
to a company official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Taiwan Power Co. has about 859 million shares, 94 percent of
which are owned by the government.
   Newspapers in Taiwan have reported that Lee was a major investor
in the local stock market, has high-level political contacts and is
a devout Buddhist.
   The SEC has accused Stephen Wang Jr., 24, a securities analyst
for Morgan Stanley & Co. in the United States, of providing Lee
with privileged information on at least 25 corporate takeovers that
Morgan Stanley handled. The agency says Lee made at least $19
million using the information and gave $200,000 to Wang.
   Lee's attorney, Michael Perlis, has said his client intends to
resist the accusations but has no plans to travel to the United
States. Wang's attorney, Ira L. Sorkin, has declined to comment
thus far on his client's plans.

   Share prices closed higher Thursday in slack
trading on the London Stock Exchange as the second quarter came to
an end.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 2.5
points, or 0.1 percent, higher at 1,857.6.
   The index opened 1.8 points higher and then rose as much as 8.9
points in the late morning before drifting aimlessly lower during
the afternoon.
   Volume was a modest 464.5 million shares, up from Wednesday's
378.0 million.
   The end of the second quarter and the approaching end of the
two-week trading account on Friday brought only very slight buying
and selling, dealers said.
   The exchange divides trading into two-week and three-week
periods for accounting purposes.
   ``A lot of funds are tidying up their books and are not willing
to take new positions,'' said John Sellen, a salesman at Chase
Manhattan Securities in London.
   London equities also dipped after Wall Street failed to provide
any trading stimulus, traders said.
   One London analyst said the market would likely continue to
drift until the Bank of England pushes the commercial banks' base
lending rate up another half percentage point to 10 percent, as the
market widely expects.
   ``July and August are traditionally slow months and until we
have our half-point rise out of the way, no one will put any new
money into this market,'' he said.
   The central bank triggered a half-point increase in the
benchmark lending rate on Tuesday.

   The Supreme Court on Thursday apparently
removed the last legal obstacle to a $180 million settlement
between Vietnam veterans and manufacturers of the herbicide Agent
Orange.
   The court also agreed to consider lawyer advertisements and
alleged race discrimination in Alaskan canneries, let stand a
damages ruling against a major defense contractor, and rejected a
product liability case against an automaker.
   Without commenting on the Agent Orange case, the justices let
stand rulings that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who
challenged the settlement, in which some 120,000 others are
expected to participate.
   The lawsuit filed by the 300 was dismissed when a federal judge
ruled that the Agent Orange manufacturers were immune from being
sued over the alleged health effects of the herbicide.
   The chemical companies sued over making Agent Orange were
Monsanto, Dow, Uniroyal, Hercules, T.H. Agriculture and Nutrition,
Diamond Shamrock and Thompson.
   The ensuing appeals from that ruling had been pending before the
nation's highest court for months, held until a key decision about
government contractors' legal liability.
   Three days ago, the court ruled that government contractors
cannot be sued over government-approved design defects unless the
contractors failed to notify the government about hazards they knew
about.
   The 300 veterans involved in the cases opted out of a ``class
action'' lawsuit that in 1984 ended in a $180 million settlement.
   James Sparrow, director of Vietnam Veterans Agent Orange Victims
Inc. of Stamford, Conn., said, ``It's a major victory for us. This
means that a 10-year battle has ended today and money will be going
out immediately to families of deceased veterans and veterans who
are 100 percent disabled.''
   Agent Orange was sprayed over Southeast Asia during the 1960s by
the U.S. military, which hoped to deprive communist troops of crops
and cover.
   The herbicide contains the highly toxic dioxin, and veterans
contend that exposure to the defoliant causes cancer, miscarriages
by their wives and birth defects in their children.
   In other action, the court:
   _Let stand a ruling that forced defense contractor Grumman
Aerospace Corp. to pay damages for an on-duty accident involving a
Navy pilot in 1979.
   _Allowed California officials to bar airlines from monitoring
phone calls between their ticket reservation agents and customers.
   _Rejected the appeal of a Minnesota woman severely injured in a
1983 car crash, turning away arguments that her car's manufacturer,
Toyota Motor Corp. and its U.S. subsidiaries, negligently failed to
install airbags.
   _Let stand the way cable television operators pay copyright
royalties for retransmitting broadcast programming.
   _Agreed to decide whether states may ban virtually all lawyer
advertisements featuring testimonials or client endorsements.
   _Refused to become involved in a California dispute over the
power of cities to charge fees to companies that operate oil
pipelines under city streets. The court let stand a ruling that
Santa Monica, Calif., may charge Shell Oil Co. $237,000 a year to
carry crude oil through of underground pipeline within the city.
   _Agreed to study alleged race discrimination in Alaskan salmon
canneries in an appeal by canners Wards Cove Packing Co. Inc. of
Seattle, Wash., and Castle & Cooke Inc. of Astoria, Ore.

   South Florida civic leaders placed full-page
newspaper advertisements calling for a truce in Eastern Airlines'
labor wars after executives of the carrier told them the company's
finances were worsening.
   Eastern, the area's largest private employer, has lost almost $1
billion in the past decade. Federal negotiators are helping mediate
secret contract talks between Eastern and its Machinists union,
which has rejected the company's call for deep pay and benefit cuts.
   AmeriFirst Bank Chairman Thomas Bomar said ads were placed in
The Miami Herald and Miami News on Wednesday in response to Eastern
executives telling business leaders that the company's finances
were slipping.
   ``It is making a lot of us very nervous,'' Bomar said.
   The ads in part read, ``Now is the time to bring disputes at the
bargaining table to a prompt and certain resolution for all,
preferably by forging a fair agreement that will allow Eastern to
become a stable and prosperous company.''
   The businessmen who signed the ad included Knight-Ridder Inc.
Chairman Alvah Chapman Jr., Burger King founder James McLamore,
Southeast Banking Corp. Chairman Charles Zwick and the Greater
Miami Chamber of Commerce.
   Besides seeking cuts from its Machinists union, Eastern is
asking its Air Line Pilots Association to accept a contract that
would save the carrier $65 million.
   Eastern welcomed the ad.
   ``We agree with the tone of the ad,'' said Eastern spokeswoman
Karen Ceremsak.
   But Machinsts local officials were annoyed by it.
   ``We are doing all we can in negotiations to get one (contract).
Of course, we are not going to cave in to their terrible demands,''
said Frank Ortis, vice president of the Machinists local.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Continental Illinois National Bank &
Trust Co. officer and an ex-banker from Oklahoma accused of
contributing to Continental's near-collapse pleaded guilty Thursday
to criminal charges.
   John R. Lytle pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds and
William G. Patterson pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting Lytle
during an appearance before U.S. District Judge Milton I. Shadur.
   Shadur had been scheduled to preside over a retrial of the men
in September on charges of wire fraud and misapplication of bank
funds, after the defendants' initial trial ended with a deadlocked
jury two months ago.
   Lytle, 53, a former vice president who once headed Continental's
oil and gas lending operation in Oklahoma, was accused of taking on
millions of dollars in poor-quality loans from customers of Penn
Square Bank of Oklahoma City in return for alleged kickbacks.
   Patterson, 38, former head of energy lending at Penn Square, was
accused of arranging the kickbacks in the form of $585,000 worth of
unsecured personal loans to Lytle between 1980 and 1982.
   Each faces a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a
$5,000 fine, Shadur said.
   The plea agreement reached by prosecutors and defense attorneys
will avert another long trial like the 6{-week proceeding that
ended May 3 when a jury announced it was hopelessly deadlocked
after deliberating five days.
   However, the panel did clear a third defendant in the case _
Oklahoma drilling contractor Jere Sturgis, who was charged with
wire fraud for allegedly participating in a purported scheme to
defraud Continental.
   ``As far as we're concerned, this is it. This puts to rest the
Continental Bank chapter, book, encyclopedia, whatever you want to
call it,'' assistant U.S. Attorney Joesph Duffy said after Shadur
accepted the plea agreement.
   ``The object was justice, and we think there's justice in the
guilty plea,'' he said, adding that prosecutors felt it would not
be in the public's interest to go through another long trial.
   Shadur last month approved a retrial of Lytle and Patterson at
the request of prosecutors, who cited that fact that 11 jurors had
voted to convict the pair and only one had held out for acquittal.
   ``We are looking forward to geting all this behind Mr. Lytle
after a long, long road,'' said James Streicker, Lytle's attorney.
   ``I feel we've come to an agreement that's fair to everyone,''
Lytle said.
   Penn Square failed in 1982, and Continental came close to
collapse two years later after the largest run on deposits in
banking history. The government kept Continental's doors open with
a $4.5 billion bailout.
   Prosecutors charged that Patterson manipulated Lytle and Sturgis
in schemes to save his own failing bank.
   The government accused Lytle, caught in spiraling personal debt
to finance a luxurious lifestyle, of accepting kickbacks from
Patterson in exchange for buying risky energy loans from Penn
Square for Continental.
   The indictment cited Lytle's involvement in $44 million in loans
made by Continental to 12 Penn Square customers, many without
documentation. It did not say how much was recovered by the Chicago
bank.
   Attorneys for Lytle and Patterson contended Continental was
saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive
lending policy, not because of a fraud scheme.
   Sentencing was set for Aug. 30.

<HEAD>Computer Associates Still Wants To Buy MSA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer Associates International Inc., the
giant software company, still wants to buy Atlanta-based Management
Science America Inc., its president said Thursday.
   ``We generally like to complete what we start,'' said Anthony
Wang, president of Computer Associates, the Garden City, N.Y.-based
company that has grown into the world's biggest independent
software company.
   At its annual shareholders' meeting Monday, Management Science
America said its directors rejected an offer of $11.50 a share, or
$191 million, from Computer Associates.
   Wang said Computer Associates was weighing its options, but
said, ``I think if you look at our track record of acquisitions,
we're not fooling around in the game.''
   Acquisitions are responsible for a large part of the growth that
has made Computer Associates bigger than such better-known
companies as Microsoft Corp. and Lotus Development Corp.
   Management Science adjourned its annual meeting until July 12 to
give shareholders more time to think about some items on its agenda
in light of the offer from Computer Associates.
   Among the items up for a vote is a proposal that would give
directors more latitude in deciding that a potential acquirer was
unsuitable.
   Management Science specializes in financial software packages
for mainframe computers. Computer Associates sells programs for
computers of all sizes, and Wang said Management Science products
would fit well with its product line.
   Management Science reshuffled its top management earlier this
year, leading to the resignation of 12 officers, and reduced
worldwide employment by 350 people, or about 12 percent of its work
force.
   The company earned $2.4 million in the first quarter on $62.9
million in operating revenue. In 1987 it had a narrow loss of
$221,000 on revenue of $258 million.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
sharply higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain ended
in the Farm Belt and drought fears held sway in the markets.
   Wheat futures turned in the strongest performance, with most
contracts advancing the expanded 30-cents-a-bushel daily limit. The
rally was driven by concern about further drought damage to the
spring wheat crop in the northern Great Plains and worries that
heavy rain in the central and southern Plains would hamper progress
on the winter wheat harvest, analysts said.
   Indications of new wheat export business also supported wheat
futures, said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc.
in Chicago.
   Some oat and soybean contracts also posted limit gains, and
prices for July delivery of all grains and soybeans were allowed to
soar freely. The exchange removed limits on the July contracts
Wednesday in a routine action linked to their upcoming expiration.
   The National Weather Service's 30-day outlook, issued Wednesday
after the close of trading, was a major bullish factor, analysts
said.
   ``They're calling for almost no rainfall from Illinois east to
Ohio and higher-than-normal temperatures in Iowa, Illinois and
Missouri, the three biggest soybean states,'' Karlin said. ``That's
one area that really needs rain.''
   At the close, wheat was 24{ cents to 34{ cents higher with July
at $3.88 a bushel; corn was 8} cents to 19 cents higher with July
at $3.28 a bushel; oats were 6 cents to 18 cents higher with July
at $3.53 a bushel; soybeans were 35 cents to 69 cents higher with
July at $10 a bushel.

<HEAD>Monsanto Announces Plan to Reduce Emissions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monsanto Co. plans to reduce air emissions from
its worldwide hazardous chemicals operations by 90 percent over the
next five years, the company announced Thursday.
   Monsanto Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard J. Mahoney
said at a news conference that the company was making the move even
though its current emission levels are well within safety
guidelines.
   ``The best scientific and medical data available indicate that
the emissions we are reporting (to the Environmental Protection
Agency) do not pose a health risk in our plant communities,''
Mahoney said. ``However, the public expects no less than a maximum
effort to reduce emissions, nor should we.''
   Monsanto has nearly 50 plants worldwide, with 30 of them in the
United States.
   Hal Corbett, Monsanto's senior vice president for safety and
health, said the program's target date for completion is Dec. 31,
1992.
   ``At present,'' Corbett said, ``we have the technology in hand
to achieve a portion of the 1992 target. The rest must come from as
yet undeveloped technologies, which we intend to find and put into
practice.''
   Because the technology does not yet exist, Corbett said, there
was no way to put a price tag on the program.
   ``But right now we are spending $200 million each year'' on
pollution control, he said.
   The company also estimated its three chemical plants in the St.
Louis area combined to produce 4.4 million pounds of air emissions
in 1987. The EPA requires companies to report their emissions
annually by July 1.
   ``The emissions numbers may sound large, since they're being
reported in annual totals,'' said Dr. Barry Friedlander, Monsanto's
director of medical and health sciences. ``But even in the areas
closest to our plants, emissions are well within the limits
considered safe.''

<TEXT>
   Union Pacific Railroad said Thursday it will
close its aging Omaha repair shops and shift the operations to its
four-year-old shops in North Little Rock, Ark.
   Railroad officials said most of the 770 workers in the
locomotive and car shops in Omaha would be offered transfers to
Arkansas or elsewhere starting at the end of September.
   Jerry Davis, the railroad's executive vice president for
operations, said most workers will be offered transfers to North
Little Rock or elsewhere in the railroad system, which spans the
western half of the United States.
   Davis announced the decision to reporters at the railroad's
headquarters while employees were being informed. Railroad Chairman
Michael Walsh briefed union leaders on the change at a meeting in
Kansas City.
   Davis said the move to North Little Rock was for reasons of
economic efficiency to keep the railroad competitive in the
transportation industry. Closing the Omaha shops will bring a $7
million one-time savings and will save $2 million a year
thereafter, the railroad said.
   The Omaha shops operate at 25 percent of capacity while the
North Little Rock shops _ started by Missouri Pacific Railroad
before it merged with Union Pacific _ are using 35 percent of
capacity.
   ``When a shop that's 75 years old, that is in about nine
different buildings, tries to compete with a shop built four years
ago with the latest technology available in our industry, it's
quite evident why productivity is better in North Little Rock than
it is in Omaha,'' Davis said. ``When you read these numbers, you'll
see that we had absolutely no choice but to make this decision.''
   When operations are consolidated in North Little Rock, the shops
will be operating at 60 percent of capacity, he said.
   Union Pacific does major repairs on locomotives and rail cars at
the Omaha and North Little Rock shops. Similar repairs are done at
Union Pacific shops in Salt Lake City and Fort Worth, Texas, and
Davis said the railroad has no plans to close either of them.
   When asked if the railroad was considering closing them, he
said, ``I would consider anything to save money.''
   Reporters asked Davis if the decision to close the Omaha shops
foretold a long-rumored move of the railroad's headquarters from
the city.
   ``At the present, we have no plans to do that,'' Davis said.
   Davis stressed that the move from Omaha was not related to the
Nebraska business climate.
   ``The closure of the shop has nothing to do with that
environment. It has to do with the age of the shop and the
overcapacity of the railroad,'' he said.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr said the state was disappointed by the
railroad's decision, but she said she understood the reasons for it.
   Omaha Mayor Walt Calinger said he was disappointed too, but he
said the loss of jobs would be somewhat offset by a new dispatching
center the railroad plans for an old freight warehouse near
downtown.
   Davis said he did not know how many employees at the Omaha shops
would accept transfers.
   ``The decision to do this is a key decision,'' he said. ``It
greatly affects our employees. We want to make sure we do the right
thing.''
   The railroad said about 90 percent of the 469 people in the
Omaha locomotive repair shop will be offered transfers to North
Little Rock while the rest will be offered jobs in North Platte,
Neb., and Salt Lake City.
   Of the 307 workers in the car shop in Omaha, about 100 will be
offered transfers to Pocatello, Idaho; about 140 will get offers to
go to DeSoto, Mo.; and about 15 will be offered transfers to
Palestine, Texas.
   The 34 positions in the Omaha shops' purchasing and materials
operation will be eliminated. About 40 workers will remain in Omaha
for about a year and a half to complete a specialized repair job.
   Davis said railroad officials did not know what would happen to
the Omaha shops after operations are closed. The buildings are on
235 acres near downtown, Eppley Airfield and the Missouri River.
   The railroad said the Omaha shops represent 10 percent of its
$235 million annual payroll in Nebraska.

   Assets of the nation's 440 money market mutual
funds fell $1.93 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $264.36 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised increase of $923.8 million in the
funds' assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group.
   That increase originally was reported as $908.7 million.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 220 general purpose funds fell $390 million to $81.44
billion, assets of 98 broker-dealer funds fell $689 million to
$112.8 billion, and assets of 122 institutional funds fell $851.3
million to $70.1 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.62 percent from 6.56 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.52 percent from 6.46 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
35 days, down from 36 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts rose to 5.74 percent as of
Wednesday from 5.73 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.12
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.11 percent
the previous week. Yields were 7.47 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
7.45 percent; 7.84 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.83 percent;
and 8.26 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged.

   The dollar closed narrowly mixed Thursday in
uneventful trading.
   Gold prices also were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted gold at $435.10 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down 20 cents
from late Wednesday.
   ``The change (in the dollar) wasn't big enough to matter,'' said
Jim Paul, director of futures research at the investment firm Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``If it lost any ground, it
probably was more a reaction to the sharp gains the dollar has
had.''
   The dollar has spurted higher in recent sessions, and traders
attributed its advance to an increasing perception that the major
industrialized democracies are willing to tolerate a more expensive
U.S. currency.
   In Europe, where the dollar edged downward Wednesday, dealers
said the U.S. currency held its own despite interest rate hikes in
West Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands.
The increases had been expected and were already discounted,
dealers said.
   The West German central bank again sold dollars in favor of the
mark, dealers said.
   Trading was thin. Dealers noted that because Thursday was the
final day of the first half of the year, many traders had already
closed their books.

<HEAD>Friday Deadline for Companies To Report 1987 Chemical Releases</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: EPA has a hotline for companies that need information about
the law, 800-535-0202; Also moved on general newswires</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new age in environmental monitoring begins
Friday.
   It's the deadline under a 1986 law for 30,000 industrial
installations to file with federal and state authorities an
estimated 1.5 million pages reporting all their releases of 328
hazardous chemicals to the environment in 1987.
   The Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to put the
information into a data base that anyone with a personal computer
and a telephone modem can query. That system won't be up and
running until sometime next year.
   Environmental groups are hoping it will build pressure for
tighter restrictions on future emissions of dangerous chemicals.
There is less concern about releases to waterways or the ground,
already closely monitored under other laws.
   Backers saw the ``community right to know'' provisions as a
response to the Bhopal, India, disaster in 1984 in which about
3,000 people were killed by an escaping cloud of methyl isocyanate,
a pesticide raw material.
   But industry, government and environmental groups are all
worried that many small businesses don't realize they are covered
by the law, which provides fines of up to $25,000 a day for failure
to comply.
   ``I think there's a lot of misunderstanding out there,''
especially among companies that think they are exempt because they
are not chemical manufacturers, said Mary Bernhard, manager of
environmental policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   ``I got a tremendous number of calls from food processing
companies,'' said Theresa Pugh of the National Association of
Manufacturers. ``They didn't realize they were covered, but they do
a lot of cleaing of vats with really strong solvents to keep down
bacteria.''
   Paint-using industries also seem unaware, she said.
   The reporting requirements apply to companies in the Commerce
Department's standard industrial classiciations 20 through 39,
manufacturers of all kinds that have 10 or more employees and meet
quantity thresholds: initially 75,000 pounds a year manufactured or
``processed'' of any of the 328 chemicals _ perhaps as a raw
material _ or 10,000 pounds a year ``used'' _ perhaps as a cleaning
material.
   ``What impressed me was the large size of the numbers,'' said Ed
Hopkins of the Ohio Public Interest Campaign, who inspected the
first 70 forms arriving at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
in Columbus two weeks ago.
   ``One hundred thousand pounds of hydrochloric acid from one
small facility in northeastern Ohio _ I think that's a lot.''
   Even larger numbers are going to be heard. An estimated 2.2
billion pounds a year of toluene, a common petrochemical, are
released to the air nationwide each year.
   ``I don't know what the public reaction is going to be. I would
hope people are going to be so shocked they will call for further
controls,'' said Bill Klinefelter, a lobbyist with the National
Wildlife Federation.
   The chemical industry has been visiting newspaper offices for
months to place its side of the story before editors.
   Many companies have been releasing the forms to local media
outlets, and environmentalists say they are eager to ``put their
own spin on the numbers,'' according to Debbie Sheiman of the Clean
Air Coalition, a group of environmental and other organizations.
   Chris Cathcart of the Chemical Manufacturers Association said he
would give this advice to to any citizen coming across news of
releases in the community: ``If the way the information is reported
gives him concern, he should ask questions of someone he has
confidence in.''
   ``It's too early'' to conclude that new laws are needed, he said.
   EPA's Sam Sassnet, part of the team dealing with the incoming
reports, said 10,000 pieces of mail had been received.
   For people interested in looking up a plant from their
neighborhood, ``Their first recourse is to go to the state,'' he
said.
   In September, EPA hopes to be able to mail copies of any
particular form to people requesting it; later this month it hopes
to open a reading room which will gradually fill with reports as
documents are logged in.

<HEAD>Money Supply Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in mid-June, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,018 billion in the week ended June 20 from $3,013
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,803 billion from $3,794 billion.
   The narowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $778.6 billion from a revised $771.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for
M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The Fed
has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $561 million in
the week ended June 22, compared with a gain of $952 million a week
earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said discount window borrowings from the
Federal Reserve System, excluding extended credit, averaged $541
million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from $498 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled an estimated
$586 million in the two weeks ended Wednesday, up from a revised
$214 million in the previous two weeks.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $279.5 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $278.2 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Surge On Dry-Weather Forecasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rose sharply Thursday, abruptly
ending a two-day decline as rain tapered off in the Farm Belt and
drought fears regained the upper hand on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   On other markets, livestock and meat traders were startled by a
government report of big grain stocks; energy futures fell;
precious metals were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   The National Weather Service's latest 30-day outlook, issued
late Wednesday, gave a big boost to grain and soybean futures,
analysts said.
   ``They're calling for almost no rainfall from Illinois east to
Ohio and higher-than-normal temperatures in Iowa, Illinois and
Missouri, the three biggest soybean states,'' said Joel Karlin,
research analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago. ``That's
one area that really needs rain.''
   Wheat futures turned in the strongest performance, with most
contracts advancing the expanded 30 cents-a-bushel daily limit.
   The rally was driven by concern about further drought damage to
the spring wheat crop in the northern Great Plains and worries that
Wednesday's heavy rains in the central and southern Plains would
hamper progress on the winter wheat harvest, Karlin said.
   Rich Feltes, director of commodity research with Refco Inc. in
Chicago, said the recent sharp rise in corn and soybean meal prices
has made wheat more attractive as a livestock feed and sparked
fears of a physical shortage of wheat.
   ``There is not enough wheat in 1988-89 for both animals and
humans,'' Feltes said. ``We've got to do something quickly to
provide an economic disincentive for wheat feeding.'' In other
words, wheat prices must rise, he said.
   Some oat and soybean contracts also posted limit gains, and
prices for July deliveries of all grains and soybeans soared
freely. The exchange removed limits on the July contracts Wednesday
in a routine action linked to their upcoming expiration.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department issued its monthly
grain stocks report, which showed larger-than-expected U.S. stocks
of corn, wheat and soybeans as of June 1.
   Analysts pronounced the report bearish but said weather factors
likely would continue to dominate the grain trade.
   Wheat settled 27{ cents to 33{ cents higher with July at $3.87 a
bushel; corn was 8\ cents to 18 cents higher with July at $3.27 a
bushel; oats were 7} cents to 18 cents higher with July at $3.53 a
bushel; soybeans were 24{ cents to 55 cents higher with July at
$9.86 a bushel.
   The USDA also issued its monthly hogs and pigs report, which
surprised observers with its larger-than-expected estimate of the
nation's hog herd as of June 1. The report also showed a sharply
higher tally of pigs born from March through May than most analysts
had expected, and it indicated hog producers intended to breed a
relatively large number of sows through November.
   The report was called bearish for futures prices, but analysts
noted that it reflected breeding intentions prior to this month's
sharp rise in feed-grain prices. Producers likely will reduce their
breeding plans in light of the higher hog-production costs,
analysts said.
   ``It's kind of hard to look at the corn and soybean prices we've
got right now and believe producers are going to breed at these
levels over the next six months,'' said Tom O'Hare, an analyst with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York. ``That would be like
the stock market rallying to new highs with the prime rate just
having increased 10 points.''
   In trading ahead of the report, live cattle settled .30 cent
lower to .43 cent higher with August at 64.60 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .20 cent to 1.05 cents lower with August at 73.97 cents
a pound; hogs were .25 cent to 1.18 cents higher with July at 46.32
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .53 cent lower to .63 cent
higher with July at 37.25 cents a pound.
   Oil prices dropped in fairly active trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after Egypt announced it was lowering its crude
export prices for the first half of July.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 27 cents to 33 cents lower
with August at $15.16 a barrel; heating oil was .64 cent to 1.04
cents lower with July at 40.88 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .68 cent to 1.23 cents lower with July at 51.94 cents a gallon.
   Gold retreated slightly while silver advanced a bit in light
trading on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold settled 40 cents to $1.10 lower with August at $437.70 a
troy ounce; silver was 5.3 cents to 7.4 cents higher with July at
$6.678 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled 2.30 points higher at 275.40.

<HEAD>Payless Cashways Approves Management Buyout</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS 6th graf to UPDATE with closing stock price.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Payless Cashways Inc.'s board of
directors on Thursday approved a $909 million offer from senior
management to take the building supplies company private in a
leveraged buyout.
   Management will pay $27 a share in cash for the company's 33.66
million outstanding shares, higher than the $26-a-share offer the
group unveiled last week.
   Payless spokeswoman Maureen Burgess said the higher offer
resulted from ``negotiations between the special board commitee and
the management group'' and included the settlement of ``certain
litigation.''
   The buyout was an apparent effort to discourage unwanted
attention from New York investor Asher B. Edelman, who had built a
stake in the company and indicated he might be interested in making
a formal takeover offer.
   Edelman partner Corey Horowitz said his group is monitoring the
situation carefully and awaiting details of the management offer
before deciding ``what the best course of action is.'' He did not
rule out making a takeover bid.
   In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Payless rose
$1 a share to close at $26.50.
   A special committee of independent directors and the Payless
board approved the offer at a meeting at the company's headquarters
in Kansas City.
   ``We believe our proposal to acquire Payless Cashways serves the
best interest of all the company's constituents,'' said Payless
Chairman David Stanley in a statement.
   ``The company's shareholders will receive full and fair value
for their investment, and for employees and customers, Payless will
continue as a strong, independent leader in the building materials
retail industry,'' he added.
   The acquisition will be made through a tender offer that will
begin ``as soon as practicable,'' the company said in a statement.
In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy a company
and then pay off the debt with the target company's cash flow or
the sale of its assets.
   Payless said the transaction will involve ``a substantial number
of employees, including all store managers, as equity
participants.'' Over the next three years, more than 300 employees
will receive stock options representing up to 15 percent of the
company's common equity.
   ``The key people to Payless' performance will now have a large
equity stake in the company's future,'' Stanley said.
   He added that Payless does not plan to ``sell off parts of the
company.'' He noted that a handful of the company's 200 retail
outlets that does not meet minimum profitability levels might be
closed, but that is exclusive of the buyout plan.
   Payless is a building materials specialty retailer that services
the home improvement, maintenance and repair market. The company's
stores are located in 26 states in the Midwest, Southwest, Pacific
Coast and New England areas.
   Edelman and his partners, who once held a 9.9 percent stake in
Payless, now control about 8.1 percent of the company's shares. The
group complained earlier this week that it was denied access to
important financial information about Payless that could have been
used to formulate an offer.
   In addition to Edelman, the investor group also includes Payless
competitor Sutherland Lumber Southwest Inc., a privately owned
company that operates about 86 building materials stores in Midwest
and Southern states.
   Payless has been the subject of takeover talk for about three
months.
   The management group takeover is led by Stanley; Larry Kunz,
president of Payless Cashways; Melvin and Harold Cohen, co-chairmen
of Somerville Lumber, a Payless subsidiary; and Payless Cashway's
five senior vice presidents.
   At the time of the company's last proxy statement on Feb. 25,
the group headed by Stanley owned less than 2 percent of the
company's stock.
   Earlier this week two Payless shareholders filed suit against
the company and its directors challenging the initial $26-a-share
offer, which the shareholders called a ``fraudulently low and
unfair price.'' As part of the final deal, the suit has been
settled.
   Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
are leading the financing effort, providing a $600 million loan. A
number of other financial institutions are participating.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished higher Thursday in thin
trading, supported by favorable sentiment surrounding the dollar.
   The Treasury's key 30-year issue was up nearly $6 per $1,000 in
face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price and is a
possible signal of other interest rate trends, declined to 8.85
percent from 8.92 percent late Wednesday.
   Bond prices opened higher and held their ground throughout the
trading session. Analysts noted, however, that few investors were
active in the credit markets.
   Many already had squared their positions ahead of the end of the
quarter, while others had already left to get a jump on the long
Independence Day weekend.
   Bond traders initially were encouraged that the dollar's value
did not decline significantly after the West German central bank
hiked a key interest rate, which theoretically makes the West
German mark worth more.
   Belgium and the Netherlands also raised key interest rates,
following the West German move.
   The dollar's value is closely watched in the credit markets
because it directly affects bond values. A stronger dollar attracts
foreign capital and boosts bond prices, while a weaker dollar
discourages foreigners from investing in the United States, incites
higher inflation and erodes bond prices.
   Although the dollar declined later in New York trading, bond
prices failed to retreat in what one analyst called ``a strange
phenomenon.''
   ``I don't see bonds reacting to anything understandable,'' said
Robert Brusca, chief economist and senior vice president at Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc.
   He said that despite the dollar's weaker finish in New York,
``there seems to be better underlying sentiment'' toward the U.S.
currency that helped to support bond prices.
   Elizabeth Reiners, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., also noted that traders are beginning to realize that the
Treasury may not sell 30-year bonds at the regular quarterly
refunding in August.
   ``That can raise prices because of a lack of supply,'' she said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose 1-16 point to 3-16 point, intermediate
maturities rose 3-16 point to 15-32 point, and long-term issues
gained 15-32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc.,
a financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a $10 change in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.18 to 110.21. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 3.15
to 1,153.16.
   Municipal issues rose. In corporate trading, industrials and
utilities also rose. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index,
which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with
maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.53 to 285.03.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were off 2 basis points at
6.55 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills fell 1 basis point to 6.70 percent and year bills
fell 4 basis points to 6.97 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8\ percent, up from 7} percent
late Wednesday.

   Quaker State Corp. named Jack W. Corn as

   Corn replaces Quentin E. Wood, who is retiring as chief
executive officer but continuing as chairman of the board, the
motor oil company said.
   Corn's appointment is in line with the transfer of top
management recommended to the board of directors at the company's
annual meeting in May.
   At that time, Corn was named president and chief operating
officer. Corn will assume his new post Friday and relinquish the
title of chief operating officer, which will no longer be in use.
   On Wednesday Ardshiel Inc., a New York investment firm, said it
withdrew its takeover offer of $695 million, or $26.50 a share, for
Quaker State.
   Dennis McCormick, an Ardshiel senior managing partner, said the
firm reviewed its options and for many reasons decided to withdraw
the offer made April 8.

<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. officials are denying allegations
that the international soft drink company paid bribes to gain
access to markets in the Soviet Union.
   Coca-Cola Chairman Roberto C. Goizueta on Wednesday distributed
a memo to employees saying an internal investigation uncovered no
wrongdoing by Coke workers, said company spokesman Carlton Curtis.
   The same day, President Donald Keough confirmed that Coca-Cola
is being investigated by a federal grand jury for possible
violation of the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which
prohibits American companies or individuals from bribing foreigners
or political parties in order to get or keep business.
   Keough denied the allegations.
   ``The simple fact is _ and you know it _ the Coca-Cola Co. has
not, does not and will not pay bribes to Soviet officials or to
anyone else,'' Keough said in his keynote address Wednesday at an
East-West trade conference in Atlanta sponsored by Coca-Cola.
   He also said the company is ``cooperating fully with appropriate
authorities,'' and he is sure Coca-Cola will be vindicated.
   The Soviet Union's chief trade representative in the United
States, Oleg V. Kozhevnikov, was at the conference. He said he had
informed his government of the investigation but did not know
whether the Soviets would launch their own inquiry.
   Kozhevnikov, who is attached to the Soviet embassy in
Washington, said the investigation will not affect Soviet relations
with Coca-Cola.
   Coca-Cola's argreement with the Soviets calls for the company to
sell soft drink concentrate manufactured at its plant in Drogheda,
Ireland, to the Soviet Union.
   Concentrate is shipped to 11 cities in the Soviet Union where
Coke is bottled and sold, said Coke spokesman Randy Donaldson. The
Soviet Union owns the bottling plants.

   American Airlines has created a new
division responsible for marketing the carrier's operations,
research and consulting skills to other businesses, company
officials said Thursday.
   Donald J. Carty, American's senior vice president for finance
and planning, said the division, called American Airlines Decision
Technologies, is comprised of the airline's former Operations
Research Department.
   Thomas M. Cook, who was the managing director for Operations
Research, will take over the new division.
   ``American Airlines Decision Technologies is an analytical
consulting group that specializes in applying technology to
decision-making,'' Cook said.
   In 1987, the Operations Research division of the airline, under
Cook, obtained a number of notable contracts, including a computer
modeling contract with the Federal Aviation Administration and a
yield management contract with Amtrak.
   Cook said the establishment of the new division will market the
airline's product better and also assist with internal operations.

   Developer Edward DeBartolo says that over the
next decade, he and his new partner Robert Campeau could be
spending more than $1 billion annually, opening as many as 10
shopping centers a year in the United States.
   The partnership, which has turned the U.S. retailing and real
estate industries on their ears, foresees the construction of five
to 10 centers a year beginning in about two years, DeBartolo told
Campeau Corp.'s annual meeting Thursday.
   ``I think he's a pretty exciting guy and he's got a lot of
guts,'' DeBartolo said of Campeau after the jam-packed meeting.
   DeBartolo, a new Campeau director, helped the Toronto-based
company complete the biggest takeover in U.S. history outside the
oil industry with the purchase in May of Federated Department
Stores Inc. for $6.6 billion.
   He loaned Campeau about $480 million for the Federated purchase
in return for more than 50 percent of his U.S. holding company,
Campeau Corp. U.S.
   Campeau, who spent part of the meeting fending off concerns
about the company's debt, said later that he and DeBartolo would
share financing for any future shopping center projects in the
United States.
   Although Campeau built his fortune in Canada, he is focusing his
attention on improving profit prospects for Federated and Allied
Stores, bought in 1986 for $3.6 billion.
   In return for a commitment to anchor new shopping malls with
prestige Allied and Federated department stores such as
Bloomingdale's, Campeau can bargain with developers for substantial
equity interests in their malls.
   That gives Campeau and DeBartolo enormous clout in mapping
shopping center development in the United States.
   ``Let's say they're uncomfortable,'' DeBartolo told reporters
when asked how competitors feel about his new partner.
   Meanwhile, the feisty Campeau, sporting a bandage on his left
hand from a squash game mishap, acknowledged that the first quarter
for the retailing industry was not good, but insisted his company's
balance sheet will be in good shape by the end of the year.
   ``We're ready and set to go,'' said a beaming Campeau. ``No one
can stop us now except ourselves.''
   Campeau President Jim Roddy said the sell-off of assets that do
not fit the company's strategy has reduced debt significantly. The
company wants to keep only key strategic properties in high-growth
centers in both the United States and Canada.
   ``It's a debt level we're comfortable with,'' Roddy said.
   The company is saddled with $3.68 billion in long-term debt and
must find ways of paying off an extra $6.2 billion in loans used to
buy Federated.
   Campeau said he expects that the sale of the profitable Ann
Taylor division of Allied Stores should be complete within 90 days,
although a buyer has not emerged.
   Campeau also plans to sell two other Federated specialty chains
_ Children's Place and Main Street _ as well as its Gold Circle
discount store chain.
   The company announced the sale of 37 properties in Ottawa for
about 100 million Canadian dollars to Toronto-based Bramalea Ltd.
this week. Earlier in June, it sold five office buildings and
shopping malls to Laing Property Corp. of Vancouver for 180 million
Canadian dollars.
   However, Campeau said the company doesn't expect to sell any
more assets in Canada. And it won't sell shopping centers in the
United States.
   ``The best part of real estate is shopping centers,'' he noted.
   Campeau sold Allied's Brooks Brothers for $750 million and the
company noted that that represented a pretax gain of $350 million
in a period of 18 months.
   The company has also cut costs by consolidating some operations
and laying off more than 3,500 employees in the United States. Last
year, it sold land holdings in southern California for $100 million.
   The company reported operating profits of $57 million on revenue
of $745 million for the first quarter ended April 30, compared with
$59 million in earnings on sales of $596 million for the three
months ended March 31, 1987.
   However, the company noted that revenue was not comparable
because of the change in the reporting period and the addition of
new stores.

   The Navy on Thursday announced the award of a
$2.9 billion contract for the construction of two nuclear-powered
Nimitz class aircraft carriers to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry
Dock Co. of Newport News, Va.
   Completion of the carriers, due before June 1998, would bring
the Navy's fleet of flattops to 15.
   The Navy already is sailing four of the Nimitz class carriers,
which are the largest in the world _ 1,092 feet long and displacing
91,500 tons fully loaded.
   Two other carriers of the class, the Abraham Lincoln and the
George Washington, are under construction. The Lincoln is to be
completed by the end of next year and the Washington by the end of
1991, said Navy spokesman Lt. Brian Cullin.
   One of the two ships contracted for Thursday, the CVN-74, has
been named the John C. Stennis, after the Democratic senator from
Mississippi, and the other is so far known only as the CVN-75,
Cullin said.
   The first carrier of the class, the Nimitz, was commissioned in
1968.
   Cullin said Newport News Shipbuilding is the only shipyard in
the United States that has the capability to construct the carriers
``in the time frame required.''

<HEAD>Hunts' Trust Estates, Creditors Agree To $750 Million Repayment
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT ROTHSCHILD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The billionair Hunt brothers' estates and creditor
banks have agreed on a $750 million payment plan to settle lawsuits
over bank debts held by the Hunts' Penrod Drilling Co., the estates
announced Thursday.
   In addition, a reorganization plan for the foundation of the
Hunt brothers wealth, Placid Oil Co., ``is just around the
corner,'' according to Tom Whitaker, vice president of Hunt Energy
Corp.
   A bankruptcy reorganization plan filed with U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Harold Abramson's court would resolve all issues surrounding
the loans to Penrod by First Chicago, Citicorp, and Manufacturers
Hanover Trust, said Whitaker.
   It also would bring the Hunt trust estates, which own Penrod in
partnership, out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors.
   Under the agreement, the banks would get a conditional 50
percent ownership interest in Penrod, the world's biggest
independent offshore oil-drilling company, subject to purchase by
the Hunts.
   Penrod and its sister company, Placid Oil Co., sued 23 of their
lenders for fraud and misrepresentation in 1986 after defaulting on
$1.5 billion in bank loans. Two of the banks since have been
dropped from the case.
   The suit alleged that the banks conspired to drive Penrod and
Placid out of business by forcing them to agree to an unreasonable
payment schedule while offering their competitors more favorable
terms.
   In August 1986, the trust estates of William Herbert, Nelson
Bunker and Lamar Hunt filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for
the trust partnership that owns Penrod Drilling. Penrod itself was
not under bankruptcy court protection.
   Placid also is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and for
now will continue pursuing claims against its 16 banks involving
$773.3 million in loans.
   Under the consensual plan filed Thursday, bank creditors will
receive a $50 million payment and a $500 million secured note from
Penrod Drilling. The banks also will receive a 50 percent interest
in the company, which is subject to purchase by the trust estates.
   In addition, some trust real estate will be transferred to the
banks subject to a $200 million purchase option.
   When the reorganization is complete, the trust estates would be
released from prior liability to their bank creditors. The banks,
trust estates and individual members of the Hunt family also would
drop claims and counter claims stemming from the bank loans.
   ``When approved by the court, this plan by the trust estates and
their bank creditors settles all issues surrounding the bank loans
to Penrod Drilling Corp....'' the Hunt estates said in a statement.
   Whitaker said the agreement would not affect the day-to-day
operation of Penrod.
   Whitaker said there was no timetable to the repayment plan. He
said the plan must gain bankruptcy court approval, but said that
since both sides of the dispute agree to it, he foresees no
difficulties.
   Bank creditors and trustees have been negotiating a plan to
repay the outstanding debt since 1986.
   Penrod employs about 2,300 workers and will have revenue of more
than $250 million this year, he said.

   Stock prices ran up a broad gain Thursday with a
lift from declining interest rates, capping off an erratic but
generally upbeat first half of 1988.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 19.73 to 2,141.71.
The average finished the first half of the year with a gain of
202.88 points, or 10.46 percent.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with

trading strategies based on their impending dividend payments.
   Otherwise, analysts said investors drew some encouragement from
a drop in bond-market interest rates.
   West German authorities raised some of their key interest rates
Thursday, following a similar move in Britain earlier in the week.
   But investors in the U.S markets took the news in stride,

   Allegheny International Inc. and a dissident
shareholder group that failed to take control of the company's
13-member board in a proxy fight agreed Thursday to stop their
legal wrangling.
   Attorneys for Allegheny International and Spear Leeds & Kellogg,
a New York brokerage house that led the effort to gain control of
the consumer products company's board, announced the settlement
Thursday to Chief Bankruptcy Judge Joseph Cosetti.
   The agreement came after several hours of negotiations between
Spear Leeds and Allegheny International, which is reorganizing
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy law protection.
   Allegheny International agreed to drop its claim that a comittee
of equity shareholders led by Spear Leeds had no right to engage in
the proxy fight. It also agreed to drop a motion seeking removal of
Spear Leeds from the committee.
   The shareholders committee agreed to drop a motion seeking to
disqualify Buchanan Ingersoll as legal counsel for Allegheny
International over alleged conflicts of interest.
   The settlement was negotiated after it became apparent Allegheny
International retained control of its board, according to
preliminary results released by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.,
the proxy contest judge.
   Preliminary results indicated the Spear Leeds group won five of
the company's 13 board seats. Two of Allegheny International's
nominees, including Chairman Oliver S. Travers, were elected to the
board. The company's chief operating officer, Thomas Albani, was
not re-elected.

   FBI agents eavesdropped as a Navy procurement
official read to a private defense consultant the sealed bids from
10 companies competing for a $120 million air control contract,
court documents disclosed Thursday.
   In a 27-page affidavit for a search warrant for the
office-at-home of consultant Mark C. Saunders in suburban Virginia,
FBI agent Joanne T. Burns said court-ordered wiretaps and office
bugging devices captured the relay of confidential, inside
information on nine defense contracts worth a total of more than
$522 million.
   Another affidavit by FBI agent James B. Lamb spelled out the
grounds for searching the offices of Varian Continental Electronics
of Dallas, one of the firms Saunders dealt with. The Saunders
affidavit was attached to the Varian affidavit.
   The affidavits laid out the government's burgeoning
investigation of defense contract fraud and bribery in greater
detail than ever since the probe was revealed by coordinated
searches around the nation June 14.
   ``If you can get anything, we ... can make some money,'' the
documents quoted one consultant as telling Saunders in a
conversation monitored by the FBI. The documents contained the
first publicly disclosed quotes from the government's eavesdropping.
   The FBI said, ``There is probable cause to believe that all of
Saunders' business records, dated June 1982 to present, ...
constitute evidence of the criminal activities of Mark C.
Saunders.''
   Saunders is a former Navy procurement officer convicted of and
fired for stock trading on insider Navy information in 1982. The
FBI said Saunders was receiving inside contract data from his Navy
successor, George Stone, and it ``believes that Saunders is paying
Stone for this information.''
   Stone is one of six Pentagon officials transferred to other
duties after their offices were searched.
   A phone call to a number the FBI listed as the one at which
Saunders reached Stone was not answered Thursday night.
   In all, the documents list the dates and location of wiretapping
and electronic bugging in the homes and offices of nine defense
consultants, including one not previously named. They describe the
initial tip that triggered the investigation in September 1986.
   The documents also give a taste of the sums of money involved
for the consultants, revealing that Saunders and another
consultant, Thomas Muldoon, were paid $8,000 a month by Litton, a
major defense contractor, which was just one of at least three
companies they worked for jointly.
   The documents detailed not only the flow of inside contract
information but also alleged that Saunders, under government
subcontract to devise a plan for the Navy to buy radios, conspired
with Joe Bradley, vice president for marketing of Varian
Continental, to rig the purchase requirements so Varian Continental
could beat other companies in the bidding.
   The affidavits were ordered unsealed Thursday by U.S. Magistrate
John B. Tolle in Dallas. Federal agents requested the documents be
sealed June 10, saying they did not want to reveal the existence of
court-approved wiretaps that were still being used in the
investigation.
   The FBI said the searches were needed to investigate possible
bribery of public officials, conflict of interest, theft of
government property, false statements, mail and wire fraud and
conspiracy to defraud the United States.
   Varian Continental's parent company, Varian Associates Inc.,
headquartered in Palo Alto, Calif., was the 155th largest defense
contractor for 1986, according to the affidavit. The parent company
received more than $81.76 million in defense awards that year.
   Gary Simpson, spokesman for Varian Associates, said company
officials have not had an opportunity to review the unsealed
affidavit and would not immediately comment on its specific
allegations.
   ``Our own internal investigation is continuing and at this point
we do not believe the company was involved in any criminal
misconduct,'' Simpson said. ``We have been advised that Continental
Electronics is not a target of the investigation. Mr. Bradley has
been placed on administrative leave until our investigation is
complete.''
   Simpson said Bradley's leave was effective Thursday.
   A Justice Department spokesman, John Russell, said federal
prosecutors in charge of the investigation were ``surprised and
shocked'' that the affadavits had been released in Dallas.
   ``We didn't know it was being made public,'' said Russell,
adding that the department would have no further comment.
   The magistrate unsealed the documents because the government had
asked that they remain sealed only until June 30.
   The FBI said Saunders regularly acquired information from Stone
and relayed it to Muldoon to give to defense contractors. The FBI
said it got a court order to tap Saunders' telephones in Virginia
in September 1987.
   ``Saunders speaks with Muldoon almost daily and provides him
with information and documents relating to various government
contracts,'' the FBI said. ``In return, Muldoon pays Saunders
one-half of the money which Muldoon receives from the contractors
who pay Muldoon for the information provided by Saunders.''
   The FBI said Saunders told Muldoon that ``he (Saunders) is
paying a lot in expenses to get information on specific programs.
It is believed these payments are to Stone because the statements
made by Saunders to Muldoon were in regard to programs (about)
which Stone passed information to Saunders.''
   The Marine Corps and the Navy Space and Naval Warfare Command,
where Stone is director of information management services and
information transfer purchase division, are taking bids on an
Advanced Tactical Air Command Control system, which the FBI said
may be worth $120 million. Initial proposals were submitted in
August 1987.
   On Sept. 30, 1987, the FBI intercepted a conversation at
Saunders' home between Stone and Saunders. The FBI said:
   ``Stone provided Saunders with the following figures from each
of the competitors' proposals: SAIC - 53.4; E-Systems - 88.8; GE
-90.8; Ford -132.1; Comptek - 137.1; LTV - 138.9; Grumman - 140.3;
Unisys - 143.0; UTC (Norden) - 144.4; and Litton - 198.7. It is
believed these numbers refer to millions of dollars.
   ``It is not known exactly what the figures represented, but it
is known that the figures were not supposed to be given out and
that the lower its figure, the better off a company was in the
competition,'' the FBI said.
   ``Saunders in turn told Muldoon over the telephone the relative
positions of the companies for which Muldoon was working or
considering working,'' the FBI said.

<TEXT>
   The FBI detailed continued meetings through April 1988 between
Saunders and Stone, usually over lunch but once when Saunders
helped Stone move into his new home. The FBI described how later
each day, Saunders passed on information to Muldoon.
   The data Saunders allegedly passed included: word that all but
two companies would be eliminated by the final bidding, the later
bids by Ford and Norden and that by February, Norden was considered
among the top four bidders even though E-Systems and Ford were
lower in price. The FBI said Muldoon was working for Norden.
   At one point, the FBI said, Saunders warned Muldoon to be
careful to whom he relayed some information because it was
``extraordinarily private.''
   When Saunders told Muldoon that Norden had become a leading
bidder, Muldoon replied that the ``$60,000 is in the bag now.''
   Neither Saunders nor Muldoon answered phone calls to their homes
Thursday night.
   The FBI said it began tapping Muldoon's telephones in Washington
in July 1987.
   The FBI also said:
   _Saunders got advance word in December 1987 from Stone about a
$32 million contract for secure Navy radio equipment.
   _Stone called Saunders at home in January 1988 to give him the
names of the finalists, which he called the ``inside skinny,'' on a
$10 million Navy contract for a Tactical Environmental Support
System. Saunders told Muldoon that this data was hard to get and
now ``we can't even make any money on it.''
   _In November 1987, Saunders provided Muldoon with a draft of the
government's plan for acquiring a $50 million Fiber Optics Cable
System.
   _In August 1987, Saunders told Muldoon the company he was
working for rated poorly on the technical aspects of its bid for a
more than $100 million Digital Wide-Band Transmission System
contract.
   _In August 1987, Saunders told Muldoon about an internal Navy
split over how to handle a $10 million contract for a prototype of
a sonar system.
   _In July 1987, Saunders told Muldoon that a $100 million
Anti-Submarine Warfare Operation Center contract might have to be
restructured and rebid.
   _In November 1987, Stone told Saunders of a decision that day
about a $100 million Digital Communications Terminal contract.
   The ninth contract described by the FBI was a $9,000 government
subcontract which had been awarded to Saunders to develop a plan to
buy radios. The FBI said Saunders worked with Bradley so Varian
could win the radio contract.
   The FBI said that in a series of conversations from September to
December of 1987, Bradley and Saunders discussed how to write the
acquisition plan ``to make it difficult for other companies to
compete with Varian.''
   In one conversation, Saunders allegedly confirmed receiving a
$1,600 check from Bradley. Bradley allegedly said if things worked
out for Varian, he would try to get a bonus for Saunders, the FBI
said.
   Bradley told Saunders that ``Bradley would like to `wash' the
payment and suggested that perhaps he should make the payments to
Marilyn Burgess instead of Saunders,'' the FBI said. The FBI said
Ms. Burgess lives at Saunders' home and is vice president of his
company.
   But ``Saunders told Bradley that he had someone else in mind,
that being MET Associates, a company owned by Tom Muldoon,'' the
FBI said.
   The FBI said Saunders also did work for Varian Continental on
contracts with the U.S. Information Agency and the Voice of
America. FBI agents overheard Saunders telling an associate in
September 1987 about that work, ``if I thought DOD (Department of
Defense) was corrupt, it is absurd the way these people operate.''
There was no explanation of who ``these people'' were.
   The FBI said the investigation began September 1986 when the FBI
and the Naval Investigative Service were told that a consultant had
approached an employee of a company which had bid on a Marine Corps
contract, offering to provide competitors' costs and bid data and
government bid evaluations.
   With the employee's consent, agents recorded his conversations
with the consultant, who subsequently was confronted and agreed to
cooperate in recording conversations with other individuals.
   This group of recordings revealed, the FBI said, that defense
consultant William Parkin, a retired Navy missile buyer, ``served
as a middleman who paid government employees for inside information
and sold it to contractors.'' In January 1987, a court ordered
tapping of Parkin's office and home telephones.
   By April 1987, the FBI said, those wiretaps led agents to tap
the telephones and bug the offices of consultant William Galvin.
   By June 1987, taps and bugs were authorized for the office
telephones and office of consultant Melvyn Paisley, who had
resigned three months earlier as assistant Navy secretary for
research, engineering and systems.
   The FBI later tapped or bugged consultant Donald Illeman in
Southern California. Illeman, who has not been previously
identified with the case, did not immediately return a telephone
message.
   Later taps or bugs were placed on consultants Fred Lackner,
Charles Gardner and Jim Rapinac.
   The FBI filed a five-page, handwritten list of items seized in
Bradley's office, including a Rolodex file, a letter dated May 19,
1988 from Saunders to Bradley regarding a contractual agreement, a
computer floppy disc, a ``VOA Debriefing Correspondence file,
containing bid correspondence,'' and a ``memo from (the) Deputy
Secretary of Defense regarding controlling defense outlays.''
