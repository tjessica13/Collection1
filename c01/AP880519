   A school bus overturned on a curve and plunged down an
embankment Thursday, injuring 60 people returning from a church
outing in Pennsylvania, and more than 20 fifth-graders were injured
in a school bus crash in Albion, Iowa, authorities said.
   No one was killed in either accident, and authorities said most
injuries apparently were bruises, cuts and broken bones.
   Police said the bus carrying a group from the Walnut Street
Christian School in Jersey Shore, Penn., was returning from an
outing in Harrisburg when it overturned on a sharp curve known in
Jersey Shore as ``Devil's Elbow.''
   At least two adults and one child were admitted to a hospital
after the 4:45 p.m. accident.
   Children on the bus appeared to be between the ages of 6 and 12,
observers at the scene of the accident said. Twelve ambulances took
them, their chaperones and the bus driver to three hospitals.
   In Iowa, 58 fifth-graders from Lowell Elementary school in
Waterloo and several chaperones were returning from a field trip
near Des Moines, when their bus slipped onto a soft shoulder and
overturned south of Albion.
   ``The injuries don't appear to be that serious,'' said Omar
Voran, administrator of the Marshalltown Medical and Surgical
Center, where at least 20 students were treated in the emergency
room.

<TEXT>
   A woman who admitted causing ``a lot
of hurt and pain'' was convicted Thursday of kidnapping a baby from
a hospital last summer and keeping him for four months.
   The Prince George's County jury deliberated an hour before
reaching its verdict against Linda Stancil-Lewis, 34, for the
kidnapping of Jeremiah Thate.
   Stancil-Lewis, who stood silently as the verdict was ready,
faces up to 30 years in prison for kidnapping, child abduction and
false imprisonment when she is sentenced June 17.
   In an eight-page statement written by Stancil-Lewis and
presented at trial, she said she saw the infant's mother on
television pleading for his return, but she couldn't give him back
because she loved him.
   The boy, who was kidnapped in June when he was 3 weeks old, was
found in Stancil-Lewis' Southeast Washington apartment Oct. 28.
   ``I took a sweet little baby boy,'' Detective Robert Davidson
quoted Stancil-Lewis as saying as he read her statement in court.
   ``My heart went out to her,'' she wrote of the baby's mother,
Theresa Thate, adding she ``couldn't give him back. I loved him,
too.''
   Stancil-Lewis, who had suffered a miscarriage shortly before the
baby was abducted, recounted in her statement that she found
Jeremiah lying unattended in a hospital crib last June 11, smuggled
him out of the hospital in a canvas sports bag and took him home.
   As the statement was read, Mrs. Thate, left the courtroom in
tears. Seconds later, she was followed by her shaken husband,
Robert Thate.
   In the statement, Stancil-Lewis said: ``I caused this lady a lot
of hurt and pain.'' She said she had begun thinking about giving
the baby back to the Hyattsville couple.
   Prosecutors completed their case Wednesday after Assistant
State's Attorney Robert H. Harvey Jr. called 10 witnesses to the
stand.
   Stancil-Lewis' public defender, E. Allen Shepherd, did not call
any witnesses and did not have Stancil-Lewis testify on her own
behalf.

   Radical students tossed up to five
small explosive devices into the U.S. Embassy compound after
scaling the walls Friday during a demonstration, police said.
   Police said the devices exploded but did not cause any injuries
or damage.
   Rioters fought police with rocks and firebombs Thursday after
the funeral of a dissident student. They attacked a U.S. cultural
center and burned an American flag in front of City Hall.
   The protesters demanded that President Roh Tae-woo's government
be removed and the 40,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea go
home.
   About five students who climbed over the wall of the embassy in
downtown Seoul were arrested, police said. Two other students were
arrested later when they rushed through the gates of the compound.
   Eyewitnesses said the devices that exploded appeared to be
homemade. Radical students set off similar devices in February whey
they briefly seized the U.S. Information Service building in Seoul.
   Protesters broke windows and hurled firebombs at the Information
Service building in Seoul during clashes with riot police Thursday
in the center of the city.
   Protesters burned the U.S. flag as speakers denounced the
government following a march Thursday by about 25,000 people to
City Hall. When the crowd did not disperse, police fired tear gas
from armored vans and about 5,000 riot police attacked.
   Student protesters fled into nearby streets and hurled firebombs
at police that set fire to several shops and part of a subway
station. Terrified pedestrian fled, many choking from thick clouds
of tear gas.
   Skirmishes between police and protesters broke out around luxury
hotels. Tourists looked on in astonishment or ran for cover.
   Gasoline bombs set a roof garden ablaze at the Lotte Hotel and
fire trucks forced their way through the rioters to reach it.
   The street protests this week were the worst in South Korea
since last summer, when demonstrations forced the government to
agree to elections and democratic reforms.
   The Yonhap news agency said 32,000 people took part in
anti-government protests Thursday at 34 places throughout South
Korea, but its tabulation appeared incomplete.
   In the southern opposition stronghold of Kwangju alone, about
100,000 people surged into the central district. Tens of thousands
clashed with police.
   Police in Seoul arrested 22 people during street battles after
the funeral of dissident student Cho Sung-man, who committed
suicide Sunday in a protest against the government.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and ``Drive out the
Yankees!'' the protesters in Seoul screamed, hurling rocks, bricks
and firebombs.
   Dozens of windows were broken in attacks on City Hall and the
nearby U.S. cultural center.
   Gasoline bombs burst into flames amid squads of riot police
during the struggle for control of the city's main shopping area.
   While street battles raged in Seoul and elsewhere, Cho's body
was buried at a cemetery in Kwangju after a five-hour procession
that included stops for memorial services at his school in Seoul
and home in Chonju, another southern city.
   The funeral procession in Seoul, which police did not try to
stop, moved through the center of the capital, snarling traffic in
the morning rush hour.
   ``Down with the murder regime!'' marchers shouted as others in
white mourning clothes beat drums and cymbals. Singers chanted
dirges and students in white performed a ghost dance.
   ``We will never end our struggle until we destroy Roh's
regime!'' one young woman shouted.
   Protests began Tuesday to honor Cho and mark the eighth
anniversary, on Wednesday, of the 1980 Kwangju uprising in which at
least 191 people were killed.
   In Kwangju, 100,000 people packed a major traffic circle for a
rally demanding a full accounting of the uprising.
   Thousands of riot police fired tear gas, starting hours of
street battles. Protesters shouted ``Execute Roh Tae-woo!'' and
``Unite the motherland by driving out U.S. imperialists!''
   Roh helped his fellow army general Chun Doo-hwan seize power in
1980 and succeeded him as president in February. Opposition groups
in Kwangju say both men should be held responsible for the harsh
military suppression of the 1980 revolt.

   Fire broke out Thursday night at the
eight-story downtown headquarters of the Kansas City Police
Department, knocking out 911 emergency service and forcing
evacuation of the building, officials said.
   At least seven people were taken to hospitals and several others
were treated for smoke inhalation at the scene, officials said.
Firefighters brought the blaze under control about 9:55 p.m., two
hours after it was reported.
   About 60 people were working in the building, police spokeswoman
Sgt. Laura Mulloy said. About 40 prisoners were evacuated from the
city jail on the eighth floor of the building and taken to the
basement of Municipal Court, she said.
   The city's 911 emergency service was out of order because of the
blaze, officials said, but four phone lines were open to the public
to reach police in case of emergency.
   The four-alarm blaze was reported about 7:45 p.m. on the
building's fifth floor, said fire department spokesman Capt. Joe
Galetti. The office of Police Chief Larry Joyner is located on the
fifth floor.
   ``There was some redecorating going on in the chief's office,
I'm told,'' Galetti said, adding that the blaze was reported by
construction workers. floor.
   Smoke poured from windows of the fifth, sixth and seventh
floors, witnesses said, and several firefighters trapped by fire on
the fifth floor were rescued by ladder, officials said.

<HEAD>Car Dealership Sues Golf Course After Errant Swings Damage Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of a car dealership that
sells expensive sports cars are teed off about their neighbors, a
miniature golf course where they say some players take too-hefty
swings.
   Golf balls have been clearing a 30-foot-high net between
Golfland USA and Porsche Motorsport for years, said Ken Boswell,
the car dealership's general manager.
   But the last straw, he said, was when a brass putter also flew
over the fence and smashed the windshield of a Porsche 911
convertible. The putter, which also scratched a Porsche 928 on the
rebound, caused $3,000 in damage, Boswell said.
   As a result, the dealership filed a lawsuit Tuesday against
Golfland in Santa Clara County Superior Court. It asks for
unspecified damages, contending Porsche Motorsport has suffered
thousands of dollars in losses because of the errant golfers.
   The manager on duty at Golfland on Wednesday referred phone
calls to owner Robert Kenney, who could not be reached for comment.
Kenney's wife, Geri, said Wednesday the couple had not seen the
lawsuit, but added that they had done everything possible to
prevent balls from going onto adjacent property.
   Boswell believes most of the wayward balls come from a hole
where golfers must hit up a ramp to reach the cup.
   ``They must treat the hole like they're on a driving range,'' he
said.

   A woman whose guided party
was pushing for Mount McKinley's summit has become the first
fatality of the 1988 climbing season on North America's tallest
peak, the National Park Service said.
   The agency said it learned early Wednesday that Lynn Salerno,
31, of Anchorage, had died of apparent hypothermia and exposure at
the mountain's 19,500-foot level. Rangers did not know the
circumstances or time of death.
   Salerno was in a party led by Vern Tejas, 35, an Alaskan whose
solo winter ascent of 20,320-foot McKinley this year made
mountaineering history.
   The party is believed to have begun its climb on or about May 1.

   Vietnam has freed 22 more Chinese

official Radio Hanoi reported.
   The captives were turned over to Chinese officials on Wednesday
at Huu Nghi border post in the northern province of Lang Son
bordering China's Guangxi Province, according to a text of the
broadcast obtained in Bangkok today.
   On Monday, 68 Chinese fishermen were reportedly freed from the

   The releases follow repeated official Vietnamese requests that
Beijing free nine sailors captured during a brief clash in the
Spratlys islands in March and a pilot whose plane strayed across
the northern border into China last year.
   The clash in the South China Sea islands was over which country
had sovereignty over the chain.

<HEAD>Radicals Gain In Parliament, Indicating More Anti-West Militancy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Strong gains by radicals in Iran's
parliamentary elections signal even greater militancy against the
West and more state control of the economy.
   Results from the second round of voting Friday confirmed the
advantage radicals gained in the first round five weeks earlier.
   There were reports of violence in some cities during the
bitterly contested election. The breakdown of the new 270-seat
parliament between the power blocs is not yet known, but announced
results show radicals clearly in the ascendancy after a prolonged
struggle with conservatives in the leadership.
   Parliament has had little say in foreign policy, but Western
analysts believe the new radical strength will affect foreign
relations, conduct of the war with Iraq and the course of Iran's
fundamentalist Shiite Moslem revolution.
   They feel the radical gains, at a time of increasing political
uncertainty and military setbacks, herald a tougher stand against
the United States. Iran accuse Washington of aiding Iraq in the
war, which began in September 1980.
   ``The Iranians will likely prosecute the war more vigorously.
They're already rethinking their strategy, which was based on
attrition,'' Hans-Heino Kopietz said in an interview from the
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
   ``But much will depend on how quickly they can improve the
economy,'' Kopietz said. ``This is their first priority. If they
can get credit abroad, to get more military hardware as well as
alleviate domestic hardship, they will be more aggressive.''
   New alliances that have emerged in the Tehran hierarchy are sure
to affect the struggle over who will run the country after the
death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the 87-year-old revolutionary
patriarch.
   He has named Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, 66, as his
successor. Montazeri has no significant power base, however, and is
opposed by such key figures as Hashemi Rafsanjani, the parliament
speaker, who regularly leads Friday prayers at Tehran University.
   Montazeri is expected to become a figurehead, with real power
held by Rafsanjani and two or three others.
   Rafsanjani, who is allied with the radicals on several issues,
scored a personal triumph in the election by winning 1.3 million
votes.
   Other radical winners include Mohammad Salamati, former
agriculture minister; Hojatoleslam Mehdi Kharroubi, who heads the
Pilgrimage Bureau and is believed to have directed riots last year
in the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and Ateqe Sediqi Rajai,
widow of President Mohammad Ali Rajai. Leftist opponents of the
Khomeini regime assassinated Rajai in 1981.
   Of 208 incumbents who ran, only about 100 were re-elected to the
new Majlis, as Iran's parliament is known. Its term is four years.
   The main group of conservative clerics, the Militant Clergy
Society, was weakened just before the elections when a radical
faction led by Kharroubi of the Pilgrimage Bureau broke away over
political and economic issues.
   Diplomatic sources with contacts in Tehran said the split was
encouraged by Khomeini and the prosecutor-general, Mohammed
Khoeiniha, a leader of the ``followers of the Imam's line'' who
stormed the U.S. Embassy in November 1979 and held 52 Americans
hostage for 444 days.
   Serajeddin Mousavi, a cleric who heads the security apparatus,
said in the Tehran daily Kayhan: ``Being in a state of war and at
this sensitive juncture, we must not allow a bunch of
obstructionists to waste parliament's time.''
   Khomeini spent years playing referee between the rival factions,
but moved clearly to the radical side before the elections.
   He decreed wider state powers, opening the way for economic
reforms that were blocked by the conservative-dominated Council of
Guardians. The council can veto legislation it decides is a
violation of Islamic tenets.
   Since the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown in
February 1979, the radicals have sought to nationalize industry and
trade, distribute land held by wealthy families and liberalize
social laws. Conservatives, supported by the merchant class,
advocate a more capitalist economy.
   ``The radicals' success is significant because it gives impetus
to their efforts to achieve state control not just of the economy,
but the whole revolutionary apparatus,'' Kopietz said.
   A major radical figure to emerge recently is Interior Minister
Ali-Akbar Mohtashemi, former ambassador to Syria. Western
Intelligence agencies have linked him closely to Shiite extremists
in Lebanon who kidnapped Westerners and carried out suicide bomb
attacks.
   Syria told Mohtashemi from Damascus in June 1985 after two
Americans were kidnapped in Beirut.
   Shortly before that, Mohtashemi lost his right eye and two
fingers of his right hand when he opened a booby-trapped parcel in
Damascus. Syria claimed the CIA sent it.
   As interior minister, Mohtashemi was in charge of the elections.
Several months ago he replaced 20 provincial governors, who are
responsible for screening candidates.
   He became interior minister in August, replacing Ali-Akbar
Nategh-Nouri, conservative head of the Hojati Islamic faction.
Nategh-Nouri did not win a majority in his Tehran district in the
first election round April 8, but made it May 13.

   Pines dot snowy peaks outside as Tom
Pinard sits in his rustic office in a peach cowboy shirt, crusading
to carve away 90 percent of the nation's largest county to create
Mojave County.
   At 18,160 square miles of mostly desert north of the San Gabriel
and San Bernardino mountains, the new county would still be the
nation's largest, bigger than Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode
Island and Delaware combined.
   Both it and what remained of San Bernardino County would have
better-focused government if voters agree to a ``divorce'' by
passing Measure A, said Pinard, who publishes a local newspaper
from this 6,000-foot-high ski resort town.
   His allies gathered 15,000 signatures to get the issue on the
June 7 ballot. If approved by a majority vote, Mojave County would
begin operating after a Board of Supervisors is elected in November.
   Four-fifths of San Bernardino County's 1.1 million residents are
jammed into the far eastern edge of the Los Angeles megalopolis,
and Pinard says they deserve a county government that concentrates
on urban woes: air and water pollution, gangs, gridlock.
   But the 205,000 people in the proposed new county confront other
problems. The area encompasses military and Indian preserves,
mining regions, wilderness, a slice of Death Valley, Colorado River
resorts and the mountains near Wrightwood.
   ``You come up over the mountains and you have people with an
entirely different set of problems,'' said Pinard, who would like
to be elected a Mojave County supervisor. ``We've got snow; they've
got gutters and curbs.''
   Residents of such Los Angeles basin cities as Ontario, Fontana
and San Bernardino are ``just not conscious of our concerns,'' he
said.
   But opponents of the ``divorce'' contend a new,
2,000-square-mile San Bernardino County would really be ``Podunk
County,'' the second-smallest in Southern California, stripped of
money and influence.
   They belittle promises by Pinard's New County Steering Committee
of more efficient and responsive government, better roads and law
enforcement.
   Opponents say it instead would skirt bankruptcy from the outset,
with too little industry for its size. Its far-flung voters would
be unlikely to approve bonds to fund a jail, hospitals or other
public works; and services would suffer, they contend.
   ``They say San Bernardino County government is too fat and
unresponsive, and maybe that's true,'' said Nelda Smith of
Wrightwood, coordinator of the NO on Mojave committee. ``But I
think we should work at changing it before jumping off a cliff.''
   A key point of contention is a report by a special governor's
commission that found Mojave County to be economically feasible,
with an $88,000 surplus on a yearly budget of more than $137
million, assuming current service levels. The commission, mandated
by law after Measure A qualified, sketched a division of assets and
liabilities and organization of the new county.
   It said current San Bernardino County employees would be able to
work for Mojave with no cuts in pay or benefits. As part of the
settlement, it said, the old county would owe the new $11.8
million, to be paid in three yearly payments.
   But late last month, the San Bernardino County Supervisors sued,
contending the study failed to account for unfunded pension
liabilities that would mean the new, smaller San Bernardino County
would be owed as much as $33.6 million by Mojave County.
   San Diego Superior Court Judge James R. Milliken ruled May 11
that he had no authority to invalidate the proposal. The
supervisors' appeal will not be heard until after the election.
   Most of the proposed county now is represented by Supervisor
John Joyner, who cast the sole vote against filing the suit.
Joyner, who is running for re-election against a former aide, has
not said how he will vote on the measure.
   If Mojave County is created, Joyner's district would be reduced
to most of the San Bernardino Mountains, including the Big Bear and
Lake Arrowhead resorts, and the Morongo Basin desert area.
   Pinard said he had believed odds for passage of Measure A were
slightly better than 50-50; but with the supervisors' suit, he
said, ``I just don't know _ the chances have to be revised
downward.''

<HEAD>Man Getting Wish Posthumously: A Piano Dropped From The Sky</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his lifetime, John Cameron Young
had a secret wish, an unusual fantasy: He wondered what an airborne
piano would sound like crashing to earth. Now, a bit late, his
friends will find out.
   The Marin County man was 44 when he died three years ago,
leaving an $800,000 estate. In his will, Young, whose life was full
of adventure and fun-loving behavior, left $15,000 to three buddies
who were instructed to toss one last party for their departed
friend.
   The professional guitar player told his friends to ``give a
party for themselves and as many of my friends as they can find
that desire to attend.''
   As told by Young's friends, the Mississippi native moved to the
San Francisco Bay area in 1972. He sang Delta blues and found time
to be a parachutist, pilot, storyteller and business success with
six furniture stores.
   It took three years to straighten out Young's will, and on May
28, hundreds of folks are expected to gather for the memorial
celebration.
   They will indulge Young's strange fantasy _ listening to a
300-pound piano crash to the ground from a hovering helicopter.
   ``He talked about that all the time,'' said Harry Murphy, 53, a
Fairfax graphic designer who met Young in a San Anselmo saloon 10
years ago. ``He'd sit here and say, `Harry, we've got to have a
piano drop. Can you hear it? ... You take an old upright piano
about 1,000 feet in the sky ...'''
   Murphy mused over that, and added fondly, ``... I think he'll be
able to hear it.''
   Murphy said a helicopter will drop an inlaid walnut upright from
50 to 100 feet near Sonoma County Airport.
   ``It's an arrogant, outrageous, playful, childish thing to do,''
said Murphy. ``That embodies J.C.''
   About four hours after the smash, the celebration will turn to a
more sedate mood with food, drink and music in Marin.
   Friends said the sendoff fits in with Young's life. He once
drove a motorcycle into a bar and ordered a beer with an olive.
   However, Young was far from a clown. He had a master's degree in
mathematics, and often dragged bar patrons into conversations about
negative numbers and mind-twisting theorems.
   His death was as unusual as his life. His body was discovered in
his black Cadillac in a ravine below a steep highway near Stinson
Beach. Authorities said he may have been beaten to death.
   ``He was full of life and I miss him,'' said real estate broker
Richard Catlett, who met young in a bar in Spain in 1972.

<HEAD>Automakers' Crash Diets Leading To Lasting Changes</HEAD>

   The Big Three automakers are replacing their
crash diets of the early '80s with more lasting changes to prepare
for challenge of the next decade: overproduction.
   By 1990 there could be 5.6 million more new cars and trucks than
buyers worldwide, according to industry estimates.
   ``First, obviously, cost-cutting was the major concern ... But
in the long term it's the products they're coming out with'' that
will determine who survives, said Kathleen Heaney, an analyst with
Nikko Securities in New York.
   Having modernized their factories and corporate structures, the
Big Three are marshaling their resources with the aim of making
American cars that are better engineered and sell like Japanese
cars.
   The dollar's slide against the Japanese yen and European
currencies two years ago has made some imports more expensive and
temporarily helped level the playing field for General Motors
Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   So has a new United Auto Workers pattern contract that stresses
job security over wage increases and gives the companies needed
flexibility.
   The auto industry tumult of the past 15 years _ fuel crises, a
recession and the shock of Japanese entry _ has given way to a more
stable market where winners and losers no longer are determined by
national origin.
   Ford, losing $1 million a day at the beginning of the decade,
has made big adjustments already, closing excess plants and running
the rest on overtime while grabbing styling leadership from GM with
a sleek, aerodynamic new lineup.
   ``People who go into a Ford dealership have a car in mind. They
say `I want that Thunderbird, Taurus, Continental','' Heaney said.
``People are not doing that for GM. ... They're going to a GM
dealer and saying: `I've got $13,000. What can I get?'''
   Ford led U.S. automakers in earnings in 1986 and went on to set
the world auto industry record with $4.6 billion in 1987 profits
and again with $1.6 billion in earnings in the first quarter of
1988. It also has a comfortable $10 billion cash cushion it is
saving for a major electronics acquisition.
   At its annual meeting last week, Ford Chairman Donald Petersen
said the second largest U.S. automaker has no intention of giving
up its edge and will substantially increase spending on new product
development over the next few years.
   Chrysler, under Chairman Lee Iacocca, also has switched its
focus from trimming costs to investing in new products.
   Chrysler had been shedding weight gained in its August
acquisition of ailing American Motors Corp. After squeezing more
Jeeps out of a former AMC assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio, Chrysler
decided to close AMC's other U.S. assembly plant, in Kenosha, Wis.,
by year's end.
   It also settled its UAW contract five months early, eliminating
the chance of a costly strike in September when its factories will
be pushing out 1989 models.
   Chrysler's strategy of aggressive pricing to gain market share
at the expense of immediate profits has boosted sales during 1988,
including a 72 percent jump for Jeeps and a 55 percent increase for
minivans.
   Iacocca, who faces his shareholders Thursday in New York,
already has injected extra money into research and development for
new models and advanced engineering this year and plans more.
   GM, which spent $50 billion since the early 1980s to modernize
or replace its factories, is also channeling resources into new
product development, but analysts say it has more problems to solve.
   The world's largest automaker is barely breaking even on its
U.S. car and truck business despite cost-cutting, which may make
additional plant closings necessary.
   Analysts also question Chairman Roger Smith's pledge to regain
lost market share. To move eight points to 45 percent of the
market, GM would have to increase sales by at least 1.2 million
cars and trucks a year. GM lost market share in 1986 to Ford and
Chrysler as well as to foreign makers.
   And the field of competitors only grows thicker.
   Mazda, which joined the ranks of Japanese makers with U.S.
plants, has sold out its Michigan plant's production through
October. Toyota's huge Kentucky plant will begin making Camry
sedans this summer and a Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant in Illinois soon
will be churning out sporty 1989 models.

<TEXT>
   When the U.S. trade deficit for March improved
beyond all expectations, many economists and big investors
responded with a chorus of ``Bah, humbug.''
   Funny they should pan what would seem like fabulous news. But
they've done it before and most likely they'll do it again.
   They responded that way to news of a lower jobless rate, to
increases in factory use, even to the dollar's new stability.
   It is a strange, discomfiting world in which good is bad, happy
is sad, up is down, square is round, best is worst, last is first,
strong is weak, bottom is peak, rich is poor and less is more.
   And if the sages are being spooked by the ``good'' news _ news
for which they've waited months and which they deemed necessary for
economic survival _ it's no wonder they're exaggerating ``bad''
news, of which they've found plenty.
   Late last year, for instance, the pessimists said consumers
would reduce spending, forcing the economy into recession. It
didn't happen. Then they said an inventory glut might produce
recession in 1988. But the glut disappeared.
   ``It is ironic that the pessimistic crowd see a boom just as
bloated inventories are starting to cool things off,'' said
economist Edward Yardeni of the Prudential-Bache investment firm,
who fears neither a boom nor a bust.
   Throughout, there has been wide disagreements among economists,
some of whom believed the biggest threat was from recession, others
that inflation would turn out to be the big problem.
   Whatever the interpretation, however, the conclusion has been
the same, i.e., bad news. If the economy expanded it would strain
production facilities and produce inflation. Should expansion
cease, recession would follow.
   The dramatic improvement in the nation's trade deficit _ a $4
billion reduction to $9.7 billion in March _ provides the most
vivid example of the syndrome.
   Nothing economic has been more eagerly awaited in recent months,
since a shrinkage of the deficit means U.S. goods, especially
manufactured items, are becoming more competitive abroad.
   In fact, many economists and investors made the latest trade
figures the fulcrum of their analyses. When the deficit grew in
February, the stock market plunged. Would a gain in March make the
market rise?
   It didn't happen. Once again the news, though opposite to that
of February, produced a negative reaction. Both the bond and stock
markets interpreted the news as indicative of an economy about to
overheat and produce inflation.
   ``It seems the better things get, the worse they're going to
be,'' quipped Malcolm Forbes, the publisher, who was addressing a
business luncheon group shortly after hearing the news.
   Why the mood?
   Economists themselves have been asking that question, and most
have defended their positions with data and theories that to the
layman seem thorough, reasonable and even sagacious.
   While recognizing that pessimism may be justified _ and that
inflation, high interest rates and perhaps recession lie ahead _
some economists believe there is a large psychological element
involved.
   In fact, with so many disproportions and dislocations in the
economy _ big budget and trade deficits, uncollectable Third World
loans, and the crash of the securities markets in October _ no
matter how poor or inaccurate an analysis might be, a negative
forecast stands a chance of being correct.
   There are also the awful memories of the 1970s to contend with.
Economists back then couldn't believe what was happening _ that
inflation and interest rates were not just high but in the double
digits. They cannot forget.
   And, finally, anxiety is produced by the very expansion itself.
Now in its 66th month, it has lived far beyond the usual lifespan
of expansions, and inevitably will turn down. But when? And will
inflation or recession end it?
   H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist for Ladenburg, Thalmann &
Co., a securities broker-dealer, remains optimistic, at least about
inflation. He notes that major inflation indicators rose less in
the first quarter of 1988 than in the final quarter of 1987.
   His forecast contrasts with that of most economists.
   ``We're convinced that with just a little bit of luck, the
expansion could continue into 1991 or 1992,'' he says, adding the
caveat:
   ``However, this will be a respite, not a reprieve. If Washington
cannot deal with its problems (mainly the budget deficit), we will
all have to live with the consequences.''

   U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings and his
supporters see him as a courageous, outspoken fighter now taking
unfair shots from those who cannot accept him as the first black
federal judge in Florida.
   Hastings, whose impeachment hearing began Wednesday in Congress,
has been battling bribery and conspiracy charges for the last seven
years.
   But he has remained a popular figure in South Florida's black
community, which has held impassioned demonstrations in his support
and contributed $65,000 to his legal defense.
   ``He's never been the kind to back down from a fight; he's had
to pull himself up from his bootstraps from day one,'' said Dr.
Gordon Merritt, a Fort Lauderdale dentist and longtime friend who
helped raise funds for Hastings. ``Most federal judges are the
placating type, but Alcee speaks out _ he's a maverick.''
   The flamboyant Hastings has proclaimed his innocence ever since
he was indicted on bribery charges in 1981 and then acquitted two
years later.
   The case didn't end there. Fellow judges accused Hastings of
obstructing justice and lying under oath, and issued a report
recommending his impeachment.
   ``I'm not going to be impeached and I'm not going to be
removed,'' Hastings said in a recent interview. ``It's pure
unadulterated politics.''
   Hastings, in sermon-like speeches around the country, has
blasted the secret judicial investigation after his acquittal as a
``witchhunt'' and an unconstitutional ``throwback to Star
Chamberism.''
   He has suggested his race has had something to do with the
effort against him, and said he really angered Justice Department
officials with his 1981 rulings blocking deportation of Haitian
immigrants.
   Complaints were filed against him in 1984 for his alleged
improper political statements, including harsh criticism of the
Reagan administration. Hastings said his position on the federal
bench does not mean he can't speak his mind.
   ``I don't have any organized effort,'' said Hastings, who added
he has also spent much of his own money. ``It's draining me
financially. It's impacting me from an emotional standpoint _ I'm
tired from all this mess.''
   His 70-year-old mother Mildred, with whom Hastings, 51, has
shared a Lauderhill apartment since his second divorce, said her
son would come out of the hearings fine and ``he doesn't need me to
talk for him.''
   The only child of a maid and butler in Altamonte Springs, a
small town north of Orlando, Hastngs earned his law degree at
predominantly black Florida A&M University, became a civil rights
leader, and ran unsuccessfully for office several times.
   In 1970, he was the first black man to run for the U.S. Senate
from Florida, but failed to win nomination.
   He returned to his private law practice, where he did much free
work in civil rights cases, until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter
appointed him to the federal bench.

   Soul music legend James Brown spent the night
in jail on charges of drug possession and fleeing from police after
his wife again complained he was abusing her.
   The 55-year-old singer, known to fans as the ``Godfather of
Soul,'' was charged Wednesday with failure to stop for police,
resisting arrest, assault against an officer and illegal possession
of a revolver, police said.
   Later in the day, Brown was charged with possession of the drug
PCP after tests on a substance found in his car.
   Deputies were dispatched to Brown's Beech Island home Wednesday
after his wife, Adrienne, went to a neighbor's house and said he
was abusing her, said Aiken County Sheriff Carrol Heath.
   When officers arrived, Brown sped away in his car but was
overtaken 1{ miles away, Heath said.
   Brown told officers he was late for an appointment, the sheriff
said. A scuffle ensued, but no injuries were reported. Brown
remained jailed Wednesday night.
   On April 4, Brown was charged with assault with the intent to
murder, aggravated assault and battery after allegedly beating his
wife with a pipe. He also was charged with firing a gun into a car
while she was inside.

   Lisa Bonet, who plays Cosby kid college
student in NBC-TV's ``A Different World'' but has raised eyebrows
by posing nude, is pregnant, a network spokesman said.
   Six months ago, Miss Bonet married musician Romeo Blue, also
known as Lenny Kravitz.
   There was no immediate word on how the pregnancy of the
20-year-old actress would affect her role in the series, according
to a statement Wednesday from NBC spokesman Bob Meyers. The show, a
spinoff of ``The Cosby Show,'' was rated No. 2 for the season,
according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   During her career on ``The Cosby Show'' and ``A Different

   Whatever their secrets, the two were among eight men honored
Wdnesday as 1988's outstanding fathers by the National Father's Day

   Randolph, who spends half the baseball season on the road, says
he has to work at keeping communication lines open with his four

   Kristofferson, who has six children by three wives and three
adopted Salvadoran orphans, said, ``I had the good taste to select
mothers who would raise them. All I've done is love them.''
   Apparently love was enough, because all nine children now live

   Federal law officers searched Wednesday for any
``shred of evidence'' that might link a Missouri couple charged
with plotting to kill presidential candidate Jesse Jackson to
violent white supremacist groups.
   Londell Williams, 30, and his wife, Tammy Williams, 26, of
Washington, Mo., were in custody on charges of conspiring to kill
Jackson, threatening an informer and possessing an automatic rifle.
   A Secret Service agent testified at a hearing Tuesday that
agents had taped a conversation in which Williams said the
Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord was planning the
assassination of Jackson.
   ``We are out seeking every shred of evidence and talking to
every person we can who might know something,'' Rich Adams, a
spokesman for the Secret Service in Washington, said Wednesday. The
Secret Service is responsible for protecting Jackson.
   Meanwhile, the Secret Service on Wednesday found a bullet under
a seat in the Jackson campaign plane. But Adams later said it was
determined the 9mm bullet belonged to the Secret Service. ``It's
one of ours,'' he said.
   Jackson, campaigning in California, suggested that comments by
some public officials had helped set the stage for the alleged plot
against him. He was apparently referring to strong criticism of him
during the New York primary campaign by New York City Mayor Ed
Koch, who at one point said Jews would have to be ``crazy'' to vote
for Jackson.
   ``The climate for this kind of antagonism and violence, of
course, has been set by many irresponsible public leaders (whose)
attacks based on race have set a divisive and dangerous climate,
such as the one...in New York in April, for example,'' Jackson told
reporters in Fresno, Calif.
   Tom Den Ouden, the agent in charge of the Springfield, Mo., FBI
office, located in an area that has become known for attracting
members of extremist groups, said he had done some checking into
the Williamses background and found no evidence the pair belonged
to The Order or CSA.
   Papers filed in federal court indicated Londell Williams told an
informer that he was a member of The Order and other white
supremacist groups and that Jackson was to be killed.
   A St. Louis television station, KSDK, reported that Williams had
telephoned from jail on Wednesday to say he had not been involved
in any plot against the Democratic presidential contender.
   ``I did not conspire to kill the man,'' the station quoted
Williams as saying. ``If Jesse Jackson makes it to the presidency,
well, fine.''
   And in an interview with the Belleville (Ill.) News-Democrat,
published in Thursday's editions, Williams admitted he is a racist
but said he is not affiliated with any group.
   ``If there was a crime done, I've done it all on my own,'' he
told the newspaper in a telephone interview from jail on Wednesday.
``I deny that there is a crime done. I did not conspire with anyone
to kill any presidential candidate, especially Jesse Jackson.
   ``I do have prejudices ... against anything that isn't white,''
he added.
   Lawyers for the couple said each denied belonging to a white
supremacist group. And after the hearing Tuesday, Mrs. Williams
said as she was escorted out of the courtroom: ``We're not part of
the CSA.''
   According to the criminal complaint filed in U.S. District
Court, an unidentified person contacted the Franklin County
sheriff's office earlier this month, claiming that the Williamses
were conspiring to assassinate Jackson.
   The information was relayed to the Secret Service and agents met
with the informant, who agreed to wear a hidden microphone and meet
again May 10 with Londell Williams, this time with law enforcement
officials listening in, the complaint said.
   The complaint said the informant later received a death threat
from the Williamses for informing on them.
   At the hearing, Secret Service agent J. Christopher Murphy
testified that the informant led sheriff's deputies to a wooded
area in Franklin County where they found an AR-15 Colt
semi-automatic rifle and a bag the informant said belonged to the
Williamses.
   The complaint said the bag contained a postcard addressed to
Londell Williams and maps, one of which had his fingerprints. The
rifle had been reported stolen from Springfield, according to the
agent.
   Murphy said that during the recorded conversation with the
informant, Williams said he wanted to get the rifle back because it
had been issued to him by the CSA. Williams also said the
organization wanted it returned because it had been used to kill a
law enforcement officer, Murphy said.
   Murphy said that the informant brought up the assassination plot
during the conversation and Williams said ``the CSA was planning to
assassinate candidate Jackson on the Fourth of July.''
   Murphy said that after the Williamses were arrested, Williams
told authorities about the individual who provided him with the
rifle and also made statements about a plan to kill Jackson.
   Secret Service agent David Northcutt testified that he had
interviewed Ms. Williams after her arrest. At that time, she said
she was present when her husband discussed the CSA and other groups.
   Jackson, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination
and has been the target of hundreds of death threats in his 1984
and 1988 campaigns, said Wednesday he would not be deterred.
   ``We will not surrender to the dream-busters,'' Jackson said in
Los Angeles. ``The Secret Service will handle the dream-busters,
and I will keep (articulating) the dream and keep hope alive.''
   The Williamses were being held without bond in the federal
detention facility in Belleville, Ill., across the Mississippi
River from St. Louis.
   Records in Christian County Circuit Court show Londell and Tammy
Williams were both arrested in Ozark Dec. 7, 1986. He was charged
with unlawful use of a weapon and she was charged with possession
of marijuana. Both ended up serving short sentences in the
Christian County jail and are on probation, according to records.

<TEXT>
   All adult Ethiopians, including
pensioners and nationals living abroad, have been ordered to pay
the government one month's salary to help finance an offensive
against two rebel groups.
   A special decree, signed by President Mengistu Haile Mariam on
Tuesday, said the government also will levy a war tax on private
enterprises.
   The decree, described by a Council of State statement on
Wednesday, did not say how much money would be raised or when the
offensive would be launched.
   According to the World Bank, Ethiopia's 42.2 million people are
among the world's poorest with a per capita annual income of $120.
   During the 1984-85 famine, which killed an estimated 1 million
Ethiopians, Mengistu imposed a similar tax for drought relief.
   The offensive will be launched against the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front and the Tigrean People's Liberation Front, two
northern rebel groups that have been fighting for a separate
homeland for more than 14 years.

   An educator who acknowledged using plagiarism
in his bid to become president of North Dakota State University
said Wednesday he has accepted a request to renew his candidacy.
   University of Minnesota interim President Richard Sauer withdrew
as a candidate earlier this month after he admitted lifting part of
a presentation for the NDSU job from a magazine article without
crediting it.
   He said Wednesday night that John Richardson, North Dakota's
commissioner of higher education, asked him Wednesday afternoon to
again become a candidate for the position.
   ``I think I have something to offer, I think I can do that job
and I'm interested in it,'' Sauer, 48, said when asked why he
accepted the offer.
   Richardson said he first asked Sauer Tuesday to resubmit his
name at the behest of the higher education board. He would not
comment on why the board members wanted to consider Sauer.
   Board President Jack Pfister of Wahpeton could not be reached
for comment Wednesday night.
   Richardson said the action merely follows the original
recommendation of the president's search committee, which put forth
Sauer's name as a possible candidate even though it knew of the
plagiarism allegations against him.
   Sauer will be interviewed by the board Sunday night at NDSU, the
higher education commissioner said.
   Sauer last week apologized to the Univesity of Minnesota
Regents, and they gave him a unanimous vote of confidence.

<HEAD>Admission Review Can Cut Hospital Costs 8 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance companies can cut medical expenses 8
percent if they require people to get approval from a review board
before being treated in the hospital, says a study published today.
   Such ``utilization review'' progams are intended to hold down
medical expenses by checking to make sure hospitalization is
necessary.
   The study found that the controls save money, although it did
not determine whether they have any effect on health.
   Utilization review programs generally require that hospital
admissions be approved by a review panel before or at the time of
admission.
   The study, directed by Dr. Paul J. Feldstein of the University
of California at Irvine, was published in the New England Journal
of Medicine and was based on a review of 222 groups of employees
and dependents who were covered by a large private insurance
company that required utilization review.
   The study concluded that utilization review reduced hospital
admissions by 12 percent and total medical expenditures by 8
percent.
   For a typical company with 1,000 employees, this could mean
saving $636,000 over five years, the study said. For a similar
company with a high rate of hospital use, the savings could total
$2.2 million.

<HEAD>`Massive Blackouts' on Cable TV Predicted from New Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's cable television subscribers will
face ``massive blackouts'' in service under a new federal policy
allowing local stations to buy exclusive rights to syndicated
programs, cable industry officials say.
   Under the policy approved 3-0 by the Federal Communications
Commission on Wednesday, cable TV systems that broadcast the same
programs in a local station's viewing area will have to black out
the shows or substitute other programs.
   Some in the cable industry are predicting dark screens and the
demise of some TV superstations as a result.
   Ted Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting Inc., which owns
nationally distributed WTBS, said the new rules ``do not give the
cable industry a realistic chance to avoid massive blackouts.''
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said the new rules will result in
less duplication of programs and will provide an incentive to
produce new programs.
   ``Blackouts will only occur if cable operators seek to cause
turmoil for short-term political advantage, which I cannot believe
they will do,'' he said.
   The National Cable Television Association said it will challenge
the rules in court.
   ``The FCC pulled the plug on the favorite TV programs of
millions of people,'' NCTA President James P. Mooney said. ``People
whose favorite programs disappear will be angered and bewildered''
and the cost of syndicated programming will rise, he added.
   The rules will likely reduce how often TV viewers can see
syndicated reruns of shows like ``M-A-S-H,'' ``Taxi'' and ``My
Three Sons.''
   A cable subscriber now can see one of these shows several times
a day if it is aired by a local broadcaster and by out-of-town
superstations whose signals are carried by the local cable operator.
   ``The rule of reruns is what prevails today,'' Patrick said. He
said that by giving broadcasters a measure of programming
protection, the rules will increase the value of their programs to
advertisers. More ad revenue, in turn, will foster production of
new programs, he said.
   In addition, cable systems will be forced to be come up with
more programming, he said.
   He also said cable systems should not have to resort to
blackouts to comply with the rules because of a one-year transition
period, a variety of exceptions that will be allowed and the amount
of substitute programming that is available, Patrick said.
   But the cable industry expects that at least some screens will
go dark and that some of the smaller TV superstations may return to
being just local stations.
   That view was expressed by Jeff Treeman, senior vice president
of United Video, the Tulsa, Okla.-based cable carrier that
distributes superstation signals including WGN. He said cable
systems in some large markets, where independents can afford to buy
exclusive rights to programming, may have to black out or
substitute shows for as much as 40 percent of a superstation's
programming.
   ``That's enough for the cable operator to drop the signal,'' he
said.
   Similar rules were dropped by the FCC in 1980. Since then, cable
systems have been able to carry the signals of out-of-town stations
such as WTBS in Atlanta, WWOR in the New York area and WGN in
Chicago, which have become known as superstations, even when those
stations transmit programs whose rights were bought by a local TV
station.
   Superstations also have become popular for the local sporting
events they carry.
   Under the new exclusivity rules, TV stations will be able to
negotiate for exclusive rights to a syndicated program and will be
able to force a cable system to honor that contract by blacking out
that show when it is aired by a superstation on the system. The
rules also allow broadcasters to negotiate rights with cable
systems.
   Superstations also will be able to buy exclusive rights for
syndicated shows on a nationwide basis.
   The rules won't apply to cable systems with fewer than 1,000
subscribers. About half of all cable systems fall into this
category, though they serve only about 5 percent of the nation's 45
million cable subscribers, the FCC said.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Swap Of Downtown Real Estate For
Swampland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the House Interior Committee are
split over whether a proposed swap of 92.5 U.S.-owned acres in
downtown Phoenix for 118,000 acres of swampland in Florida is fair
to taxpayers, but the committee approved the arrangement.
   ``This is a good deal ... everybody wins,'' says longtime
Interior Chairman Morris Udall, D-Ariz., who helped put the
proposal together.
   Strongly disagreeing is Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., an
Interior subcommittee chairman who is first in line to eventually
succeed Udall as chairman and who normally is aligned with Udall on
issues before the panel.
   Miller says the deal could find taxpayers trading the Phoenix
acreage for ``a bargain basement price'' because nobody knows just
how much the property will be worth when it is rezoned for
commercial development.
   Udall on Wednesday had the clout that normally flows to a
chairman, easily winning voice-vote approval for legislation
authorizing completion of what Miller says would be the biggest
interstate land trade in U.S. history.
   The proposed deal involves the 104-acre site that now houses the
Phoenix Indian School, a federal facility that is slated to close
next month. Miller says the property is one of the most valuable
undeveloped urban tracts in the West. An Interior Department
appraisal values the parcel at $122 million.
   On the Florida end are 118,000 acres owned by the Collier
family, although Miller says that 4,236 of them are under tidal
water and possibly owned by the state of Florida. This land would
be used to enlarge the Big Cypress National Preserve and the
Florida panther refuge in the southwest part of the state, but the
government would not own the subsurface mineral rights.
   The deal worked out by the Interior Department and the Arizona
congressional delegation values the Florida land at $45.1 million.
The proposal also calls for the Collier family to pay the
government $34.9 million.
   Under the plan, the Colliers would get 68 of the 104 acres in
Phoenix. The city of Phoenix would be given 20 acres for a park and
the Veterans Administration 11.5 to expand a hospital, with the
state of Arizona possibly getting the other 4.5 acres.
   Miller challenged the appraisal on the Phoenix property, citing
a report by the congressional General Accounting Office that says
the real value of the land won't be known until the 68 acres are
rezoned for commercial use.
   By a 36-3 vote, he lost an attempt to amend the bill to delay
completion of the deal until after Phoenix substantially completed
the rezoning process, new appraisals were submitted to Congress and
GAO ruled that what the government was getting was equal to what it
was trading away.
   ``My intention is to make this exchange look a little more like
a business transaction,'' Miller said. ``We owe this to the
taxpayers. ... There is no private individual who would get rid of
these lands under these circumstances.''
   Udall and other supporters argued that the legislation could
bring a higher price for the 68 acres because it requires the tract
to be offered to the highest bidder once rezoning is completed.
Under the plan, the Colliers could get the land by matching the
high bid.
   Miller said, however, that there is little likelihood another
buyer could quickly put together the financial package to satisfy
the bill's requirement that the buyer pay cash for the property
within 30 days of the bidding.
   Defending the legislation, Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, said that
``it's a good package for what we're all trying to do. Forget the
value of the Phoenix land. ... We're not in the moneymaking
business.''

<HEAD>Poor, Elderly Would Cash Government Checks At Any Bank Under
Proposal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks should be required to cash government
checks for the elderly and the poor even if they have no accounts
with the financial institutions, an advocacy group told lawmakers.
   Peggy Miller, representing the Consumer Federation of America,
told a Senate subcommittee on Wednesday that people on Social
Security and welfare would be willing to pay a fee of $2 for the
check cashing service by banks, even though legislation does not
call for it.
   Ms. Miller provided the Senate Banking subcommittee on consumer
affairs with statistics showing that check cashing outlets,
including liquor stores, often charge exorbitant fees for the
service because of the unwillingness of banks to provide it.
   She said check cashing outlets and unlicensed community
locations often charge as high as 20 percent to 30 percent for
personal checks, 10 percent for money orders and 6 percent for
government checks.
   ``They can do so because they are vendors of last resort,'' she
said. ``Many of their customers, including our elderly, have no
where else to go.''
   Ms. Miller said her group supported legislation introduced in
the Senate by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and in the House by
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., which would require banks to cash
government checks of customers with no accounts once their
identification has been verified.
   August Zinsser III, representing the American Bankers
Association, told the committee that the legislation would subject
banks to large fraud losses and ``is premature, inappropriate and
unfair to depository institutions.''
   Proponents of the legislation, including Ms. Miller, denied that
fraud would be a problem.
   Ms. Miller said currently 54,000 government checks out of 482
million are forged each year. ``This represents less than the
normal bounce level of all checks cashed in banks,'' she said.
   Another witness, assistant Comptroller General Richard L. Fogel,
released a prelimary report done by the General Accounting Office
which indicates that Social Security and welfare recipients in the
nation's urban areas have the most difficulty cashing their
government checks in banks where they have no accounts.
   He said: ``The unbanked population of the United States is at
the lower end of the income scale, relies relatively heavily on
government benefit programs, includes a significant percentage of
the unemployed, and most have 12 years or less of education.
   ``Some individuals do not have depository accounts and are not
able to cash their checks at local banks or thrifts,'' Fogel said.

<HEAD>Study Says Higher Standards Needed To Improve State `Safety Nets'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government needs to set higher
standards for state poverty programs so that the assistance
available to poor people won't vary so widely from state to state,
a private research group says.
   At the same time, states need to do more on their own to improve
programs for the disadvantaged, said the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities.
   The center, which analyzes government spending and its impact on
the poor from a liberal perspective, reported Wednesday that most
states fail to provide adequate ``safety nets'' for the poor.
   The center's report, ``Holes in the Safety Nets,'' found broad
differences among the states in the quality of assistance provided
to the poor. It concluded that shortcomings exist in all regions of
the country and even in some states with sound economies and
above-average personal income.
   ``The extent of variations in state poverty policies makes a
strong case for an enhanced federal role, both in setting standards
and providing funds,'' the researchers said. ``Assistance to many
poor families would not then depend so much on where in this nation
they happen to live.''
   But center Director Robert Greenstein said that because budget
constraints probably will prevent sweeping changes at the federal
level, ``we believe that the principal choices made in determining
the quality of the state safety nets are likely to be those made in
each state capital.''
   ``To narrow some of these holes in the safety net, state action
is crucial,'' he said.
   The center studied government programs that provide cash,
medical and other assistance to the poor, and found that none of
the states nor the District of Columbia met all 10 standards in a
``reasonable adequacy'' test developed by the center.
   Twenty-nine states meet three or fewer of the criteria,
including Indiana and Texas, which meet none; just 14 states meet
more than half the criteria, including Minnesota and Massachusetts,
which did the best by meeting nine of the 10.
   The study found, for example:
   _In 32 states, maximum benefits from Aid to Families with
Dependent Children are below half the poverty line for a family of
three with no other income.
   _Twenty-eight states impose state income taxes on working
families living below the poverty line, and 10 tax the income of
families living below half the poverty line.
   _In 26 states, fewer than one in three jobless workers received
unemployment insurance in an average month in 1986.
   Greenstein told reporters that some of the states that are the
most stingy with benefits ``turn around and extract significant
amounts of the income of poor families through the tax system in
their states.''
   He said that because the assistance gaps are present in all
regions of the country and in states with both low and high
personal income, ``this indicates that really you're talking about
political questions'' in determining benefits.
   ``I think what you're seeing reflected ... on the most part is
the political weakness ... of low-income families,'' Greenstein
said.
   Here is a breakdown of which states met how many standards in
the 10-point adequacy test:
   _Zero: Indiana and Texas.
   _One: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North
Dakota and South Dakota.
   _Two: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,
Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, Tennessee and Wyoming.
   _Three: Hawaii, Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah,
Virginia and West Virginia.
   _Four: Alaska, Delaware, District of Columbia, Kansas, Nebraska
and North Carolina.
   _Five: Iowa and Maryland.
   _Six: Maine, Oregon and Washington.
   _Seven: Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Vermont and
Wisconsin.
   _Eight: California, Michigan, New York and Rhode Island.
   _Nine: Massachusetts and Minnesota.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III is launching
a counterattack against his critics and telling conservative
senators he won't resign in the absence of evidence of wrongdoing.
   Meese's private lawyers said Wednesday that a Senate
subcommittee report is ``seriously wrong'' in accusing Meese of
violating a White House policy by assisting scandal-plagued Wedtech
Corp.
   In addition, Meese's counselor at the Justice Department,
William Bradford Reynolds, claimed that subcommittee chairman Carl
Levin of Michigan hadn't given the panel's members an opportunity
to vote on the report.
   In response, Levin said: ``The report was circulated to every
member of the subcommittee for comment. ... Release of the report
was approved by the subcommittee members.''
   The report issued earlier this month says that then-White House
counselor Meese and his deputy violated a White House policy
barring contacts with procurement officials, resulting in
favoritism toward Wedtech.
   Meese's private attorneys, Nathan Lewin and James Rocap, said
the subcommittee report was incorrect because the White House
policy permits contacts with procurement agencies when the White
House has a legitimate interest in information about procurement
matters.
   President Reagan had campaigned in the South Bronx, N.Y., area
where Wedtech was located and had expressed an interest in
promoting jobs in the area.
   Independent counsel James McKay, who has been conducting a
criminal investigation of Meese's involvement with Wedtech and
other matters, is expected to issue a report in several weeks
raising ethical questions about the attorney general's behavior,
sources familiar with the investigation have said.
   Meese told seven conservative Republican senators on Wednesday
that if he resigned now it would be an admission of guilt when
there is no evidence he has done anything wrong, congressional
sources said.
   The attorney general made the comment after being asked by one
of the conservative senators whether he had weighed the possibility
of quitting, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Meese's 90-minute, closed-door luncheon at the Capitol came two
days after it was disclosed that the attorney general had fired his
staunchly conservative chief spokesman, Terry Eastland, allegedly
for not defending him aggressively enough.
   After the meeting, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., told reporters the
subject of Meese's future had come up ``peripherally.'' Helms
added, ``I assume he'll be attorney general for the rest of this
year.''
   The meeting was ``a good, candid, frank, amicable discussion
about the operations of the Justice Department,'' said Christopher
Simpson, press secretary for Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who also
attended the meeting.
   ``The best thing for all concerned is to wait to see the McKay
report,'' added Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   In related developments:
   _Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., has written to the House and Senate
Judiciary committees accusing Patrick S. Korten, Meese's new chief
spokesman, of making false statements while he was chief spokesman
for the Office of Personnel Management, The Washington Post
reported today.
   In a letter obtained by the newspaper, Ford said he was stunned
when Meese appointed Korten, who as OPM spokesman ``lost all
credibility ... as a result of repeated instances of false and or
misleading statements'' to the House Post Office and Civil Service
committee which Ford chairs.
   _Peter Flaherty, chairman of the Citizens for Reagan, a
100,000-member lobbying group, urged Meese to ``fight it out. ...
My impression is that the attorney general is anxious to confront
his critics and anyone who thinks Ed Meese is leaving soon is going
to be disappointed.''

<HEAD>Bill To Require Data On Hate Crimes Clears House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``hate crimes'' bill requiring the
government to keep figures on violence motivated by prejudice is on
its way to the Senate complete with a provision to tabulate crimes
against homosexuals.
   The House passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act 383-29 on
Wednesday after overwhelmingly rejecting an attempt to remove
attacks on homosexuals from the hate crimes list.
   Peri Jude Radecic, a lobbyist for the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, said the action fell short of a step towards gay civil
rights but was nevertheless encouraging.
   ``Members of Congress have recognized that anti-gay and
anti-lesbian violence is not acceptable in our society,'' she said.
``They are on record as not condoning it.''
   The measure passed by the House requires the Justice Department
to collect and publish data on the incidence of crimes motivated by
prejudice based on race, religion, ethnicity or homosexuality.
Homicide, assault, robbery, burglary, theft, arson, vandalism,
trespassing and threats would be tabulated.
   The FBI publishes an annual Uniform Crime Report on a variety of
crime based on information from some 16,000 state and local law
enforcement agencies. However, the report does not currently
include a national count of hate crimes.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on criminal justice, described a hate crime as ``an
act of violence which is accompanied by an additional motive: an
attempt to intimidate a larger group or class of people.''
   ``It is important to document that cross burnings are more than
`arson' and that swastikas painted on synagogues are more than
`vandalism','' said Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn., sponsor of the
bill.
   Conyers, Kennelly and others said comprehensive national figures
on crimes motivated by intolerance would enable law enforcement
authorities to spot trends in bigotry, develop enforcement and
educational strategies, and concentrate manpower in the right
places.
   House debate centered on the inclusion of hate crimes committed
against people on grounds of their sexual orientation, a provision
that was not in a similar bill passed by the House in the last
Congress.
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., argued that the provision would
elevate homosexuals ``to a position higher than other people who
are in perhaps worse circumstances.''
   He asked why the bill did not require separate data on crimes
against octogenarians, child abuse victims, bus passengers and
police officers killed in the line of duty. ``They are not included
here and they're all protectable groups of people,'' Gekas said.
   ``We are not talking about ... crimes committed against
passengers on a bus,'' countered Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., one of
two acknowledged homosexuals in Congress. ``There is no
centuries-old tradition of hatred against bus passengers,
policemen, the handicapped or the young.''
   Studds and others said hearings produced substantial evidence
that ``gay-bashing'' is frequent and on the rise, and in fact is
the most prevalent form of hate crime. They said deleting that
category from the bill would imply that violence against gays is
acceptable.
   The Gekas amendment was killed when the House voted 384-30 for a
substitute amendment that changed a phrase in the bill but had no
substantive effect. The successful measure, sponsored by Rep. John
Miller, R-Wash., replaced the phrase sexual orientation with a more
specific reference to homosexuality.
   Supporters of the bill include the American Civil Liberties
Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, several religious
groups and organizations representing police officers,
psychologists, homosexuals and women.
   The Reagan administration opposes the measure, contending its
data-collection requirements will be difficult and expensive to
meet, and be burdensome to law enforcement authorities.

<TEXT>
   A petition organized by a Christian human
rights group asks a Shiite Moslem religious leader in Beirut to
intercede on behalf of Westerners being held hostage in Lebanon, a
former captive said Wednesday.
   The prayerful plea, with 40,000 signatures, was carried out of
the United States this week and is expected to be delivered this
weekend to Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah in Beirut, said David
Jacobsen, who spent 17 months in captivity.
   The wording of the petition was carefully worked out in
consultation with Shiite religious leaders, Jacobsen said in a
telephone interview at his home in Huntington Beach, 32 miles south
of Los Angeles.
   Reading from a copy of the petition, Jacobsen said it reads:
``In the name of one merciful God, we the undersigned wish to
express to you our concern and prayers for the hostages held
captive in Lebanon.
   ``We also pray for the countless Lebanese held captive in
Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East.
   ``As believers in almighty God we have faith that prayer is more
powerful than armies or contingents of diplomats. Because of this
we respectfully ask you to pray with us and to do whatever you can
to intercede on behalf of all these hostages and captives.'''
   Fadlallah is a Shiite Moslem religious leader associated with
the Hezbollah, or the Party of God,
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is the group believed responsible
for the kidnapping of Americans, British and other Westerners in
Lebanon.
   ``What makes this so very important is that a story came out
Tuesday in which Sheik Fadlallah said the only way the hostages can
be released is through direct talks with the abductors,'' Jacobsen
said.
   It is hoped that Fadlallah can facilitate those talks, Jacobsen
said.
   A total of 18 Westerners are being held in Lebanon, including
nine Americans. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, has been held captive longest. He was
kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   Jacobsen, 57, was released by his captors in Beirut on Nov. 2,
1986, after being held for 17 months. He was working as the
hospital administrator at the American University Hospital in
Beirut when he was seized on May 28, 1985.
   Jacobsen said the petition specifically asks Fadlallah to ``join
us in prayer'' for the safe return home of Anglican church envoy
Terry Waite, who was taken hostage last year while trying to
negotiate the release of other Western captives.
   The petition concludes, ``We share with you the desire to see
all people safe and at peace, and we agree with your statement,
`Neither Islam nor Christianity justify kidnapping.'''
   The petition was organized by Friends in the West, a small
Protestant group based in Seattle, Wash., that has worked quietly,
but tirelessly for the release of the hostages since 1986, Jacobsen
said.
   Jacobsen asked that the leader of Friends in the West not be
named, saying it may endanger his life, or his freedom, in further
efforts to free the hostages.

   Members of Congress say they'll accept
President Reagan's call for a bipartisan anti-drug task force, but
some question his election-year timing and wonder why he didn't act
sooner.
   Reagan called Wednesday for the task force to find a consensus
within 45 days on all aspects of the anti-narcotics campaign, and
said the battle against illegal drugs is in danger of being
``tripped up'' by political debate.
   Reagan's proposal comes as his administration faces mounting
criticism on the drug issue, most notably for its willingness to
consider dropping drug charges against Panamanian military leader
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   And with elections approaching, the nation's politicians are
trying to outdo each other as foes of drug abuse. Presidential
candidates speak of the issue, lawmakers are demanding that the
military be more involved, and congressional task forces in both
houses are studying new, comprehensive legislation to supplement a
major 1986 drug bill.
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y. and chairman of the House select
committee on narcotics, said of Reagan: ``In this political year,
he thought there was still something more that had to be done and I
could not agree with him more.''
   But Rangel noted that the task force proposed by Reagan would
report ``on the eve of the Democratic convention this July and the
August Republican convention.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said Wednesday,
``We welcome the president's belated leadership. We are ready to
cooperate with him.
   ``We have already begun to work,'' Byrd said. ``The
administration has been lax in the treatment of this subject. The
president has suddenly decided he will cooperate with the
Congress.''
   On Tuesday, Byrd appointed a ``Working Group on Substance
Abuse'' as part of the Senate's Democratic Caucus. The group, to
report by June 29, will work to ``expedite the consideration of
legislation to strengthen existing drug laws and to provide
additional resources for the drug abuse crisis.''
   Reagan made his comments in New London, Conn., in a commencement
address at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.
   ``If we cannot remove the politics from drugs, how can we hope
to remove the drugs from our communities, workplaces and schools?''
Reagan asked his audience of 159 white-uniformed, graduating cadets
and their relatives.
   ``Illegal drug use is the foremost concern in our country. And,
frankly, as I finish my final year in office and look ahead, I
worry that excessive drug politics might undermine effective drug
policy,'' he said.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said he ``welcomes the
administration's interest in the drug issue'' and pointed out that
the House established its own bipartisan task force on May 9 to
produce a new drug bill.
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla. and a member of the House narcotics
committee, said Reagan was ``plowing old ground. We already had
task forces and already had bills with bipartisan support. This is
a feeble attempt to justify what has been a failed policy.''
   But a Republican member of the panel, Rep. Duncan Hunter,
R-Calif., said the administration alone cannot be blamed for
problems in the war on drugs. He said the House Democratic
leadership tried to block his amendment to the defense bill that
would require the military to seal U.S. borders against drug
smugglers within 45 days after enactment.
   The amendment passed 385-23 and its fate will be decided in a
House-Senate conference. The Senate, by 83-6, passed a less
sweeping amendment to get the military involved.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said he was ``delighted to hear
President Reagan once again declare illegal drugs `public enemy No.
1.'''
   The senator said he and Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y. have
spent nine months drafting a comprehensive drug bill, and suggested
it be used as a blueprint for the president's task force.
   D'Amato was critical of Reagan on Wednesday.
   ``If we took action, there wouldn't be any necessity for
rhetoric,'' he said. Speaking of the bipartisan commission, D'Amato
said, ``It is unfortunate that it took the Congress to drag the
administration, kicking and screaming, to the altar on doing
something about drugs.''
   Reagan said his task force should produce a report on issues
such as how the military should be involved in the campaign and
whether the death penalty should be imposed when a police officer
or other people are killed as a result of drug trafficking.
   ``Our task force should agree on solutions for every area of the
drug problem, from blocking supplies to curtailing demand, from
treatment to education to prosecution, from interdiction and
confiscation to eradication _ nothing should be overlooked or ruled
out,'' the president said.

   NBC is hoping that Bill Cosby will still be
having such fun in his fifth year of ``The Cosby Show'' that the
network can persuade its No. 1 star to stay on past next season.
   Cosby had said he would only do five years of ``The Cosby
Show,'' which quickly became the top-rated network show four
seasons ago and is credited with putting NBC into first place.
   ``This is our fifth season, and it's supposed to be our last, so
I'm going to have my fun this year _ not in messing up, but in
doing things even better,'' Cosby told advertisers here Wednesday
to get a peek at the network's fall lineup.
   ABC and CBS are also scheduled to announce their fall schedules
this month.
   At a news conference, NBC Entertainment President Brandon
Tartikoff said the network hoped to persuade Cosby to stay after
next season.
   ``If he's having fun, and he's got stories to tell, we might
convince him to come back,'' said Tartikoff, though he added that
there had been no formal talks with Cosby.
   At Wednesday's presentation, NBC unveiled some of its new
series. Tartikoff insisted the network is not playing it safe with
the fall schedule, having canceled some successful but aging series
and adding stylish, new shows. Advertisers were shown clips from
some of them.
   ``Midnight Caller'' stars Gary Cole (``Fatal Vision'') as a
mouthy, troubled ex-cop who is persuaded by a radio station owner
to take on a late-night radio call-in show and becomes a cult hero.
The show is set in San Francisco. The clips from the pilot looked a
little derivative _ it was directed by Thomas Carter, the talented
director of the ``Miami Vice'' pilot _ but Cole is a charismatic
actor, and the series shows promise.
   ``Baby Boom,'' based on and produced by the same people who did
the movie of the same name, stars Kate Jackson in the Diane Keaton
role as a high-powered career woman suddenly saddled with an infant
she inherits from a distant relative. The clips got laughs from
advertisers, and the show looks to be a sophisticated winner.
   Another tantalizing, sophisticated hour-long series,
``Tattinger's,'' comes from the producers of ``St. Elsewhere'' and
shows the same smart dramatic and comic twists. It stars Stephen
Collins, sure to be a new TV heartthrob, as a flamboyant, recently
divorced restaurauteur who battles rude cabbies, drug dealers and
mobsters while courting his long-suffering ex-wife (Blythe Danner).
   Another virtually certain hit is ``Dear John,'' starring fine
comic actor Judd Hirsch (``Taxi'') as a newly divorced middle-aged
man. It is based on a BBC series of the same name and will go into
NBC's Thursday lineup of hit comedies.
   Likewise ``Empty Nest,'' from the makers of ``Golden Girls,''
starring Richard Mulligan as a recently widowed pediatrician
contending with life and kids. The show will follow ``Golden
Girls'' on Saturday night, and there will be some crossover of
characters between the two series.
   NBC canceled ``The Facts of Life,'' ``Crime Story,'' ``A Year in
the Life,'' ``Our House,'' ``Beverly Hills Buntz,'' ``The Bronx
Zoo'' and ``Aaron's Way.''
   ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd'' is getting a summer run on
Wednesday nights, and Tartikoff said if the show does phenomenally
well, which he didn't really seem to expect, it could come back.
   ``Day by Day'' and ``In the Heat of the Night,'' which were
spring replacement series, made the fall schedule.
   Tartikoff said it was a toss-up between ``Day by Day'' and ``My
Two Dads,'' but NBC is gambling on the appeal of teen star, C.B.
Barnes, of ``Day by Day.''
   Another star NBC is pinning hopes on is Mario Van Peebles of
``Sonny Spoon,'' an offbeat detective series that was also a
replacement series.
   Tartikoff said he regretted bidding farewell to ``Crime Story,''
but the hardest decision was canceling ``A Year in the Life.''
   ``There were some darlings of mine that in this game of musical
chairs, I could not get everybody to sit down,'' he said.

   A summer experiment with prime-time news on NBC
could turn into a fall series if the strike by the Writers Guild of
America doesn't end by mid-summer, says NBC Entertainment President
Brandon Tartikoff.
   Tartikoff told reporters in a satellite news conference
Wednesday that NBC plans to put a series of news specials,
prominently featuring Connie Chung, into the Tuesday 10 p.m. EDT
time period by the end of June.
   NBC has scored in the ratings this season with lifestyle
documentaries like Chung's ``Life in the Fat Lane'' and Maria
Shriver's ``Women in Prison,'' but NBC has not had a regular
prime-time news show since ``1986'' was canceled 1{ years ago. CBS
has three prime-time news hours: ``60 Minutes,'' ``48 Hours'' and
``West 57th.'' ABC has ``20-20.''
   NBC starts the season with prime-time coverage of the Summer
Olympics, but Tartikoff said if the writers' strike continues
through the summer, it could delay the start of NBC's entertainment
series, and a news show could fill in. NBC News writers are covered
by the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians,
not the Writers Guild.

<HEAD>Rabin: Jordan, Egypt Not Doing Enough to Stop Infiltrations</HEAD>

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin accused Jordan
and Egypt of not doing enough to prevent guerrilla raids into
Israel from their territory.
   Rabin made the comment Wednesday, a day after one Palestinian
guerrilla crossed the border fence between Jordan and Israel and
was wounded and captured by Israeli troops. Two other guerrillas
escaped back to Jordan.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the authorities in Egypt and
Jordan are doing sometimes not everything that can be done to
prevent the (infiltrations),'' Rabin said on Israel radio.
   Tuesday night's infiltration was the second from Jordan and the
13th attempt since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Since Dec. 1, guerrillas have twice tried
to enter Israel from Egypt.
   Rabin linked the increase in infiltration attempts to the
``intefadah,'' Arabic for uprising. He charged the PLO with
inciting terror attacks from Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt as well as
inside the occupied lands to breathe life into the rebellion.
   But Rabin said that thanks to the army's tough response, the
uprising was dying out. ``We have seen a gradual reduction of
civilian violent activities as a result of ... measures we have
taken such as arrests, administrative detentions, deportations,''
he said on a tour of the Gaza Strip.
   Jordan denied that the latest raid into Israel was launched from
its territory, saying it ``would never allow infiltrators to cross
from Jordan into occupied Arab territories.''
   In another development, Israeli troops backed by helicopters and
bulldozers on Wednesday carried out a pre-dawn raid on two Arab
mountain villages and were surrounded by hundreds of stone-throwing
Palestinians. Hospital officials said one Arab villager was killed
and 10 were wounded.
   Troops also shot and wounded four Arabs during a confrontation
in the marketplace of Nablus, the largest West Bank city, the army
said.
   The fatality Wednesday brought the Arab death toll in the
uprising to 191, according to U.N. figures. Two Israelis also have
died.
   Arab doctors said at least 20 Palestinians were injured by
beatings and rubber bullets during the clashes in Abwein and Arura,
neighboring villages north of Ramallah. Witnesses said hundreds
were arrested.
   An army spokesman confirmed one Arab was killed and nine
wounded. But he refused comment on the arrests or the reason for
the sweeps on the final day of Id el Fitr, the three-day Moslem
holiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.
   In both villages fighting lasted through Wednesday morning, with
helicopters dropping tear gas, before soldiers gained control and
moved from house to house in search of suspects, witnesses said.
   In Arura, troops rounded up about 300 teen-agers and young men
in a schoolyard, a 19-year-old Palestinian said from his hospital
bed in Ramallah.
   In Abwein, soldiers made no arrests, apparently because most
youths fled into the surrounding hills, said a merchant who would
only give his first name, Saam. But he said troops beat several
women and in some cases smashed furniture with clubs.
   Army bulldozers pushed aside roadblocks that had been set up by
villagers and forced residents to remove outlawed Palestinian flags
from a mosque tower and utility poles, witnesses said.
   A black flag of mourning fluttered from the home of Majdi
Youssef Hilal, a 16-year-old boy who was fatally shot in the chest
during the clashes.
   In Nablus, troops were attacked by youths throwing stones as
they patrolled the city's market, an army spokesman said.
   ``The troops fired at the Arabs when they were in danger,''
wounding four Palestinians, the spokesman said.
   The Defense Ministry on Wednesday ordered that teen-agers in the
Gadna paramilitary youth corps not be allowed to serve in areas
where Arab prisoners were held, the army said.
   A army spokesman said the order was in response to an incident
in which a teen-ager in the corps beat an Arab prisoner during a
visit to a detention center after being encouraged to do so by an
army sergeant.

Job</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aide to Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard
has moved into the top staff job at the Democratic Platform
Committee.
   Democratic officials revealed Wednesday the personnel shuffle
took place at the end of last week, a few days after the Democrats
held their first hearing on the 1988 platform.
   Rosemary Freeman, deputy director of the state of Michigan's
Washington office, is now acting executive director of the platform
committee in addition to her duties as its press secretary.
   Cynthia Lebow, who quit her post as general counsel of the
Senate Judiciary Committee to head the platform committee staff
March 1, has been reassigned as a special assistant to Democratic
Party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr.
   Freeman said the personnel shuffle was done to make ``better use
of people and abilities'' and to ``maximize our strengths.''
   Lebow said, ``It's really just a question of using resources
best, especially when you're trying to do something long-distance.''
   She said in an interview that she has been helping the party
reach out to its constituent groups, especially women's and civil
rights groups, and will continue that work for Kirk ``for the
remaining 56 days until the convention.''
   The committee heard from several dozen witnesses, primarily from
stalwart liberal groups, at its first hearing May 10, and is
holding several more forums around the country over the next few
weeks.
   ``Having gotten that started, we're going to let Gov.
Blanchard's people, some very talented people from Michigan take
over and do the rest of the events, and the drafting,'' Lebow said.
   Lebow said, ``Kirk put me in the job with Blanchard's OK.'' Her
removal was ``a mutual decision by everybody _ Paul Kirk and
Blanchard and myself.''
   Kirk has instructed Blanchard's committee to keep the platform
short and styled as ``an open letter'' to the American people, not
weighted down with a myriad of special interest groups' pet
positions.
   A platform committee hearing on defense issues that was
postponed last Friday in Norfolk, Va., will be held this Friday in
Alexandria, Va.
   Blanchard and the rest of a 15-member drafting committee will
huddle on Mackinac Island, Mich., June 9-13 to draft the platform.
The full 163-member committee will take it up in late June.
   The platform is on the agenda July 19, the second night of the
party convention in Atlanta.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Baker Won't Write Book, but Others Have</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Howard H. Baker Jr. says top White House aides
have ``at least an implied commitment'' not to write about their
intimacy with power. If so, its a commitment as often honored in
the breach as in the observance.
   A quick survey shows that half a dozen people who have held
Baker's post of White House chief of staff, or its equivalent, have
written books about their experience. About the same number have
passed up the temptation.
   At least three of the chiefs of staff who have written books
have described tempestuous circumstances surrounding their
departures from the White House.
   Donald T. Regan, however, was apparently the first to rush into
print while the president he had served was still in office, which
partly accounts for the unprecedented furor his book has aroused.
   ``I don't think you ought to write those books,'' Baker told
reporters Wednesday. ``I think when you take a job like this that
there's at least an implied commitment that you're not going to
write books like that. If you're in daily, intimate contact with
the president in a decision-making process, I think there's an
obligation to treat that discreetly and confidentially.
   ``I do not intend to write a book,'' Baker said. ``I think the
bloom is off the rose now with the kiss-and-tell books and I very
much hope that that's a phenomemon that's going to subside and go
away.''
   Maybe so, but it's been around for a while. The very first
person to hold the title of White House chief of staff, Sherman T.
Adams, brought out a book about his experiences in 1961, one year
after the president he served, Dwight D. Eisenhower, left office.
   Like more recent ones, the book contained direct quotations from
the president's conversations, such as one in which Eisenhower told
Adams that the maneuverings of one GOP party leader ``looked like
pretty slippery business'' to him. Adams did not identify the party
leader.
   Regan also sprinkled his book with what appear to be direct
quotes from President Reagan, although he omitted the quotation
marks ``out of deference to the office and the man'' except when he
was quoting what had appeared elsewhere.
   Adams' book, ``Firsthand Report,'' contrasts sharply with
Regan's in one respect. In the index, it has nine entries for first
lady Mamie Eisenhower. The index to Regan's ``For the Record'' has
half a column of entries for Nancy Reagan and nine separate
headings covering his controversial disclosures of her interest in
astrology.
   Adams is one of the two previous chiefs of staff who, like
Regan, left office under fire _ Regan over his handling of the
Iran-Contra affair and Adams over his acceptance of gifts from
Boston industrialist Bernard Goldfine.
   Regan, describing his abrupt replacement by Baker, recounts an
angry telephone conversation in which he told Reagan he had
``deserved better treatment'' and the president replied only that
he was sorry.
   Adams, who had a reputation for reticence, wrote that when he
handed the president his proposed statement of resignation,
Eisenhower ``said that he wanted nobody but me to make this
decision and that under the circumstances he thought I had acted
wisely.''
   In contrast to this low-key account, H.R. Haldeman wrote a
dramatic recital of his dismissal by Richard Nixon at Camp David,
with Nixon telling him that the night before he had ``prayed that I
wouldn't wake up in the morning.''
   Haldeman said he was touched by the president's words, but was
hurt to discover after a Nixon television interview in 1977 that
the president had spoken the same words to John Ehrlichman in
firing him the same day. In fact, he said it was this interview
that prompted him, almost four years after leaving the White House,
to write his book, ``The Ends of Power.''
   He said the effect of the Nixon interview was to ``distort and
confuse'' Watergate issues.
   The most recent chief of staff to break into print was Hamilton
Jordan, whose 1982 book, ``Crisis,'' dealt with the last year of
the Carter presidency. Other books by top White House aides include
``A Political Education,'' published in 1972, by Harry C.
McPherson, who was special counsel to President Johnson, and two
books about the Kennedy administration by Theodore Sorensen. Both
Andrew Goodpaster, who took over many of Adams' duties, and
Alexander Haig, who succeeded Haldeman, have written books but they
did not deal with their White House days.

<HEAD>Teamsters President Has Surgery To Remove Tumor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teamsters union President Jackie Presser
was recovering well following successful surgery to remove a
malignant tumor from inside his skull, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Presser underwent the operation Tuesday at Barrow Neurological
Center at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, Deborah Gelbart
said Wednesday.
   The 61-year-old Cleveland man was recovering well and without
complications, but no further information was being released at the
request of his family, Ms. Gelbart said.
   She said that decisions on further treatment would be delayed
until next week, ``pending review of all post-operative studies.''
   An Ohio newspaper reported that Presser was diagnosed as having
brain cancer two weeks ago. He was transferred from the Cleveland
Clinic to Barrows on May 11.
   Presser, who has been the president of the nation's largest
union since 1983, relinquished his duties for four months effective
May 4 because of health problems.
   He underwent surgery for a malignant lung tumor in January 1987
in Cleveland.
   The hospital said the malignancy removed Tuesday apparently had
spread from the cancer that led to the earlier operation.
   Presser, elected to a five-year term in 1986 as head of the 1.6
million-member union, is scheduled to stand trial July 12 in U.S.
District Court in Cleveland.
   He is charged with embezzlement and racketeering on allegations
that he took $700,000 from his hometown union local in Cleveland,
and paid it to ``ghost'' employees who performed no work.
   Presser pleaded innocent to the charges.

   Recipe for a potentially record-winning
burrito: mix 70 pounds of beans with 70 pounds of meat, spread it
in 750 tortilla shells and sprinkle with 15 pounds of cheese.
   And hope the locals like Mexican food.
   The 444-foot-long burrito, constructed Wednesday by students at
Tennessee Technological University, was divided into 600 six-inch
pieces that went for $1 each.
   But the sponsor's goal was bigger than the public's appetite:
about half the big burrito was left over and had to be thrown away.
   Still, the project raised $300 for the Cookeville Rescue Mission
for the homeless, said Bob Hagemann, a spokesman for Tennessee Tech.
   The goal was to build a 500-foot burrito, but the weather
interfered as workers tried to cover 65 tables with the flour
tortilla shells in preparation for stuffing.
   ``It was too windy a day. All of our burrito flours (tortilla
shells) were flying away,'' said Jeff Dishman, shift manager for
the Cookeville Taco Bell, which helped build the burrito.
   Denver burrito builders hold the Guinness Book of World Records
award for the largest burrito _ a 400-footer _ said Joseph Null,
assistant manager of Taco Bell.
   Guinness officials were invited Wednesday, but none showed up,
Dishman said. But he said the organizers plan to send Guinness some
photos of the burrito and a sworn statement from the Cookville
mayor in the hope they will be declared the new champion.

   The late head of West Germany's
Jewish community may not have acted alone in the apparent
embezzlement of millions of dollars of government funds earmarked
for Holocaust survivors, prosecutors say.
   The family attorney for Werner Nachmann, who died in January,
said on Wednesday that he had been unable to determine where the
missing money had gone and that Nachmann may have squandered much
of it.
   The family has filed for bankruptcy in Karlsruhe, where Nachmann
lived and ran a wholesale textile business.
   Nachmann, who headed the Central Jewish Council for 23 years
until his death from a heart attack at age 62, may have had
accomplices in the scheme, said Manfred Roething, a spokesman for
the Karlsruhe prosecutor's office.
   He said investigators would seek to determine ``whether other
parties may be liable for prosecution as accessories.''
   Government officials have vowed to bring the truth to light. A
top aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl is to meet Friday with Heinz
Galinski, who succeeded Nachmann as council president.
   Jewish leaders have expressed shock and outrage. They say they
believe Nachmann had for years embezzled money earmarked for
Holocaust survivors around the world, which he was in charge of
disbursing.
   Galinski said Nachmann appears to have stolen more than $6
million.
   But Peter Paepcke, the Nachmann family attorney, said he
believes the late Jewish leader may have embezzled up to $15
million and used some of it to bolster his failing business.
   Paepcke, who said he had worked for Nachmann for a decade,
indicated he believed Nachmann had squandered some of the money. He
said he filed for bankruptcy March 30 for Nachmann's heirs and the
Karlsruhe-based company.
   ``I do not understand this yet,'' he told West German
television. ``The sums of money that were apparently taken should
have been more than enough to cover (the Nachmann business')
debts.''
   ``I can only conclude that perhaps the money also went
elsewhere,'' he added without elaboration.
   Eberhard Braun, a court-appointed investigator who has been
examining Nachmann's financial records, told The Associated Press
he found unexplained income of $13 million in Nachmann's company
records.
   Jewish leaders vowed to launch their own investigations to help
clear up the case.
   ``We will use all legal means at our disposal to take action
against everyone who took part in this,'' Hanover Jewish leader
Michael Fuerst said in a telephone interview.
   Nachmann, who became Jewish Council president in 1965, was in
charge of disbursing about $236 million that had been allocated by
the government in 1980 for Holocaust survivors who had not
previously made reparations claims.
   Those funds were in addition to the $47 billion already paid by
West Germany to Holocaust victims or their families.
   Nachmann is suspected of having taken interest that accumulated
from the funds appropriated in 1980 and transferring it to other
accounts, including his private business, according to newspaper
and other media reports.
   Nachmann's family fled Nazi Germany to France in 1938. He
returned to Karlsruhe in 1945 and began working toward
re-establishing Jewish communities in the country.

<HEAD>Administration Says Minimum Wage Increase Could Cost 850,000 Jobs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The White House has entered the congressional
fray over a proposed increase in the minimum wage, arguing that it
could cost 850,000 jobs while adding to the budget deficit.
   Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisors, says even the smallest increase under
consideration, raising the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.65 per
hour by 1992, would cost 600,000 jobs.
   Those losses ``would be concentrated among younger, less skilled
and minority workers,'' he said.
   A chart supplied by Sprinkel indicates an increase in the
minimum wage to $5.05 an hour over four years would eliminate
850,000 jobs by 1992.
   Legislation to raise the minimum wage $4.65 by 1991 was
introduced last year, but the House Education and Labor Committee
raised the figure to $5.05 per hour over four years. The original
bill proposed by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., is pending in the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, which Kennedy chairs.
   ``Increasing the minimum wage would have adverse effects on
employment, unemployment, economic output and on the budget
deficit,'' Sprinkel said in a letter to Rep. Thomas E. Petri,
R-Wisc., a committee member.
   ``Increasing the federal minimum wage would do little to help
the working poor; under 20 percent of minimum wage workers are poor
and many would lose employment,'' Sprinkel wrote in the letter,
released Wednesday. ``The direct impact on the budget deficit would
be about $2 billion, due to both increased budget outlays and
reduced revenues.''
   He also said consumers would have to absorb roughly $13 billion
more in higher costs for the products that minimum-wage workers
help to produce.
   Democrats have argued that a minimum wage would have a minimal
effect on unemployment and the economy, and Kennedy denounced
Sprinkel's findings in a statement released Wednesday night.
   ``That's preposterous,'' he said. ``The president could have
obtained a more reliable estimate of the job effect from Joan
Quigley,'' the San Francisco astrologer contacted by Nancy Reagan
for advice..
   Petri sought Sprinkel's assessment of the minimum wage
legislation after charging that the Democratic leadership had
attempted to suppress a Congressional Budget Office report that
said an increase to $5.05 an hour will cost up to 500,000 jobs.
   The draft study was sent to House labor Chairman Augustus
Hawkins, D-Calif., who returned it to the CBO, asking only the
costs of the bill and not its economic impact.
   House Republicans charged that the CBO ``deliberately censored
information pertinent to consideration of the bill or was
specifically instructed to do so and followed that instruction,''
according to a letter from House Minority Leader Robert Michel,
D-Ill.
   Sprinkel said an earned income tax credit (EITC), an alternative
proposed by Petri but rejected by the House labor committee, would
target assistance to families of the working poor more directly
than an increase in the minimum wage.
   Petri plans to place his proposal for a wage supplement which
would base the credit on family size before the full House when the
legislation reaches the floor.
   ``Without the same adverse effects on the economy, and with
comparable or even smaller budgetary cost than the proposed
increased in the minimum wage, an expanded EITC would target
increased income to working heads of larger families below or close
to poverty level,'' said Sprinkel.

<HEAD>Masters And Johnson Defend Research Before AIDS Commission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sex therapists William H. Masters and Virginia
E. Johnson say they published their controversial book on AIDS
because too little attention was being paid to the potential spread
of the disease among heterosexuals.
   Ms. Johnson told the White House AIDS commission on Wednesday
that the authors did not mean to create ``panic in the streets,''
but wanted to ``counteract an earlier absence of openness, of
honesty in collaboration'' on the part of government officials.
   Federal health officials have criticized the book for suggesting
AIDS is spreading more rapidly among sexually active heterosexuals
than projected by official government estimates.
   Another criticism is that the Masters-Johnson findings did not
go through the ``peer review'' process required for publication in
a major medical journal.
   ``There would have been no way to publish in journals,'' said
Masters, citing both the length of the material and what he said is
traditional difficulty in getting sex research accepted in such
forums.
   ``Books are the characteristic mode of publishing in the field
of sex research, which is our field,'' added Dr. Robert C. Kolodny,
a long-term associate of the Masters-Johnson team and a co-author
of the book ``Crisis: Heterosexual Behavior in the Age of AIDS.''
   To commission chairman James Watkins' admonition that there
should be ``an element of solidarity, you might say, among the
scientific and medical community'' on AIDS, Kolodny replied:
   ``With all due respect ... the process of science is not and has
never been served by looking for unanimity of opinion. The process
of science has always been served by allowing people to speak on
varying interpretations.''
   Kolodny acknowledged the book's estimate that as many as 3
million Americans may have the virus without knowing it is about
twice as high as the official government estimate. But he
emphasized that the difference stems from different interpretations
of the same raw data available to both government and private
analysts.
   As to controversy over what is often called casual spread of the
disease, Kolodny said the book carefully distinguishes between
theory and saying ``as a practical matter, this is not something
you ought to worry about.''
   For example, on the question of risk of catching the virus in a
restaurant where a waiter or chief has AIDS ``we said in our book,
specifically, not unless you have sex or share needles with that
person.''
   On catching it from a toilet seat?
   ``We traveled here by public transportation and we all used the
toilets in those areas and that should address the practical
aspects of the risk,'' said Kolodny.
   ``We do not suggest for a minute that people not use public rest
rooms, but we do suggest that if the public place looks to be
contaminated with suspicious substances, blood or other materials,
we wouldn't have used that 15 years ago in the time before AIDS and
we don't suspect that anyone would really use that now.
   ``This is common sense. No one is claiming that the virus jumps
off a surface and bites you,'' Kolodny said.

<HEAD>DJ, D'Amato Staff Claim White House Refused Anti-Noriega Calls</HEAD>

   A New York disc jockey claims the White House
``acted very bizarrely'' when his listeners took the advice of Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato and called to complain about President Reagan's
handling of the situation in Panama.
   The White House switchboard refused to take the complaints
Wednesday or to transfer callers to a special presidential
inquiries extension, said Jim Kerr, a disc jockey with WWPR-FM, an
ABC affiliate in New York City.
   ``I spent two hours of my day today before I escaped from the
station taking all these phone calls from people saying, `I tried
to call the White House and they told us to call another number,'''
Kerr said.
   He said he believed the White House did not want to keep what
could be an embarrassing tally of the calls.
   ``The White House is now acting very bizarrely,'' he said.
   D'Amato spokesman Ed Martin said ABC ``thinks they're getting
jerked around because the president's giving a big drug speech and
they don't want to have anything critical like this.'' The
president stressed his administration's antidrug efforts in a
commencement speech at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on Wednesday.
   White House spokesman Ben Jarrett refused a reporter's request
to find out whether operators were refusing to transfer the calls.
   ``I don't know anything about the operators,'' he said. ``I'm
not going to track that down, I'm sorry.''
   He also declined to explain how the inquiries office functioned,
and refused a request to determine how the office decides when to
begin keeping a tally of calls on an issue.
   Jarrett said that office had received calls Wednesday about the
situation in Panama, but ``They didn't have a count of them and no
characterization of the answers.''
   But Martin said he got a call from a volunteer at the complaint
number ``who left a message with our reception area saying the
senator made some comments in New York today and we're getting a
flood of calls and we'd like to know what he said.''
   D'Amato, R-N.Y., went on the radio Wednesday morning expressly
to ask constituents to call the White House and complain about
reports that the United States is considering dropping drug charges
against Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.

<HEAD>Dukakis' Minority Supporters Beginning To Aggressively Court Black
Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black backers of Democratic front-runner Michael
Dukakis, who have seen Jesse Jackson reap almost unanimous black
support in the primary races to date, are now moving aggressively
to court the black vote for the November election.
   A group of 80 minority members who advise Dukakis has decided,
with his approval, to expand efforts to meet and talk with members
of the Jackson campaign and to lobby black leaders before the
Democratic National Convention in July.
   The group will be working to identify possible party platform
differences _ before the convention can put them in the spotlight.
   Also, there is to be a meeting later this month between the
Massachusetts governor and about 100 black leaders from across the
country. And there will be appearances by black Dukakis supporters
throughout the South in the next eight weeks.
   The Dukakis group's leader, long-time adviser Joseph Warren,
says he and Jackson go way back together.
   Warren, a college classmate of Jackson, said in an interview
this week, ``We went to civil rights fights together, to jail
together.''
   ``We see our role as getting out there now as advance folks,
getting out and letting our people know who this man is, much more
aggressively than we have in the past,'' Warren said.
   ``We feel that the people who are supporting Jesse Jackson ought
to know who Mike Dukakis is,'' he said. ``That investment at this
time is very important.''
   Besides Warren himself, the group of minority Dukakis supporters
includes many black leaders with ties to Jackson aides.
   Jackson supporters have threatened to fight delegate-selection
and other rules at the convention. But Warren said he hoped
increased communication between the campaigns would allow Dukakis
and Jackson to settle other differences and avoid public feuding
that could alienate black Jackson supporters.
   ``We're going to talk unity,'' Warren said. ``But there are only
two guys who can make the final deal _ Mike Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson.''
   Robert Beckel, Walter Mondale's presidential campaign manager
who handled negotiations with Jackson in 1984, said Dukakis, who
speaks with Jackson at least weekly, appears to have a better
relationship with Jackson than Mondale did.
   ``Jackson believes that Dukakis respects him and that goes a
long way with Jackson,'' Beckel said. ``It's not a question of
getting something resolved now but to begin talking about how
you're going to do it.''
   Jackson campaign manager Gerald Austin declined comment when
asked if the Jackson campaign would cooperate with Warren and other
black Dukakis supporters. He said recently that he was speaking
frequently with Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich but that
those talks have not involved issues likely to arise at or just
before the convention.
   Dukakis has insisted the choice of picking a running mate is his
alone to make, and he is not expected to offer Jackson the No. 2
spot on the Democratic ticket.
   As his delegate lead has widened, Dukakis in recent weeks has
been more forceful in asserting differences with Jackson but still
has avoided direct criticism of the civil rights leader. Aides say
Dukakis is banking on winning the final primaries in New Jersey and
delegate-rich California on June 7 to lessen Jackson's bargaining
position heading into the Atlanta convention.
   Some Dukakis aides say privately that they fear a falling-out
with Jackson would cost the Democratic ticket black support it
needs to carry several states in the South. Publicly, however, the
aides profess only optimism.
   ``We feel strongly that Jesse will come out with us,'' Warren
said. ``We are looking forward to a fight with George Bush and we
are looking forward to locking arms with Jesse Jackson.''
   Christopher Edley, issues director for the Dukakis campaign and
a White House aide during the Carter administration, refused to say
whether he personally has had recent talks with Jackson aides.
   Edley, who is black, did say, ``I share my candidate's optimism
that we will be able to bring the party together without serious
acrimony on any front.''
   The meeting between Dukakis and the black leaders, most of them
already Dukakis supporters, is planned for Memorial Day in Boston.
Members of Warren's group and other black Dukakis supporters then
will fan out across the South and to Northern cities with large
black populations, holding rallies and meeting with black media
organizations to discuss Dukakis' record, Warren said.
   ``We want to get there early, not wait until after June 7 or
after the convention to sell the Dukakis message and the Dukakis
record,'' Warren said.
   An information package his group has put together says that
while minorities make up 6.7 percent of Massachusetts' population,
12 percent of Dukakis' judicial appointments have been minorities
and 13 percent of state workers are minorities.
   ``This isn't some Johnny-come-lately that we're all sitting here
window dressing because the national press is asking `Where is the
black presence around Michael Dukakis.' It's always been there,''
said Janet Langhart, a former Boston television personality serving
as a Dukakis media adviser.

   U.S. and Soviet diplomats met to talk
about efforts to end Angola's 13-year civil war and lead South-West
Africa to independence.
   Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, met on Wednesday with Anatoly Adamishin, deputy foreign
minister, at the U.S. Embassy.
   U.S.-sponsored mediation seeking peace in Angola and neighboring
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, was stalled for years
over demands by each side that the other withdraw its forces from
Angola first.
   However, talks progressed in recent weeks after a joint
Angolan-Cuban proposal in March for phased withdrawal of Cuban
troops.
   Angola's Marxist government and its Cuban supporters are
fighting rebels for control of the former Portuguese colony. The
rebels are backed by South Africa and the United States.
   South Africa rules Namibia in defiance of a U.N. resolution.
   Referring to Wednesday's talks, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan
Clyde said in Lisbon: ``They're here to discuss the (southern
African) regional issues _ certainly the Angolan and Namibian
points.''
   Reporters were not allowed into the embassy complex, and Ms.
Clyde said neither Crocker nor Adamishin would make any public
statements.
   The discussions followed a meeting of delegations from Angola,
Cuba and the United States on May 2-3 in London. South Africa held
a second meeting with the Angolans in Brazzaville, Congo, last week.
   Both envoys to Wednesday's session were to leave today to report
to their governments before the Moscow summit beginning May 29
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Best Elementary Schools Cut Across Income, Ethnic Lines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When Virginia B. Calvin got word that her
South Bend, Ind., elementary school had been chosen as one of the
nation's best, she made good on a promise to her pupils and kissed
the concrete steps to the building.
   ``I told you if we won this, I'd kiss the steps you walk on,''
said the overjoyed principal of Muessel School as students watched
her fulfill the pledge.
   Her jubilation was shared by the principals, pupils, teachers
and parents at 286 other schools across the country Wednesday, from
a posh private academy in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich., to a largely
Hispanic public school in Chandler, Ariz., to a Chevy Chase, Md.,
school for the learning disabled.
   All made the U.S. Department of Education's list of exemplary
elementary schools.
   Sidney I. DuPont, headmaster ofGrosse Pointe Academy in
Michigan, said, ``As an independent school in a pretty sharp place,
I'm not really too surprised we got it.''
   ``The real question remains, how close are we to No. 1?'' added
DuPont, whose school charges up to $5,700 tuition and whose parents
raised more than $500,000 at the school's spring auction last
weekend.
   At Frye Elementary School in Chandler, Ariz., one of 230 public
schools in the winners' circle, more than half the children are
Hispanic and nearly two-thirds qualify for free or reduced-price
meals because of their families' low incomes. But 75 percent read
at or above grade level, and their math scores are even higher.
   The award shows ``that a school doesn't have to have a
demographic breakdown that is mostly high socioeconomic to be
considered an excellent school,'' said Frye principal Ray Polvani.
``Too often in this country, a school is evaluated by the color of
the kids and their ethnicity or the socioeconomics. ... It
shouldn't be that way.''
   A power-sharing arrangement with Frye's teachers has helped the
school rack up achievement gains, said Polvani, as has a ``very,
very effective'' bilingual education program.
   At the Hebrew Academy of Greater Washington in Silver Spring,
Md., Rabbi Pinchos Hecht said the award ``means a lot. I can tell
you until tomorrow that we really do a good job. But when somebody
from the outside says it, it feels good.''
   The selections were made by 100 people from outside government _
only a third of them educators _ who reviewed more than 600 schools
nominated by state school superintendents and the Council for
American Private Education.
   Every state except Delaware and South Dakota produced at least
one winner. South Dakota did not nominate any school; one Delaware
school failed to make the final cut.
   Principals and other school representatives will be invited to
Washington in the fall to receive ``flags of excellence.''
President Reagan has hosted the ceremony in past years at the White
House.
   The schools were judged by their stated philosophy and goals,
organization, leadership, curriculum, instruction, climate,
character development and community relations.
   The program also gave extra attention this year to schools with
special math and science programs.
   The department honors exemplary elementary schools one year and
secondary schools the next. Junior highs usually compete among the
secondary schools.

   Michael Dukakis, riding an impressive
string of primary victories, is taking aim at the blocs of
delegates he needs to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Still several hundred delegates shy of a convention majority,
the Massachusetts governor was campaigning in New Jersey and
California. The states are the two big prizes on June 7, the day
that closes out the Democratic primary season.
   There are 314 Democratic delegates at stake in the California
primary and 109 in New Jersey. The other two June 7 states are New
Mexico with 24 delegates and Montana with 19.
   At a news conference on Wednesday, Dukakis brushed aside
Jackson's complaint that he was not getting his fair share of
support from the party and elected officials designated ``super
delegates'' to the nominating convention.
   ``I think Jesse has a perfect right to voice criticism of
whatever he chooses to criticize,'' Dukakis told reporters at the
Massachusetts Statehouse. ``I don't think we are going to have a
fight with Mr. Jackson.''
   After he arrived in New Jersey, Dukakis said of the Jackson
complaint, ``We all knew what the rules were going in.''
   Dukakis continued to insist that he won't start the process of
choosing a running mate until after he has clinched the nomination.
   Asked about reports he has designated his close friend and law
school classmate Paul Brountas to head the search for a vice
presidential candidate, Dukakis said: ``Nobody is heading my search
for a running mate. The search for a running mate will not begin
until the eighth of June.''
   But Dukakis also said he hoped to have chosen a running mate
before the Democratic convention convenes in July.
   ``I would hope that decision would be made before the
convention,'' he said.
   Dukakis has been getting plenty of advice about where to turn
for the second spot on the Democratic ticket, most of it centering
on members of the Senate.
   Among the names mentioned most often were Sens. Sam Nunn of
Georgia, Bob Graham of Florida, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, John Glenn
of Ohio and Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
   Asked about the home-state favorite when he arrived in New
Jersey, Dukakis said of Bradley, ``I like him.''
   But Bradley said Wednesday he doesn't want to be vice president.
``No, no, no. It's as firm and strong as I can make it,'' he said.

   Iranian speedboats attacked a Norwegian
tanker twice in the Strait of Hormuz on Thursday, shipping
executives said. It was Iran's second foray against neutral vessels
in two days in the Persian Gulf.
   The executives identified the tanker as the 55,173-ton Berge
Strand, an empty liquefied petroleum gas carrier. Its destination
in the gulf was not immediately determined.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did
not know what weapons were used against the vessel in the first
attack, at 6:30 a.m. (10:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday).
   The Berge Strand began sailing to the southern gulf port of
Dubai for repairs on minor damage. There were no injuries reported.
   An hour later the speedboats returned and fired four rockets at
the ship, injuring one person, the sources said. They said that the
Berge Strand developed engine problems after the second raid, but
had no further details.
   Iran attacked the Japanese-owned chemical tanker Ace Chemi on
Wednesday.
   A fire started on the 6,730-ton Ace Chemi that forced its
Japanese captain and 16 South Korean crewmen to abandon ship in
Hormuz, the gulf's only outlet. All were rescued by salvage tugs,
said shipping executives who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In the ground war, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
said Iranian forces killed or wounded 2,000 Iraqi troops and
captured more than 10 square miles of northeast Iraq in an
operation that began Tuesday night. It said many Iraqi troops were
taken prisoner. There was no comment from Iraq.
   The U.S. Central Command said the Navy's 32nd convoy of the year
was sailing south through the gulf. It included one U.S.-flagged
Kuwaiti tanker, the 46,723-ton Gas Prince, escorted by the missile
frigate Copeland.
   The Ace Chemi attack was the first by Iranian gunboats on a
neutral vessel since April 24. It came one month after a major
clash with U.S. naval forces in which six Iranian craft were sunk
or disabled.
   It also was the first since the Reagan administration began a
new policy May 3 that permits Navy ships to intervene in attacks on
commercial vessels on request regardless of what flag they are
flying.
   Iranian officials recently declared their policy of
blow-for-blow retaliatory attacks on neutral shipping would
continue.
   The Ace Chemi raid happened 11 miles south of Iran's Larak
island oil terminal as the Panamanian-flagged ship was heading into
the gulf, bound for the Saudi Arabian oil port of Jubail for a
cargo of petrochemicals, the sources said.
   U.S. warships were on patrol as usual in the area at the time of
the 8 a.m. attack and monitored the tanker's distress call on
radio. But the nearest U.S. vessel was 60 miles away, a two-hour
sail at top speed, said Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke.
   Iraq has claimed a dozen raids, six of them independently
verified, on Iranian tankers and terminals since April 29. The
raids seek to strangle oil exports that support Iran in the
7{-year-old gulf war.

<HEAD>Carlucci OKs Development of Missile Rail System; Contracts Let</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has awarded two contracts
totaling almost $329 million to develop a rail-car launching system
for the MX nuclear missile, the Pentagon says.
   The contracts were let after Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
authorized full-scale development of such a `rail garrison' system.
   ``As currently configured, the `rail garrison' system will
consist of 50 missiles, based aboard 25 trains with each carrying
two missiles,'' a Pentagon statement said.
   The MX, a 10-warhead, 195,000-pound missile, is now entering the
Air Force's inventory as a silo-based weapon. President Reagan has
asked Congress to allow deployment of 100 of the missiles, but so
far only 50 have been authorized.
   Reagan, in a bid to obtain approval for the second 50, proposed
in December 1986 that a rail version of the missile be produced to
improve its survivability in the event of a Soviet attack.
   His proposal is known as rail garrison because it envisions
placing MX missiles on rail cars that would remain inside military
bases, or garrisons, until there was a threat of attack. Only then
would they scatter across the country on the commercial rail
network.
   Unlike the Soviet Union, the United States currently does not
have any mobile intercontinental missiles.
   The Air Force contracts are for the construction and testing of
the missile-carrying, launch control and security rail cars that
will be needed to make the 71-foot missile mobile.
   A $167 million contract was awarded to Westinghouse Electric
Corp.'s Marine Division in Sunnyvale, Calif., to design, develop
and test the missile launch car.
   The second contract, worth $161.7 million, was awarded to
Rockwell International Corp.'s Autonetics Electronics Systems
Division in Anaheim, Calif., for the design, development and
testing of the launch control system, launch control car and
security car.
   Both contractors will be expected to complete their work by July
1992, the Pentagon said.
   The Air Force has said it expects each train to include two
locomotives and six cars _ two missile launch cars with missiles
inside; one launch control car; two security cars, and one
maintenance car.
   Congress has generally endorsed the idea of developing a mobile
missile, but is now locked in a debate over whether to produce a
rail version of the MX or a much smaller, single-warhead missile
known as the Midgetman that could be fired from a truck launcher.

   Tess ``Tweety'' Twietmeyer has graduated
from high school, 78 years after she dropped out.
   The 94-year-old Twietmeyer was honored with the rest of Greeley
County High School's 1988 class after completing her General
Education Development course.
   About 150 people attended a reception for her, celebrating under
a banner that said ``Congratulations, Tweety.'' Her four children
and 12 of her 18 grandchildren traveled to Tribune in western
Kansas for Sunday's event. President Reagan sent a telegram.
   Twietmeyer said her daughter first suggested she finish high
school. Her instructor, Carol Coe, said she could quit any time if
she didn't like it.
   ``So I thought, `Well, I guess it's worth a try,'' Twietmeyer
said.
   Her course of study included reading, writing, social studies,
science and math. She said she always liked math, but had doubts
about the other subjects.
   ``I got excited about it and studied really hard,'' said
Twietmeyer, whose husband died in 1948.
   Her GED papers show that she scored a 47.4, more than twice the
average score.
   Twietmeyer, who dropped out of school at age 16 because of
recurring ear aches and sore throats, said she keeps busy by
playing bridge and drums in a senior citizens band. She also
exercises every day.
   `I'm busy all the time,'' she said. ``I do everything myself. I
keep active, and I walk everywhere. I don't drive.''

<HEAD>Dissident Reports That Thousands Rally in Armenia</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Sakharov</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people rallied in Armenia to tell
authorities the sentencing of an Azerbaijani man does not address
their demands that a neighboring region be annexed, a dissident
source said.
   ``They think the problem goes deeper than sentencing guilty
people,'' Vladimir Ryabokon, an editor of the dissident journal
Express-Khronika, said Wednesday.
   Ryabokon said about 15,000 Armenians rallied in the streets of
Yerevan, the Armenian capital, on Tuesday, a day after Talekh
Salekh Ogli Ismailov was found guilty of premeditated murder and
given the maximum sentence of 15 years.
   It was the first conviction in connection with three days of
rioting that broke out in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait on Feb.
28.
   Ryabokon said there were no arrests by police during Tuesday's
protest.
   He said a few thousand people also gathered in Stepanakert, the
major city of Nagorno-Karabakh, after Ismailov was sentenced to
stress that they consider the annexation issue still not settled.
   Ryabokon said his information came from the weekly journal's
correspondent in Yerevan.
   Express-Khronika has been distributing information on dissident
activities and actions by various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union
since the fall.
   Armenians began agitating in mid-February for permission to
annex the predominantly Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region from
neighboring Azerbaijan. Their campaign apparently led to the riots.
   Thirty-two people _ 26 ethnic Armenians and six ethnic
Azerbaijanis _ were killed in the rioting.
   The Soviet government has refused to permit the annexation.
Instead, it has come up with a costly development program for
Nagorno-Karabakh to improve economic and social conditions.

   The chief chef at a popular seafood restaurant
chain returned to the hospital where he had been a patient recently
to perform some corrective surgery of his own. In the kitchen.
   As the specialist he is, Jean-Jacques Paimblanc supervised a
well-scrubbed staff of more than 100 at Beth Israel Hospital.
   A few watched as he made an incision into a cooked fish.
   ``Perfect,'' said Paimblanc, of Legal Sea Food's restaurants.
``It should taste moist, but not too soft. This is good.''
   For Wednesday's lunch and dinner, Paimblanc and two Legal Sea
Food employees oversaw preparation of 1,400 meals for patients and
staff at the 460-bed hospital.
   ``It just takes a little attention to make good, fresh meals,''
said Paimblanc. ``Hospitals serve fish sticks when they could get
in fresh fish. They serve frozen vegetables when they could buy
presliced fresh vegetables. It doesn't take much to make a much
better meal.''
   The items on the menu were identical to those served at Legal
Sea Food's six Massachusetts restaurants, including the fish
chowder included at President Reagan's inaugural dinner in January
1981.
   Paimblanc added a newly created low-calorie clam chowder with
clams and vegetables.
   ``With all the studies talking about the benefits of fish and
fish oils on health, it seems like hospitals should be talking a
closer look at their meals,'' Paimblanc said.
   ``We'll put the hospitals out of business if people keep eating
like this.''
   Gail DeLuca, Beth Israel's director of nutritional services,
said research is still ongoing on direct correlations between fish
oils and lower incidence of cardiac problems. The hospital omitted
a reference to fish oil's health benefits from the back of the
Legal Sea Food menu used at the hospital.
   Paimblanc, 54, was recovering from a mild infection 18 months
ago when he wandered into the Beth Israel kitchen bored by his
meals. He suggested trying his hand at preparing the hospital's
food for a day.
   On Wednesday, 250 pounds each of cod and tuna were baked or
broiled under the supervision of Paimblanc, who wove his large
frame through the crowded kitchen to inspect the meals.
   During a break in preparing the fish and stirring the chowder,
Paimblanc took time out for his own lunch.

<HEAD>Orders State to Buy Recycled Goods, Drop Polystyrene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has ordered the state
government to use recycled goods and stop buying polystyrene
products, an action that won the praise of environmentalists.
   ``It is time for us to get away from the notion of a throwaway
society and to do everything possible to promote use of recycled
and recyclable products,'' Dukakis said Wednesday in a statement
that aides admitted was printed on nonrecycled paper.
   The Democratic presidential front-runner signed an executive
order to phase out the purchase of polystyrene, whose production
has been blamed for harming the Earth's ozone layer. The order came
one day after a Canadian researcher warned that a hole in the ozone
layer may be developing above the North Pole.
   Earlier studies identified a seasonal hole over the South Pole
in the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful solar
radiation. Scientists have attributed the potentially damaging
ozone loss to chemical reactions touched off by
chlorofluorocarbons, a family of chemicals used in making plastic
foam.
   The foam, known as polystyrene and sold widely under the trade
name Styrofoam, was the target of Dukakis' order. Under its terms,
the state purchasing agent was told to immediately stop buying
disposable polystyrene products manufactured with
chlorofluorocarbons.
   As of June 1, the state will stop buying polystyrene products
that are not made from recycled materials. State officials said
recycled plastic foam is not considered a threat to ozone.
   Dukakis also ordered the state purchasing agent to expand
purchases of recycled paper, recycled aluminum and recycled
low-grade plastic products such as trash bags.
   In addition, the state will begin using ``composted soil
supplements'' in parks and roadsides wherever compost is available
and appropriate.
   ``What we have here is another example of how economic growth
can be combined with a commitment to the environment and high
standards of environmental protection,'' Dukakis told reporters at
a Statehouse news conference.
   On Monday, Dukakis won praise from environmentalists by joining
Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., in calling for an expanded moratorium
on exploratory oil drilling off the New England coast.
   On Wednesday, Dukakis said his goal was to boost the recycling
industry by expanding the supply of recyclable materials and the
market for recycled products. Aides said the state's purchases of
paper, aluminum and plastic amount to millions of dollars annually.
   According to the governor's staff, the state will incur a
slightly higher cost for purchases of recycled paper and an
increase of 5 percent or more on recycled aluminum.
   New York and Vermont earlier banned state purchases of
polystyrene, and 11 states have programs to encourage government
purchase of recycled materials, according to Massachusetts
environmental officials.
   Minnesota lawmakers recently banned the manufacture and sale of
foam products made with chlorofluorocarbons in the state starting
in 1990. But the packaging industry views the law as symbolic since
no such products are made in Minnesota.
   Judy Shope, of the Environmental Lobby of Massachusetts, said
the new policy puts Massachusetts in the forefront of recycling and
noted that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has yet to
adopt a similar requirement.
   ``Who knows? Maybe next year that will change,'' she said,
referring to Dukakis' presidential campaign.

   The British may have to discard their cherished
good manners to combat littering, the chairman of the Tidy Britain
Group said.
   ``I'm beginning to think we've been nice about it for a little
bit too long,'' Lord Parry told a conference Wednesday sponsored by
the anti-litter organization.
   Parry called for tougher enforcement of anti-littering laws. The
law permits fines of more than $700 for littering, but in 1986, the
average fine imposed was less than $60.
   Parry also suggested hiring wardens to ticket litterers, much
like meter maids ticket parking violators, and producing a ``black
book'' illustrating a community's litterers or even awarding a
``booby prize'' to the worst.
   A major soccer match can pile up 5 tons of garbage in and around
a stadium and on an average week, commuters leave 25 tons of
rubbish behind in the London Underground subway system, said Graham
Ashworth director-general of the group.

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A human rights group said Andrei
Sakharov, the Nobel Peace laureate, wrote Mikhail S. Gorbachev
critizing the Soviet leader for his handling of recent ethnic
unrest in the Soviet Union.
   ``Glasnost appears to be crushed when it is most needed,'' wrote
the nuclear physicist who won the Nobel prize in 1975.
   The Bukovsky Foundation, a lobby group for Soviet dissidents,
released excerpts of Sakharov's letter translated into English at
its annual Sakharov Conference on Wednesday, saying it was written
in April but never publicized.
   Sakharov was invited but did not attend the conference on
``Blank Spots in Soviet History,'' the Amsterdam-based organization
said.
   Now living in Moscow, Sakharov was exiled to the city of Gorky
from 1980 to 1986 for criticizing his nation's intervention in
Afghanistan.
   Expelled Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky, for whom the
foundation is named, on Wednesday predicted that Gorbachev will
have to increase consumer prices, and that could lead to unrest in
Soviet society.
   Gorbachev told Sakharov soon after receiving the letter that it
would be published in the popular English-language weekly Moscow
News if the dissident was willing to ``soften some of his
language,'' the foundation said in a preface to the letter.
   Sakharov refused, the foundation said. It added that the letter
was signed ``with deep and sincere respect.''
   The letter referred to clashes in February between ethnic
Armenians and Azerbaijanis in Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region,
where dozens of people died.
   ``In the context of perestroika, the Armenian population of
Karabakh raised its hopes that there may be a constitutional
solution to the problem,'' said Sakharov's letter.
   ``Glasnost,'' openness on selected social topics, and
``perestroika,'' restructuring, are key elements of Gorbachev's
program to reform the Soviet society and economy.

<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government and
the rebels have tentatively agreed to hold a third round of talks
in hopes of securing a lasting peace, the government announced.
   A communique issued Wednesday night said the U.S.-supported
rebels, known as Contras, have agreed to a government proposal to
hold the talks May 25-28 at an as yet undetermined location.
   The agreement was reached at meetings Tuesday and Wednesday
between deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco and Azucena
Ferrey, one of the five directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance.
   The meeting was held in Miami, where the Contras are based.
   According to the communique, the Sandinistas proposed that the
third meeting be held in Managua, as the previous two had been, but
the Contras appeared reluctant and delayed the decision on a site.
   Rebel leaders had complained that the Sandinistas restricted
their delegates to a hotel during the previous two meetings,
refusing to allow them to meet with domestic opposition political
leaders.
   On March 23, the two sides signed a preliminary peace accord in
the southern border post of Sapoa and a cease-fire that ends May 30
took effect.
   During the truce, the belligerents were to meet in Managua and
try to end the civil war that began in 1982 and has claimed more
than 26,500 lives.
   Since the Sapoa accords, the two sides have delineated seven
cease-fire zones into which the rebels are to move. But they remain
far apart on issues of democratic reforms and what role Contra
leaders will be permitted to assume in Nicaragua's political future.
   Until those issues are settled, the Contras say their fighters
will not enter the cease-fire zones and lay down their weapons.
   If peace talks do not resume by June 1, the Sandinistas have
threatened to mount an all-out offensive to try to wipe out the
rebels.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson was campaigning in
California's agricultural heartland today, sounding environmental
and farming themes as he searched for votes in the June 7 primary.
   At a stop in Fresno Wednesday night, Jackson suggested that past
comments by ``irresponsible public leaders'' could have helped set
the stage for an alleged assassination plot against him.
   A St. Louis couple, Londell and Tammy Williams, were charged
this week with conspiring to kill Jackson. According to court
papers, Londell Williams told an informant he was a white
supremacist, but investigators said they had not found evidence
linking him to any organized white supremacist group.
   Jackson suggested that racial hatred could have been fueled by
statements made during last month's raucous primary campaign in New
York. New York City Mayor Ed Koch criticized Jackson harshly and at
one point said Jews would be ``crazy'' to vote for him.
   ``The climate for this kind of antagonism and violence, of
course, has been set by many irresponsible public leaders (whose)
attacks based on race have set a divisive and dangerous climate,
such as the one...in New York in April, for example,'' Jackson told
reporters.
   However, Jackson vowed not to ``lower the tone of my campaign,
adding: ``I will keep dreaming.''
   Londell Williams, in an interview published today in the
Belleville, Ill., News-Democrat, said, ``I did not conspire with
anyone to kill any presidential candidate, especially Jesse
Jackson.''
   ``I'm sorry that this mess has been brought up,'' he said.
``This is a very bad mistake. I'm really sorry the man (Jackson)
has to hear anything like this. The man should not be afraid of
anything from me ... I could care less if he's elected president or
not.''
   Jackson, whose relations with the Jewish community have been
strained in the past, met Wednesday with some three dozen rabbis
and Jewish leaders.
   Jackson was beginning the day today in Bakersfield, with stops
set later in San Francisco.
   Jackson received a warm welcome at Fresno's Saroyan Theater from
a crowd of about 3,000, including toddler Jonathon Clark. Last
year, Jackson taped a public service announcement to appeal for a
new liver for the boy, then 10 months old, who needed the
transplant to survive. The child received the donor liver last May
and will celebrate his second birthday next month.
   Jackson hoisted the boy in his arms during the speech and told
the crowd of the ``challenge to save our children'' by putting a
higher priority on education and social programs.
   After the rally, Jackson reiterated his support for the United
Farm Workers' boycott on table grapes. And, questioned about
cleanup of pesticide contamination in San Joaquin Valley wells,
Jackson replied, ``It does not require additional laws, it just
requires commitments and enforcement.''
   Jackson criticized the Reagan administration record on
environmental and worker safety laws as ``scandalous.''

<TEXT>
   A top general said in a rare interview
that Taiwan's military could repel an invasion from Communist China.
   Hau Pei-tsun, chief of the general staff, said in the interview
with the Global Views Monthly magazine that Taiwan was building up
its defenses to deter an invasion from Communist China, which
maintains this island off its coast is a renegade province.
   Hau was quoted as saying that ``there has always been the threat
of a Communist Chinese armed invasion against Taiwan,'' although
Beijing might hesitate to launch such an attack because of negative
international reaction.
   ``But from the military standpoint alone, we still have chances
of winning,'' Hau was quoted as saying in the edition of the
magazine published Sunday. It said the interview was the general's
first with the media.
   Despite China's large amount of military equipment, Taiwan ``can
win by the quality of not only our defense equipment but our
troops,'' he was quoted as saying. The United States has been
Taiwan's main weapons supplier.
   Although Communist China has roughly 3 million troops while
Taiwan has fewer than a half million, Hau told the magazine that
China could not bring into play all its forces against the island.
``The room for battling is very small in Taiwan,'' he was quoted as
saying. ``They cannot fly thousands of aircraft, nor can they send
millions of troops here at the same time.''
   The Nationalist government based in Taiwan claims to be the
rightful ruler of all China, although it lost a civil war to the
Communists in 1949. Beijing has refused to rule out using force to
reunify with Taiwan, but tension has eased as unofficial contacts
have increased in recent years.

<TEXT>
   If you've got a big brain, a yen for the indoors
and little love of glamour or rawboned rigor, then America has just
the right job for you, according to the publishers of ``The Jobs
Rated Almanac.''
   Ranked as the best of 250 American jobs is a career few children
are likely to have heard of, much less name: an actuary. Next are
computer programmer, computer systems analyst, mathematician and
statistician.
   Typical, more glamorous children's career choices like being a
dancer, doctor or astronaut also fared poorly in the almanac's
overall listing because they rated at or near the bottom in at
least one of the six ranking criteria.
   According to the almanac, published this month by American
References Inc. of Chicago, the worst job listed in the ranking was
migrant worker, which rated near or at the bottom in all six of the
criteria.
   The second worst _ commercial fishing _ also was ranked low
because of long hours, seasonal work, high government regulation
and tough physical demands. That was followed by construction
worker, roofer, seaman, dairy farmer, roustabout, lumberjack,
cowboy and professional football player.
   Almanac Editor and Publisher Les Krantz identified the criteria
used to judge jobs as salary, stress, work environment, outlook,
security and physical demands.
   ``Most of the best paying jobs are performed in highly
competitive and physically confining environments for long hours,''
Krantz said. ``Don't expect a cushy job if you want to earn more
than $50,000 a year.''
   But ultimately, he added, ``The job best for an individual is
the one the person likes the best, and that depends a lot on
someone's priorities.''
   Astronauts have the worst working environment, with surgeons
second, the book concluded. Firefighters have the longest work
weeks and their jobs are the most stressful and physically
demanding, it said.
   But actuaries _ who interpret statistics to determine expected
personal losses due to sickness or disability and material losses
from disasters _ did well in all six categories.
   A 23-year old actuary in training, Mike Vaughan, said he agreed
with the assessment.
   ``Once the (training) exams are over, I'd say the stress would
be pretty much non-existent, and the job market is so open I could
just walk out and find a new job in a day,'' he said.
   Vaughan, who works for Allstate Insurance Co. in suburban
Northbrook, said his $31,000 annual salary ``was probably 20 to 25
percent higher than any other job I could have gotten, and it goes
up faster.''
   William Hermes, a fisherman for 47 years, said he wasn't
bothered by his job's low ranking and couldn't imagine making a
living any other way.
   ``It's the only job I've ever wanted,'' said Hermes, 62, owner
of Big Bay DeNoc Fisheries in Garden, Mich. ``You're out in the
open, you're your own boss and you don't have to answer to nobody.''
   Krantz said most of the information for the almanac comes from

<HEAD>Carlucci Tells Congress That Unneeded Bases Should Be Closed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, pointing
to the need to reduce the federal deficit, says he supports
congressional attempts to close unneeded military bases.
   ``It makes sense to look seriously now at closing bases, because
our military force structure is being reduced and growth in the
defense budget is being slowed,'' Carlucci told a House
subcommittee on Wednesday.
   ``We must stop spending money to operate bases we do not need,''
he said. ``Our increasingly scarce resources simply must be applied
to higher defense priorities, so that we do not jeopardize
America's national security interests.''
   Carlucci was testifying in support of a plan designed to
surmount the strong reluctance of Congress to allow military bases
to be closed.
   It calls for creation of a Pentagon commission to review bases
by Dec. 31 and recommend a list of which can be closed. Carlucci
would then have 15 days to accept or reject the entire list. His
decision would be made less than a week before the end of President
Reagan's term in office.
   The Pentagon estimates $2 billion to $5 billion could be saved
by closing the unneeded bases.

<HEAD>IRS Refunds Total $56 Billion So Far</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has refunded
$55.9 billion to taxpayers this year, slightly less than it sent
out last year, although the money went to more people.
   The IRS said Wednesday that 65.1 million couples and
individuals, or 80.4 percent of the returns that have been
processed so far this year, qualified for refunds. The refunds
averaged $860.
   The total number of refunds is up slightly, from 64.8 million
last year. The amount refunded declined, from $56.1 billion, as did
the average, from $866.
   Through May 13, the IRS had received almost 101 million returns,
an increase of 3.3 percent from the 97.7 million tallied during the
same period a year ago. The agency has processed 80.9 billion, up 1
percent from the 80 billion last year.
   The number of taxpayers who filed the simplest return, the Form
1040EZ, rose by 8.7 percent over last year, from 16.7 million to
18.2 million. Filers of Form 1040A, were off slightly, from 17.6
million to 17.4 million. The number filing the long form, 1040,
increased 3.3 percent, from 63.4 million to 65.4 million.

<HEAD>Three Dismissed Workers Get Awards For Whistleblowing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three people who lost their jobs after
allegedly blowing the whistle on wrongdoing by their employers have
been rewarded with $10,000 each by a private foundation.
   The Cavallo Foundation, set up by Massachusetts money manager
Michael Cavallo, gave its first annual awards on Wednesday to a
fired shipyard inspector, a former Census Bureau worker and an
ex-Veterans Administration employee.
   The awards came as a Senate committee prepared to vote today on
a bill that would protect government employees who disclose abuses.
The bill would restrict the Office of the Special Counsel from
acting against whistleblowers who complain that the agency often
ends up investigating them when they file complaints.
   Receiving the awards Wednesday were: Leon Bard, 34, fired in
1986 as a quality inspector at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine; John
Barter, 39, fired as security chief at the Cincinnati Veterans
Administration Medical Center; and Billie Pirner Garde, 35, fired
for speaking out eight years ago against corruption and sexual
harassment in the Muskogee, Okla., district office of the Census
Bureau.

   The wife of Palestinian activist Mubarak Awad

deportation from Israel.
   ``I'm presenting this case to congressional members, that they

   Ms. Nye is hoping U.S. lawmakers will ask Israeli Prime Minister

deported.
   Awad, 44, a naturalized U.S. citizen who has a home in
Wapakoneta, Ohio, is being held in an Israeli jail pending review

   Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey says he does
not want to be the Democrats' candidate for vice president this
year.
   ``No, no, no. It's as firm and as strong as I can make it,''
Bradley said Wednesday.
   The senator has been mentioned occasionally as a possible
running mate for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, and The
Washington Post reported Wednesday that senior Dukakis aides are
talking favorably of Bradley as well as Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, as
potential vice presidential candidates.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen also denied any interest Wednesday in joining
Dukakis on the ticket.
   ``I have absolutely no interest,'' says the senior senator from
Texas.
   Dukakis himself said he has not begun to look for a running mate
but hopes to choose one before the Democratic National Convention
in July.
   Bradley said that while he and Dukakis have met twice during the
past month, they have not discussed the vice presidency. ``The

<HEAD>City Proposes Lottery For Official Convention Protest Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials are proposing a lottery to decide
demonstration times at the official protest grounds near the site
of the Democratic National Convention.
   The plan was proposed this week during a meeting with
representatives of the Atlanta chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, which has criticized the city for being slow to
establish procedures for protests.
   Atlanta '88, the non-profit committee helping stage the
convention, plans to lease a parking lot near the Omni and equip
the site with a stage and loudspeakers.
   A single lottery to draw times for using the protest area
``solves some problems but not others,'' said Gene Guerrero,
executive director of the local ACLU chapter. ``If you have it
right before the convention, that means no one can plan.''

   The new group raising New Orleans' share of

   ``We've received cash and commitments to the tune of about
$250,000,'' Ron Jones, president of Louisiana Coca-Cola Bottling

Wednesday.
   That doesn't include two possible $100,000 donations up for

   ``We have a lot of good leads. The first thing was to get a plan
together, and a target,'' said Jones.
   The city will need an estimated $5.5 million to cover its
commitments, including some security precautions, 5,000 upholstered
chairs, and lighting and sound systems for the New Orleans
Superdome.
   About $619,000 has been raised and another $300,000 pledged. In
addition, hotels and motels have pledged 10 percent of the money

   A mob of neighbors chased down and apprehended a
man accused of breaking into a home and raping a 7-year-old girl in
front of her 5-year-old sister, authorities say.
   One of the neighbors said later that if they had known why they
were chasing the man, they might have killed him.
   The man, a parolee who was once accused of making a telephone
threat against the life of President Reagan, was chased for about
four blocks by about eight people, surrounded and held until police
arrived, officers said.
   ``I think we basically got there before anybody had a chance to
lay into him,'' said Sgt. Bill Staney of the Juvenile Division.
   Charles Franklin Ireland, 42, was being held in the Harris
County Jail today in lieu of $20,000 bond on charges of burglary
and aggravated sexual assault of a child.
   Ireland is accused of climbing through a window of a house late
Tuesday and sexually assaulting the girl in her bedroom, Staney
said. Her 5-year-old sister was in the room and saw the attack, he
added.
   The victim was released Wednesday from Ben Taub Hospital.
   The girls were alone in the house while their mother worked at
her evening-shift job, Staney said. She normally had a babysitter
stay with the girls, but she told police she had no money to pay
the sitter this week and left them at home with a padlock on the
front door, he said.
   The girls' father does not live with the family, Staney said.
   Neighbors saw Ireland climbing back out the window and heard the
girls frantically screaming, Staney said.
   ``It's a mostly Hispanic neighborhood, so when the neighbors saw
this big white guy coming out the window, they knew he didn't
belong there,'' he said.
   Ireland did not resist and was not harmed by the neighbors,
Staney said.
   Guadalupe Ramirez, one of the people who chased the man, said
they heard someone yelling and ran toward the house.
   ``We were behind him. There were about eight of us,'' Ramirez
said.
   ``We were trying to catch him, but we really didn't know exactly
why,'' Ramirez, 43, said. ``If we had known what had happened he
might have died.''
   Ramirez said Ireland started crying after he was caught.
   ``He just started crying, crying like a baby,'' Ramirez said.
   Ireland, a welder, told police he didn't remember assaulting the
girl, Staney said.
   Ireland was charged in August 1984 after calling the local U.S.
Secret Service and FBI offices from a Houston telephone booth and
making a threat against Reagan, police said.
   Agents said his threat stemmed from a belief that Reagan was
sending money to Africa instead of helping people in this country.
   Staney said Ireland also was paroled from the Texas Department
of Corrections in October 1982 after serving about five months of a
two-year sentence for auto theft.

<TEXT>
   Ousted Gov. Evan Mecham, whose criminal
trial was scheduled to begin today, has been barred from speaking
at Brigham Young University because of questions about his honesty.
   ``We haven't decided that Evan Mecham is guilty, but now is not
the appropriate time for him to appear on campus,'' said Brent
Harker, a spokesman for the university that's operated by the
Mormon Church.
   Mecham, who is a Mormon, had been scheduled to speak at the
Provo, Utah, campus on May 26 or 27, in an appearance sponsored by
Campus Republicans, a student group.
   ``We do not allow to speak on campus people who are not worthy
examples,'' said Brad Hanesworth, a communications professor and
the group's faculty adviser. ``I thought it was clear that he did
not meet the criteria'' on which speakers may appear at BYU.
   ``It wasn't an effort to say `Here's Governor Mecham. He's a
great guy and the people of Arizona (treated him unfairly.)' It was
an effort to say, `Governor Mecham, here's a chance to explain
yourself and give one side of the issue,''' said Joe Woodwell,
president of the Campus Republicans.
   School policy says that in order to appear at BYU, a speaker
``must not, in his or her personal life (as reflected in the news
media and common understanding of the public), have committed acts
of immorality, dishonesty or other conduct that would make it
inappropriate for the Church Education System to feature him or her
as a speaker.
   ``His or her life and advice should make an appropriate model
for students in an educational system with our ideals.''
   Mecham, a Republican, said Wednesday he is not upset by the
decision barring him from speaking on the campus.
   ``I don't get too upset about anything,'' Mecham said. ``It was
just a group of young Republicans who wanted me to speak. If they
have a policy, they have a policy, and I won't speak.''
   Harker said one reason for not permitting Mecham to appear is
that he is under indictment and his trial on charges that he
concealed a $350,000 campaign contribution was about to begin.
   ``When a person is involved in (a court case), if he comes to
speak, that would imply an endorsement by the university,'' Harker
said. ``People would say, `Oh, he's speaking at BYU. They must
think he's OK.' ''

   JESSE JACKSON, commenting Wednesday on the arrest of a St. Louis

irresponsible public leaders (whose) attacks based on race have set
a divisive and dangerous climate, such as the one ... in New York
in April, for example.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, declaring he won't negotiate with drug dealers:
``Drug dealers are domestic terrorists, killing kids and cops and
they should be treated as such. I won't bargain with terrorists and
I won't bargain with drug dealers either, whether they are on U.S.
or foreign soil.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, on Jesse Jackson's claim that the ``super
delegate'' system has unfairly favored Dukakis: ``I think Jesse has
a perfect right to voice criticism of whatever he chooses to
criticize. I don't think we are going to have a fight with Mr.
Jackson.''

Suicide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Protesters battled riot troopers with
firebombs and rocks in the center of Seoul for a third day today
after police broke up a funeral march with volleys of tear gas.
   The demonstrators called for an end to President Roh Tae-woo's
government and demanded that the 40,000 U.S. forces based in South
Korea under a mutual defense pact be forced to leave.
   Clashes began when riot police fired volleys of tear gas to
break up thousands of students trying to march past City Hall. The
huge crowd fled as showers of tear-gas bombs exploded in its ranks.
   Students retaliated with firebombs, rocks and bricks and battled
police for control of the city's main shopping area. Firebombs
exploded against buildings and among squads of riot police.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship'' and ``Drive out the
Yankees,'' protesters screamed as they hurled rocks at police.
   Riot police seized dozens of protesters and roughly hauled them
away. Both sides hurled rocks at and hit each other. Police
declined to give any figures on arrests or casualties. It was the
worst rioting in several months.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, 3,000 students yelling
anti-government slogans battled riot police with firebombs and
rocks today at Chonnam University. The battle began when police
fired tear gas to stop the students marching into the streets.
   Fighting started in Seoul after authorities allowed 25,000
people to march and stage rallies for more than five hours in
memory of Cho Sung-man, a student who committed suicide on Sunday
in a ritual form of anti-government protest sometimes used by
radicals. His body was to be taken to Kwangju for burial.
   The funeral procession marched through the center of the city,
snarling traffic for miles.
   ``Down with the murder regime,'' marchers shouted as musicians
in white mourning clothes beat drums and cymbals. Singers chanted
dirges and dancers in white performed a ghost dance.
   ``We will never end our struggle until we destroy Roh's
regime,'' said one angry woman student.
   The march ended in front of City Hall, where protesters burned
an American flag as speakers denounced the government. Marchers
were to disperse under an agreement with police, but many started
to march again and police attacked.
   Black police armored vans fired salvos of exploding tear gas
bombs into the marchers and hundreds of cars were stranded in the
sprawling City Hall square.
   About 5,000 riot police in green combat fatigues poured into the
streets and chased fleeing students.
   Students seized several nearby streets and set fire to part of a
subway station and some shops as they hurled firebombs at police.
Terrified pedestrians fled, many choking from the tear gas.
Shopkeepers locked their doors and sidewalk vendors abandoned their
stalls.
   Fighting swirled around several luxury hotels in the city center
and frightened foreign tourists looked on in astonishment or ran
for cover.
   Firebombs set ablaze a roof garden at the Lotte Hotel and fire
trucks forced their way through the fighting to extinguish the fire.
   It was the third day in a row that the center of the city had
been hit by rioting. Protests began Tuesday to honor Cho and mark
Wednesday's eighth anniversary of the Kwangju uprising in 1980.
   Opposition leaders are pressing for an investigation into the
suppression of that anti-government uprising during which at least
191 people were killed. Roh was a senior general at the time and
the opposition wants his role in the incident probed.
   Protesters repeatedly denounced the United States, charging it
maintains military rule in South Korea and is responsible for the
division of the Korean peninsula.``Unite the motherland,'' they
yelled.
   The Korean peninsula was divided by Soviet and U.S. forces at
the end of clash. The south and communist north remain bitter
enemies and often clash.
   President Roh, who took office Feb. 25 after winning elections
in December, has introduced broad democratic and liberal reforms.
But many Koreans distrust him because of his ties to past
authoritarian regimes.

<HEAD>Judge Sets $1 Million Bond For Defendant in Wells Fargo Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK SEAVY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge set bond at $1 million
for a Puerto Rican nationalist who is accused of helping mastermind
a $7 million Wells Fargo robbery and has been held without trial
for a record 32 months.
   U.S. District Judge T. Emmet Clarie, acting under a federal
appeals court order, set the bond Wednesday for Filberto Ojeda Rios.
   Under last week's order by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, Ojeda must be released by 5 p.m. Friday.
   Clarie had denied bond for Ojeda five times before at the
request of authorities, who sayd Ojeda is a Cuban agent and would
flee the country before trial.
   ``It (32 months detention) is not a record I am proud of,''
Ojeda said in a telephone interview Wednesday night from a federal
detention center. ``To tell you the truth, I'd rather have the
record for the shortest.''
   He said he considers his imminent freedom only a ``partial
liberation. ... It could only be total liberation if I was in my
home and my country was free.''
   Ojeda is accused of helping plan the September 1983 robbery of a
Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford to finance Los Macheteros _
Spanish for ``the machete wielders'' _ a violent group seeking
Puerto Rican independence.
   Clarie rejected a prosecution request that he set bond at $2.5
million, but imposed sharp restrictions on Ojeda's movements once
he is released.
   Ojeda must wear an electronic bracelet that will tell
authorities where he is, must live in Hartford and will be able to
move around the city only between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m.
   Clarie rejected the government's request that Ojeda be confined
to a defense attorney's home and a defense request that he be
allowed to return to Puerto Rico to convalesce from triple-bypass
heart surgery April 11.
   Defense attorney Richard J. Harvey called Clarie's ruling ``a
clear defeat for the government.''
   ``As long as justice is done, the government never loses,'' said
U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr.
   Twardy said that despite the $1 million bond he still does not
believe Ojeda will appear in court.
   ``If I thought this was enough I would have done this three
years ago,'' the prosecutor said.
   Ojeda, who is in his mid-50s, has been in pretrial detention
since his August 1985 arrest in Luquillo, Puerto Rico.
   He had been held under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which allows
federal judges to deny bond to dangerous suspects. However, the
appeals court ruled that further detention would violate Ojeda's
constitutional rights.
   The 15 other Wells Fargo defendants are free on bonds of up to
$1.5 million.

<TEXT>
   The Sikh elders who manage the Golden
Temple were called into session today to discuss reopening the
golden-domed shrine where a 10-day police siege ended with the
surrender of militant Sikh separatists.
   The 400-year-old temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine, had become a
base for extremists waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for an
independent Sikh homeland in Punjab state.
   Forty-five men and one woman walked out of the temple on
Wednesday, their hands in the air or clasped on their heads, and
surrendered to the 2,800 policemen, commandos and paramilitary
troops surrounding it.
   At least 42 people, mostly militant Sikhs, were killed during
the siege. Four other militants committed suicide rather than
surrender.
   Bhan Singh, secretary of the Sikh elders' committee that runs
the temple, told reporters late Wednesday night that it would today
discuss how to restore daily religious rites at the shrine.
   A curfew remained in effect today within 300 yards of the
complex's walls and municipal workers began cleaning its dining
hall, hostels and offices.
   Despite the government's success in ending the siege, its
authority is still challenged by continuing Sikh attacks elsewhere
in Punjab state.
   The United News of India said today that 13 more people were
killed during the night around the northern state in attacks by
Sikh extremists, who killed at least 99 people in Punjab while the
siege was under way.
   At least 40 people were killed Tuesday and Wednesday, including
more than 30 migrant Hindu laborers shot to death as they slept at
a camp near the state capital of Chandigarh. A note found near the
laborers' bodies said the killings were to avenge the Golden Temple
siege.
   So far this year, at least 1,076 killings in the state have been
blamed on Sikh gunmen. In all of 1987, the militants killed about
1,030 people in Punjab.
   Sikh militants say they need a separate homeland to preserve
their faith and combat what they call discrimination by India's
Hindu majority.
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, comprise less than 2 percent of
India's 800 million people but are a majority in Punjab.
   The temple siege began May 9 after Sikh gunmen fired from inside
the complex at a party of police commanders who were on an
inspection tour outside its walls. Five of the officers were
wounded.
   Eight hundred pilgrims and temple workers were evacuated the
following day and security forces proceeded to fire hundreds of
rounds at the temple complex's office and residential buildings.
   They were, however, under orders not to hit the temple itself.
   On Sunday, 146 people including a number of wanted Sikh
extremists surrendered during a cease-fire. The last of the
hard-core militants gave up on Wednesday.
   Sidharth Shankar Ray, the governor of Punjab, called it ``a day
of great relief'' but added: ``It is neither victory nor defeat.''
   He urged Sikh gunmen throughout Punjab to turn themselves in and
pledged to restore religious rites at the temple as soon as
possible.
   The siege was the largest show of force at the temple since June
1984, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had the army storm the
complex to oust armed Sikhs. More than 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs,
died in the onslaught.
   Many Sikhs considered the raid the worst sort of desecration,
and it was avenged less than five months later when Mrs. Gandhi was
assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards.
   Mrs. Gandhi's son and successor as prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi,
said on Wednesday that the carrying of arms in the temple should be
banned.
   He also told reporters in New Delhi that he thought most of
India's Sikh community had supported the siege.

   Soviet officials today reluctantly allowed
Japanese investigators to search a portion of a Soviet passenger
ship to determine what caused a fire that killed at least 11 people
and injured 35.
   After 70 minutes of heated negotiations with Soviet consular
officials, police agreed to pare down to 15 a team originally
consisting of more than 60 investigators.
   Police also gave in to Soviet demands that the probe be limited
to the passenger cabins of the 4,870-ton Priamurye, gutted by a
fire on Wednesday.
   All of the 129 crew members and 295 passengers listed in the
ship's registers were Soviet nationals, and all of the dead were
passengers.
   ``I have no idea why they (the Soviets) demanded this and I
don't really understand what the problem is with them,'' said
Yoshihide Yasuda, a police official in charge of the investigation.
   ``But the fact remains that our investigations are limited ...
and may not be carried out as expected,'' Yasuda said at a news
briefing.
   Earlier, Yasuda said police and firefighters had been through
the gutted ship in a preliminary probe, but the Soviets asked them
not to enter the engine room. Police had said the fire was
discovered in an area above the engine room.
   It took 18 hours for firefighters to put out the blaze aboard
the Priamurye, which was blackened and listing at dock in this port
city of western Japan. The investigative team, clad in boots and
overalls and equipped with cameras and flashlights, entered the
ship at 10:43 a.m.
   Yasuda said the 10 police, three fire department and two
Maritime Agency specialists will concentrate on a cluster of cabins
on the second deck, one level below the main deck, where nine of
the 11 bodies were found.
   Maritime official Norimasa Watanabe, in charge of emergency
measures, said earlier that a cigarette or faulty lighting could
have started the fire, which gutted most of the 85-cabin ship
registered in Vladivostok, U.S.S.R.
   Osaka Fire Department officials contacted by telephone said 15
of the original 35 injured in the fire remained hospitalized this
afternoon.
   Yasuda described as ``uncooperative'' the attitude of both
Soviet consulate officials and ship captain Aleksandr Yerastov. He
said there was little likelihood that investigations could be
completed prior to the arrival of a Soviet vessel to take back
survivors.
   Soviet crew members, including about 50 who had remained on
board the ship overnight despite police objections, began loading
food and beverage supplies to prepare to pull out as early as
Friday, officials at the site said.
   The Piramurye pulled into Osaka port Tuesday after calling on
Otaru, Hokkaido May 8 and Tokyo May 12. The vessel was to leave for
Hiroshima tonight.
   Maritime officials said the passengers, many of them in their
20s and early 30s, were visiting Japan for sightseeing purposes as
part of the Sputnik youth group tour, organized by the Soviet
Communist Youth League.

   Undercover agents broke up an alleged conspiracy to funnel 1,000
pounds of cocaine every 48 hours for a month into a swanky New York
summer retreat, in one of three separate U.S. drug busts that
netted 17 arrests.
   In other actions Wednesday,Customs agents said a patrol vessel
chased down a high-speed boat running without lights in the Florida
Keys just before dawn and found more than 2 tons of cocaine aboard.
   Three Florida men and a Colombian national were arrested and
their 38-foot boat confiscated, said Customs spokesman Michael
Sheehan.
   In Mobile, Ala., federal authorities charged four people,
including a West German couple, with possession of 1{ tons of
marijuana and 236 pounds of a substance believed to be hashish oil,
with a combined street value of more than $20 million.
   Customs agent Gary Wright said the drugs were smuggled into the
Gulf Coast from a foreign distribution point apparently aboard a
35-foot sailboat.
   The plot to sell 8 tons of cocaine in the Hamptons, a chic beach
retreat on New York's Long Island, came to light when undercover
agents learned of an attempt to get a plane for flights between
Colombia and Long Island, officials said.
   ``This seizure is unbelievable, out of sight,'' said state
police Capt. Gary Heesch. ``It has not only put a major dent into
the importation of cocaine to Long Island but it has more
significantly removed the major players.''
   The first shipment, which contained 1,200 pounds of cocaine, was
seized Tuesday in Miami when the plane transporting it lost an
engine and had to land, officials said. The plane, which was headed
for Suffolk County Airport in Westhampton Beach, N.Y., had been
under surveillance since leaving Colombia.
   The pilot, Dennis Pekarchik, 40, of Boston, was arrested in
Miami and eight others, including two Colombians, were arrested
Wednesday on Long Island. All were charged with conspiracy to
import and distribute cocaine.
   Heesch, head of the special investigations bureau, estimated
that the 1,200 pounds of cocaine could have been sold for $80
million.
   Undercover agents infiltrated the plot by arranging for a jet
between Colombia and Long Island and helping handle the logistics
of the smuggling operation, using electronic surveillance
throughout the negotiations.
   Special Customs Agent Arthur Stiffel said the smuggling ring had
planned to bring in 1,000 pounds of cocaine every 48 hours for 30
days, stockpile it at various sites on Long Island and sell it in
the Hamptons.
   ``We got them on their first run,'' said Stiffel. ``They were
just gearing up so they had enough supplies during the peak sale
period of the summer.''
   In Los Angeles, meanwhile, youthful-looking undercover officers
posing as high school students made more than 230 drug buys and
arrested 171 drug dealers recently, Police Chief Daryl Gates said
Wednesday.
   Of those arrested in undercover operations at 10 high schools,
Gates said 46 were gang members. Of the total arrested, 104 were
younger than 18 years old, and of those, 101 were students.
   Drugs seized by police, mostly high potency marijuana, were
valued at about $114,330, the chief said.

   Jurors in the cocaine-smuggling trial
of Carlos Lehder Rivas watched a videotape in which the reputed
Colombian cocaine lord called drugs a ``revolutionary'' weapon
against North American imperialism.
   The jury were scheduled to return today for their seventh day of
deliberations in the 7-month-old trial.
   On Wednesday, the jury reviewed a tape made by Lehder in 1985
when he was a fugitive in the jungles of Colombia, as well as a
June 29, 1983, television tape that a clean-cut Lehder made when he
was running for the Colombian Senate. In the jungle tape, Lehder
said, ``This is about political action and cocaine has become, and
marijuana has become, a revolutionary weapon in the struggle
against North American imperialism. Stimulants from Colombia are
the Achilles' heel of imperialism.''
   However, added Lehder, who prosecutors say has neo-Nazi views,
``I have never admitted that I have dealt or done any business with
drugs.''
   On the jungle tape, Lehder is dressed in a sleeveless T-shirt
and sleeveless denim jacket and has long, stringy hair, in sharp
contrast to his short hair and business suit image in court.
   The last time the jury communicated with the court before
Wednesday was Saturday, when U.S. District Judge Melton denied
requests for the testimony of three prosecution witnesses.
   Lehder appeared weary in court Wednesday. His brother, Bill
Lehder, an economist in Colombia, said he had been able to visit
the defendant during deliberations.
   ``He's very positive, energetic. He's feeling well. He's in a
good mood,'' the brother said.
   Lehder, 38, and co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are charged
with conspiring to smuggle 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United
States from Colombia, using Norman's Cay in the Bahamas, from 1978
to 1980.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, two counts of importation of
cocaine, seven counts of possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute and one charge of engaging in a continuing criminal
enteprise.
   If convicted, he could receive life plus 150 years in prison and
up to $350,000 in fines and forfeiture of his assets in the Bahamas.
   Reed, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged with a single conspiracy
count and faces up to 15 years in prison and $25,000 in fines if
convicted.

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped nearly 400 points
today for its biggest single-day decline this year, while the
dollar declined in narrow trading against the yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues closed at 27,373.24, falling 394.34 points, or 1.42
percent. On Wednesday the index shed 52.40 points.
   ``Apprehensions about possible inflation and rising interest
rates in the United States outweighed the expectations produced by
the dramatically reduced U.S. trade deficit,'' said Keiji Arai of
Sanyo Securities.
   On Tuesday, the U.S. Commerce Department reported the nation's
trade deficit fell more than $4 billion in March to $9.7 billion,
the lowest monthly finish since March 1985.
   Compared with Wall Street, what the Tokyo market lost was
smaller, but if Wall Street continue to sag, pulling the Dow Jones
industrial average below the 1,700-point level, investors will be
forced to ``give a second thought about the Tokyo market as well,''
he said.
   Steels and shipbuildings were under strong selling pressure.
Electricals, chemicals, non-ferrous metals also lost ground.
Certain precision metals and drugs were higher.
   Volume on the first section trading was esimated at 1 billion
shares, down from the 1.2 billion shares that changed hands on
Wednesday.
   After opening the day at 125.00 yen, down 0.53 yen from
Wednesday's finish, the dollar dipped further and closed at 124.80
yen, down 0.73 yen.
   ``The dollar's lower opening followed its decline against the
yen in New York trading,'' said an exchange dealer at a major
commercial bank.
   The dollar buying by trading houses in the morning was outpaced
by selling in the afternoon by export-related industries, said the
dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Trading was relatively quiet, however, and the dollar traded in
a narrow range between 125.00 yen to 124.75 yen without incentives
to prompt major movements among participants, he added.

   Johnny Carson, a week into using his own
material because of the scriptwriters' strike, quipped on NBC's
``Tonight Show'' that he had seen pictures of his writers on milk
cartons.
   Carson was in fine form Wednesday, entering the second week of
writing his own monologue and material after returning to the air
despite the strike that began March 7.
   He remarked that he had started the day with a bowl of cold
cereal. ``My writers' pictures were on the milk cartons,'' he said,
referring to the cartons that often contain information about
missing children.
   A standard gag about his longtime friend Ed McMahon filled out
the repertoire.
   He joked that McMahon was helping to fight the California water
shortage by taking his scotch and water without water.
   ``That ought to be enough to turn the Kalahari Desert green,''
he said.
   Carson also joked about Attorney General Edwin Meese and the
``kiss and tell'' books about the Reagan administration, Surgeon
General Everett Koop's declaration that tobacco is addictive, plus,
of course, band leader Doc Severinsen's colorful attire.
   Carson, despite the absence of his writers, was cooking. And the
studio audience, unusually loud and boisterous, expressed its
appreciation with yells, whoops, laughter and loud applause.
   He was at his best ad libbing answers to written questions from
the audience and reacting to his guests.
   One viewer asked him when he first ``messed around.'' Carson
replied, ``When I was 16, in the back seat of a '39 Chrysler. It
wasn't much fun. I was alone.''
   Carson's first guest was Dr. Terry Gosliner of the California
Academy of Science in San Francisco. He brought with him a
selection of mollusks. Carson had noted that a bill was before the
California Legislature to make the banana slug the state's official
mollusk.
   The audience, after looking at such mollusks as the slug and the
abalone, cast their vote for the sea hare.
   Other guests were comedian Bill Kirkenbauer and rock musician
Billy Vera.
   Carson returned to the air with ``The Tonight Show'' on May 11
after saying he would write his own material. The show had been in
reruns since the Writers Guild of America walked out over issues of
residual pay for reruns and creative rights.

<HEAD>Former Wedtech President: $1 Million to Meese Associates Were
`Payoffs'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wedtech Corp.'s former president characterized a
$1 million fee for two financial associates of Attorney General
Edwin Meese III as a payoff.
   Fred Neuberger made the statement Wednesday in testimony for the
prosecution in the trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi, Biaggi's former law
partner and five others accused of turning the now bankrupt
military contractor into a racketeering enterprise.
   Neuberger said W. Franklyn Chinn, Meese's former financial
adviser, told him the money was needed ``for friends in Washington
that he has to take care of.''
   Biaggi's lawyer, James M. LaRossa, asked Neuberger about a $1
million payment Wedtech made to Chinn and a colleague, Rusty
London, to manipulate the company's stock.
   Neuberger testified: ``Mr. Chinn also came to whisper in my ear
that he needs it for baksheesh, which means payoffs ... payola ...
grease. ''
   Chinn and Meese's former lawyer, E. Robert Wallach, have been
indicted on charges of taking bribes for trying to influence Meese.
Meese has not been indicted in the Wedtech case.
   The defense has been trying to show that Biaggi's role in
helping Wedtech win no-bid government contracts was insignificant
compared to Wedtech's ties to the Reagan administration.
   Neuberger, the third Wedtech executive to testify, backed up
earlier testimony that Wedtech paid $300,000 to help defray
Wallach's costs in defending Meese during his 1985 confirmation
hearings.
   LaRossa asked Neuberger if Wallach asked for the $300,000 ``to
assist in the defense of his friend Ed Meese'' during the
confirmation hearings.
   ``Oh yes,'' Neuberger said. ``At that time, yes. He said to me,
it's clear that he hasn't got any income now because he is involved
in the defense of Mr. Meese and he needs help for that reason. So
if we'd pay his expenses, which are very high in Washington.''
   LaRossa asked Neuberger whether it was ``your belief that you
were paying $300,000 to Mr. Wallach and, in effect, Wedtech was
paying for Meese's legal representation?''
   Replied Neuberger: ``That was my thought.' '

   Christopher Gore, who wrote for
theater and the screen and received an Academy Award nomination for
his screenplay of the hit movie ``Fame,'' died of cancer at age 42.
   ``Fame,'' about students at New York City's High School of the
Performing Arts, earned five Oscar nominations in 1981 and
eventually became a television series. It's success allowed Gore to
buy a home in England, where he spent much of his time and ``was
enjoying life as a country gentleman,'' his brother, Richard, said.
   The Fort Lauderdale native died Wednesday in Santa Monica, Calif.
   Gore began his career writing plays and large-scale musicals.
One of his first musicals, ``Mary,'' about Mary Queen of Scots, had
its premiere at Fort Lauderdale's Parker Playhouse in 1967.
   Gore reached Broadway in 1972 with the rock musical ``Via
Galactica.'' His next musical was ``Nefertiti,'' a production about
the Egyptian queen.
   Gore was the son of the late Jack Gore, former editor of The
Fort Lauderdale News, and Betty Gore. The family owned The Fort
Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel newspapers until 1963, when they
were sold to the Tribune Company.
   A memorial service will be held in Los Angeles this weekend.

<HEAD>Author Sidney Sheldon Sues Over `Hart To Hart' Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Sidney Sheldon sued Columbia Pictures
and Spelling-Goldberg Productions, claiming they owe him $1.4
million in compensation for creating the television series ``Hart
To Hart.''
   Sheldon said in his Superior Court lawsuit Wednesday that he
gave Spelling-Goldberg the right in 1973 to use certain material,
which resulted in the creation of the program about a globetrotting
husband-and-wife detective team.
   The rights later were transferred to Columbia.
   The suit says Sheldon was to get 15 percent of the producer's
net profit, but several improper charges such as excessive studio
overhead, were billed to the production. Sheldon was told the
series had not produced a net profit until this year.
   Sheldon said a 1988 accounting showed the series grossed $178.9
million.
   ``Hart To Hart,'' which starred Robert Wagner and Stefanie
Powers, ran from 1979-1984 on ABC-TV.
   The lawsuit seeks $1.4 million in compensatory damages and
unspecified punitive damages.
   An after-hours call seeking comment from Columbia Pictures was
answered by a recording saying the switchboard had been shut down.
There was no Los Angeles area listing for Spelling-Goldberg
Productions.
   Sheldon is the best-selling author of such books as ``Windmills
of the Gods'' ``A Rage of Angels,'' and ``The Other Side of
Midnight.''

<HEAD>Baker Says Economy Will Help Determine Presidential Election</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-World Economy, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Signs of renewed vigor in the U.S. economy are
likely to play a role in determining the outcome of the November
presidential election, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker said today.
   ``My rosy predictions won't decide the election. If they come
true they might have some impact,'' Baker told a breakfast meeting
with reporters.
   He said the Reagan administration was sticking to a forecast
that the economy would expand by 2.4 percent this year and that
inflation would hold near the current level of 4 percent.
   ``In our view at least, there is not going to be a resurgence of
inflation,'' Baker said. ``The economy is a major factor in any
election, particularly in a presidential election. People tend to
vote their pocketbooks.
   ``We have no reason to suspect or expect that the economy is not
going to perform reasonably well.''
   Baker was in Paris for two days of talks with trade and finance
ministers from leading industrial countries.
   Some European officials expressed concern on Wednesday that U.S.
consumer demand was growing too fast, raising the risk of a revival
of worldwide inflation. Baker said he rejected this view.
   Baker also said he had no immediate plans to leave his post to
manage the fall election campaign of Vice President George Bush,
who has virtually locked up the Republican nomination.
   ``For now I'm staying at the Treasury Department,'' he said.
``What I do in the future, of course, is a matter for the vice
president and the president.''

<HEAD>Judge Bans Robbery Suspect From Chicago Transit Trains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge banned an 18-year-old robbery suspect
from riding the city's train system, calling the youth ``a menace''
to transit patrons.
   ``He's forfeited his right to use that form of public
transportation. He can use the public sidewalk,'' Cook County
Circuit Judge Michael Bolan declared Wednesday when Tommy Holloway
appeared for the second consecutive day on charges he had robbed a
train passenger.
   On Tuesday, Bolan found probable cause to charge Holloway with
robbery for the theft of a gold necklace and $38 from a 16-year-old
student riding an elevated train on April 22.
   Less than two hours after leaving court on $5,000 bond in that
case, prosecutors contend, Holloway stole a St. Louis Cardinals
baseball cap and a book bag from another student waiting for a
train.
   During that attack, Holloway and nine other youths punched and
kicked the victim on the ground, said Assistant State's Attorney
Mary Lou Norwell.
   Bolan on Wednesday set bond at $50,000 for each case. He didn't
say how he would enforce that banning order.
   ``You're leading a marauding little pack of dogs out there,''
Bolan told the defendant. ``If I could hold you without bond, I
would because you're a danger to the community _ a menace.''

   Iranian speedboats attacked a Norwegian
tanker twice in the Strait of Hormuz today, firing rocket-propelled
grenades that set the vessel afire and injured one crewman,
shipping executives said.
   The 55,173-ton Berge Strand, an empty liquefied petroleum gas
carrier sailing to Saudi Arabian ports, was the second vessel
attacked by Iran in the Persian Gulf in the last two days.
   Iranian speedboats raided the Japanese-owned Ace Chemi on
Wednesday, following Iraqi attacks on Iranian terminals and tankers.
   The shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Berge Strand was damaged slightly in the first attack by
two speedboats, at 6:30 a.m. (10:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday). They did
not know what weapons were used in the first strike but said no
injuries were reported.
   An hour later, one of the speedboats caught up with the Berge
Strand and pumped five rocket-propelled grenades into its
accommodation quarters, then veered away, the sources said.
   A small fire broke out and flying shrapnel injured one of the 19
crew members in the face and forearm, the sources said. The crew,
believed to be Norwegian, put out the fire.
   An Omani warship on patrol rushed to help the vessel and took
the injured sailor to a hospital in Oman, they said. His condition
was not serious, they added.
   The Berge Strand headed to the southern gulf port of Dubai,
where the Ace Chemi is docked for repairs.
   The U.S. Central Command, meanwhile, said the Navy's 32nd convoy
of the year was sailing south through the gulf. It included one
U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker, the 46,723-ton Gas Prince, escorted by
the missile frigate Copeland.
   A fire on the 6,730-ton Ace Chemi forced its Japanese captain
and 16 South Korean crewmen to abandon ship. All were reported
rescued by salvage tugs.
   The raid on the chemical tanker was the first by Iran since the
United States implemented a new policy May 3 that permits U.S. Navy
ships to intervene in attacks on commercial vessels on request,
regardless of the flag they are flying.
   U.S. ships were unable to respond to the Ace Chemi raid because
the closest U.S. Navy vessel was 60 miles away, a two-hour sail,
said U.S. Navy sources.
   The attacks on the Japanese and Norwegian ships occurred about
11 miles south of Iran's offshore Larak oil terminal, where Iraqi
warplanes on Saturday devastated the world's largest tanker, the
564,739-ton Seawise Giant, and four other ships.
   The unofficial death toll stood at 34 after Iraqi F-1 Mirage
jets streaked into Larak following a 750-mile run down the gulf.
   The Seawise Giant, chartered by Iran as a storage ship, had been
unloading oil to the Spanish ship Barcelona. At Larak, tankers pick
up oil brought down the gulf by Iran's fleet of shuttle tankers.
   Baghdad has claimed a dozen raids, six of which were
independently verified, on Iranian tankers and terminals since
April 29. The raids seek to strangle oil exports that support
Tehran's side of the 7{-year-old gulf war.
   Iranian officials recently declared that their policy of
blow-for-blow retaliatory attacks on neutral shipping would
continue, but Wednesday's was the first since April 24.
   About 350 seamen have been killed and hundreds of others injured
in attacks on more than 500 vessels in gulf waterways in the
spillover of the Iran-Iraq land war, which began in September 1980.
   In the ground war, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
said Iranian forces killed or wounded 2,000 Iraqi troops and
captured more than 10 square miles of northeast Iraq in an
operation that began Tuesday night. It said many Iraqi troops were
taken prisoner. There was no comment from Iraq.

   A judge has ruled that random drug tests proposed
for Boston police officers are unconstitutional.
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert E. Keeton ruled Wednesday that
unannounced, random urine tests violate an officer's Fourth
Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure.
   The Boston Police Patrolman's Association, which filed suit in
protest against Police Commissioner Francis Roache's proposed drug
policy in April 1986, called the ruling a ``major victory.''
   Roache's attorney, Kevin McDermott, said he will urge a federal
appeals court to reverse Keeton's ruling.
   Roache proposed testing the 2,300-member police department after
three officers were charged with drug violations in 1985.

   A boater charged with shooting a swan with
a pistol told police he was acting in self-defense.
   John Milazzo, 39, told investigators he was canoeing in
Irondequoit Creek near Rochester on Wednesday when the swan started
paddling toward him in the water and flapping its wings, said
Robert Doe, a New York state environmental conservation officer.
   Milazzo said he tried to shoo the bird away with his paddle, but
it kept coming back until Milazzo capsized and fell in knee-deep
water, said Monroe County sheriff's Capt. John Perrone. Milazzo
shot at the bird twice, hitting it once, Perrone said.
   ``He claims the swan attacked him,'' Doe said. ``He said he had
no other choice but to draw his .38-caliber pistol and shoot.''
   The bird, a white adult muted swan, survived the wound from a
bullet that apparently passed through its body, said Dan
Michalowski, director of the Seneca Park Zoo. The bird is being
kept at the zoo's hospital, he said.
   Michalowski said swans can get belligerent with intruders and
will flap their wings and raise a fuss if they feel threatened.
   ``They're real bullies when it comes to protecting the nest. If
he invaded their territory, that can happen,'' Michalowski said.
   Milazzo was charged with a violation of state conservation law
for shooting a protected bird. The violation carries a potential
fine of $250 and 15-day jail sentence, Doe said.

   Politics may make for strange bedfellows,
but in the race for the Newton County judge's office, two bed
partners are making for some strange politics.
   Alton Campbell, a convicted felon, decided not to run for
re-election, even though he won the Republican nomination March 8.
That decision prompted the county's GOP township committee to
certify the second-place finisher: Campbell's wife, Verdell.
   Both Campbells declined comment when asked if their husband-wife
politics was meant to hang on to political clout. But the incumbent
characterized the race as friendly: ``We're probably the only two
candidates who sleep together,'' he said.
   Mrs. Campbell filed for the spot after her husband's conviction
last April on federal vote-buying charges. He received a three-year
prison sentence and a $5,000 fine. A three-member panel of the 8th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld that decision and
Campbell filed a petition asking the full court to review his
appeal.
   Campbell said he plans to finish his fifth term and has no
intention of resigning. Mrs. Campbell faces Democrat Clinton
Daniels in the November general election.

<TEXT>
   Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, said today he will talk with Syrian officials in
Damascus to try to help secure the release of nine Americans held
hostage in Lebanon.
   Walters, who leaves Friday for the Syrian capital, would not
give details of his plans. ``When it comes to the hostages, the
less you talk about what you plan to do the more you get done,'' he
said.
   Walters said his visit to Damascus was prompted by a concern for
the safety of the hostages because fighting between rival Shiite
Moslem factions has escalated in the southern suburbs of Beirut,
where the captives are believed held.
   ``Of course we're concerned about the safety of the hostages,''
Walters said in an interview. ``We're concerned about their safety
all the time, we think about them all the time.''
   Fighting has been raging between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah since May 6 in the 16-square-mile slums
of south Beirut.
   Most of the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon are believed to be
held by Hezbollah-backed Shiite zealots.
   More than 240 people have been killed and 762 wounded in the
fighting between Hezbollah, or Party of God, and Amal, Arabic for
hope.
   Over the weekend, Syria massed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks and
armored vehicles on the edges of south Beirut. Syrian officers have
said the army is prepared to move in to stop the fighting.
   Shiite Moslem sources quoted in the Jerusalem Post today said
the Shiite kidnappers have threatened to kill the hostages if
Syrian forces move into Beirut's southern suburbs.
   Walters, who is in Israel for a three-day visit, also met for
more than an hour today with Robert Hopkins, head of the U.N.
Relief and Works Agency in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   ``We discussed the problems of the refugees in all the areas you
might imagine,'' Walters said. ``We discussed all the issues and
the problems relating to the uprising.''
   Since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8, more than 190 Arabs
have been killed in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Two
Israelis also have died.
   There are 18 foreigners, including nine Americans, missing and
presumed kidnapped in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry A.
Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Report: If Planet Is To Survive, Humans Must Stop Plundering Its
Resources</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The earth will only be able to support its
population in the coming century if all countries cooperate to
reverse environmental destruction and control population growth, an
annual U.N. report said.
   The 1988 State of World Population Report, released in London on
Wednesday, says increasing human demands and population are
damaging the natural resources on which all life depends.
   The report says world population, now at more than 5 billion, is
expected to reach 6.1 billion by the year 2000.
   ``All countries must face the fact that the combination of
population and industrial growth could destroy the land, water and
air on which everything else depends,'' Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive
director of the United Nations Population Fund, told a news
conference.
   The Pakistani physician expressed hope that action by
governments, individuals and international organizations to curb
population growth and encourage conservation will ``safeguard the
future of our planet.''
   But ``population and resources could become more seriously out
of balance unless we do something about it today,'' she said.
   Every year, the world adds a nation the size of Mexico to the
population _ about 80 million people _ with nearly all the growth
occurring in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America
that are least able to absorb it, the report says.
   It says that though most developing countries are trying to
reduce population growth, their needs are increasing and their
attempts to find new land and increase food production are
destroying the environment rapidly.
   ``There is urgent need for action ... In the poorest areas, the
`scissors effect' of poverty and increasing population is slicing
away at their ability to sustain human life.''
   The report encourages slower growth and more even distribution
of population to take pressure off agricultural land, forests and
water and energy sources.
   Tropical forests are shrinking at a rate of 27 million acres a
year. Topsoil is being lost at the rate of 26 billion tons a year.
About 13 million acres of deserts are being created each year and
about half the world's irrigated land is in danger, it says.
   By the end of the century, half the world will be living in
urban areas and one-fifth of the urban population will live in
``mega-cities'' of 4 million or more, the report says.
   It says population growth will not stop ``for perhaps another
century, when world population may be over 10 billion, twice its
present level.
   ``Part of this dramatic rise in numbers is the result of
widespread improvements in basic health care which have contributed
to lower infant mortality ... and longer life spans. But the very
success of these interventions now threatens the future.''

   Half the world's people will be city dwellers by
the year 2000, and 11 of the world's 13 largest cities will be in
the developing world, the 1988 State of World Population Report
says.
   Since 1950, the number of city dwellers has almost tripled
worldwide, reaching nearly 2 billion in 1985, according to the
annual report released Wednesday by the United Nations Population
Fund.
   It says the greatest increase has been in developing countries,
where millions are flocking to urban areas in search of better
education, health services and jobs.
   By the end of the century, 75 percent of Latin America's
population, 42 percent of Africa's and 37 percent of Asia's will be
urban dwellers, the report adds.
   The number of people living in cities of over 1 million also has
grown rapidly.
   In 1940, one in 100 cities topped a million. In 1980, one in 10
cities contained more than a million people and in highly urbanized
Latin America, the present ratio is one in four, the report says.
   Eleven of the world's 13 most populous cities will be in the
developing world by the end of century, compared with eight now, it
adds.
   The 13 largest metropolitan areas in 1985 were: Tokyo (18.8
million), Mexico City (17.3), Sao Paulo, Brazil (15.9), New York
(15.6), Shanghai, China (11.8), Calcutta, India (11.0), Buenos
Aires, Argentina (10.9), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (10.4), London
(10.4), Seoul, South Korea (10.3), Bombay, India (10.1), Los
Angeles (10.0) and Osaka, Japan (9.4).
   In the year 2000, the report said, the 13 largest metropolitan
areas will be Mexico City (25.8 million), Sao Paulo (24.0), Tokyo
(20.2), Calcutta (16.5), Bombay (16.0), New York (15.8), Seoul
(13.8), Teheran, Iran (13.6), Shanghai (13.3), Rio de Janeiro
(13.3), Buenos Aires (13.2), Jakarta, Indonesia (13.2) and New
Delhi, India (13.2).

   The U.S. dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies in thin European trading this morning, and traders
suggested it will remain in a narrow trading range for the rest of
the week. Gold prices rose.
   Earlier, the dollar fell 0.73 yen to a closing of 124.80 yen in
Tokyo, in what traders said was a correction following sharp gains
on the back of Tuesday's narrower-than-expected $9.75 billion U.S.
trade deficit for March.
   ``The dollar overshot a reasonable range after the trade
figures,'' said a currency dealer in Milan, Italy. ``But in ...
Europe, it seems to have found a more sustainable level.''
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   --1.6988 West German marks, down from 1.7055
   --1.4150 Swiss francs, down from 1.4215
   --5.7517 French francs, down from 5.7700
   --1.9022 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9090
   --1,261.30 Italian lire, down from 1,265.50
   --1.2434 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24125
   In London, the dollar was also quoted at 124.75 yen, and one
British pound cost $1.8660, more expensive for buyers than late
Wednesday's $1.8605.
   Gold prices firmed in moderate European trading, boosted by
Wednesday's gains in New York, bullion dealers said.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$456.65 a troy ounce at midmorning, up from the opening bid of
$455.50 and late Wednesday's $453.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $456.60, up from $454 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.02 to close at a bid $457.56.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid $6.70 a troy ounce, up from
Wednesday's $6.58.

<HEAD>Court Ruling: Rabbis Must Let Woman Sit on Religious Council</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today overruled the nation's
rabbis and upheld the appointment of the first woman to a religious
council in Israel.
   The council's chairman in the southern town of Yeroham condemned
the decision and threatened to resign if he is forced to implement
it.
   The ruling of the three-justice panel marked an unusual
intervention of secular courts in religious matters and followed a
two-year battle by Leah Shakdiel, 36, who was prevented by rabbis
from accepting the appointment to her hometown council.
   The justices, who included a woman, Miriam Ben-Porat, ordered
Mrs. Shakdiel appointed to the council within 30 days, saying the
rabbis' action was based on ``considerations that are extraneous''
to Israeli law.
   Reacting to the ruling, an elated Mrs. Shakdiel told reporters
at the court: ``I think this is a very big achievement for Israel,
for religious Zionists and for women in Israel.''
   Mrs. Shakdiel appealed to the court after Orthodox rabbis in
Yeroham, a town of 6,000, refused to let her sit on the council.
She was chosen for the position in March 1986 by left-leaning Labor
Party city councilors.
   Most Jewish communities in Israel have religious councils that
administer synagogues, ritual baths and other religious affairs.
The council members are chosen by local municipalities and are
usually symbolically approved by the rabbis.
   But in Yeroham, the rabbis blocked Mrs. Shakdiel's appointment
on the grounds that Orthodox tradition bars women from taking an
active role in public religious affairs, such as leading prayers or
interpreting laws.
   The Orthodox rabbis have a monopoly on Jewish affairs in Israel
and sole authority to minister rituals such as marriages and
divorces.
   Moshe Peretz, a rabbi who heads Yeroham's religious council
responded with anger to the court ruling.
   ``The Supreme Court cannot force us to sit with a woman on the
council. If the Religious Affairs Minister forces us then I will
resign,'' Peretz said in an interview with army radio.
   Peretz also criticized the court for intervening in religious
matters.
   ``I don't force the justices to wear yarmulkas (religious skull
caps) so they can't force me to sit with a woman on my council.''

   Thunderstorms dropped heavy rain on parts of Pennsylvania today,
sending streams over their banks, while rain and drizzle fell over
much of the northern Atlantic Coast and the upper Ohio Valley.
   Showers and thunderstorms were common from western Minnesota and
the eastern Dakotas to the central and southern High Plains.
   A few showers dampened Florida. Widely scattered showers fell
over the central Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. Fair skies
prevailed elsewhere in the nation.
   A thunderstorm in Nebraska spawned a tornado Wednesday evening
south of Hershey, but no damage was reported. Thunderstorms
produced dime-size hail north of Pecos, Texas, and at Statesville
and Mooresville, N.C., and small hail in Colorado.
   Several high-temperature records were set Wednesday, including
92 degrees in Fargo, N.D., topping the 90-degree record set in
1941; 94 in Lake Charles, La., beating the 92-degree mark of 1961;
and 93 in Port Arthur, Texas, besting by one degree the 1933 record.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
eastern lower Michigan, eastern Indiana and Kentucky to the
Atlantic Coast, from central Maine to Maryland and Delaware, and
from northwest Wisconsin to the upper Mississippi Valley, South
Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, eastern Colorado, western Kansas and
northern New Mexico. Sunny skies were predicted for much of the
rest of the nation.
   Highs were expected to be in the upper 50s and 60s in New
England, the northern half of the Appalachians, the lower Great
Lakes and the upper Ohio Valley; 50s from northern Colorado to
central Wyoming; 60s from North Dakota to western South Dakota, the
upper Missouri Valley, the Rockies and the northern Pacific Coast;
upper 80s and 90s from northern Florida to the central Gulf Coast,
the lower Mississippi Valley, Oklahoma and the eastern two-thirds
of Texas; and in the 90s in the desert Southwest. Elsewhere, highs
will generally reach the 70s and 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at McCall, Idaho, to 79 at Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Editor Of Dissident Journal Says Police Shut It Down Through
Seizure</HEAD>

   The editor of a well-known Soviet dissident
journal said police held him for a week and seized the computer and
printer he uses to produce the magazine as well as its archives.
   KGB security police ``even took all the pictures off the
walls,'' Sergei I. Grigoryants told reporters in his Moscow
apartment on Wednesday.
   The editor said that his arrest and detention show that Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's promised reforms have not ended civil rights
violations by the state security apparatus.
   The former political prisoner was arrested May 9 with four other
people at a small country house he uses to produce his 11-month-old
unofficial magazine, named Glasnost after Gorbachev's policies of
more openness in society.
   Grigoryants, a literary expert, said the officers had no arrest
or search warrants, and a judge convicted him of ``malicous
disobedience'' of a police officer and sentenced him to seven days
in jail without a proper trial.
   ``It is a result of the demonstrably sharp deterioration in the
situation in the country of people's rights,'' he said.
   The actions show that Gorbachev's drive for democratization of
Soviet society and openness has not meant more tolerance of
dissent, Grigoryants said.
   Grigoryants was released from jail on Monday and the following
day tried to visit the house in the village of Kratkovo, 25 miles
southeast of Moscow.
   Police sealed off the house and prevented him from entering,
saying he must prove to a prosecutor he has the right to live there
and that his property won't be returned until he shows evidence it
belongs to him.
   Grigoryants said, however, that a prosecutor told him the matter
should be taken up with the militia. ``It's not even clear to whom
to turn,'' he said.
   The editors of Glasnost hope to continue publishing, but they
are having trouble getting needed equipment and offices.
   Glasnost was the first privately controlled periodical to be
published openly in the Soviet Union. Past dissident magazines had
been published clandestinely and many of their publishers were
arrested.
   Grigoryants was sentenced in 1983 to 10 years in prison for
writing for an underground bulletin on human rights. He was
pardoned in February 1987.
   His arrest May 9 came hours before a group seeking to found a
political party called the Democratic Union planned to meet in his
offices.
   The group met instead at a nearby club to form the party, which
seeks to challenge the Communist Party's political monopoly.
   The weekly newspaper Moscow News has accused the Democratic
Union of seeking to replace socialism with capitalism and called
its members ``convinced enemies of our system, the political and
economic system of the Soviet Union.''
   The Democratic Union calls for multiparty parliamentary
democracy, independent trade unions, a new constitution and the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe and areas of the
Soviet Union seized in World War II.

<TEXT>
   A new expedition led by the
first man to conquer Mount McKinley alone in winter ended less than
1,000 feet from the top when one climber apparently froze to death
and three others suffered hypothermia.
   Lynn Salerno, 31, died early Wednesday at the 19,500-foot level
of North America's highest peak, the National Park Service said.
Two other members of the nine-person expedition were evacuated by
helicopter.
   ``We had a beautiful experience turn into a nightmare,'' one
exhausted climber, Leonard Kelly, said as he clutched a hot cup of
tea at Denali Medical Camp at the 14,000-foot level of Mount
McKinley.
   ``It's unbelievable that one minute you can be on top of the
world, and in the next minute under it,'' Kelly said.
   The expedition, which began about May 1, was led by veteran
guide Vern Tejas, who last March became the first mountaineer to
survive a winter climb to McKinley's 20,320-foot summit.
   According to accounts from expedition members, Tejas called a
conference at about 8 p.m. Tuesday, after nearly 10 hours on the
trail. They were still more than 1,000 feet below the summit.
   Tejas warned that the approaching night would be bitterly cold.
He told them to make individual decisions on whether to continue.
   Kelly, at 57 the oldest member of the party, said he had
intestinal cramps and decided to turn back with another man, Dave
Burns. Tejas sent assistant guide John Swider to accompany them to
the 17,200-foot camp. The others, led by Tejas, went on.
   Before the trio reached the haven, Swider fell on the steep,
rocky terrain. He was saved from certain death only when Kelly
secured them using an ice ax.
   ``We all ended up in kind of a blob, hanging on, looking at each
other, because the next step was really kind of a big one _ like a
couple of thousand feet right off the ridge, going straight down,''
Kelly said.
   Other climbers saw the fall and went to the rescue.
   Swider, who had head lacerations and a back injury, and Kelly
were helped back to camp, where they spent a long night worrying
about their companions.
   The others had it even worse.
   Some 500 feet below the summit, Lynn Salerno began acting
irrationally.
   It remains unclear whether she was ailing from hypothermia or
some sort of altitude sickness, but she grew increasingly cold and
unresponsive, the climbers said.
   While others worked desperately to warm her, Tejas tried to dig
a snow shelter in the icy, rocky terrain, but in a matter of
minutes she was dead.
   ``She was such a strong supporter of Vern's,'' Kelly said. ``She
was practically on the trip because of him'' after hearing him
describe his mountain experiences at a talk in Anchorage.
   Kelly was assisted down the mountain Wednesday evening by other
climbers. He was treated for three frostbitten toes.
   Swider and Mike Moss, 50, of Minnesota, who had severely
frostbitten feet, were flown off the mountain to a hospital in
Anchorage.
   Tejas remained with the rest of the expedition at 17,200 feet.
Two reportedly were recovering well from hypothermia.
   ``I felt like we had the best guide in the world,'' Kelly said.
``He did everything in the world a human being could be expected to
do in a dangerous occupation like this.''

   The president of Middlebury College
suspended a fraternity for hanging a battered female mannequin
splattered with red paint from a balcony during a toga party
earlier this month.
   College President Olin Robison on Wednesday accepted the
recommendation of the school's community council to ban the Delta
Upsilon fraternity from living in its house next year or
functioning as a social organization.
   Members of Delta Upsilon also must participate in a sexism
awareness course, said college spokesman Ron Nief.
   The fraternity was deluged with criticism last week after
several students complained about the mannequin used as a
decoration at the party.
   The mannequin's breasts were mutilated and splattered with red
paint, and its head and face were bashed in, according to a letter
of complaint seven students wrote to Robison.
   The action was characterized as being sexist and insensitive to
violent crimes against women.
   In a statement, Robison said, ``It is at just such times as this
that we recognize how very much our community depends upon a shared
acknowledgement of the limits of permissable behavior.
   ``Our very survival as a community of learning requires both a
generous amount of tolerance and a concomitant willingness to
insist that there is ... a point beyond which our tolerance cannot
and must not be stretched,'' Robison said. ``This recent episode
has defined, and defined appropriately, such a limit.''
   The fraternity called the council's decision too severe.
   Jennifer Weiss, one of the students who complained, said she was
pleased that a sexism awareness program would result from the
complaint.
   After the end of the school year, the council will decide
whether the fraternity should be placed on probation, suspended for
another year or closed. The council is made up of students, faculty
and staff members.

   Three fraternity members were indicted
in the rape of an 18-year-old Florida State University student who
was near death from drinking.
   A grand jury on Wednesday indicted an FSU student, a Tallahassee
Community College student and an Auburn University student on
charges stemming from the March 5 incident at the Pi Kappa Alpha
house.
   The students were arrested last month, and are free on bond.
   Daniel G. Oltarsh, 23, of Fort Lauderdale and Byron L. Stewart,
21, of Orlando were charged with sexual battery. Oltarsh and Jason
J. McPharlin, 19, of Plantation were charged with kidnapping to
facilitate the commission of a felony.
   Oltarsh, the FSU student, was charged with battery in the
scrawling of a fraternity symbol and other writing on the woman's
leg and with aiding in the possession of alcohol by a person under
21.
   The indictment alleged that McPharlin, the Auburn student, and
Oltarsh carried the victim, who had passed out and was near death
from alcohol intoxication, from the Pi Kappa Alpha house to a
neighboring frat house, where they abandoned her.
   The victim was hospitalized for treatment of scratches, bruises
and abrasions.
   Following the indictment, Raymond Orians, the fraternity's
national executive vice president in Memphis, Tenn., said the FSU
chapter had been suspended and that an undetermined number of its
members would be expelled.
   The grand jury, which had complained in an interim report that
fraternity members had been uncooperative, reiterated the complaint
in a final report Wednesday.
   After the interim report and a university order disbanding the
fraternity for five years, a fraternity member stepped forward, the
grand jury said.
   Information from the fraternity member led to two of the
arrests, and another frat member who admitted involvement in the
incident was granted immunity in exchange for information leading
to the third arrest.
   According to the grand jury, the informant described sexual
activities all four had with the woman, and said they dressed her
as she sat slumped on the floor. He said they verbally abused her
and repeatdly told her they were members of another fraternity and
that they were in that fraternity's house, the panel said.
   The victim admitted she violated the state's drinking age law
against consumption by those under 21, but the grand jury urged she
not be prosecuted because of the circumstances.
   The panel recommended that university police monitor areas where
there is drinking, and urged FSU administrators to establish a
mandatory first-semester orientation course on date rape, drug and
alcohol abuse, personal safety and the availability of counseling
services.
   University President Bernie Sliger thanked the grand jury for
its recommendations, and said he had already directed FSU officials
to take actions requested by the Board of Regents.
   ``This university has made it clear it will not tolerate conduct
which demeans the human spirit,'' Sliger said.
   In Middlebury, Vt., on Wednesday, Middlebury College President
Olin Robison suspended the Delta Upsilon fraternity for using a
female mannequin that had been battered, mutilated and spattered
with red paint as a decoration at a toga party. The fraternity was
heavily criticized after students complained about the mannequin.

   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said
the armed forces will carry out any anti-drug assignments that
Congress decides upon, but he warned the practice could compromise
civil rights.
   ``Putting an end to the drug problem would be much broader than
our mission,'' Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. said at a news conference
Wednesday before a luncheon speech to the Economic Club of Detroit.
   ``I think there are things we can do, primarily identification,
surveillance and tracking of people bringing in drugs in illicit
fashion,'' Crowe said.
   But, he warned, ``to solve the drug problem and still guarantee
all Americans the rights and privileges they enjoy today is a
difficult thing. ... To truly stop the flow of drugs you would have
to increase police powers and do some searches and seizures that
are not contemplated today.''
   The Senate last week approved a provision giving the military an
expanded role in stopping drug smuggling, including new arrest
powers for Navy officers aboard warships that stop suspected drug
boats on the high seas.
   The House has passed a more far-reaching provision, ordering the
president to have the military essentially seal off U.S. borders
against illegal drug trafficking.
   The provisions were attached to the Defense Department's budget,
which is being debated on Capitol Hill.
   Crowe also said he did not expect increased U.S. military
activity in Panama would force the exit of its leader, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   The admiral said he did not know when U.S. involvement might end
in the Persian Gulf.
   ``I do not see any short-term or long-term end to the Iran-Iraq
war,'' he said, adding that the United States is committed to
protecting shipping in the gulf.
   ``As long as those interests are in jeopardy, we will be
there,'' Crowe said. ``Of course, the government never said it
would be a short-term operation.''

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said she
will convene her Cabinet's crisis committee to discuss the
implications of a summons a Philippine court issued to her ousted
predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters on Wednesday that she would convene
the committee soon to discuss the summons issued on Tuesday by the
anti-graft court, the Sandiganbayan.
   The summons stems from a $2.5 billion lawsuit filed by the
Presidential Commission on Good Government to recover some of the
$10 billion it alleges Marcos stole during his 20 years in office.
   Mrs. Aquino has barred Marcos from returning from Hawaiian exile
to the Philippines, from which he was forced in a February 1986
popular uprising.
   Government sources said the committee must study the legal
implications of the lawsuit, including whether the summons can be
served on Marcos in Hawaii and if so, whether he has a legal right
to return to answer the charges.
   A source at the anti-graft court said on condition of anonymity
that the summons was forwarded to the Department of Foreign Affairs
but had not yet been sent on to Honolulu.
   The source said Marcos and his wife Imelda could respond in
writing within 60 days of receiving the order. Legal sources said
it was not clear whether Marcos could demand to answer the charges
personally in Manila.
   On Wednesday, police fired tear gas and smoke bombs to halt a
rally and march to the U.S. Embassy by protesters demanding that
Marcos be allowed to return for his mother's funeral.
   Organizers said at least four women and two children were hurt.
Police said there were minor injuries to several demonstrators but
did not give a figure.
   About 5,000 demonstrators rallied to urge the government to
allow Marcos to return to attend the funeral of his mother, Josefa
Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4. A breakaway group of 2,000
demonstrators, chanting ``If you want trouble, we will give you
trouble!'' later marched toward the embassy and were blocked near
City Hall by 50 policemen.
   A police spokesman said the demonstrators were dispersed when
they started throwing stones at the officers, who fought back with
truncheons and later used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse the
marchers. The marchers later regrouped in the central Bonifacio
Square to protest the dispersal.

<HEAD>Minister Says Indian Troops Will Withdraw</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior government minister told
Parliament today that Indian troops battling Tamil rebels in the
north and east will withdraw from the island nation.
   ``The government is very keen to see the Indian peacekeeping
troops leave. They are definitely going,'' said Gamini Dissanayake,
land and river development minister.
   Dissanayake said the withdrawal would be in stages but that the
date of the pullout has not been discussed yet. He did not
elaborate.
   Indian Defense Minister K.C. Pant is scheduled to arrive in
Colombo this week to discuss peace proposals with Tamil militants,
who have been fighting for a separate homeland since 1983.
   India and Sri Lanka signed a peace accord in July 29, 1987 to
end the Tamil separatist war in Sri Lanka's northern and eastern
provinces. The accord, which grants some autonomy to the minority
Tamils in exchange for a surrender of weapons, has been rejected by
the militants.
   Indian troops landed on July 30, 1987 to disarm the militants
and enforce the peace pact, and an estimated 50,000 Indian soldiers
are now in Sri Lanka.
   India, a regional power, became involved because of its own 60
million ethnic Tamils, who are politically powerful and have close
ties with the Sri Lankan Tamils.
   A senior police official, meanwhile, reported that Sinhalese
extremists killed a candidate of the governing United National
Party in the central Kandy district on Wednesday night.
   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the
victim as Jayaratna Heenbanda, who was going to run for the
provincial council elections.
   A 19-year-old student, Aruna Saman Dissanayake, also was killed
Wednesday when gunmen shot at another government party candidate,
Sella Jayakody, at Horona town, just south of Colombo.
   Sinhalese extremists also oppose the accord on grounds that it
gives too many concessions to the Tamils. They have vowed to kill
government officials, politicians and others who support the peace
pact.
   Tamils are 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, most of
whom are Sinhalese. Tamils say they are discriminated against by
the Sinhalese, who control the government and the military.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch's personal chef is under
investigation for allegedly operating a private catering business
with cars, workers, food, linen and utensils owned by the city,
according to a report published today.
   The New York Post said that Mitchel London, the chef at the
mayor's residence, has been the subject of a probe by the city's
Department of Investigation since April 26.
   London is believed to have used city supplies, such as plastic
forks, escargot shells and mushrooms, for his food service, the
Post said.
   The newspaper said Koch approved the investigation after his
counsel, Pat Mulhearn, told him a former city employee had reported
that 34-year-old London was using city assets to run his business.
   London, who earns $49,000 a year, is the only full-time resident
of Gracie Mansion other than Koch, and has worked for the mayor
since 1981.
   The Post said London confirmed his firm is under investigation,
but said the allegations made him ``chuckle.''
   London's financial disclosure forms for last year say he earned
more than $1,000 but less than $5,000 in outside income from his
catering firm.
   London said he has spent $50,000 to $70,000 trying to build the
business.
   Asked if he had ever stolen city food, London said, ``I make my
own purchases, I have my own people, I have my own saute pan!''

<HEAD>Judge To Hear Arguments For Retrying Sharpeville Six</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to CLARIFY that no decision made to reopen
trial. Pick up 6th graf pvs: `President P.W...' TRIMS thereafter.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A judge will hear defense
arguments next month that the ``Sharpeville Six'' defendants should
be spared death for complicity in the mob killing of a black
official, court officers said.
   The black defendants _ five men and a woman _ were scheduled to
hang March 18 for their role in the 1984 mob slaying of a black
town councilor in Sharpeville, south of Johannesburg.
   However, a stay of execution was granted March 17 in the case,
which has attracted international attention and widespread appeals
for clemency.
   Pretoria Supreme Court Justice W.J. Human this week gave
permission to defense lawyers to present arguments June 6 on why
the trial should be reopened. The lawyers say they have evidence
that a key state witness was coerced into giving false testimony.
   The Justice Department said Wednesday that no decision had been
made on whether to reopen the trial. It noted that government
prosecutors would be arguing against the application to try the
defendants again.
   President P.W. Botha has said he will not intervene in the case.
   The trial caused debate in part because the six were not
convicted of contributing physically to the death of councilor
Jacob Dlamini. Instead, they were convicted under the doctrine of
common purpose, which held them responsible because they actively
joined the mob.
   The killing occurred during riots provoked by a rent increase in
Sharpeville and neighboring townships.
   Also Wednesday, police said a former mental patient on Tuesday
night killed two officers, including one accused by black squatters
of organizing vigilante gangs against them.
   The 30-year-old white man who killed the officers in a shootout
was identified as Christopher Du Plooy. He later was killed by
police who stormed his house in Fish Hoek, a coastal town on the
Cape Peninsula.
   One of the slain police officers, Warrant Officer Hendrick
Barnard, was a Cape Town policeman for 20 years. The white officer
usually worked in impoverished black townships and squatter camps
east of Cape Town.
   Last year, he was injured in a hand grenade attack in one
township.
   Many blacks said Barnard was connected with attacks and
factional fighting aimed at intimidating or displacing squatters.
Barnard has been mentioned frequently in an ongoing court action
filed by squatters who were burned out of their shacks in 1986.
   The plaintiffs said that Barnard and other officers either
encouraged or condoned an onslaught on the squatter camp by black
vigilantes. Some witnesses have testified they saw Barnard in a van
leading a force of 1,000 vigilantes, and others say they saw him
distributing incendiary devices.
   Scores of people were killed and more than 70,000 burned out of
their homes during attacks on the squatters in May and June 1986.
   Barnard said police tried to stop the violence but were unable
to move through the densely packed shanties in vehicles and
considered it too dangerous to go on foot.
   Some squatters have banded together to resist attempts to
relocate them, and the government considers other squatter
communities strongholds of anti-apartheid militants.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   A Soviet media official today confirmed that
12,000 to 15,000 Soviet soldiers died in Afghanistan during the
Kremlin's more than eight years of military involvement in that
country's civil war.
   Eduard Rosental, a political observer for the government news
agency Novosti, confirmed a recent report by the Paris-based Agence
France-Presse news service that 12,000 to 15,000 Soviets had been
killed in Afghanistan.
   Rosental's comment during a news conference to discuss
Afghanistan's history was believed to be the first time a Soviet
official has approximated the death toll from the Soviet
intervention.
   He had been asked by a reporter how many soldiers had died in
the war.
   He reviewed various Western media assessments, including the AFP
report, and said: ``I think the figures cited by Agence
France-Presse are more or less correct, but you can obtain more
correct figures from our military men.''
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, has
promised to bring high-ranking military officials to a news
conference soon to discuss the war's costs in more detail, Rosental
said.
   A Soviet-inspired revolution in April 1978 brought a Marxist
leadership to power in Afghanistan. The Kremlin sent troops and
tanks in December 1979 to help the allied Kabul government fight
U.S.-backed Moslem rebels.
   Under a U.N.-mediated accord signed in Geneva on April 14, the
Soviets began pulling out their 115,000 troops from Afghanistan on
Sunday and are expected to complete the withdrawal within nine
months.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said after the
signing ceremonies in Geneva that his government would release
casualty figures once the pullout began.
   No date for the Gerasimov military press conference has been
announced yet.
   A U.S. State Department report released in December estimated
the total number of Soviet casualties in Afghanistan since 1979 at
``at least 33,000 to 38,000, more than one-third of whom were
killed.'
   That would make the number of men killed in combat between
11,000 and 12,700, or more. ``Those estimates do not include heavy
losses to disease,'' the State Department report added.
   The report said disease is ``rampant'' among the Soviet troops,
particularly dysentery and hepatitis caused by poor hygiene.
   If the death figures mentioned by Rosental are correct, then the
Soviet Union suffered far fewer losses in Afghanistan than the
United States did in the Vietnam War.
   A total of 47,253 Americans were killed or mortally wounded in
combat in Vietnam and adjacent military theaters of Southeast Asia,
and more than 150,000 were wounded.
   Rosental rejected a reporter's suggestion that the Kremlin was
abandoning an allied government still beleaguered by a nationwide
insurgency.
   ``To withdraw troops does not mean to leave the country in the
lurch,'' the Novosti official said. ``We leave many cultural and
economic facilities there. The Soviet Union is not abandoning
anyone.''
   The first Soviet soldiers to be withdrawn under the Geneva
accords, about 1,300 men from a motorized rifle unit, crossed the
border at Termez in the Soviet Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan
on Wednesday.

<BYLINE>Dry, Cool Weather Gives Illinois Bell A Boost In Restoring Service
^By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spell of cool, dry weather has helped Illinois
Bell restore telephone service to thousands of customers in six
suburbs west of Chicago whose phones went dead after a fire ravaged
a switching center, a company spokesman said.
   Illinois Bell has advanced its target date from mid-June to
early June for restoring normal service to the 35,000 customers who
lost all service after the May 8 fire, spokesman Larry Cose said
Wednesday.
   Illinois Bell expects to start connecting subscribers to a new
digital call switching system being installed at its Hinsdale
center by May 26, instead of the original June 1 target date, Cose
said. It normally takes 50 weeks to install such equipment under
phone company guidelines.
   ``The weather has been our friend the last couple of days,''
Cose said. ``As long as it stays dry and cool, it's great for us;
if it was wet and humid out there we'd probably be seeing more
problems than we are seeing now.''
   Hinsdale's weather _ with daytime temperatures in the 60s and
nights in the 40s under clear skies _ has been good for the 250
employees working 24 hours a day to repair or replace old equipment
and install the new switching system.
   The cool, dry weather has reduced problems with corrosion of old
switching equipment badly damaged in the fire. As a result, Cose
said, Bell officials are using the old equipment to restore partial
service to customers until the new system is installed.
   Twenty dehumidifiers also have been set up to prevent corrosion
of the old equipment.
   By Thursday, the company had restored partial service to 31,000
of the 35,000 customers whose service was cut off by the fire, Cose
said.
   By the end of the week, all 35,000 subscribers in the Hinsdale
area should have limited service, with irregular dial tones and
crackling on the lines, Cose said. The technical problems will
continue until the customers are hooked up to the new switching
equipment, he said.
   As partial service is restored, many would-be callers have
encountered delays because of heavy demand.
   ``It's like a jam getting on the expressway during the rush
hour,'' Cose said. ``But the situation is better than it was
yesterday.''
   Bell expects that regional and long distance lines and special
business lines transmitting computer data that were routed through
the Hinsdale center should be functioning normally by the end of
the week, Cose said.
   More than 125 coin-operated telephones were set up around the
western suburbs, the company said. Many businesses that rely on
telephone orders have been suffering from lagging sales, and one
hospital started using pizza trucks to make birth announcements.
   Meanwhile, volunteer workers continued to staff mobile emergency
reporting patrols in the six suburbs to relay calls for police,
fire or medical services.
   Hinsdale Village Manager Ron Ruskey said 19 emergency vehicles
would be on the street until the town was sure all local phones
were operating.
   A Naperville company, Angels International Travel Inc., filed a
lawsuit seeking class-action status and unspecified damages in Du
Page County Circuit Court for what it said was Bell's failure to
protect properly against the fire.
   Richard Janney, vice president and general counsel for Illinois
Bell, said the company will give double credit to customers who
have been without service. Bell has said it believes it is
protected from legal damages under state law.
   Sam Mitchell, of the Chicago Association of Commerce and
Industry, said it might take months to determine the financial
losses caused by the phone outage.

   Authorities said today that two men killed in a
car bomb explosion were planning to park the automobile near the
headquarters of the Kuwait Airways Corp., but the explosives
apparently went off prematurely.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman identified the men killed in the
explosion Wednesday as Nasser Mohammed Ali Hassan Ahmed, 22, and
Walid Abdel-Nabi Mohammed Mousa Al-Mousa, 23. Both were Kuwaitis.
   ``They were killed as a punishment for their intended crimes,''
said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity under
ministry rules. ``They wanted to plant the explosive somewhere in
the area.''
   He did not say what detonated the bomb on a main downtown
avenue. The explosion, about 25 yards from the airline's office,
destroyed the car and killled both men.
   No other casualties or damage were reported.
   Shops in the area were closed because Wednesday was the third
day of the Moslem feast of Id el Fitr, which marks the end of the
holy month of Ramadan. There would have been few pedestrians in the
area at the time of the blast, residents said.
   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they believe
that the driver wanted to park the Mazda-929 in front of the
airline's headquarters.
   The explosion was the third in this northern Persian Gulf
country in a month. Kuwait is close to the Iran-Iraq warfront and
has been the target of attacks blamed on pro-Iranian terrorists.
   The previous explosions occurred in the same area of the capital.
   The first, on April 27, injured a guard near the offices of the
Saudi national airline. Then on May 7, an explosion occurred at the
offices of Avis, the American car rental company.
   A Kuwaiti newspaper recently reported three people were arrested
in connection with the earlier blasts. Authorities have not
confirmed the report.
   A Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 was commandeered last month on a
flight from Bangkok by gunmen who have been identified as
pro-Iranian Moslem extremists. Two of its Kuwaiti passengers were
killed during the 16-day ordeal and the other passengers and crew
were released.
   The hijackers sought the release of 17 people convicted of
bombing the U.S. and French embassies, the same demand made by the
captors of pro-Iranian groups holding 18 foreigners hostage in
Lebanon.

   A man accused of exposing himself to women
while posing as an underwear model has been convicted of three
counts of lewd and lascivious behavior and four counts of
trespassing.
   Daniel Von Loh was found guilty of the charges Wednesday, but a
Dane County Circuit Court jury acquitted him of a charge of illegal
use of a telephone.
   Defense attorney Morris Berman said in closing arguments that
Von Loh had not broken the law because each of his victims invited
the man into their apartments when he offered to model underwear.
   Assistant District Attorney Robert Kaiser called Von Loh a
``sophisticated flasher'' who lied to his victims to gain their
confidence.
   Judge Angela Bartell revoked Von Loh's bail and sent him to jail
to await a presentence investigation and sentencing.

<TEXT>
   The man who built Sasson Jeans Inc. into a
multimillion-dollar business before winding up in bankruptcy court
has been charged with threatening the judge who is hearing the
firm's bankruptcy reorganization case.
   ``I did not threaten anybody. I am astonished to see I have been
accused of this,'' Paul Guez told U.S. Magistrate Barbara A. Lee
during a hearing Wednesday in which prosecutors sought to have him
detained without bail.
   Guez had been arrested and charged with threatening the life of
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland.
   Guez claimed the charges were ``part of a conspiracy'' to block
his attendance at an afternoon hearing on Sasson's Chapter 11
reorganization plan.
   The magistrate ordered Guez, who was dressed in a rumpled gray
suit and white shirt without a tie, held overnight.
   According to federal prosecutors, Guez, 43, threatened to kill
Lifland and the trustee he appointed to oversee Sasson's
reorganization ``if a result contrary to his interest were to be
reached.''
   FBI agents arrested Guez on Wednesday afternoon at the lower
Manhattan building that houses bankruptcy court.
   The allegations of threats on Lifland were based on information
supplied by an informant described as a lawyer with ``a privileged
professional relationship'' with Guez.
   The complaint further stated that ``due to the tone and
demeanor'' of Guez, the informant believed he was ``fully capable
of carrying out his threat.''
   Sasson has been in bankruptcy proceedings since October 1986. On
Wednesday, Lifland approved the sale of the company's name for $8
million to Stanwich Partners of Stamford, Conn.
   The Tunisian-born Guez arrived in the United States in 1976 with
$74 and a new style of French cut jeans. Through clever advertising
he made millions, also licensing the Sasson label for watches,
lingerie and luggage.
   But the company, beset by to internal feuds, was swamped by
lawsuits leading to the Chapter 11 reorganization.

<HEAD>Cuban Troops Reported Within 45 Miles Of Namibian Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuban troops in Angola have
moved south and are within 45 miles of the border with South-West
Africa, a newspaper reported today.
   Business Day, citing unidentified South African intelligence
sources, said the Cubans were concentrated in five areas in
south-central Angola.
   The newspaper did not say how many Cuban troops were involved.
Defense Minister Magnus Malan said Monday that up to 9,000 of the
more than 40,000 Cuban soldiers in Angola were advancing.
   South African and Angolan officials have met twice this month in
a bid to resolve the 13-year-old civil war in the former Portuguese
colony.
   Angola's Marxist government is supported by the Cuban forces,
while South Africa and the United States support the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   U.S. officials said South Africa and Angola, joined by the
United States and Cuba, are scheduled to meet next week in
Brazzaville, Congo.
   South Africa and Angola have said initial talks were cordial,
but South African officials continue to make hostile statements.
   Malan had suggested that South Africa may have to respond
militarily to the reported Cuban troop movements.
   Angola says South Africa has 9,000 troops in its territory
backed by heavy artillery. South Africa says it has never had more
than 3,000 troops in Angola since it began deploying combat forces
there a year ago.
   A resolution of the Angolan conflict also could lead to a
political settlement in neighboring South-West Africa, also known
as Namibia.
   South Africa administers the territory in violation of a U.N.
resolution and says it has no plans to grant independence until
Cuban forces leave Angola.

<HEAD>9 Black Officers Quit Union In Controversy Over Fired Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine black police officers have quit their
union to protest its staunch support of a white officer who was
fired for making racist and sexist slurs.
   ``The PBA is not in my best interest,'' said Detective Bob
Wright, 32, a 10-year veteran and union member for the past two
years. ``The PBA always seems to revolve around racial issues.''
   Six officers quit the Police Benevolent Association on Tuesday
and three more canceled their $15 monthly dues payments Wednesday,
police officials said.
   Wright said his decision was prompted by dismay over the union's
backing of the fired officer and union President Bob Sheehan's
criticism last month of a stinging manuscript on race relations by
Hillsborough County sheriff's Maj. Arnie Myers, who is black.
   The police union has lambasted last week's firing of Officer
Charles W. Glass by Mayor Sandy Freedman. Sheehan called the
mayor's action illegal and a violation of due process.
   But Wright said he supports the mayor's decision to fire Glass
and favors her tough policy against discrimination.
   ``Being black, I like the policy. It was long overdue,'' he said.
   In a letter to the mayor Tuesday, R. Jeffrey Stull, attorney for
the police union, urged her to reinstate Glass.
   The dispute between the police union and the mayor began Friday
when Ms. Freedman fired Glass, 26, after he acknowledged to police
investigators he made sexually and racially derogatory comments
about Officer Vicky Thomas.
   Police officials reprimanded Glass on April 28. But when the
mayor learned about the incident, she intervened on the grounds
Glass had violated her 1987 policy on discriminatory conduct, which
calls for at least a 15-day suspension and possible dismissal.

   Investigators today blamed recent bombings
in the northern Alto Adige region on neo-Nazi groups based in West
Germany and Austria.
   ``The bombs were probably placed by German-speaking extremists
inspired by neo-Nazi groups based in Bavaria and the north Tyrol,''
said Renato Compagnone, chief of Bolzano's squad that handles
politically linked crimes. He did not say what information led him
to that conclusion.
   Alto Adige, also known as South Tyrol, borders Austria and has
many German-speaking residents. North Tyrol refers to an Austrian
region along the border.
   In the provincial capital of Bolzano on Tuesday, bombs went off
outside two buildings housing Italian-speaking families and outside
the local offices of the Italian state-run television RAI and the
Italian telephone company SIP. There were no injuries.
   Mario Martin, the local state prosecutor, was quoted by Rome's
daily La Repubblica as saying the explosions ``may signal the
beginning of a terrorist escalation in the region.''
   The attacks were claimed, in a leaflet distributed in Vienna, by
a German-speaking extremist organization called ``Ein Tirol'' (One
Tyrol) which seeks self-determination for Alto Adige and opposes a
recent agreement between the Italian government and the local party
Sued Tiroler Volkspartei.
   The party's president, Silvius Magnago, and Eva Klotz, who heads
the South Tyrolean patriotic league Heimatbund, have criticized the
resurgence of extremism in the region.
   The tense relations between Italian-speaking and German-speaking
residents in the popular Alpine resort area was credited for
sizeable gains by Italy's neo-fascist party MSI in the last
provincial elections.
   Italian police tightened security in the area following reports
that a large amount of explosives was stolen this week at Neustift,
an Austrian town just across the border.

   An unusually arid spring has kicked up what
meteorologists are calling the worst blowing dust in at least a
decade, damaging crops and creating hazardous driving conditions in
Minnesota, South and North Dakota.
   Light rain that fell in parts of northern Minnesota and North
Dakota today will help somewhat, said Sam Standfield of the
National Weather Service in Minneapolis.
   ``It will help at least keep the dust down for a while, but
we're going to need more rain than this to end the drought
problem,'' Standfield said.
   In northern Minnesota, the dry spring has caused the worst
conditions of blowing dust in a decade, said William Larson, head
of the University of Minnesota's soil science department.
   The dust has been even worse in North Dakota, says state
climatologist John Enz. ``Over most of the state, we've had the
driest September-through-April since the 1930s,'' he said.
   Conditions are poor in the northeast and northcentral sections
of South Dakota, where officials have declared an agricultural
disaster in 13 counties, said state climatologist Bill Lytle.
   ``There have been a lot of calls from farmers reporting crop
damage,'' said Wally Nelson, superintendent of the Southwest
Experiment Station of the University of Minnesota at Lamberton.
   Blowing dust around Aberdeen, S.D., has filled ditches along
roads, and police closed roads in that area around two weeks ago
when a heavy storm made visibility dangerously low and began
causing accidents.

Bases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese workers at U.S. Navy bases are protesting
a policy that requires employees who deal with confidential matters
to submit to lie detector tests.
   ``The plan neglects our basic human rights,'' said Misao
Kamiyama, chairman of the All Japanese Garrison Forces Labor Union,
which represents 1,200 workers at the U.S. bases.
   The union Monday asked the Defense Facilities Administration
Agency, which hires Japanese workers for the bases, to urge the
Americans to drop the polygraph requirement.
   ``In Japan, only criminals get that kind of treatment ... We are
planning a full-scale nationwide protest against the decision'' if
the agency does not respond by Friday, he said.
   The Navy briefed the workers on the tests in April. Kamiyama
said about 500 Japanese at were asked to sign an agreement to take
a polygraph examination and were ``threatened to be transfered to
other sections if they refuse to sign,'' he said.
   The accuracy of polygraph tests is widely disputed.
   An agency spokesman said it consented to the U.S. plan but
expressed concern about the ``human rights standpoint'' of
polygraph tests. The spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, did not elaborate.
   The agency acts as liaison between the U.S. military in Japan
and the Japanese government. Under the plan, only employees at Navy
plants would have to take the tests.
   Since September 1987, the Navy has been requiring the polygraph
examination before it grants ``limited access authorization,'' to
personnel, a U.S. military spokesman said.
   ``This is a measure taken worldwide and not aimed at Japanese
alone,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   About 500 Japanese base workers are subject to the lie detector
test, the spokesman said. Most work at ship repair facilities in
Yokosuka and Sasebo.
   Kamiyama said trasfers of employees who refused to take the
tests could fuel anti-American sentiment among the Japanese.
   ``In Okinawa, where people feel uneasy about the U.S. bases
occupying such a vast land, such an insensitive policy could easily
cause a major protest, not only among base workers but also other
people,'' he said.
   U.S. bases occupy about 11 percent of the island of Okinawa's
867 square miles.

   Equipment containing superheated steam
exploded today at a General Electric Co. manufacturing plant,
killing one worker and burning two others, one critically, company
and hospital officials said.
   The explosion at a facility where GE manufactures steam turbines
and generators occurred when pressure built up in an autoclave,
said company spokesman Pat Rocchi.
   ``It appears a pressure vessel ruptured,'' said another
spokesman, Len Doviak.
   Thomas Dwojakowski of Schenectady was dead on arrival at Ellis
Hospital, said hospital spokesman Andy Foster. The cause of death
was not stated, pending an autopsy.
   One of the injured, Robert Frascatore, 39, was taken to the
Schenectady hospital, then transferred to the burn unit of Albany
Medical Center, Foster said. He was listed in critical condition
with burns over more than half his body.
   The second man, William Andres, 44, of Schenectady, was treated
for burns and released, Foster said.
   The company was investigating the accident, said Doviak, and the
federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been
notified.

<HEAD>Deng Urges Leaders to Take Risks, Says Price Increases Necessary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping said today he advises
China's leaders not to be afraid to take risks for the sake of
progress, and he cited recent price increases as an example.
   Deng made the comment during a two-hour meeting with O Jin U,
North Korea's Minister of the People's Armed Forces, who led a
military delegation on a five-day visit to China, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported. The delegation returns to North Korea
Friday.
   The 83-year-old senior leader went into semi-retirement last
fall and has made rare public appearances.
   The nationally televised evening news showed Deng, looking fit
and alert, greeting O with a hug and kisses on both cheeks.
   ``I often tell my colleagues to be brave and not be afraid of
risks, because otherwise, no progress will be made,'' Deng told the
North Koreans.
   He made the statement while talking about drastic price reforms
that have raised the prices of four staple foods by as much as 60
percent.
   The price increases went into effect in Beijing four days ago,
raising the prices of eggs, pork, vegetables and sugar by 28
percent to 60 percent. They created much grumbling among consumers
already unhappy about skyrocketing prices.
   ``China's current price reform is a bold yet risky action, but
the country's leadership is confident of doing a good job,'' Deng
said.
   He said the price increases are necessary because food prices in
the past were kept artificially low through government subsidies.
   Deng said reform of the price of raw materials would follow the
rise in food prices.
   Resolving the price problem is imperative to China's economic
progress and its attainment of the goal of reaching
``developed-country status'' by the middle of the next century,
Xinhua reported Deng as saying.
   ``China's leadership knows every step the country takes involves
risks and it could encounter difficulties,'' Deng said. ``The party
and the masses have to understand this is a demanding task.''

<HEAD>Crew of Two Planned for First Soviet Shuttle Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet space official said today two cosmonauts
probably will man the nation's first shuttle flight.
   The Soviets earlier had indicated the inaugural flight of the
space shuttle might be unmanned. No date has been announced.
   Radio Moscow quoted Vladimir Shatalov, head of the Soviet
cosmonaut training program, as telling reporters visiting the space
center in Baikonur that two cosmonauts would be aboard.
   ``The test flight will be carried out after all the systems of
the Energia booster rocket and of the shuttle have been thoroughly
checked,'' the broadcast quoted Shatalov as saying.
   Radio Moscow said the Soviet shuttle is ``similar to the
American model, but has a number of design peculiarities.''
   No other details were provided.
   Sources in Washington familiar with the Soviet space program say
the shuttle has been tested at Baikonur on a 15,000-foot landing
strip and that cosmonaut Igor Volk is the program's chief pilot and
likely to be part of the crew.
   Soviet officials have been saying since January that the first
launch of a reuseable spacecraft was imminent and have varied in
their reports about whether it would be manned or not.
   Alexander Dunaev, head of the Soviet space agency Glavkosmos,
told a news conference in March that scientists were working around
the clock to prepare for the first shuttle flight, which he said
would be unmanned.
   ``We pursue the fundamental objective: whether man is alive or
dead after the flight,'' Dunaev said, in pointed reference to the
January 1986 U.S. space shuttle disaster in which seven astronauts
were killed.
   The American shuttle program has been grounded since the
Challenger tragedy.
   The first Soviet satellite launch for a paying customer was made
on March 17, when an Indian satellite was lifted into orbit from
the Baikonur spaceport in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan.
   Western sources have told The Associated Press that the Soviet
shuttle will not have rocket engines mounted on it, as the U.S.
shuttle does. Instead, the engines are mounted on the Energia
booster rocket, and the reuseable craft is powered by jet engines
which give it more maneuverability on landing.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler has begun installing driver's-side air
bags as standard equipment on three of its models and will add them
this week to three more, becoming the first U.S. automaker to make
air bags standard equipment.
   Federal safety regulations require increased use of passive
restraints, such as air bags, which inflate in event of a
collision, or automatic seat belts. Twenty-five percent of 1988
vehicles must have them, 40 percent in 1989 and 100 percent by 1990.
   Chrysler said Wednesday it began installing driver's-side air
bags on Dodge Daytona, Chrysler LeBaron coupe and LeBaron
convertible models after May 1. Beginning Saturday, its large
rear-wheel-drive sedans _ Chrysler Fifth Avenue, Dodge Diplomat and
Plymouth Gran Fury _ will have them. However, Chrysler plans to
stop building those three cars at year's end.
   The No. 3 automaker said it will tout the air bag-equipped
models in a two-page advertisement featuring Chairman Lee Iacocca
and a drawing showing how the device works. The ad will run in 14
magazines and newspapers next week.
   The air bags inflate within one-twentieth of a second after
electronic sensors detect the beginning of an impact that would be
comparable to hitting a wall at 10 miles an hour or faster. The
bags, stored in the center of the steering wheel, deflate almost
immediately.
   Chrysler offers motorized automatic lap and shoulder belts on
the imported Conquest and Eagle Medallion and plans to include them
on the Dodge Shadow, Plymouth Sundance and Eagle Premier later this
year, said spokesman Tom Houston.
   Ford Motor Co., the nation's second-largest automaker, offers
air bags as optional equipment on its Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz
compact cars, plans to add more models by 1990 and may include them
as standard equipment on one high-end 1989 model.
   Ford uses automatic motorized front seat belts on several models
including the Ford Escort, one of its top-selling cars.
   General Motors Corp., the nation's largest automaker, offers the
bags as options on the 1988 Oldsmobile Delta 88, plans to offer
them on an additional car line in 1989 and plans to make them
standard equipment on some 1990 models.
   Automatic front seat belts already are standard on many GM
models.

<HEAD>Three Officers Plead Innocent To Supporting Coup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three military officers pleaded
innocent today to charges of supporting an August 1987 coup attempt
that left 53 people dead and hundreds wounded.
   Also today, the military reported that seven people were killed
in communist guerrilla attacks.
   Army Maj. Wilhelm Doromal, Lt. Fernando Baltazar and Lt.
Gregorio Catapang denied charges that they had incited Philippine
Military Academy cadets to support the Aug. 28 coup bid against
President Corazon Aquino.
   The Supreme Court meanwhile ordered a military tribunal to stop
the arraignment of two other officers, Lt. Col. Eduardo Kapunan and
Lt. Col. Nelson Eslao. They have been charged with the same
offense, but on Wednesday asked the court in a petition halt the
arraignment and release them.
   The five officers were accused of voluntarily joining the mutiny
led by former Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan and denouncing the Aquino
government in a letter read over a radio station in Baguio City,
where the military academy is located. Honasan is still at large.
   In their petition, Kapunan and Eslao accused chief of staff Gen.
Renato de Villa and other officers of ``grave abuse of authority''
in filing the case against them. The court gave military
authorities 10 days to answer the charge.
   A regional Philippine Constabulary commander said today that
vice mayor Aquilino Cantiaga was ambushed Monday in the coastal
town of Albuera, 360 miles southeast of Manila.
   Brig. Gen. Lorenzo Mateo said an undetermined number of
communist New People's Army rebels positioned on both sides of an
isolated road in Albuera fired on the jeep carrying Cantiaga, three
bodyguards and a civilian companion.
   The vice mayor was unhurt, but the civilian was killed and three
bodyguards were wounded in the gunfire, Mateo said.
   On the island of Negros, guerrillas killed two soldiers and two
government militiamen in a clash Wednesday in the town of Isabela,
130 miles southwest of Albuera, a military report said. It said two
rebels died in the fighting.

<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top elective body in Ayacucho Province
said soldiers entered a village and massacred about 100 peasants in
retaliation for a rebel ambush of an army convoy.
   The military, in a communique issued late Wednesday, called the
charges unfounded and said they were aimed at blocking efforts to
capture the Maoist Shining Path rebels. In Lima, lawmakers said the
government would investigate.
   The alleged massacre reportedly occurred just hours before Pope
John Paul II arrived in Peru during a four-nation South American
tour. He did not travel to Ayacucho, which is 230 miles southeast
of Lima.
   The leftist-oriented Ayacucho Provincial Council said troops
swarmed into Cayara, 50 miles south of this provincial capital, on
Saturday and slaughtered the peasants.
   Cayara residents told council members soldiers
``indiscriminately'' killed 30 to 50 defenseless young men who were
harvested corn in fields surrounding the town of 1,000 people, the
council said in a statement Wednesday.
   Residents said troops then herded 50 more peasants into a chapel
and killed them, the statement claimed.
   It said townspeople told the council they were unsure how many
people were killed because the attackers poured gasoline on and
burned some bodies and because many people had gone into hiding. It
said the troops used bayonets to kill many of them.
   The council is headed by Ayacucho Mayor Fermin Azparrent, a
member of the Marxist opposition party the United Left.
   Senate President Jorge Lozada said the government of President
Alan Garcia would investigate.
   Leftist and human rights groups have frequently accused the
military in the past few years of killing civilians in areas where
rebel activity is intense and soldiers suspect villagers of
sympathizing with the insurgents.
   The Ayacucho military command said on Wednesday that 100
guerrillas of the Shining Path movement ambushed two army trucks
around midnight on Friday near Cayara. It said four soldiers and
six guerrillas were killed and 15 troops wounded in the fighting.
   Wednesday's communique, the first official description of the
attack, said troop reinforcements pursued the guerrillas and the
two sides clashed again on Saturday, causing ``unverified
casualties among the subversives.''
   The military communique said Cayara residents had fled and the
town was empty when troops arrived on Saturday. It said four bodies
were found in the chapel.
   Ayacucho's impoverished highlands were the birthplace and remain
the stronghold of the Shining Path. The eight-year insurgency has
cost more than 10,000 lives, mainly those of peasants caught up in
the violence between guerrillas and government forces.
   Police in the provincial capital say the Shining Path has
murdered hundreds of villagers in the province, more than 100 so
far this year, who it accuses of supporting the army.
   The province had been under direct military control since late
1982.
   Residents of the province have linked the military with the
deaths of nearly 150 peasants in three earlier purported massacres
since Garcia took office in July 1985.
   Charges by human rights groups that the military has waged a
``dirty war'' against peasants have eased, however, during Garcia's
term.

<HEAD>Youth Organization Asks For Explanation of Rumored Coup Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Slovenian youth organization
says the military planned a coup in the republic of Slovenia but
that the government prevented it.
   The allegation and a demand for an explanation came in an open
letter to Slovenia's Communist leader Milan Kucan and its interior
minister, Tomaz Ertl. It was published by the magazine Mladina,
official mouthpiece of the Socialist Youth.
   In the letter, the Socialist Youth alleged the coup was planned
for earlier this year and included the arrests of nonconformist
journalists, writers and officials. It said its report was based on
widely spread rumors.
   The military was to quell street demonstrations and other unrest
that were expected to follow the arrests, Mladina said in its
current edition.
   The report said that according to rumors, the army had failed to
notify the country's and Slovenia's civilian Communist leadership
of the coup plans.
   Slovenian security organizations notified Kucan and Stane
Dolanc, Slovenia's member in the collective presidency and now
Yugoslavia's vice president, who prevented the plan, said the
magazine.
   From Kucan and Ertl ``we demand a clear and detailed answer to a
simple question: How much truth is there in the above summarized
rumors?'' said Mladina.
   France Zavrl, an editor of the magazine, told The Associated
Press that Kucan promised to reply.
   A number of articles published in the Slovenian press this year,
particularly in Mladina, denounced the army as an undemocratic
pro-Soviet institution intent on staging a military coup.
   In April, a parliamentary commission responsible for state
security said the articles were part of an international conspiracy
to weaken national defense and to overthrow the government.
   The army has criticized Slovenia's leadership for not taking
tough action against dissent in Slovenia. The dissent includes
frequent attacks on Yugoslav domestic and foreign policies and such
figures as the late Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito.
   Earlier this month, Mladina published what it said was a speech
by Kucan at a closed session of Yugoslavia's Communist presidium on
March 29 in which he said that the coup plan existed.
   The article quoting Kucan's speech was immediately banned by the
authorities under the pretext that it revealed a state secret, said
Zavrl.
   Communists in Slovenia have often been at odds with official
Yugoslav policy by offering unorthodox solutions to the country's
deepening economic and social problems. The proposals include
introduction of a more market-oriented economy and closer ties with
the West.
   Yugoslavia is officially non-aligned.

   House Speaker Jim Wright said today that the
government watchdog group Common Cause was wrongly accusing him of
unethical behavior and that his actions were ``clearly legal and
proper.''
   Common Cause president Fred Wertheimer announced on Wednesday
that his group, which monitors and suggests ways of enforcing
ethical practices by public officials, was requesting an
investigation by the House ethics committee into whether Wright
violated conflict-of-interest rules.
   Wright, D-Texas, for months has been the subject of published
reports about his activities on behalf of Texas associates and
campaign contributors.
   According to the reports, Wright receives 55 percent of the
royalties, far above the normal 10 to 15 percent, for his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man.'' The book, published by longtime
campaign supporter William Carlos Moore, has earned Wright more
than $54,000.
   Moore's firms reportedly received more than $250,000 for
campaign services during 1985 and 1986 from Wright's re-election
committee.
   Wertheimer said the ethics committee needs to examine whether
the speaker's campaign committees were at all involved in either
publishing or selling the book, which he said could be a violation
of House or other federal conflict-of-interest rules.
   The committee also needs to determine whether Wright improperly
sought special treatment for constituents and party campaign
contributors in connection with the regulatory activities of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, including blocking legislation,
Wertheimer said.
   ``Common Cause believes that it is in the best interests of the
public, the House of Representatives and of Speaker Wright for the
House ethics committee to examine and resolve these matters,''
Wertheimer wrote in a letter to the ethics panel.
   ``We further believe that in conducting its inquiry, the
committee should retain an outside counsel, as it has done on a
number of occasions in the past,'' to ``ensure that the results of
the inquiry are credible to and accepted by the public.''
   Wright said today his discussions with the banking officials
were part of a congressman's job. ``This action is clearly legal
and proper,'' he said.
   ``Most members of Congress intercede regularly on behalf of
constituents with the various regulatory agencies of government,''
he said.
   Wright said the rules of Congress clearly authorize members to
receive royalty payments for their books, and he said his campaign
committee ``did not pay any amount for publishing the book, nor did
it purchase any copies of the book.''
   The speaker today criticized Wertheimer for not contacting him
directly about the accusations. On Wednesday, the speaker's office
released a statement accusing Common Cause of being ``the
handmaiden of a partisan political initiative.''
   Wertheimer said his request was not associated with the actions
of Wright's opponents. But Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who has led
the criticism, said Common Cause was giving ideological balance to
the criticism.
   Gingrich said in a statement Wednesday he was working with
lawyers ``to develop formal charges along the lines Common Cause
suggests.''
   The ethics committee, officially called the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct, has been criticized by Gingrich and
others for apparent reluctance to investigate the speaker's
activities.
   Committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said he had no
comment on the letter.

   Fruits, spices and grains entombed with the
ancient Egyptian boy king Tutankhamun for his journey to the
afterlife have been rediscovered after 56 years in a musty
storeroom, a newspaper reported today.
   The Times of London said an archeological student discovered the
boxes of food remains at the Royal Botanical Gardens.
   The newspaper said the remains have not been disturbed since
they were sent to the gardens in 1932 by Howard Carter, who
discovered Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valleys of the Kings at Luxor,
Egypt, in 1922.
   The remains were to have been cataloged by retired botanist
Leonard Boodle, but were apparently forgotten after his death in
the 1930s.
   Arthur Bell, director of the gardens at Kew in south London, was
quoted as saying the remains recently were identified by Christian
Tutundjian de Vartavan, a 23-year-old French student working on a
master of science degree in ancient Egyptian plants at London's
University College.
   The Times said the college's Institute of Archaeology is trying
to determine what species of plants are represented in the hoard,
which includes sections of funeral wreaths and more than five
pounds of seeds, fruits and spices placed in Tutankhamun's tomb
after his death more than 3,300 years ago.
   The Times said the species indentified so far include emmer
wheat for making bread on the journey, barley for brewing beer and
a considerable quantity of watermelon seeds to chew on.
   Also found were coriander, fenugreek, black cumin, sesame seeds,
two kinds of juniper berries and grapes.
   The Times quoted University College botanist Gordon Hillman as
saying the collection also includes more than 20 species of weeds.
   ``They will help to tell us how the crops were irrigated, how
they were harvested and how they were stored,'' Hillman was quoted
as saying.
   The newspaper said officials at Kew are willing to return the
specimens to the Egyptian government, but would like to put some on
display.
   The Independent newspaper said Tutundjian de Vartavan came
across the Tutankhamun remains while studying ancient Egyptian
plant remains.
   The Times and The Independent said the find represents only a
fraction of the food buried in the tomb. The rest is still in 116
original wicker baskets and several pottery jars in the Cairo
Museum and the Dokki Agricultural Museum in Egypt.

<HEAD>Thai Official Says Soviets Will Talk With Vietnam About Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and Vietnam will talk
about ending the Vietnamese military occupation of Cambodia,
Thailand's foreign minister said today.
   ``The Soviet Union will talk earnestly to Vietnam and try its
best to resolve the occupation of Cambodia,'' Foreign Minister
Siddhi Savetsila said. He said he was told of the apparent switch
in Moscow's position by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduarde
Shevardnadze during an 1{-hour meeting Wednesday in Moscow.
   There was no immediate response from Moscow.
   Siddhi declined to say when and where the talks would be held.
He spoke with reporters at Bangkok airport upon returning from
Moscow. He had accompanied Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, who
remained in the Soviet capital.
   The official Radio Thailand today quoted a Foreign Ministry
report as saying that in talks with Prem on Wednesday, Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``pledged to assist in every way in the
search for a political settlement of the Cambodian problem and
agreed with Cambodia being a neutral and independent country.''
   Soviet officials previously have said they had no direct role to
play in the situation. Vietnam has occupied Cambodia since 1978,
when it drove the bloody Khmer Rouge from power.
   The State Department says Vietnam has 120,000 soldiers in
Cambodia.
   The Soviet Union is the main supplier of arms to Vietnamese
forces that are battling guerrillas backed by Thailand and other
countries. Cambodia is on Thailand's eastern border, and Bangkok
regards the Vietnamese occupation as its major security threat.
   
   While visiting Thailand last month, the Soviet deputy foreign
minister, Igor I. Rogachev, said the Kremlin couldn't pressure
Hanoi on Cambodia because Vietnam is a sovereign country.
   Thai officials responded that Hanoi would be forced to end the
occupation if the Soviets stopped supplying arms.
   Radio Thailand said that in talks with Gorbachev, Prem referred
to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and said he believed the
Cambodian conflict also could be resolved. Gorbachev then pledged
to help.
   Siddhi said that Moscow wants him to hold talks on Cambodia with
Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, after Thailand's
general elections on July 24.
   The Khmer Rouge, a radical communist guerrilla group, defeated
the U.S.-backed Cambodian government in the spring of 1975 and
forced the evacaution of the country's cities, making the residents
go into rural areas to work. Millions of Cambodians were killed by
the Khmer Rouge or died of starvation and disease.

<TEXT>
   An orphaned whale that washed ashore
with its mother arrived today at its new home in Florida, where it
is expected to survive, marine experts say.
   Paul Barrington, curator of the North Carolina Aquarium here,
said the baby pygmy sperm whale showed no signs of disease or
severe injury. Daniel Odell, a marine biologist at Sea World in
Orlando, Fla., said the whale was suffering from low blood sugar
was otherwise fine.
   Sophia and a 10-foot female whale beached Tuesday afternoon at
Long Beach. The larger whale died and its corpse was sent to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, where a necropsy will be
performed.
   The surviving whale ate small herring and small portions of
squid at the Fort Fisher aquarium. Aquarium employees were helping
it feed by putting food up to its mouth. Staffers were trying to
keep it relaxed to allow the food to digest properly.
   A veterinarian injected the whale, which was slightly injured in
the beaching, with antibiotics and vitamins.
   Wednesday night, Raleigh television station WRAL hired an
airplane to take the whale _ named Sophia before aquarium workers
found it was male _ to Sea World near Orlando.
   The mammal arrived safely early today, said Kevin Shand, an
assignment editor at WRAL-TV. ``They're still not sure whether the
baby whale will stay at Sea World or be returned to its home in the
ocean,'' Shand said today.

<TEXT>
   Youths from rival housing projects
should be able to meet peacefully on the basketball court, say
school officials, but police aren't so sure that street warfare
won't spill over into the contest.
   The Board of Education this week unanimously approved a request
to hold a basketball match June 5 between students from Pitney
Village and the nearby Shore Park complex, both on the city's west
side.
   A school official said he believed there would be no replay of
the violence that marred a tournament last year.
   Wilbert L. Royal, coordinator for the West Side School Complex,
where the game would be held, said the game would be the ``first
attempt to try and ameliorate ... any animosity that still exists
between these two areas.''
   ``It will be a friendly rivalry rather than the combative
rivalry that a turf war brings,'' he said.
   But Atlantic City Police Chief Joseph Pasquale called the idea
``ridiculous'' and said he doubted the event would be permitted.
   ``We discourage any gathering of these two groups because they
hate each other,'' he said. ``Both areas have a lot of weapons.
Both areas dislike each other. Both areas are drug-infested and
we've got two big investigations going on in both areas.''
   Pasquale fears a repeat of the shooting and stabbings at the
Seagull Classic high school basketball tournament in nearby Absecon
in December.
   Royal said he would not dispute Pasquale if he believes the
basketball game would be a risk to safety. But he said he believed
``the sides have cooled.''
   Royal pointed to a recent incident-free rap concert at a city
complex, calling it an example of the ability of students from
different parts of the city to get along.

   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
said today the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty could be
approved before President Reagan leaves for Moscow next Wednesday.
   ``If only the legitimate and serious points of order and
amendments are called up, this treaty can be approved in time for
the president to take it with him to the summit,'' Byrd, D-W.Va.,
told reporters.
   The Senate voted 91-6 Wednesday to reject the first conservative
attack on the treaty. That was a point of order raised by Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who claimed Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
wasn't authorized to sign the pact and the Senate therefore should
not ratify it.
   ``The first vote would indicate the Senate did not think it was
a serious point. I did not think it was,'' said Byrd.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said, ``we need to get some
action...We need to have the debate, have the vote, and move on.''
   ``I feel a particular responsibility in this instance'' because
there is a Republican in the White House and Republican
conservatives are the chief critics of the treaty, Dole said.
   ``The burden is on the Republicans to move this along,'' said
Dole, noting that the only proposed amendments have been spelled
out by members of his party.
   ``Maybe we could even get lucky and finish this by next Tuesday
or Wednesday,'' said Dole. ``I hope we continue to expedite this
process.''
   Reagan leaves Wednesday for his Moscow summit meeting with
Gorbachev and he has said he hopes he take a ratified treaty with
him.
   After the vote late Wednesday, Dole said, ``I think the vote
we've just had is an indication of the strong support we have for
this treaty. Let's get on with it.''
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., agreed with Dole. ``Let's do our work.
Let's not fool around, which I think we are doing to a large extent
on the amendment that was just defeated. ... I don't know what
benefit there is in waiting until after the summit begins to ratify
this treaty.''
   ``There is no cause for further, untimely delay,'' said Exon.
   Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt., said ``the American people want the
president to have a ratified treaty in his briefcase when he
meets'' Gorbachev.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed Dec. 8 by
Reagan and Gorbachev, calls for the elimination of all missiles
with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   Helms contended that because Gorbachev was signing as the
general secretary of the Soviet Union's Communist Party, he
represented a political party and not the Soviet state.
   ``This document now at the desk is not binding on the Soviet
Union. It is only an agreement between the president of the United
States and the head of a foreign political party,'' said Helms.
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, agreed with Helms, noting that ``if
Gorbachev is removed from power someday, they could easily come
back and say he was only the head of the Communist Party and
therefore the treaty is invalid.''
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., responded that ``there is no
substance whatsoever to the claim that the treaty was not legally
signed. ... Treaty making is a matter of common sense and wise
judgment.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said there was no question that Gorbachev was
representing his nation when he signed the pact.
   ``It is clear that Mr. Gorbachev and no one else in that
delegation was the chief representative of the Soviet Union,'' Pell
said.
   Helms rejected what he said he were insinuations that he was
raising technical points simply for the sake of delay. ``What is
occurring is not dilatory, but is instead and, in fact,
deliberative,'' he told his colleagues.
   The Senate still faces an unresolved fight over the legal
interpretation of treaties.
   That dispute arises from Reagan's claim that he has the legal
right to unilaterally change how a treaty is viewed by the United
States. He has asserted that right in relation to the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   Democrats who control the Senate have added an amendment to the
INF pact which says no future president can reinterpret the pact
without Senate approval. Republicans object to the addition.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Wednesday that the
interpretation amendment was a ``booby trap'' that ``creates
confusion and confrontation.'' He called it ``a turf battle
extraordinaire in which the Senate is seeking primacy in the
treaty-making process.''
   But Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., disagreed, arguing that the
Senate should protect its rights. ``If we do not do this, the
Senate's role in treaty-making will be completely obliterated,'' he
said.

   The commander of U.S. Navy forces in the
Persian Gulf said today that the missile attack on the USS Stark a
year ago led to improved safety techniques that helped save a
sister vessel.
   Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less said the survival of the missile
frigate Samuel B. Roberts after it hit an Iranian mine last month
was ``proof positive that others live, due to the sacrifice of the
brave men on Stark.''
   Thirty-seven sailors were killed when two errant Iraqi missiles
hit the Stark on May 17, 1987.
   Less, commander of the U.S. Joint Task Force Middle East, spoke
of the Navy's improved shipboard safety measures at a U.S. Embassy
ceremony honoring the sailors.
   Ten crewmen on the Samuel B. Roberts were injured when it
collided with a newly laid mine in the central gulf April 14. Its
skipper, Cmdr. Paul X. Rinn, has said lessons learned from the
Stark incident enabled his crew to keep their ship from sinking.
   Less said the sacrifice of the Stark's crew ``greatly assisted
the United States Navy in being smarter, more combat-ready,
especially here in this gulf, and elsewhere throughout the world.''
   Among post-Stark safety measures now in effect are procedures
under which Iraqi warplanes raiding Iranian oil tankers are warned
away from U.S. ships.
   Iran and Iraq both have attacked neutral tankers in the gulf as
part of their 7{-year-old war.
   The Iraqi government said the Stark attack was a mistake, and
the United States accepted its apology.
   Other ceremonies marking the first anniversary of the Stark
attack have been held in recent days at Arlington National Cemetery
in Arlington, Va., Mayport Naval Station in Mayport, Fla., the
frigate's home port, and aboard Navy ships in the gulf.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II returned to Rome today after a
12-day South American tour in which he condemned drugs in Bolivia,
preached reconciliation in Peru and Paraguay and reminded Uruguay
of its Roman Catholic roots.
   The pontiff's plane arrived at Rome's Ciampino airport shortly
after 4 p.m. and he headed directly for the Vatican.
   He ended his tour in the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion on
Wednesday with a plea for listeners to settle their differences and
build a better nation. The day also marked his 68th birthday.
   ``The key to unity, reconciliation and brotherhood is in the
Scriptures,'' the pontiff said at an airport farewell ceremony
attended by authoritarian President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, 75,
the Western Hemisphere's longest-ruling head of state.
   ``By building a Christian nation and being faithful to your
genuine roots, you can build a Paraguay of tomorrow,'' said John
Paul, who early in the visit preached respect for human rights and
civil liberties to Stroessner, in power since a 1954 coup.
   Stroessner, bidding the pope goodbye, said the visit had been a
``source of joy and hope'' for Paraguay, which he described as ``a
pluralistic and democratic society ... without terrorism ... and
enjoying full freedom within a state of law.''
   Most outside observers regard the nation of 3.8 million people
as a dictatorship.
   The Asuncion daily newspaper Patria, run by the governing
Colorado Party, lashed out on Wednesday at the pope's Tuesday night
meeting with a church-selected group of civic and cultural leaders
which included opposition activists. The church had called the
group Builders of Society.
   Labeling the group a ``grab-bag of society's destroyers'' Patria
said in an editorial: ``There is no doubt about the opposition's
ideologizing, politicizing and manipulating everything concerned
with the meeting.''
   John Paul's trip, his 37th since becoming pope in 1978 and the
ninth to Latin America, took him from tiny Uruguay on the Atlantic
coast to Bolivia, high in the Andes, Peru on the Pacific and
landlocked, semi-tropical Paraguay.
   The pontiff ended his trip at a giant youth rally where he was
serenaded with ``Happy Birthday'' sung in his native Polish and in
Guarani, the Indian language spoken along with Spanish by most
Paraguayans.
   ``I feel young, especially when I'm with young people,'' the
pope told the youngsters, estimated at more than 100,000.
   John Paul urged them ``to love God above all things, to be
saints.''
   The rally ended a gruelling 57-hour schedule that included
visits to five Paraguayan cities and meetings with Stroessner,
opponents who accuse the president of political repression, church
leaders, poor peasants and landless native Indians.
   John Paul flew on Wednesday to the southeastern Parana River
port of Encarnacion for a prayer meeting and visited Caacupe for a
Mass at the national Catholic shrine.
   Speaking at a copper-roofed basilica dedicated to the Virgin of
Caacupe, the pontiff repeated an earlier call that special
attention be given to the rights of Paraguay's peasants and Indians.
   Difficulties and problems ``are not lacking in the life of the
native as well as that of the peasants,'' the pope said. ``Often
they have been marginalized and forgotten.''
   The Roman Catholic Church, John Paul added, strongly supports
these groups ``and their demands that their legitimate rights be
respected.''
   The pope told tens of thousands of faithful at a prayer service
in Encarnacion that Paraguay suffers from a concept of life that
puts ``profits and a thirst for power above the human person and
his needs.''
   The Paraguayan visit was perhaps the most politically sensitive
on the trip. Just after the pope arrived, police arrested four
people associated with opposition activity, including a U.S. Jesuit
priest, but later released them without comment.
   In Uruguay, South America's most secular nation, the pontiff
told the populace to remember its Catholic roots and spoke out in
favor of union rights.
   Bolivia, South America's most impoverished nation and a leading
cocaine source, heard the pontiff call for a campaign against drug
traffficking and corruption.
   In Peru, amid massive security and the arrest of thousands of
suspected troublemakers, John Paul urged an end to the ``hate and
violence'' that have claimed 10,000 lives over a decade of leftist
terrorist activity.

   A man who served time for killing his
heiress mother-in-law and her nurse in 1977 has apparently
committed suicide, authorities said.
   Roger S. Caldwell, 54, slit both wrists and bled to death on his
living room floor late Tuesday or early Wednesday, according to
Westmoreland County Deputy Coroner Joseph Musgrove.
   Caldwell was convicted in the slayings of Elisabeth Congdon of
Duluth and her night nurse, Velma Pietila, 67, in Congdon's Lake
Superior mansion on June 27, 1977.
   Musgrove said Caldwell left three suicide notes. The St. Paul
(Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch reported one note said he was
innocent of the murders.
   The newspaper also cited unidentified sources who said Caldwell
recently complained of being unable to get a job in his hometown of
Latrobe and of being haunted by notoriety from the murders.
   An agreement nearly five years ago allowed Caldwell to plead
guilty to second-degree murder and he was released on time already
served in prison.
   It came after the Minnesota Supreme Court overturned his 1978
murder conviction, released him from prison and granted him a new
trial.
   Prosecutors and police had contended the slayings were part of a
plot by Caldwell and his wife, Marjorie, to kill her adoptive
mother and collect an inheritance of about $8.2 million.
   Marjorie Caldwell was later tried and acquitted on similar
murder charges. The couple were divorced, according to Musgrove.

election campaign is viewed abroad.

   Editorial writers abroad have begun looking ahead to a race in
November between Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael
Dukakis. Here is some of what they had to say:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Guardian of London (liberal): ``Something that has not
happened since 1964 may suddenly, unpredictably, be happening
again. Almost 24 years ago, Lyndon B. Johnson won California for
the Democrats. No Democratic candidate since has performed that
trick. ... And yet, this morning, we not only find Gov. Michael
Dukakis leading George Bush by 10 clear percentage points on
nationwide polls, the front-runner in every major area of the
United States: we also find him 17 points ahead in California.
   ``May polls, of course, may be broken reeds in November. ...
But, at the very least, Europe ought now to be sitting up and
taking urgent notice. Our leaders, and those they pay to advise
them on diplomatic developments, have until very recently ...
tended to assume that President Bush is a foregone conclusion. That
was always a little wonky. Today it looks stupid. Try President
Dukakis for size.''
  
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Times of London (independent): ``The American presidency
has more often than not been held by dull men, or by men who would
have been thought dull were it not for the interesting events in
which they were caught up. That is perhaps the explanation of the
`bore factor' which is affecting not just George Bush but his most
likely Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis. This year's campaign
is taking place in times of peace and prosperity for America
unmatched in most presidential election years this century. It is
difficult for candidates to sound exciting in such times. ...
   ``Whoever wins, an envious world will eventually make sure that
America becomes _ for a while at least _ less peaceful, and perhaps
less prosperous. That is the fate of great countries which are also
democracies in a world in which most countries are neither great
nor democratic. Either candidate will soon become more exciting
than he is at present because _ sadly _ the events will become so.
America should be grateful for these two `bores' while she can.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ZIMBABWE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Herald of Harare (government-controlled): ``In comparing
Democrats and Republicans the former are more accessible and easier
to communicate with. American interests are interwoven with the
interests of others. At worst the Democrats make Third World
countries at least feel they are considered when America makes
decisions. But Republicans act in ways that fly in the face of
accepted diplomatic norms.
   ``Because of that primary consideration for American interests,
it is highly unlikely that anyone with political ideas such as
Jesse Jackson's would ever reach the White House. ...
   ``Mr. Ronald Reagan had no political program when he came in and
may not quite understand the differences between the Contras and
Unita but he went through on the `make America the greatest again'
ticket.
   ``Yet the Democrats are the lesser of the two evils. Developing
countries would certainly be better off with Michael Dukakis. If he
appointed a black to the post of secretary of state this would be
for the purpose of internal public relations and not for any
consideration of black Africa.
   ``Developing countries must accept the fact that developed
countries are only what they are because we are how we are. Any
change in our status will proportinately change theirs. It is this
that is drilled into the resident of the White House to always
remember.
   ``We too in developing countries must always remember that.''

   Lucius P. ``Pat'' Yale, who served as a
reporter, editor and bureau chief in a 37-year career with The
Associated Press, died of cancer today. He was 79.
   Yale retired in 1971 as the AP's Connecticut bureau chief. He
had held that position since 1965 after serving for 15 years as
chief of bureau in Boston. From 1942 until 1950, he was chief of
bureau in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Yale, born Jan. 4, 1909, in Aurora, Ill., graduated from the
University of Illinois and worked on the St. Louis Star, the Ottawa
(Ill.) Republican-Times and the Joliet (Ill.) Herald-News before
joining AP in Chicago in 1934.
   He was transferred to New York in 1938, serving on the Foreign
Desk and as night editor and city editor in the New York bureau.
   While in Des Moines, he covered the trial in 1949 of Dr. Robert
C. Rutledge, who stabbed to death his wife's lover. Yale's verbatim
reporting of the sometimes racy testimony became a landmark case in
AP trial coverage.
   Some newspaper editors objected to such frank reporting and
voiced their opposition at the annual convention of The Associated
Press Managing Editors in Fort Worth, Texas. The convention voted
overwhelmingly that the AP should continue such reporting and let
newspaper editors decide whether to publish it.
   Yale, who lived in Essex, Conn., is survived by his wife,
Margaret, and three children, Robert of Washington, D.C., Stephen,
a minister in Philadelphia, and Mrs. Donald C. Sukosky of
Glastonbury, Conn.

<HEAD>Senators Introduce Legislation to Overhaul War Powers Act</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of senators, aserting that
the War Powers Act doesn't work, introduced a measure today
overhauling the 15-year-old law.
   ``There's an old saying that if something isn't broke, don't fix
it,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services
Services Committee. ``Well, the War Powers Act is broken and it
should be fixed.''
   The Vietnam-era law, enacted over the veto of President Nixon,
restricts the power of a president to send U.S. military personnel
to situations of ``imminent hostilities.''
   The current law requires a report from the president when such
troops are dispatched. Under some circumstances, those troops must
be withdrawn after 60 days or 90 days, unless Congress specifically
votes to authorize them to remain.
   The new proposal would allow the troops to remain for an
unspecified length of time unless Congress votes to remove them.
   In addition, the proposal creates a group of 18 senior
congressional leaders who would regularly meet with the president
to discuss national security matters.
   In situations of hostilities, the group of congressional leaders
could trigger the war powers law by introducing a resolution to
either authorize the troops to remain or to order them withdrawn.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, said the regular consultations
between the congressional leaders and a president ``will forge a
stronger basis for bipartisan cooperation in national security
matters.
   ``Meaningful and consistant consultation with the Congress would
also help prevent the president from implementing a controversial
policy that Congress could not responsibly change,'' said Mitchell.
   All four presidents since the enactment of the war powers law
have contended that it is an unconstitutional restriction on their
authority.
   ``The War Powers Act, as presently constituted, is unworkable,''
said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a co-sponsor of
the proposed change.
   ``Frankly, if I were president, I would thumb my nose at this
legislation,'' said Byrd, speaking of the existing law. ``No
president can indicate to a potential enemy'' plans such as the
length of a proposed deployment of troops, he said.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, said he supports the change because the
existing law ``has never worked very well.''
   ``Every president resents a diminution of his power,'' said
Warner, explaining why the law has always been a focus of
legislative-executive fights.
   Byrd and Warner said the Reagan administration had not been
consulted in advance about the proposed change in the law.
   ``I would hope the administration won't veto this,'' said Byrd.
He said hearings will be held later by the Foreign Relations
Committee.
   Warner said, ``It will be up to the administration to look at
this and see if they can support it.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, agreed that ``the present law does not seem to be
working.''
   The latest fight over the War Powers Act involves Reagan's
Persian Gulf policy of reflagging 11 Kuwaiti-owned tankers and
protecting them with Navy warships.
   Reagan has refused to invoke the law, even though there have
been four separate clashes between the Navy and Iran. Congress has
debated trying to invoke the law, but has been unable to agree on
whether that should be done.

   A truck driver in an 18-wheel rig rammed more
than two dozen vehicles during a 40-mile freeway rampage, then told
police he only hit people who ``wouldn't get out of my way,''
authorities said.
   The rampage caused only minor injuries, authorities said.
   The driver, identified as Charley Tom Lee Jr., 25, of Haltom
City, Texas, refused police orders to stop and was taken into
custody Wednesday after his brakes locked on the Hollywood Freeway,
officials said.
   The driver was arrested for investigation of assault with a
deadly weapon _ his truck, said California Highway Patrol spokesman
Mike Maas. He was also arrested for investigation of possessing
narcotics, evading arrest, reckless driving and possessing a
concealed, loaded weapon, Maas said.
   Authorities said tests indicated he was not under the influence
of drugs or alcohol.
   Jerry Johnston, a dispatcher with Fort Worth, Texas-based Lisa
Motor Lines Inc., said Lee has worked with the firm for about two
years. The tractor-trailer rig was bound for Los Angeles with a
load of ironing boards.
   ``We are on top of the situation and have notified our insurance
people. We don't know anything more right now,'' said Wendal Short,
the company's safety director.
   As of today at least 24 accident reports had been made, although
authorities believe others may have occurred, Maas said. About a
dozen CHP officers, a police helicopter and a canine unit chased
Lee through afternoon rush-hour traffic.
   ``His method was to run up behind a car going 15 to 25 mph,
faster than the intended victim and then accelerate,'' said Sgt.
Bruce Wiedmer, who saw the driver ram five cars.
   ``Those people who would get out of my way, I wouldn't hit. But
if they wouldn't get out of my way, I would hit them,'' CHP Officer
Bruce Hanson quoted Lee as saying after he was arrested.
   No one involved in the crashes was hospitalized, said CHP
Officer Shirley Gaines. ``We had three people complain of pain,''
she said.
   ``He's been one of our very best drivers and is a very nice
person, I have no explanation for what happened,'' Johnston said.
   On the rear of the truck was a sign that read, ``How am I doing?
If you see this vehicle operated in an unsafe manner, call 1 (800)
441-3847,'' said Carlos Morales of Continental Towing in downtown
Los Angeles.
   An 800 operator said the number did not work in the Los Angeles
area.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Iranian efforts to end a
two-week battle between rival Shiite Moslem militias remained
deadlocked today as fighting raged on in south Beirut, where
foreign hostages are believed held.
   Police said one man was killed and 10 people were wounded as the
pro-Syrian Amal militia, bottled up in Shiyah, its last stronghold
in the southern slums, traded machine gun fire with the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
   Today's casualties brought the overall toll to 244 killed and
772 wounded since the fighting began May 6 in the 16-square-mile
district. The man killed was a bystander who was checking on his
damaged apartment, police said.
   A police spokesman said the fighting has ``settled into
exchanges of machine-gun fire,'' as Hezbollah, or Party of God,
tightens its grip on 90 percent of south Beirut.
   The spokesman, who by regulation cannot be identified, said most
of those wounded today were civilians hit by rooftop Hezbollah
snipers.
   Syria on Sunday massed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks and armored
vehicles on the southern, western and northern edges of south
Beirut and its officers said the army was prepared to move in to
quell the fighting.
   However, there was fear that such a move might endanger foreign
hostages believed held in the slums.
   The independent Beirut daily newspaper An-Nahar said, meanwhile,
that Iran was opposed to such a deployment and wants the Syrians to
send in only a limited ``disengagement force'' to separate the
combatants.
   An-Nahar said the Iranians also want guarantees that the Syrian
force would not seek to disarm Hezbollah.
   Iran's third demand, An-Nahar reported, is that ``the issue of
releasing the hostages be separated from the objectives of the
Syrian deployment,'' the paper added without further elaboration.
   Most of the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon are believed held by
Hezbollah-affiliated zealots based in the southern slums.
   Acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Mohammed Besharati said on
Wednesday that the hostage issue will be ``solved'' once the
fighting ends. ``The case of kidnapping (foreigners) in Lebanon is
part of the crisis which Lebanon is passing through. I believe that
if we could end the state of war currently prevailing, then
definitely the other case would be solved too,'' he said.
   In Jerusalem today, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
Vernon Walters, said he would talk with Syrian officials in
Damascus to try to help secure the release of the nine American
hostages in Lebanon.
   The nine include the longest-held foreign hostage, Terry
Anderson, Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent. He was
seized March 16, 1985.
   Walters, who leaves Friday for the Syrian capital, would not
detail his plans. He said the trip was prompted by a concern for
the safety of the hostages because of the fighting in south Beirut.
   Meanwhile, Brig. Gen, Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's military
intelligence chief in Lebanon, said Besharati's efforts to arrange
a peaceful settlement were not succeeding.
   The two met for 90 minutes on Wednesday, after which Kenann
said: ``We are giving political efforts a chance to solve the
problem and end the bleeding in south Beirut.''
   The Iranian embassy said Besharati would meet later today with
Lebanese Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini to ``pursue his
efforts.''
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, is Iran's main Arab
ally in the war with Iraq. However, it recently has been alarmed by
Iran's efforts to dispute its role in Lebanon by trying to dominate
the nation's 1.2 million Shiites through Hezbollah. Lebanon has
been embroiled in civil war since 1975.

<HEAD>Bush Edges Away From Reagan on Panama</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top 6 grafs new with Fitzwater reax to Bush comments on
administration drug policy; editing thruout, no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's spokesman said today there
is ``no conflict'' resulting from Vice President George Bush's
implied criticism of administration policy on Panama.
   ``I'm saying that he has his ideas on how he's going to want to
do things, and that's fine,'' said Marlin Fitzwater. The spokesman
spoke one day after Bush's aides suggested a break with Reagan on
the question of dismissing drug-trafficking indictments against
Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush didn't mention Noriega's name as he touted his own drug
enforcement policies on Wednesday in Los Angeles, and he
side-stepped reporters' questions on the subject. But an aide told
a reporter, ``President Bush just wouldn't make a deal with a guy
like Noriega.''
   At his daily news briefing, Fitzwater was questioned about the
White House view of Bush's apparent move to distance himself from
some of Reagan's policies.
   ``We expect the vice president to be speaking out on how he
would do things differently and what his opinions are,'' Fitzwater
said.
   ``As we go through this campaign, I would expect to see the vice
president speaking out on a number of issues in terms of what he
would do,'' he said. ``I expect a number of them will be different
than existing policies and we will not criticize them in any way.
If you want to drive a wedge between the White House and the vice
president, forget it.''
   In his speech at the Los Angeles Police Academy Wednesday, Bush
said, ``Drug dealers are domestic terrorists, killing kids and cops
and they should be treated as such. I won't bargain with terrorists
and I won't bargain with drug dealers either, whether they are on
U.S. or foreign soil.''
   Bush didn't expand on those phrases and repeatedly refused to
comment on the Noriega situation directly.
   But in background discussions, aides said that if Bush were to
become president, he wouldn't do what Reagan is doing _ offering to
drop drug indictments if Noriega will yield his power in Panama.
   The vice president has never directly criticized the
administration's dealings with the Panamanian leader.
   Bush's latest pronouncement wrapped up a weeklong Western
campaign swing that had been dogged by Reagan administration
controversies. Those problems are sticking to Bush, he conceded
Tuesday, helping drive down his ratings versus Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   The Republican standard-bearer used this trip to New Mexico,
Oregon, California and Washington to lay out some differences _ if
not dramatic ones _ with Reagan. For example, he called Monday for
action on acid rain, where the administration has for the last
seven years called only for more study.
   The Noriega situation is a particularly sticky one for Bush, for
it hurts him on an issue _ drugs _ that aides say he wants to use
against Dukakis in the fall. Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller said
the speech is the first of a series by the vice president on drugs.
   Asked why polls show Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis is
perceived as tougher on drugs, Fuller said:
   ``The voters will get a chance to decide who will be tougher on
drugs. ... You can count on the vice president spending more time
on the problem,'' Fuller added.
   In words and actions, Bush worked Wednesday to emphasize his
commitment to fight drug abuse and his different approach from
Reagan's.
   The vice president began the day with a private meeting with Los
Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and then visited a storefront,
raided by police earlier this month, where the potent cocaine
derivative crack was sold and used.
   Asked about the practical value of his visit to the onetime
crack den, Bush bristled a bit.
   ``It's not show business,'' he said. ``Anybody who has practical
experience, you learn more from them. You try to learn and
understand and then take action...It's been extraordinarily
helpful.''
   Bush praised the Reagan efforts to curb drug abuse, but said he
would do things differently. For one, he said he would make his
vice president more than just the head of a task force on drug
interdiction.
   ``If I'm elected, I will put my vice president in charge of
every aspect of federal drug policy,'' Bush announced. ``I will ask
the vice president to head a Cabinet-level council of war to pull
the effort together ... to make sure it's carried out.''
   He repeated his call for the death penalty for drug kingpins.
   ``I'll demand stronger penalities for drug offenders. Mike
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson criticize our anti-drug effort _ I
readily concede there's room for improvement _ but I want them to
join me on these tougher penalities. This isn't Democrat or
Republican,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Panel Would Require Better Information on Home Equity Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee voted unanimously
today to require banks and credit unions to provide more timely and
complete information on home equity loans, or second mortgages.
   Under the bill, passed by voice vote, lenders would have to
disclose prior to making a loan the annual interest percentage
rate, any fees associated with the loan, a series of warnings about
the risks involved and a description of repayment options.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the committee's
consumer affairs subcommittee, said, ``This legislation will
provide consumers with important information regarding home equity
lines of credit.
   ``It will enable those consumers to understand fully the
conditions of this new form of consumer borrowing,'' said Annunzio.
``It will make clear to them that they risk the loss of their home
in the event of default.''
   The American Bankers Association, in a statement handed out in
the committee room after the bill was approved, said: ``In recent
months we have worked with legislators to ensure that the bill
preserves the product by providing for creditors' remedies in
deteriorating loan situations.
   ``However, the disclosure and advertising provisions are
impractical. They will result in an unnecessary overload of
information for consumers, and they will severely limit the
creditors' ability to design informative advertisements,'' the ABA
said.
   The biggest difference in the measure approved today and the one
which came out of the Annunzio subcommittee in February was a
provision barring lenders from unilaterally changing terms of the
loans, except in some instances.
   ``Traditionally, in open-end accounts, a lender has reserved the
right to change the terms of the loan,'' said Rep. David E. Price,
D-N.C., chief sponsor. ``However, this provision causes special
problems in the home equity area. The high initial fees, the fact
that the home is at risk, and the large lines of credit involved,
make this unilateral right to change the terms of the loan
undesirable in the home equity area.''
   A home equity loan disclosure bill has passed the Senate as part
of a bigger bank restructuring bill now being considered by the
House Banking Committee. A committee staffer said proponents wanted
a separate bill to pass the House and be sent to the Senate in case
the bank restructuring measure is not approved.

<HEAD>Environmental Group Will Help Soviets Save Energy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. environmental organization said today
it had agreed to help the Soviet Academy of Sciences investigate
and demonstrate energy conservation in homes and commercial
buildings as a method of slowing the ``greenhouse'' warming of the
earth.
   The agreement between the academy and the Natural Resources
Defense Council also calls for research help in minimizing the use
in appliances of the chlorofluorocarbon refrigeration fluids, which
as gases help destroy the earth's protective ozone layer.
   Those gases contribute to the expected warming of the earth, but
the major source of that warming will be carbon dioxide formed by
the combustion of fossil fuels.
   The United States and the Soviet Union together probably account
for almost half the world's emissions of carbon dioxide, the
council said.
   Among other things, the agreement calls for construction of a
building technology demonstration center in the Soviet Union,
visits to U.S. sources of information, demonstration of
retrofitting energy-saving devices such as insulating windows to
residential buildings in the Soviet Union and drafting model
building codes.
   The agreement was signed in Moscow last Friday by the council's
executive director, John Adams, and academy official Yevgheniy
Velikov.
   The Soviet Union is believed to be one of the world's most
energy-inefficient economies because most energy use is not
regulated through a market.
   ``Many families still use open windows to regulate the
temperature in their centrally heated apartments, even in the dead
of the Soviet winter,'' the Worldwatch Institute said in its 1988
``State of the World'' volume.
   While U.S. energy efficiency improved 23 percent from 1973 to
1985 and Japanese efficiency improved 31 percent, Soviet efficiency
did not improve at all, Worldwatch said.
   The institute, a Washington environmental policy research and
advocacy organization, has estimated that the Soviet economy uses
about 45 megajoules (12.5 kilowatt hours or almost 43,000 BTUs) per
dollar of gross national product, 60 percent more than the U.S.
economy in 1985 and more than three times the comparable figure for
West Germany.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, founded in 1972, is a
private group based in Washington and New York that does research
and advocacy on behalf of environmental causes. It is perhaps best
known for its frequently successful litigation against government
agencies. One survey two years ago by the magazine ``Environmental
Forum'' concluded that it was the most effective of all the
environmental groups that lobby Congress.
   It has engaged in joint research with Soviet scientists on
questions of verification of arms control agreements.

   The White House said today that the
drug-smuggling indictments against Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio
Noriega were not brought to President Reagan for advance approval
but that it views the charges as ``a correct course.''
   Even so, the administration is ignoring Senate appeals and
appears intent on offering to drop the indictments in return for
Noriega's resignation as defense chief.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the National
Security Council staff, Justice Department officials and State
Department officials monitored the process as the indictment
against Noriega was being considered earlier this year.
   ``It wasn't brought to the president for decision,'' Fitzwater
said. ``There was no questioning of it by the administration. We
still think it's a correct course.''
   Fitzwater said, ``It doesn't do any good to go back and start
second-guessing it now. We're standing by it, we're on a course and
that's it.''
   Asked to reconcile his assertion that the administration was
sticking by its course with the reported offer to drop the charges,
Fitzwater said, ``Indictments are very important to putting the
pressure on him, (it's) all part of the process.''
   The State Department's No. 3 official, Michael Armacost, said
Wednesday that the objective is to find a way to remove Noriega
from politics and withdrawing the indictments ``may represent one
means'' of accomplishing that goal.
   Armacost said that approach ``may be a worthwhile way of
proceeding'' because Noriega would be beyond the reach of U.S.
prosecutors so long as he remains in Panama. He noted that the U.S.
extradition treaty with Panama does not provide for the extradition
of Panamanian nationals.
   On Tuesday, the Senate voted 86-10 to approve a non-binding
resolution expressing opposition to dropping the indictments.
   Armacost made his remarks during a trans-Atlantic interview with
foreign reporters sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency. His
statement broke what had been a prolonged news blackout by State
Department officials on the nature of the discussions with Noriega.
   The first indications that dropping the indictments was being
discussed with Noriega came last week from Justice Department
officials speaking privately.
   White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. said Wednesday he
is ``reasonably hopeful'' that the United States will succeed in
removing Noriega from power.
   ``The negotiations are under way,'' Baker said. ``Our policy is
that Noriega must go, and indeed that remains our commitment.''
   Referring to the Senate vote, Baker said he understands the
frustration of his former colleagues.
   ``The fact remains that the administration has a firm, fixed
policy that Noriega must go and we are working very hard to see
that that happens,'' Baker said. ``We're working very hard to see
that that happens. I am reasonably hopeful that we'll get that
result, but we don't have it yet.''
   Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Times reported today that
administration officials are now trying to depict the initial
Justice Department decision to seek Noriega's indictment as poorly
thought out. The newspaper, which did not identify the
administration sources, reported that they also said the Justice
Department did not submit the decision to Reagan or Baker for their
approval.
   However, the Justice Department did consult with officials of
the State and Defense departments, and with the White House
National Security Council staff before the indictments were
returned, one official told the Times.
   White House spokeswoman Leslye Arsht said Wednesday night she
had no comment on the report.
   President Reagan, asked Wednesday whether a deal with Noriega
had been completed, said ``I don't know.''
   Asked whether the two sides were close to an agreement, Reagan
gave the same response.
   The negotiations with Noriega are being carried out by Michael
G. Kozak, a State Department official who has spent much of this
month in Panama.
   The plan reportedly calls for Noriega to step down as commander
of the Panamanian defense forces in August and to leave Panama for
at least one year.

<TEXT>
   Wall Street's underlying dread of another stock
crash has been aggravated by two significant events, an upward
spike in interest rates and the first notable selling by big
institutional investors in several weeks.
   Unresponsive to good news and obsessed with the bad, the stock
market took another sharp spill Wednesday, depressing the Dow Jones
industrial average to its lowest point in more than three months.
Broader market indexes also fell sharply.
   Prices weakened further this morning. The Dow average was down
24.86 points to 1,926.23 by 11 a.m. EDT on Wall Street, and losing
stocks outnumbered gainers by nearly 5-to-1 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The declines themselves were not particularly new or alarming,
because prices have been bouncing up and down for a while in a
post-crash market dominated largely by brokers buying and selling
to each other.
   What concerned investment professionals this time was an influx
of sell orders from large institutional investors such as pension
funds and mutual funds, the flesh and bones of the stockholding
public. The selling suggested that these crucial investors are
growing exasperated.
   ``Today's the first day I've seen some real institutional
liquidations,'' William King, head trader at Nikko Securities Co.
International in New York, said as the selling intensified late
Wednesday. ``You're getting some acknowledgement from institutional
investors that there's a problem.''
   Institutional selling partly was responsible for inflating the
volume on the New York Stock Exchange, where 209.42 million shares
were traded. It was the first time the volume exceeded 200 million
shares in more than a month.
   To the technical strategists who attempt to plot the stock
market's course based on mathematical formulas and past behavior,
the price drop signaled some serious concern as well.
   The Dow industrials fell 35.32 points to 1,951.09 on Wednesday,
the lowest since Feb. 9, when it closed at 1,914.46. At one point,
the average fell through 1,950, which strategists have called an
important ``support level.''
   In addition, a drop in the Dow transportation average, which
often precedes declines in the industrial average, suggested prices
would keep falling.
   More disturbing to some strategists was the lack of support
levels on their technical charts, based on the market's movements
since it plunged 508 points on Black Monday, Oct. 19, to 1,738.74.
Between that level and the Dow average's position now, there have
been only two stable points, 1,930 and 1,860.
   Stock strategists who look at economics to predict the market's
behavior said rising concern about inflation and interest rates was
a key reason for Wednesday's big selloff.
   They were particularly alarmed by the bond market, where prices
tumbled and yields on the 30-year Treasury bond flirted with 9.3
percent, the highest point since the crash. This has made bonds
increasingly attractive as an alternative investment to stocks.
   ``When the bond market started falling apart, we saw quite
substantial blocks of institutional selling in the stock market,''
said Jack Barbanel, a trading strategist at the New York investment
firm Gruntal & Co.
   ``It's certainly bearish for the stock market, because
institutions get out of the stock market when they can get
risk-control yields elsewhere _ the bond market,'' he said.
   ``Why take risks in a stock market that in the past three or
four months has been volatile, with not much volume to support it?
The flight to quality bonds and risk-controlled investments is
going to be the thing to do.''

   Federal judge Alcee L. Hastings gave false
trial testimony about draft letters and telephone calls in an
attempt to hide his involvement in a bribery scheme, a House
impeachment panel was told today.
   New York lawyer John Doar summarized the evidence used by a
special judicial panel in concluding that Hastings, who was
acquitted of bribery conspiracy charges in 1983, had actually
committed the crime and tried to conceal his part in the scheme.
   Hastings sat silently with his lawyers in the hearing room as
the House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice heard Doar
outline the judicial panel's case for impeaching the Miami judge.
   Doar said Hastings gave ``knowingly false'' trial testimony
about phone calls and draft letters purportedly made in behalf of
an old friend, Hemphill Pride, who was seeking reinstatement as a
lawyer after serving a prison sentence in connection with
misappropriation of housing funds.
   But Doar said the judicial panel's investigation concluded that
the letters cited by Hastings were intended ``to conceal his
participation in the bribery scheme through false evidence.'' He
said Hastings' testimony about the phone calls also was ``knowingly
false'' and intended to mislead the jury.
   It was the second day of testimony by Doar, a former assistant
U.S. attorney general for civil rights in the mid-1960s and special
counsel to the House Judiciary Committee in its move to impeach
President Nixon in the Watergate scandal a decade later.
   The deliberate, soft-spoken Doar was selected by a special,
five-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta to lead its exhaustive, 3{-year investigation of Hastings'
judicial conduct.
   Hastings was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring to solicit a
$150,000 bribe from two convicted racketeers.
   But the judicial panel said it had found ``clear and convincing
evidence'' that Hastings conspired with Washington lawyer William
A. Borders to solicit the bribe in exchange for a promise of
lenient sentences.
   The panel also accused Hastings of trying to conceal the ``sale
of justice'' by lying under oath and fabricating evidence at his
highly publicized trial in Miami five years ago.
   Hastings, who was nominated to life tenure on the federal bench
by President Carter in 1979, has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
   ``They found me not guilty of crimes I never committed,'' he
said Wednesday at the start of impeachment hearings by the House
Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice.
   ``I am not guilty, but I am not free,'' said Hastings, the first
black federal judge in Florida. His voice rising, he declared:
   ``I ask you in the name of decency, in the name of justice, in
the name of the American jury system ... I ask you in the name of
the American way of life, I beg you, I beseech you, I implore you _
hell no, I tell you and I demand of you that you set me free!''
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the subcommittee chairman,
expressed concern that the case against Hastings might be racially
and politically motivated _ as Hastings has charged in the past.
But Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on
the panel, said Hastings' race played no part whatsoever in the
impeachment inquiry.
   Following Hastings to the witness table, Doar reviewed the
massive evidence used by the appeals court judges in their 381-page
report charging Hastings with impeachable misconduct.
   The report was endorsed unanimously by the Judicial Conference
of the United States, the chief policymaking body of the federal
judiciary, which told House leaders that ``consideration of
impeachment may be warranted.''
   Doar and subcommittee members listened to a series of secretly
taped conversations and telephone calls in late 1981 between Boders
and an FBI undercover agent posing as racketeer Frank Romano.
   Borders was convicted at a separate trial in 1982 on charges of
arranging the alleged bribe payment to Hastings from Romano and his
brother, Thomas.
   If the subcommittee recommends impeachment and the full
Judiciary Committee concurs, the House must vote whether to impeach
Hastings. If impeached, he would face a Senate trial on the
charges. A two-thirds Senate majority would be required to convict
Hastings and remove him from office.
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., whose district includes Miami,
entered the hearing room late Wednesday, shook hands with Hastings
and took a front-row seat to listen to Doar's testimony for about a
half-hour.

   After holding up a place where they
peddle petals, an armed robber put the pedal to the metal in his
getaway vehicle: a 65-passenger school bus.
   An hour after Wednesday's caper, a 32-year-old bus driver was
arrested as he waited to pick up kindergartners at a Minneapolis
school about 11:30 a.m.
   Police said the man robbed a St. Paul flower shop at knifepoint
on his break between school routes and escaped in the bus belonging
to Ryder Student Transportation Services.
   Witnesses outside the flower shop saw a man leave, according to
police.
   An alert Ryder dispatcher identified the suspect from the
descriptions of the man and told officials to hold the children in
school until an arrest was made, said Gary Rogers, transportation
director for the Minneapolis schools.
   The driver was being held in the Ramsey County jail on suspicion
of armed robbery, police said. He will be suspended from his job,
said Bruce Dischinger, Ryder operations manager.

pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao newspaper, died Wednesday of a heart
ailment. He was 80.
   Among the posts he held in the Chinese government was
vice-director of the Basic Law Drafting Committee that is writing a
constitution for Hong Kong that will be used after the colony
reverts to China in 1997. He also was vice-director of the Law
Committee of the National Peoples' Congress, China's parliament.
   Since Fei was hospitalized last year, many Chinese leaders,
including President Yang Shangkun and former National Peoples'
Congress leader Peng Zhen, sent envoys to visit him.
   Fei was born in the Chinese city of Suzhou, Zhejiang province,
and was educated in Beijing. He joined the newspaper in Tianjin
when he was 22 and helped it get started in Hong Kong eight years
later.

<HEAD>Official Sees Indications Sovieties Will Turn Over Equipment to
Afghans</HEAD>

   A State Department official said today there
are indications the Soviets will turn over facilities and equipment
worth up to $1 billion to the Afghan government after Red Army
troops depart Afghanistan.
   Michael Armacost, undersecretary of state for political affairs,
told reporters ``there have been indications that we have picked
up'' that the Soviets intend to leave behind equipment and
installations, ``perhaps a half billion or billion dollars worth.''
   ``That doesn't strike me as a demonstration of tremendous
restraint,'' Armacost said, reiterating a U.S. policy that calls
for continued supply of American aid to the Afghan resistance
forces as long as the Soviets continue giving aid to the Afghan
government.
   ``We will have practical ways of accomplishing that purpose,''
Armacost said of U.S. deliveries.
   When the United States and the Soviet Union signed an agreement
setting the stage for the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000
Soviet troops, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
rejected a U.S. proposal that both superpowers stop aiding their
clients in Afghanistan.
   U.S. officials said, however, they still hoped the Soviets would
change their minds as the withdrawal proceeded. It began several
days ago and the first brigade of forces reached Soviet territory
on Wednesday.
   Armacost's comments indicated those hopes may have been dashed,
at least according to the current indications.
   He noted that there have been reports of fighting between Soviet
forces and the U.S.-backed mujahadeen.
   Asked if the United States expected the Soviets to ask U.S.
officials to urge restraint on the part of the resistance, to
facilitate the withdrawal, Armacost said, ``the position we've
taken on that has been generally, a prompt timetable is one that is
more likely to elicit cooperation from the mujahadeen.
   He advised the Soviets to make ``some kind of local
arrangements'' with resistance leaders, through direct talks, to
secure protection for the withdrawing Soviet troops.
   He said he had heard rumors of such arrangements in some areas.

<HEAD>Computer Aids Handicapped Singer-Musician Teddy Pendergrass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer-musician Teddy Pendergrass, paralyzed
in an auto crash six years ago, said Thursday he is competitive at
the top level of the music industry thanks to a versatile computer.
   ``I have come to realize that music and technology suddenly got
married,'' Pendergrass told the Senate subcommittee on the
handicapped.
   Pendergrass said his MIDI _ musical instrument digital interface
_ permits him to compose, arrange, create sounds and ``play
literally every instrument that would be included in a 100-piece
orchestra.''
   ``That allows me to compete at the highest level. It erases the
handicap,'' he said.
   The Philadelphia singer-composer, who uses an automatic
wheelchair and has limited use of his hands, was among the
witnesses at a hearing on assistive technology for the disabled.
The panel was urged to make such technology more accessible to
those who need it.
   By bringing his computer software to the studio, Pendergrass
said, he can complete a record in one-third of the studio time it
once took.
   He called the cost of the computer equipment ``fairly
reasonable. We're not re-creating the wheel. The technology was
already on the shelf. All we did was adapt it for my needs.
   ``The technology exists at every level for everything,''
Pendergrass added. ``All we need to do is adapt it ... and
(handicapped) people could continue in any industry at all levels.''

<HEAD>Job Outlook Bright for Most Graduates with Agricultural Degrees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of new college graduates with
agricultural degrees is down again this year, but Agriculture
Department officials say their job outlook is the brightest in a
decade.
   One official warned Wednesday that the graduates are declining
in number and that this could spell problems in critical food and
agricultural specialities in the future.
   ``The demand comes in part from recent advances in agricultural
science and technology, and from the need of U.S. agribusiness to
improve its position in international marketing,'' said J. Patrick
Jordan, administrator of the department's Cooperative State
Research Service.
   Despite the good news of greater job demand and record-high
starting salaries, Jordan and college officials said the nation's
supply of graduates in agriculture majors continues to decline.
   This year, for example, Iowa State University graduated about
500 agriculture majors, down 35 to 40 from 1987, and Purdue
University graduated 225, down from 301 a year ago.
   But salaries are looking up. At Iowa State, starting salaries of
graduates with bachelor's degrees in agriculture are averaging just
over $20,000 a year. The University of Georgia estimates starting
salaries near $19,000 for those with bachelor's degrees, $24,000
for those with master's, and $34,000 to start for holders of
doctoral degrees.
   The University of California, Davis, reported situation is
bright for all food science graduates, who will attract starting
offers averaging $22,000 to $36,000.
   At Texas A&M, agriculture graduates will average $17,000 to
$26,000 to start. Cornell University says its graduates with
bachelor of science degrees will see salary offers running 4
percent to 6 percent above last year's average of $20,406.
   Campus recruitment also has perked up, with many businesses
finding a shortage of new graduates to fill current openings.
   The hottest spots in the job picture, according to college
officials, include food science, poultry production, agricultural
education, agricultural chemistry and engineering, dairy science,
agricultural journalism, entomology, landscape architecture and
ornamental horticulture.
   Jordan said a USDA panel forecasts a ``continuing national
shortage'' of 4,000 agriculture and life sciences graduates
annually through 1990. Some experts predict the shortage will
continue beyond that date and that it will become more significant
as good starting salaries and career opportunities draw off
bachelor of science graduates who otherwise might obtain master's
or doctoral degrees.
   ``To a degree, the laws of supply and demand will no doubt enter
into play here, so that more college students, seeing that the
agricultural professions offer good career opportunities, will
choose an agricultural major,'' Jordan said.
   But he added that if college-bound young people fail to see the
opportunities in agriculture, then ``the nation may soon face a
critical shortage of expertise in the food and agricultural
sciences and professions.''

   Farmers will get a smaller share of what
consumers spend on food this year, according to a new Agriculture
Department report.
   The food marketing bill, or the difference between consumer
expenditures and the farm value of domestically produced food, is
expected to increase 6.6 percent in 1988, compared with a 4.7
percent gain last year.
   Food marketing includes the costs of transporting, processing,
packaging and merchandising food after it leaves the farm.
   ``While food expenditures will rise 4.8 percent _ about the same
as the pace last year _ the farm value of food is expected to
decline 1 percent, because of bigger supplies and lower prices for
livestock and poultry products,'' the department's Economic
Research Service said Wednesday.
   During the first quarter, consumer food costs rose 3.1 percent
above a year earlier, with much of the increase due to higher
prices for fruit, vegetables and fish.
   Prices for food served in restaurants and fast-food outlets
``rose a little faster than prices for food at home,'' the report
said. For all of 1988, food prices are forecast to rise 2 percent
to 4 percent from 1987 when they increased 4.1 percent.
   The report continued to forecast 1988 net cash income of farmers
at $50 billion to $55 billion, down from last year's record of $57
billion. Rising production costs and lower federal payments to
farmers are factors in this year's decline.

   World sugar production in 1988-89 is expected
to be a record of about 103.9 million metric tons, slightly more
than the 103.8 million tons produced in 1987-88, says the
Agriculture Department.
   The latest figures announced Wednesday included revisions from
the department's first forecast issued on May 4, which indicated
production at 104.1 million metric tons in 1988-89 and last year's
output at 103.6 million tons.
   Production in Brazil _ the largest producer _ was reduced to a
1988-89 forecast of 8.1 million tons from 8.4 million tons
indicated earlier this month, the report said. Revisions also were
reported for several other countries.

<TEXT>
   The state observed an official day of
mourning today as grief-stricken friends and families gathered to
bid farewell to six victims of one of the nation's worst bus
crashes.
   The Rev. Leo Craycroft told mourners at St. Christopher Church
that there were ``no real satisfying answers'' for the deaths of
his three teen-age parishioners and other victims of Saturday
night's accident, which claimed 27 lives.
   ``The saying is trite but painfully true: They had their whole
lives before them,'' the priest said at the funeral Mass for Mary
Cathryn Daniels, 14; Denise Ellen Voglund, 13; and Amy Christine
Wheelock, 14.
   They were to be buried at the same Radcliff cemetery where
12-year-old Julie Ann Earnest was laid to rest today in a brief
graveside ceremony.
   All four girls were students at Radcliff Middle School. A fifth
middle school pupil, 14-year-old Tina Michelle Mustain, was to be
buried later today in Tyler, Texas.
   Joshua Conyers, 14, of nearby Vine Grove, a ninth-grader at
North Hardin High School, was to be buried today at the same
Radcliff cemetery as the others, which abuts his high school.
   Flags across Kentucky flew at half-staff to honor the memory of
the 24 children and three adults killed when their bus was struck
head-on by a pickup truck heading in the wrong direction on
Interstate 71.
   ``If it were possible to turn back the clock, we would,'' Gov.
Wallace Wilkinson said Wednesday in declaring today's official day
of mourning. ``Whatever consolation we can give will never make up
for the loss of friends and loved ones.''
   A memorial service for all 27 victims was planned for tonight at
North Hardin High School in Radcliff. Most of the other funerals
were scheduled for Friday.
   Although fatal bus crashes also occurred this week in Cleveland
and New York state, a deputy administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said today that school buses are
remarkably safe.
   Jeff Miller, on CBS' ``This Morning,'' said that the Saturday
crash ``was no accident. This was a crash and this was caused by a
drunk driver.''
   ``Out of 46,000 fatalities on our highways every year, less than
100 even involve school buses,'' Miller said. ``It's the safest
form of transportation. We've got 350,000 school buses on our
highways, they transport 21 million kids to school every day and
they've done an extraordinarly good job.''
   The Kentucky crash involved a converted school bus carrying
members of a church group from an amusement park near Cincinnati.
Most of the victims were military dependents or had ties to nearby
Fort Knox. The service at the high school's 2,400-seat football
stadium will include hymns and a performance by the post military
band, said Lelia S. Haddle, secretary to Mayor Joseph Hutcherson.
   ``Right now, Fort Knox is kind of our mainstay,'' she said.
``They are being very involved because there are a lot of military
families in this.''
   The fort has also sent chaplains and counselors to help families.
   On Wednesday, grief counselors from the National Organization
for Victim Assistance conducted a seminar in Radcliff for school
counselors, military personnel and others dealing with victims'
families.
   Also, the National Transportation Safety Board said it located a
witness to the crash, and someone who saw what is believed to be
the pickup truck cross the grassy median and head north in the
southbound lanes.
   The truck driver, Larry Mahoney, still hospitalized in
Louisville about 35 miles southwest of Radcliff, was charged with
27 counts of murder, one for each of those who died in the
accident. Authorities said he was intoxicated at the time of the
crash. Thirteen other people remained hospitalized Wednesday.
   In Cleveland, four people remained hospitalized Wednesday from a
public transit bus accident that killed a teen-age passenger.
Police were checking reports that the bus accelerated after
striking a car.
   Tuesday's accident started when a motorist tried to make a left
turn in front of the bus. The bus struck the car and then lurched
out of control, striking a tree, a pole and a fence before grazing
a building and another pole, said Patrolman Emil Cielec.
   In Clinton Corners, N.Y., an NTSB inspection found no structural
or mechanical problems with a bus that overturned Monday, killing
three people and injuring 20 others, authorities said Wednesday.
   However, mechanical failure has not been ruled out as the cause
of the accident, said state police Sgt. Dennis Cody. The driver of
the bus remained hospitalized and was unable to talk to
investigators Wednesday, Cody said.

   At least 15 children became sick with an
intestinal bacteria, and health officials suspect tainted snow
cones.
   The children, ages 15 months to 12 years, were infected with the
bacteria shigella and have symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal cramps and fever, said Dr. Mary Duffy, Knox County health
director.
   The illnesses began May 9, she said.
   After talking with the children, health officials figured the
culprit could be snow cones from delivery trucks that circle
Knoxville neighborhoods.
   But Health Department personnel have been unable to find the
trucks. Duffy said no snow cone vendors have obtained the necessary
permit to sell the cones.
   ``These are usually kitchen operations, and they sell the ice
and sell the syrup to other people who in turn peddle it around,''
she said.

<DATELINE>MARION, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 6-year-old schoolyard preacher and his
sister were suspended for a fourth time today for violating school
rules.
   ``Now is the day of Salvation,'' 6-year-old Matthew Strode
shouted at a crowd of reporters, schoolchildren and TV cameras as
5-year-old Pepper stood beside him holding a Bible. ``Hell has
enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure.''
   The two children, returning today from their third suspension,
arrived at Eastfield Elementary School in a car driven by their
mother, Robin.
   They stood at a teachers' entrance and waited for a cue from
their 10-year-old brother, Duffey, who was outside the school gate.
Duffey was suspended for 10 days last Friday for refusing to stop
proselytizing and go to class.
   ``For God so loved the world...,'' Duffy called from the gate,
setting off a stream of preaching from his younger brother.
   ``Fools make a mock at sin,'' Matthew shouted at Principal Jim
Gorst, who asked him to come inside the school. The boy stood his
ground as Gorst repeated his request several times.
   The children are not being suspended for their preaching, Gorst
said, but rather for remaining outside the school building when
school rules require them to be inside.
   He said if the children would agree to come to school Friday and
discontinue preaching, the suspension would be dropped.
   Gorst complained that the children were being encouraged by
publicity.
   ``If the news media was not here and if the offers for talk
shows were not present, I believe in my mind they'd be back in
school,'' he said.
   Pepper does not preach because she doesn't want to, the
children's father, David, has said.
   School officials call the preaching a disruption, while parents
have complained that the fire-and-brimstone tone of the sermons is
frightening other children.
   But the children's parents, who moved to Marion 17 months ago
from Pennsylvania, call the suspensions an attack on their
constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of
religion.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis today criticized the Reagan
administration for proposing another in-depth look at the nation's
drug problem, saying ``We don't need another study.'' George Bush's
statement that he wouldn't bargain with drug dealers prompted a
White House spokesman to say ``he has his ideas on how he's going
... to do things and that's fine.''
   Dukakis made a final appearance in New Jersey before heading off
to California, both states part of the June 7 primary season
finale. California's will be the biggest primary of the season,
offering 314 Democratic delegates, with 109 at stake in New Jersey.
   In Camden, N.J., Dukakis spoke with community leaders in a
neighborhood marred by drug use and violence. Asked about President
Reagan's announcement Wednesday of a new bipartisan study on drugs,
he said, ``I don't think we need another study.''
   ``There is no Democratic or Republican or independent way to
fight this,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   Bush wrapped up a seven-day West Coast campaign swing on
Wednesday and made an anti-drug message his central theme.
   Campaigning in Los Angeles, he said that as president, he
wouldn't ``bargain with drug dealers ... whether they are on U.S.
or foreign soil.''
   Although he repeatedly refused to state his views directly on
the administration's attempts to cut a deal with Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega, who is under indictment on drug charges, his aides
said on background that the message was, ``President Bush just
wouldn't make a deal with a guy like Noriega.''
   At the White House today, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was drawn
into a debate with reporters over Bush's edging away from Reagan
administration policy.
   ``I'm saying that he has his ideas on how he's going to want to
do things, and that's fine,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``If you want to drive a wedge between the White House and the
vice president, forget it.''
   Dukakis' only remaining rival, Jesse Jackson, suggested that
racist comments by ``irresponsible public leaders'' helped create
the climate for an alleged assassination plot against him.
   Jackson, campaigning in Fresno, Calif., was asked about this
week's arrest of a St. Louis couple accused of plotting to kill
him. Londell Williams and his wife, Tammy, were also charged with
threatening an informant and possessing an automatic rifle.
   Papers filed in federal court indicated Londell Williams told an
informer he was a member of The Order and other white supremacist
groups, and that Jackson should be killed.
   But lawyers for the couple said each denied belonging to a white
supremacist group, and the FBI said no evidence had been found that
the pair belonged to The Order.
   Jackson initially downplayed word of the arrests, saying, ``I
cannot just focus on the two people arrested in St. Louis.''
   But later he told reporters: ``The climate for this kind of
antagonism and violence, of course, has been set by many
irresponsible public leaders (whose) attacks based on race have set
a divisive and dangerous climate, such as the one ... in New York
in April, for example.''
   Jackson was apparently referring to comments by New York City
Mayor Ed Koch during the New York primary campaign last month. Koch
said, among other things, that Jews would be ``crazy'' to vote for
Jackson.
   Jackson met privately Wednesday with nearly three dozen rabbis
and Jewish leaders in Los Angeles, in what he described as a ``step
toward healing the wounds.'' Many Jews were offended by Jackson's
1984 reference to New York as ``Hymietown'' and his association
with Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan.
   A dozen demonstrators outside the Hollywood hotel where the
session was being held chanted ``Lose, Jesse, lose'' and ``Jew
hater.''
   Jackson was campaigning in California again today.
   In Los Angeles, the vice president stopped in at a storefront,
raided by police earlier this month, where the potent cocaine
derivative crack had been sold and used. Later, he visited the Los
Angeles Police Academy and said he would convene a Cabinet-level
``council of war'' against illegal drugs.
   ``Together we can coordinate an attack on the drug trade that
will be nothing less than a modern D-day,'' said Bush.
   The delegate race is over on the Republican side _ Bush
mathematically clinched the nomination last month in the
Pennsylvania primary.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis has dramatically widened his
delegate lead in recent weeks. By the latest AP count, he has 1,643
to Jackson's 974.
   Jackson's campaign has written to Democratic Party chairman Paul
Kirk, complaining that under the delegate-selection process ``the
vote of the people is distorted.''
   Jackson has long maintained that the support of so-called
``super delegates'' _ party and elective officials who have a vote
at the convention _ should be roughly in line with the popular
vote. But under party rules, the super delegates are not bound to
follow primary results in their states.
   The letter to Kirk, signed by Jackson's campaign chief Willie
Brown and Jackson adviser Walter Fauntroy, the District of
Columbia's delegate to Congress, urged the party chairman to
consider the ``moral and political questions'' raised by the rules.
   A copy of the letter, dated Tuesday, was sent to the Dukakis
camp.
   Dukakis, however, said he did not believe Jackson would mount a
challenge to delegates at the Democratic convention.
   ``I don't think we are going to have a fight with Mr. Jackson,''
he said.
   The Massachusetts governor, who added a primary win in Oregon to
his column this week, was in New Jersey on Wednesday, where he met
with local Democratic leaders, then mingled with patrons and served
up beers at a restaurant in the waterfront city of Hoboken.

<HEAD>Senate Proposal Would Modify Vietnam-Era Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The War Powers Act, a Vietnam-era law that has
been the focus of a long-running fight between the White House and
Congress, would be overhauled by a proposal introduced Thursday in
the Senate.
   ``Our goal is to make the statute more workable,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a sponsor of the reform
measure.
   Commenting about the existing act, Byrd said, ``Frankly, if I
were president, I would thumb my nose at this legislation. The War
Powers Act has never really worked.''
   The law was enacted in 1973, over the veto of President Nixon,
who argued that it was an unconstitutional restriction on his
authority. That is the same position taken by all three subsequent
presidents.
   The law requires a report from the president when U.S. military
personnel are sent to situations of ``imminent hostilities.'' Under
some circumstances, those troops must be withdrawn after 60 days or
90 days, unless Congress specifically votes to authorize them to
remain.
   The new proposal would let the troops remain for an unspecified
length of time unless Congress votes to remove them. It also
creates a group of 18 senior congressional leaders who would
regularly meet with the president to discuss national security
matters.
   ``Presidents have not consulted adequately with Congress prior
to making decisions to involve the nation in a situation where
hostilities are certain, imminent or probable,'' said Byrd, arguing
that the new 18-member group would change that.
   The congressional leadership group could trigger the war powers
law by introducing a resolution to either authorize the troops to
remain or to order them withdrawn.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, said he believes the change is a good idea
because the current law ``has never worked very well.''
   Warner said he doesn't know whether President Reagan will back
the change.
   ``It will be up to the administration to look at this and see if
they can support it,'' said Warner, explaining that administration
approval was not sought by the group of legislators who drafted the
plan.
   Byrd said, ``I would hope the administration won't veto this.''
He said action is likely later this year by Congress.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, said that ``the War Powers Act is
a good example of the limited ability of human beings to predict
future events.''
   ``It was written for the Vietnam war,'' said Mitchell, and has
been difficult to apply to current situation of small, brief
military clashes or terrorist situations.
   The most recent dispute over the War Powers Act involves
Reagan's Persian Gulf policy of reflagging 11 Kuwaiti-owned tankers
and protecting them with Navy warships. Navy vessels have also been
authorized to aid neutral merchant vesels which seek help.
   Reagan has refused to invoke the law, even though there have
been four separate clashes between the Navy and Iran. Congress has
debated trying to invoke the law, but has been unable to agree on
whether that should be done.
   Last year, 115 legislators went to federal court and filed suit,
seeking an order directing Reagan to invoke the law. But the suit
was thrown out of court and the legislators are now appealing that
ruling.
   Mitchell said the law was ``well intentioned, but it has not
worked. We have spent countless hours proposing, filibustering, and
debating measures to invoke a law _ rather than assessing the
wisdom of the policy that prompted the deployment of forces.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said, ``there's an old saying that if something isn't broke, don't
fix it. Well, the War Powers Act is broken and it should be fixed.''
   Nunn said the law ``encourages confrontation rather than
consultation between the presidents and Congress. When forces are
introduced, the debate in the Congress is frequently on procedure
rather than policy.''
   Warner said many of the problems in the current law arise
because ``every president resents a diminuation in his power.''
   The law was approved in November 1973 despite the veto by Nixon.
The House voted 284-135 to override Nixon's veto while the Senate
vote was 75-18.
   Backers of the law argued that it was needed because Nixon's
Vietnam policies were usurping the congressional right to declare
war.
   Since the law was enacted, presidents have formally submitted
reports on a dozen occasions, although they have rarely cited the
section of the law which triggers the 60-day time period for a
congressional vote.

   Jose Cura was, by many accounts, a
gentle dentist.
   But he gave up his license three weeks ago, when officials
learned he never went to dental school.
   Cura, 46, was trained in the Army as a dental technician and
easily passed Florida's dental exam seven years ago, his lawyer,
Harold M. Braxton, said.
   He treated more than 3,500 patients.
   ``He learned a lot of techniques in the Army,'' Braxton said.
``He just watched, observed and started reading a lot of books.''
   Doctors praised him as highly competent, and patients said he
was generous and had a knack for putting them at ease and getting
rid of pain.
   State licensing officials alleged that Cura forged transcripts
indicating he had attended the University of Havana 1958-63 and had
received a doctor's degree in dental surgery. They said Cura
actually was a high school student in New Jersey from 1958-60.
   ``We were absolutely thunderstruck and flabbergasted,'' said
Robert T. Ferris, an Altamonte Springs dentist who chairs the state
Board of Dentistry.
   Cura told state officials he plans to go dental school, but the
board last month rejected his request for a license suspension
until he graduated. State officials said Wednesday no decision has
been made on criminal charges.
   Bill O'Neil, general counsel for the Department of Professional
Reguation, said he wished Cura would go to dental school because he
did a good job.
   Cura's undoing was person who wrote anonymously to the
department, saying that on a visit to Cura's office, he noticed no
degrees on the walls and began to investigate.
   ``I am asking you for all the innocent people that put their
lives in his hands on a daily basis and trust him wth surgery
without even imagining that he has never had university studies and
does not know what he is doing,'' the letter said.
   Cura couldn't be reached, but Braxton said he was contrite.
   ``I'd say remorseful is a very good word,'' the lawyer said.
``He comitted a wrong, there's no question about it.''

   One of the world's most successful filmmakers
and a legendary film company release a $55 million cinematic gamble
on Friday with the opening of the medieval fantasy ``Willow.''
   Both George Lucas, whose ``Star Wars'' and ``Indiana Jones''
movies have grossed $1 billion, and MGM, which once was Hollywood's
greatest studio, need a hit. The movie is directed by Ron Howard,
who won acclaim with ``Splash'' and ``Cocoon.''
   Lucasfilm Ltd. has produced two expensive flops, ``Labyrinth''
and ``Howard the Duck.'' MGM, meanwhile, is struggling to regain
momentum after several reorganizations. As a further complication,
financier Kirk Kerkorian, who owns 82.4 percent of the parent
MGM@UA Communications, is seeking a buyer for the company. A
``Willow'' hit would enhance the price.
   Despite some early negative reviews for the movie, which goes
into 1,000 theaters nationwide Friday, MGM and Lucas can be proud
of their achievement. ``Willow'' is movie storytelling in the grand
tradition.
   No, it isn't a landmark film such as the ``Star Wars'' trilogy _
the kind of achievement that happens once a decade. Much of
``Willow'' may seem familiar to audiences exposed to special
effects movies of recent years or to animated classics from Disney.
   But ``Willow'' stands on its own merits as high adventure
executed with superior imagination.
   Theater owner and reviewer screenings drew mixed responses.
Daily Variety called the film ``a medieval mishmash'' but predicted
``kids will probably love it.'' Time magazine said: ``For now,
(Lucas') wonder wand is broken.'' Newsweek's headline was: ``The
Raider of Lost Art.''
   Facing blockbuster competition from ``Rambo III'' and
``Crocodile Dundee II'' on May 25, MGM prudently released
``Willow'' five days earlier.
   ``Willow'' centers on the efforts of a brave dwarf to save a
baby from the clutches of an evil queen who fears the child will
destroy her power. The hero, Willow, finds allies in an
over-the-hill knight and a pair of mischievous ``brownies'' _
creatures 9 inches tall.
   There are no major stars in the film, which features Val Kilmer
(``Top Gun''), Joanne Whalley (``Dance With a Stranger''), Jean
Marsh (``Upstairs, Downstairs'') and 19-year-old Warwick Davis as
Willow. The 3-foot-4 Davis was discovered by Lucas a few years ago
and cast as an Ewok in ``Return of the Jedi.''
   The producers count on a box-office success to help their
massive merchandising campaign. More than 30 companies have been
licensed to manufacture such items as ``Willow'' underwear, bed
sheets, lunch boxes, meal promotion at Wendy's, coloring sets, toy
action figures, computer and board games, magic tricks, records,
tapes and compact discs.
   ``Willow'' resulted from a friendship between Lucas and Howard,
who met 15 years ago when Lucas directed ``American Grafitti,''
with Howard as one of the principal actors.
   Lucas was just out of USC Film School, directing his first major
film under the sponsorship of his friend, Francis Coppola. Howard
had been an actor from the age of 5, working mostly in TV series
such as ``The Courtship of Eddie's Father,'' ``The Andy Griffith
Show'' and ``Happy Days.''
   They met again a few years ago. Howard recalled their
conversation in a recent interview:
   Lucas: ``I'd like to do a fantasy.''
   Howard: ``That's something I'd like to do.''
   Lucas: ``I've always wanted to do a story that centered on a
little person.''
   Howard: ``That's something I've always wanted to do, too. I've
always been intrigued by the idea of taking a little person or the
relationship of two little people and developing it so that 15 or
20 minutes into the picture you'd forget completely that the person
was small.''
   ``Willow'' was the result, with Lucas creating the story, Bob
Dolman writing the script and Howard directing.
   Among the director's many chores was preserving believability in
the happenings of another world.
   ``Fantasy works best when everyone involved in a project _
writer, producer, director and certainly the actors _ believe what
they're doing and try to be as honest as possible,'' Howard said.
   ``The actors really had to trust that it was OK to look at a
talking animal and play a scene just as if that creature was an
important character in your life. Gee, they all really committed to
it. That's the only way you can make a movie like this one.''
   Shooting locations for ``Willow'' ranged from the glacial
mountains of New Zealand to the craggy cliffs of Wales, with
interiors at the Elstree Studio near London.
   The cost of ``Willow'' has been reported from $35 million to $40
million, with $20 million for prints and advertising. Howard
declined to confirm the amount.
   ``This is an escapist movie, and I don't want people thinking
what it cost when a lot of soldiers charge down a mountain. When
there's an amazing special effect, I don't want them whipping out
their pocket calculators and saying, `By my estimate ...'
   ``I want them to say, `Oh, wow! What's going to happen next?'''

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Bill Requiring Full Disclosure on Home Equity
Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee on Thursday
unanimously approved legislation requiring lenders to make full
disclosure on home equity loans.
   The bill also is designed to put an end to the use of unfair
contract provisions and misleading advertisements.
   Committee Chairman Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., said the
measure ``contains the kind of disclosures that will enable a
consumer to make a reasoned judgment with the full understanding of
what lies down the road.''
   The legislation, he said, assures that the consumer will not be
surprised by unilateral changes in terms after the contract is in
force.
   ``The legislation is a major protection against consumers being
duped by misleading claims and falling into financial traps that
could lead to loss of a home,'' St Germain said.
   The bill requires banks and credit unions to disclose important
information about the terms and conditions of the loan, such as the
various repayment options, with the application and before fees are
required. Current law allows lenders to withhold disclosures until
the consumer is about to sign on the dotted line.
   Lenders also would be required to tell the consumer about all
fees which may charged in connection with the loan and whether or
not the terms disclosred are guaranteed to remain in effect for a
specific period of time.
   The full committee amended the measure that came out of the
consumer affairs subcommittee on Feb. 24 by making more stringent a
provision prohibiting lenders from unilaterally changing the terms
of the contract after it has been signed, except in narrow
circumstances.
   The bill also limits lenders from calling in the loan before the
due date, except in narrow circumstances, and requires lenders
offering variable interest rate programs to use an index which is
outside their control and is publicly available
   The consumer also is protected from misleading statements or
half-truths in advertisements. If an ad tells of a super-low,
short-term rate, it will also have to display, in equal prominence,
what the normal rate would be. All ads will have disclose the
hidden cost such as fees and points.
   Leslie Gainer, representing U.S. Public Research Group, said,
``Lenders have insisted on one-sided contracts which allow them to
change the terms at any time after the borrower has signed on the
dotted line. The House Banking Committee has corrected this
inequity by prohibiting the lender from altering the terms after
the contract has been signed by both parties.''
   Michelle Meier, representing Consumers Union, said, ``These
loans can be land mines for some consumers. The House bill will
give consumers the information they need to keep in a financial
safety zone.''
   Home equity loans _ a line of credit available to borrowers who
provide their homes as collateral _ have grown quite popular in
recent years, especially since the federal tax law that went into
effect last year still makes the interest on them tax deductible in
most cases.
   Consumer groups report that home equity lending doubled between
1986 and 1987 from $40 billion to $80 billion.
   The Senate has passed a less stringent measure as part of a
bigger bank restructuring bill which is now before the House
Banking Committee. A committee aide said proponents wanted a
separate bill in case the restructing bill gets bogged down.
   The American Bankers Association said in a statement that the
trade group had worked with legislators ``to ensure that the bill
preserves the product by providing for creditors' remedies in
deteriorating loan situations.
   ``However, the disclosure and advertising provisions are
impractical,'' said the statement. ``They will result in an
unnecessary overload of information for consumers, and they will
severely limit the creditors' ability to design informative
advertisements.''

   Mary Ruth Wilson was teaching her class
at West High School when a policeman showed up.
   She was surprised when he proceeded to handcuff her, and
resigned by the time he began to remove his clothes.
   The man was not a policeman, of course, but a stripper
apparently hired by the all-girl class for Ms. Wilson's birthday.
   ``I realized it was a joke when the girls started laughing,''
Ms. Wilson said, adding the man left on his shorts. ``They did it
because they liked me. The girls thoroughly enjoyed it.''
   Ms. Wilson said she was embarrassed and wishes the incident
earlier this month had not happened.
   ``He did not come through the office and had he, he would not
have been permitted,'' said Principal Charles Lowery. ``He was
trespassing.''
   The president of the Knox County PTA, Pam Guinn, said ``I'm

would be upset.''

<HEAD>Bush Must Define Himself Without Undermining Reagan</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a painfully slow ballet, George Bush is
delicately stepping away from Ronald Reagan.
   Each step is carefully choreographed as the cautious Republican
vice president tries to define what he would do as president _
without undermining or angering the president.
   The Republican nominee-to-be cannot win without convincing
Americans he is his own man. But he cannot break with Reagan
dramatically, for that would shatter Bush's hold on the
conservative foundation of his bid for the White House.
   And Bush does want to be identified with low unemployment,
continuing prosperity and a declining trade deficit _ all current
conditions the Reagan administration brags about.
   But he is falling in the polls against Democratic front-runner
Michael Dukakis, in part because he has failed thus far to paint
for the voters a vivid picture of what he would do as president.
   As New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean said Thursday, ``Ronald Reagan is a
very popular man, but nobody wants a clone.''
   The White House appeared to ease the way for Bush when spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, ``He has his ideas on how he's going to want
to do things, and that's fine.''
   A weeklong trip through the West demonstrated graphically the
easy and the hard choices Bush must make in the next six months to
try to put together a winning coalition in the fall.
   In the Pacific Northwest, Bush hit hard on protecting the
environment, proclaiming that the government must do more.
   He didn't directly criticize the environmental record of the
administration, but he did break cleanly with Reagan on one issue
Monday. Bush said he would act to stop the sources of acid rain,
while the administration just wants to study the problem more.
   This was an easy one for Bush, for the environment is close to a
motherhood issue. No one is against clean air and clean water, even
though there are disagreements on how to achieve those goals.
   And acid rain is not a burning issue for Reagan, nor is it one
that is central to the basic GOP constituencies.
   The hard choices for Bush come in packages like the
administration's dealings with Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega.
   The Reagan Justice Department indicted Noriega for involvement
in drug-running, but the White House is thinking of dropping the
indictments if Noriega will give up power.
   Bush's first reaction was to say that talking about sensitive
matters is a mistake. Of course, the White House was talking _
albeit carefully _ about the negotiations.
   Next the vice president said he wanted Noriega out of Panama,
leaving the impression perhaps, that a deal dropping the charges
was all right.
   Then, Bush tried yet another formulation with yet a different
emphasis. He said Friday in San Diego, he wanted Noriega ``brought
to justice.''
   That meant he was against dropping the indictment, right? Bush
wouldn't say and neither would aides. It was a precisely vague
phrase, for bringing someone into court is only one meaning of
``justice.''
   This careful wording didn't draw the attention Bush wanted and
thus didn't deal with the problem.
   At every stop, reporters shouted questions to the GOP
heir-apparent on Noriega. Bush would smile and just say nothing.
   Wednesday brought yet another effort.
   ``Drug dealers are domestic terrorists, killing kids and cops
and they should be treated as such,'' Bush said at the Los Angeles
Police Academy. ``I won't bargain with terrorists and I won't
bargain with drug dealers either, whether they are on U.S. or
foreign soil.''
   He didn't say Noriega. And aides were quick to say he was not
talking about the current situation, only what he would do in the
future.
   Now there was no doubt that Bush wanted to leave the impression
that he simply would not cut a plea-bargaining deal with Noriega.
To say it clearly would have been critical of Reagan and a step
into the middle of a mess Bush would like to avoid as much as
possible.
   So Bush tried to say it without saying it.
   But the problem is a simple one _ it does not answer the basic
question: What does Bush think of the proposed deal?
   So the questions will continue, as long as Noriega is on the
front pages.
   Likewise with the scandals swirling around Attorney General
Edwin Meese _ Bush has refused to comment and so he faces
questioning almost every day on whether or not he thinks Meese
should resign.
   Bush aides will talk privately about the need for the vice
president to step away from Reagan, but Bush himself is the one
arguing the time is not yet ripe for clear and definitive moves.
   The problem for Bush, as an aide once said, is that he is the
Velcro candidate _ everything sticks to him. To win in the fall,
that must change for Bush.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Fishing Contest Cruel to Animals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMM, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court has fined two organizers of a
fishing contest about $700 each for cruelty to animals, ruling that
fish feel pain when hooked and pulled from the water.
   The April 18 decision grew out of a suit filed by an animal
rights group against a local angling club that staged a fishing
contest two years ago.
   The object of the contest was to see which fisherman could catch
the most pounds of fish in two days. After the fish were pulled in
and weighed, they were returned to the water.
   Civil court Judge Horst Brinkmann based his decision on
testimony of experts called in to determine whether or not fish
feel pain when hooked, and if they suffered during the time they
were out of the water.
   Four wildlife experts testified that an increased heart rate and
labored breathing of the fish after they were pulled from the water
indicated that they feel pain.
   Brinkmann ruled that fishing was permissible if fish were
quickly killed, and if they were caught for useful purposes. But he
added that simply catching the fish to weigh and determine which
angler was more skilled subjected the creatures to unusually cruel
treatment.
   ``Fishing contests serve no further purpose than to determine
who has won,'' Brinkmann ruled.

   The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Robert
Runcie, will confer a doctorate of literature next month on British
playwright Christoper Fry.
   The Church of England said the degree will honor the 80-year-old
Fry's work as a dramatist and his contribution to religious drama.
   As spiritual heads of the Church of England, archbishops of
Canterbury are entitled to confer Lambeth degrees under a statute
dating back to King Henry VIII. These are full academic degrees
from Oxford University, not honorary degrees, the church said.
   Fry was a schoolmaster, actor and theater director before making
his name as a playwright in the 1940s.
   His mystical and religious plays include ``The Boy With A
Cart,'' ``The Firstborn'' and ``Thor with Angels.''

   Answering his mail will occupy part of his birthday, as it does

he has shared with wife, Gloria, for 39 years. He often has lunch
at the Beverly Hills Hotel, then returns to the office to answer

   Stewart said he hadn't given the milestone much thought.
``Frankly, it sneaked up on me. After 75, I didn't pay much

   As for making it to 80, he responded in characteristic Jimmy

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis responded Thursday to President Reagan`s call for a
bipartisan task force on drugs by criticizing administration
cutbacks on money for drug education and enforcement.
   ``I have no problem with another study,'' the Massachusetts
governor told a news conference. But he then added, ``I don't think
we need another study.''
   Dukakis said that in 1985 Reagan signed ``a sweeping drug
education prevention act'' and then four months later cut 50
percent from the funding that had been agreed upon.
   ``There are modest sums that have been appropriated by Congress
for state and local law enforcement agencies to fight this war
against drugs. The president is the one who zeroed them out,'' he
said.
   Apparently unwilling to flatly reject Reagan's call for a
bipartisan effort, Dukakis said, ``This is a bipartisan issue.
There is no question about that. There is no Republican or
Democratic or Independent way to fight it.''
   Dukakis campaigned half a day in New Jersey before flying to
California on Thursday.
   They are the two biggest states holding primaries on June 7, the
day Dukakis hopes to bring his delegate total over the 2,081 needed
to lock up the Democratic presidential nomination.
   He denied he was already looking at potential running mates.
   ``There was not a word of truth in that article,'' he said of a
Washington Post story that said Dukakis aides were looking closely
at Sens. John Glenn of Ohio and Bill Bradley of New Jersesy for the
second spot on the ticket.
   Bradley has said he isn't interested.
   ``I haven't even thought about it,'' said Dukakis.
   After the last Democratic primaries on June 7, he said, ``there
will be plenty of time to be thinking about running mates.''
   He added that no member of his staff was authorized to discuss
the selection process.
   He said he would make his choice ``thoughtfully and with a
certain amount of reflection.''

   Communist Party delegates gather Friday
to consider changes in Hungary's divided leadership, including the
possible replacement of party leader Janos Kadar.
   Kadar, the party's general secretary since the Soviets crushed a
revolt in 1956, has been increasingly blamed for Hungary's
deepening economic crisis and for resisting political reforms.
   ``Kadar has come to personify the mistakes that have been made
in the past,'' said a prominent party official, who spoke on
condition he not be identified further.
   ``No real change can occur as long as he remains on top,'' the
official said, adding that a growing number of party members wants
to see him step down.
   Hungary's Communist leaders are under mounting pressure from
both inside and outside the party to adopt political reforms as a
first step in revitalizing the nation's stagnating economy.
   Last week, the party's Central Committee said personnel changes
would be high on the conference agenda, fueling speculation Kadar
would be asked to step aside.
   However, Western diplomatic sources say there is still no clear
indication that Kadar intends to relinquish control soon.
   ``The situation is very fluid and the outcome (of the
conference) is almost impossible to predict,'' said a Western
diplomat, who requested anonymity.
   Any changes in the party leadership would likely be announced
after a Central Committee meeting scheduled for Sunday.
   While Kadar pioneered reforms that made the country relatively
prosperous in the late 1960s and 1970s, a series of recent economic
setbacks and austerity measures imposed to curb them have angered
many Hungarians.
   Premier Karoly Grosz, a leading contender to succeed Kadar, has
said that the political future of the party leader may be up for
debate during the conference, the first since 1957.
   Kadar has said in recent interviews that he would step down if
asked.
   In addition to personnel issues, some 900 delegates are to
debate a package of economic refoms and proposals for modest
political changes drafted by Kadar.
   Reformists in the party say the political reforms _ which
include provisions for secret ballots, limited terms of office for
party officials and multicandidate elections _ do not go far enough.
   Imre Pozsgay, an outspoken Central Committee member and a
leading proponent of reforms, has called for changes in the
constitution that would provide for referendums and guarantee the
independence of a growing number of political interest groups.
   Pozsgay, leader of the Communist sponsored People's Patriotic
Front, has also urged that the leading role of the Communist Party
be reviewed.
   The Central Committee announced last week that the delegates
would discuss the ``party's tasks and the development of the
political system.''
   A commentary published in the latest edition of Magyar Ifjusag,
the official newspaper of the Hungarian Communist Youth Union, also
called for changes, saying that ``internal instransigence within
the party has come to hamper roads to reform.''
   The economic weekly Figyeloe said in an editorial Thursday that
the conference ``will be a turning point in Hungary's national
destiny.''
   ``Economic reforms cannot be separated from the political
sphere,'' the editorial said.
   A gross foreign debt of more than $17 billion and rising
inflation led Hungary's leaders this year to impose Eastern
Europe's first personal and value added taxes.
   Many Hungarians, whose standard of living has been hit hard by
the measures, are calling for more of a voice in Hungary's economic
and political affairs.

   Historic Charleston's Southern charm
will take on the air of a European fairy tale Friday when the
Spoleto Festival U.S.A. opens for its 17-day run.
   In its annual rite of spring, the city is transformed into a
carnival of the performing arts, with music, dancing and drama
everywhere. Streets are adorned with colorful banners and street
corners become impromptu stages for mimes and musicians.
   The fairy-tale motif also will make its way to stages around the
city during this year's 12th edition of the festival founded by
composer Gian Carlo Menotti and patterned after its namesake
festival in Spoleto, Italy.
   Spoleto '88 _ the most ambitious American Spoleto to date _ will
open its run with the traditional round of speeches on the steps of
City Hall.
   There'll be a brass fanfare and a samba band from ``The Warrior
Ant'' _ a work by director Lee Bruer and composer Bob Telson
featuring more than 50 dancers, musicians and actors, which will
have its world premiere during Spoleto.
   Later Friday, the festival's major opera, Dvorak's ``Rusalka,''
goes on the boards at the Gaillard Municipal Auditorium.
   The work, based on a Czechoslovakian fairy tale and rarely
produced in this country, is filled with sprites, gnomes and
witches.
   The Spoleto version is replete with special effects and will be
sung in Czech. However, slides with the English translation will be
projected over the stage for festivalgoers.
   Echoing the fairy-tale theme is ``Miracolo d'Amore'' (Miracle of
Love), a dance-theater piece by New York choreographer Martha
Clarke. The work is based on Italian fairy tales and may prove
somewhat controversial in Charleston because it features some
nudity. However, it's not the first time there's been nudity on
stage at the festival.
   And, from 12th century France, comes the musical drama ``Herod
and the Innocents,'' performed by New York's Ensemble For Early
Music.
   Other highlights include Carl Henrich Graun's 1755 opera
``Montezuma'' about the Spanish destruction of the Aztec
civilization in the 1500s and the U.S. debut of the Symphony
Orchestra of Belgian Radio and Television.
   The popular Circus Flora featuring Flora the elephant, which
played to packed houses at Spoleto two years ago, is back for an
encore this season.
   Festival ticket sales have been brisk, said General Manager
Nigel Redden, who added organizers expect to surpass last year's
record box office.
   All in all, there will be 112 performances featuring 550
performers before the festival closes with a concert and fireworks
display at nearby Middleton Place Plantation on June 5.
   There'll also be dozens of additional performances for Piccolo
Spoleto (Little Spoleto), the companion arts festival staged by the
city of Charleston.

<HEAD>Judge Reschedules LaRouche Trial; Questions Oliver North Subpoena</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The judge who declared a mistrial in a conspiracy
case against political extremist Lyndon LaRouche has scheduled a
new trial for October and challenged a defense request to question
Oliver North, who LaRouche claims tried to ruin him.
   Although U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton has set the trial
for Oct. 3, he will first have to rule on defense contentions that
retrying LaRouche and his followers would violate their
constitutional protection against being tried twice on the same
charges.
   Keeton last week ordered defense lawyers to submit written
arguments on the double jeopardy issue by July 15 and given
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham until Aug. 1 to respond.
Keeton is expected to rule before a Sept. 8 status hearing.
   Keeton declared the mistrial last month following complaints
from several jurors, who had been told when the trial began in
December that it would last about six months but later were told it
might last up to a year.
   The judge was careful to note he blamed the mistrial both on
lengthy hearings needed because of alleged government withholding
of documents from defense lawyers and on ``agressive behavior'' by
defense lawyers, a comment widely interpreted as an indication
Keeton would reject arguments that LaRouche and the others cannot
be retried because the mistrial was the prosecution's fault.
   LaRouche, six aides and five LaRouche political groups were
charged with conspiring to obstruct a 1986 federal grand jury
investigation of allegations that LaRouche's 1984 presidential
campaign raised more than $1 million through credit card fraud and
another $1 million or more through loan fraud.
   LaRouche, who is making his fourth run for the presidency,
contends the FBI and CIA infiltrated his organizations because of
Reagan administration anger at his refusal to support efforts to
arm the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. LaRouche contends the
infiltration and fabrication of evidence of fraud was directed by
North, the former Marine lieutenant colonel who ran a Contra
resupply network from the White House at a time when such aid was
prohibited by Congress.
   Defense lawyers have sought to question North from the outset of
the case and stepped up the effort three months ago after obtaining
a declassified memo written to North in which another key player in
the Iran-Contra affair, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord,
mentioned an associate's efforts to gather ``info against
LaRouche.''
   Keeton last week ordered defense lawyer William Moffitt, who is
handling the North request, to refine his lengthy arguments on the
request in a memo outlining what testimony defense lawyers believe
North could give that would be relevant to the case.
   Markham has opposed the request and said that he likely would
have to grant North immunity if Keeton ordered him to testify
because North is under indictment for his role in the Iran-Contra
scandal.

   A Jewish group asked a French
bank Thursday for financial records to trace millions of dollars
earmarked for Holocaust survivors that allegedly were embezzled by
the group's former leader.
   Jewish officials said it was still not certain how much money
late Central Jewish Council leader Werner Nachmann allegedly took
nor where the funds went.
   Hesse State radio, without citing sources, said that Nachmann
may have embezzled up to $24 million, a much higher figure than
previously reported. Some of the money appears to have gone to a
fashion store Nachmann owned, the radio said.
   The radio station also said ``higher-level officials'' moved to
block a Karlsruhe Tax Office audit of Nachmann's records in 1980.
But the tax office's director, Bernhard Schmitt, flatly denied the
report.
   ``No audit of his (Nachmann's) accounts was ever ordered, and
could therefore not have been blocked,'' Schmitt said in an
interview.
   Heinz Galinski, who took over the council's leadership after
Nachmann's death in January, was to meet with an aide to Chancellor
Helmut Kohl Friday to discuss the incident.
   Galinski said he and the Kohl assistant, Wolfgang Schaeuble,
would seek to determine whether government officials should have
better monitored the flow of money paid by West German for
Holocaust survivors.
   Galinski, in an interview, said the Jewish Council had asked the
Karlsruhe branch of the Bank Societe Generale Alsacienne for full
financial records of Nachmann's transactions.
   The French bank handled some of Nachmann's accounts and an
account belonging to the Jewish Council, according to Galinski.
   Galinski said earlier this week that Nachmann appeared to have
embezzled about $6 million since 1980.
   The Nachmann family's attorney, Peter Paepcke, said he believes
Nachmann apparently took the money to help bolster his failing
Karlsruhe-based textile business, but added that he had been unable
to trace the funds.
   The attorney filed for bankruptcy for Nachmann's heirs and his
business on March 30. The proceedings opened Thursday, Paepcke said.
   Nachmann, president of the Jewish Council from 1965 until his
death at age 62 in January, was in charge of disbursing the
government funds to Holocaust survivors around the world.
   About $236 million was allocated by the West German government
in 1980 for Holocaust survivors who had not previously made
reparations claims.
   On Wednesday, Karlsruhe prosecutors said they would seek to
determine whether other people may have been involved in the
embezzling case.
   Nachmann's family fled Nazi Germany to France in 1938. He
returned in 1945 and began working toward re-establishing Jewish
communities in the country.
   About 530,000 Jews lived in Germany when the Nazis took power in
1933. West Germany has about 30,000 Jewish residents today.

   Jury selection began today in former Gov.
Evan Mecham's criminal trial on charges of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan.
   About 100 prospective jurors filed into the Maricopa County
Superior Court room and then were sworn in the first step in
choosing a jury for the ousted governor and his brother, Willard.
   The Mechams did not attend today's court session. The former
governor's attorney, Michael Scott, said Mecham probably would
attend next week, after the field is narrowed and questioning of
prospective jurors begins.
   On Wednesday, a state Supreme Court justice refused a defense
request to delay the trial until the high court considers a defense
motion to return the charges to the state grand jury. However, the
justice agreed that the Supreme Court will hear arguments on that
issue June 1.
   The state Court of Appeals rejected a defense claim Monday that
the Mechams were denied ``substantial procedural rights'' in the
grand jury process.
   The former governor said he could not predict whether he will
fare any better in court than he did at his state Senate
impeachment trial. The Senate removed the 64-year-old Republican on
April 4, a year into his first term.
   ``I haven't broken any laws,'' Mecham said Wednesday. ``I looked
at the laws. My attorney looked at the laws. We've had experts look
at the laws. We haven't broken any of them.''
   The prospective jurors were given a questionnaire worked out by
the prosecution, defense and trial Judge Michael Ryan and designed
to ferret out obvious bias for or against the former governor.
   ``Please do not withhold any information in order to be seated
on this jury,'' Ryan told the prospective jurors.
   The 99 questions included whether the prospective jurors know
anyone involved in the Mecham case and whether they signed or
circulated petitions for or against Mecham while he was governor.
Others asked about favorite television shows and whether
prospective jurors have bumper stickers on their cars.
   The field is to be narrowed by the attorneys and judge with the
remaining prospective jurors to be called back for questioning
either Monday or Tuesday.
   Mecham faces six felony counts on three charges _ perjury,
filing false documents and fraud _ accusing him of concealing a
$350,000 campaign loan. Willard Mecham, who was his brother's 1986
campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts.
   Prosecutors said the Mechams failed to report the loan from
Tempe developer Barry Wolfson on personal or campaign financial
statements until after a newspaper reported the contribution.
   The former governor could face up to 22 years in prison if he is
convicted on all six counts.
   If the attorneys are unable to choose an impartial jury from the
initial pool of 100, Scott has said he probably will seek either to
dismiss the charges or to move the trial to another location.
   Scott said other motions may be filed before trial testimony
begins, probably after Memorial Day. Both sides have said they
expect testimony to take two to three weeks.
   In papers filed Wednesday with the state Supreme Court, defense
attorneys said the Mechams were entitled to ``an adequately
informed and properly instructed grand jury.''
   ``Instead the attorney general's office, in its inordinate
thirst for an indictment, and perhaps the celebrity that
prosecuting a controversial governor can bring, repeatedly tested
the very limits of judicial tolerance to which they might go in the
manipulation of this grand jury,'' the defense said.
   Mecham's attorneys contend that prosecutors were not justified
in pursuing a grand jury indictment after an earlier grand jury was
disbanded.
   Also Wednesday, the defense asked Ryan to reconsider a claim
that the Mechams were victims of selective prosecution.
   Ryan has rejected several other defense motions, including a
proposed change of venue and a motion by Willard Mecham for
separate trials.
   Mecham was convicted in the Senate of trying to thwart a death
threat investigation and of misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund by loaning the money to his auto dealership.
   He also was impeached on charges of concealing the $350,000
loan, but the Senate decided not to consider that charge for fear
of prejudicing Mecham's criminal trial.

<HEAD>Bush Told That Reagan Won't Complain If He Cites Differences</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush received an open invitation from the
White House Thursday to express policy differences without fearing
criticism ``in any way'' from President Reagan. Michael Dukakis hit
administration cutbacks in money for drug education.
   Dukakis' Democratic challenger, Jesse Jackson, campaigned on the
West Coast, but spent most of the day in private meetings.
   Bush, who has the Republican presidential nomination locked up,
also spent most of the day working privately. But the political
repercussions continued from his declaration on Wednesday that he
would not negotiate with drug dealers _ an implied disagreement
with administration talks with Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian
general facing drug charges in this country.
   The vice president's comment dominated the daily press briefing
at the White House, where spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said no
offense was taken by the president.
   ``As we go through the campaign, I would expect to see the vice
president speaking out on a number of issues,'' he said. ``I expect
a number of them will be different than existing policies and ...
we will not, we will not criticize them ... in any way.''
   At the same time, Fitzwater defended the administration's
approach to Noriega, which White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker
has likened to ``plea bargaining.''
   But the spokesman also gave these words of advice to White House
reporters: ``If you want to drive a wedge between the White House
and the vice president, forget it.''
   Bush received his free-expression pass from the White House as
public opinion polls showed him losing ground to Dukakis, the
all-but-certain Democratic nominee, a decline widely believed
linked in part to controversies involving Noriega and embattled
Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   The vice president, who stressed his loyalty to Reagan during
the early, competitive weeks of the primary campaign, has been
receiving unsolicited advice from Republican allies that he needs
to establish his own identity with the voters.
   ``Ronald Reagan is a very popular man but nobody wants a
clone,'' said New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, interviewed while
visiting London ``He must separate himself from Ronald Reagan.''
   Dukakis spent part of the day campaigning in New Jersey before
flying to California. The two states are among four that hold
primary elections on June 7, the last day of the Democratic primary
season.
   Dukakis is heavily favored to defeat Jesse Jackson in both those
primaries, and aides say he will have enough delegates to assure
his nomination by the time the results of those elections are
counted.
   The Massachusetts governor responded mildly to Reagan's call for
a bipartisan drug study commission. ``I have no problem with
another study,'' he said, although he also added, ``I don't think
we need another study.''
   Dukakis also criticized the administration as he spoke to
community leaders in a Camden, N.J., neighborhood known for drug
problems.
   He said that in 1985, Reagan signed ``a sweeping drug education
prevention act'' and then four months later cut the funding in half.
   ``There are modest sums that have been appropriated by Congress
for state and local law enforcement agencies to fight this war
against drugs. The president is the one who zeroed them out,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   A pastor charged with raping two teen-agers
required members of his church to turn over their savings accounts
to him and furnish tax records to prove they were giving enough to
the church.
   Law enforcement sources also said Wednesday that newlywed
members of the Rev. Thomas Streitferdt's True Church of God were
required to honeymoon at a church-owned resort in Mexico and to
register babies at the church's school.
   In order to get to heaven, he told his congregants, they had to
be buried at the church-owned cemetery in New Jersey, according to
the sources, who spoke on condition their names not be used.
   Streitferdt took complete personal charge of the savings
accounts of many of his members and offered them other banking
services, the sources said.
   He is free on $25,000 bail following his arraignment Monday on
two counts each of first-degree rape and first-degree sodomy
involving two sisters, age 14 and 16. A hearing was scheduled for
Friday.
   A Brooklyn minister who spoke Wednesday on condition of
anonymity said some members of Streitferdt's church said that the
pastor required them to show him their W-2 forms to prove they were
giving part of their incomes to the church.
   The minister said members of the church, located in a poor
Harlem neighborhood, called him fearing they would be charged with
tax violations, following news reports of questionable financial
activities by Streitferdt.
   Law enforcement sources said tax and financial records of the
church and Streitferdt will be subpoenaed. The sources said a
two-year investigation showed the pastor registered possessions in
the name of a church or religious group.
   Among the possessions is a $1.4 million waterfront estate on
Long Island, where the pastor, who is white, lives with his wife,
who is black. It also includes several Mercedes-Benz automobiles,
property in the Virgin Islands, a honeymoon resort in Acapulco, and
the Rose Hill Cemetery in Linden, N.J.
   ``Everything is owned by the church,'' confirmed Streitferdt's
lawyer, Ben Herzweig, who added, ``It's a legitimate church.'' He
called Streitferdt ``an honorable, deeply religious man who tries
his best to help people.''
   The law enforcement sources said Streitferdt had churches in
other cities, including Elmira and Syracuse, and in the Caribbean.
   To finance purchase of the properties, including the lavish
Harlem church, Streitferdt required an annual 10 percent tithe from
his 700 members, except every third year when he required 30
percent.
   Streitferdt required that children born to congregants be
registered, for a fee, with the church's school at the age of 6
months, sources said. Tuition is $600 at the school, which is not
regulated by the state because it does not go through the 12th
grade or offer diplomas.
   The Harlem church, dedicated in 1975, was locked Wednesday. A
church employee said Streitferdt was not in the building but would
conduct services Sunday morning.

   Two missiles fell accidentally from a
Soviet military jet and exploded on a private farm Thursday,
damaging buildings and knocking out power but causing no injuries,
the official news agency PAP reported.
   The accident occurred near the southwestern town of Przemkow in
Legnica province, the report said. It gave no details on how the
accident occurred.
   The province is home base for the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact's
Northern Group of Forces. It is 200 miles southwest of Warsaw and
about 50 miles from the East German border.
   A resident reached by telephone said test flights are common in
the area.
   One year ago Thursday, a rocket accidentally dropped by a Soviet
fighter exploded in a barnyard in Wilkocin near Przemkow, killing
one man and injuring two people.
   The PAP report said the latest accident left two craters in a
private farm field, cracks and splits in some buildings and
unspecified damage to ``roof structures.''
   Also damaged was a 300-yard section of high-power lines,
interrupting electricity and shutting down the water pumping system
for Przemkow, a town of about 5,000 people.
   Police in Przemkow declined comment. But the resident said the
missiles fell several hundred yards from the nearest homes, setting
off loud explosions that knocked out windows.
   ``Luckily the missiles fell outside any residential area ...
because it would have been an awful thing,'' the man said. He said
one missile could be seen passing over the town into the fields.
``It made a great big crater.''

<TEXT>
   Sea World trainers have returned to the water
to train with killer whales under stricter safety guidelines, but
no performances with humans and the giant mammals together are
scheduled.
   ``I would say that the biggest change is in the raised
experience level of the trainers,'' said Michael Scarpuzzi, the
marine park's new director of training. ``From now on, trainers
have to have a minimum of four years of experience before they can
even get in the water.''
   Scarpuzzi would not specify when the trainers would go back into
the pool for performances. But he said Wednesday it probably woudl
be soon.
   The trainers were ordered out of the water following a series of
accidents last year, including one in November in which a trainer
with two years of experience was critically hurt when a whale
landed on him during a show.
   In response, William Jovanovich, chairman of Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc., Sea World's parent company, ordered trainers out
of the water during shows and fired three executives. One of the
executives later was reinstated.
   Jovanovich also vowed that humans would never again enter the
water with killer whales, which had become a trademark of the
aquatic park.
   ``I don't think it was ever their intent to just say flat out,
`No,''' Scarpuzzi said. ``I know the chairman said that, but it was
said during a very emotional time.''

   A mountain of castoff clothing, offered
free in a pasture to bargain hunters who pay $5 to park, could
become North Carolina's hottest tourist attraction this weekend,
authorities say.
   ``We have been besieged with calls from all over the state
wanting to know how people can get to the free clothing,'' said
Sheriff Tommy Allen of Anson County.
   Lee Wright, a used-car dealer who owns the farm where the
clothes are stored, has refused to say where the garments came
from. But the sheriff said the clothing cost Wright nothing and was
hauled away from a second-hand clothing exporter in New York City.
   Allen said nothing apparently is illegal about giving the
clothing away or charging the $5 parking fee. And Anson County
Health Department officials said the operation will be considered a
flea market.

   Four foreigners and two white
Zimbabweans detained as alleged South African spies appeared in
court Thursday, and the government said it needed more time to
investigate the case.
   The six whites were returned to custody pending a June 20
hearing. They had been denied bail on Wednesday.
   Prosecutor Tadius Karwi told magistrate Gilbert Mutezo the state
expected it would be ready to fix a trial date at the hearing.
   The six _ two Britons, a Canadian, an Irishman and two
Zimbabweans _ face charges under Zimbabwe's official secrets act
which carry a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment on
conviction.
   They were detained under emergency powers regulations in
September after Ivor Harding, 55, a Zimbabwean, was allegedly found
at Beitbridge border post adjoining South Africa with information
on Zimbabwe-based officials of the African National Congress.
   The six allegedly carried out surveillance on the homes and
vehicles of ANC and Pan Africanist Congress officials and South
African exiles in Zimbabwe for the South African security services.
   The ANC and the PAC are the main guerrilla-backed organizations
fighting the white-dominated South African government and its
apartheid policies of racial separation.
   Several ANC officials have been killed in sabotage attacks
mounted by South Africa in Zimbabwe and in neighboring black-ruled
states in the past two years.
   Detained were Jack Lewis-Walker, 54, and Patricia Brown, 53,
both Britons who have been longtime residents of Zimbabwe.
Lewis-Walker was a senior civil servant and provost marshal in the
Rhodesian air force before the former British colony's independence
in 1980.
   Also held were Canadian Dick Laban, 50; Zimbabwe-born Jeffrey
Mee, 45, who holds an Irish passport; and Ivor Harding and his son
Clive, 25, both Zimbabweans.

   Wildlife officials say they are stumped by
the discovery of three more dead eagles along the Piney River,
bringing to 10 the number of eagles found dead in the area recently.
   About 30 eagles are killed each year in Colorado. Most are hit
by cars while as they feed on dead animals in the road, or are
electrocuted when they land on power lines, said Todd Malmsbury,
spokesman for the state Division of Wildlife.
   But in this case, he said, ``We're looking at something
completely different.''
   The state and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are conducting
tests to find out what might have killed the birds.
   Traces of mercury in their systems would not necessarily cause
the birds to die, and officials have been unable to find a source
of mercury in the area.
   The birds are protected by several state and federal laws,
including the Endangered Species Act.

   Vice President George Bush must cast off his
``identical twin'' image and mark out his differences with Ronald
Reagan if he is to succeed Reagan as president, New Jersey Gov.
Thomas Kean said Thursday.
   Kean, sometimes mentioned as a possible vice presidential
candidate on a Bush ticket, said Bush can win only if he shows
voters how his presidency would differ from Reagan's.
   ``Vice presidents are often co-opted by the president when they
try to run. George Bush can't allow that to happen,'' Kean said in
an interview.
   ``Much as he likes and admires Ronald Reagan, he has got to,
with Ronald Reagan's full support, spell out where the differences
are,'' he said. ``If he does that effectively, I think he'll be
successful.''
   ``Ronald Reagan is a very popular man but nobody wants a
clone,'' Kean said.
   He did not rule out accepting the No. 2 pot on the Republican
ticket.
   ``I have said I did not want the position ... but it would be
totally arrogant to say that were the position offered ... you
would turn it down,'' Kean said.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves to Tighten Control of PCB Handlers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation designed to close a loophole in
the handling of highly toxic chemicals known as polychlorinated
biphenyls, or PCBs, was approved Thursday by the House Energy and
Commerce Committee.
   The bill, endorsed by a voice vote, would require the
Environmental Protection Agency to write regulations controlling
so-called PCB brokers, the middlemen who contract to transport the
chemicals to disposal sites.
   ``There is no federal manifesting requirement to adequately
track PCBs from owner to final disposal,'' said Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla., the bill's principal sponsor. ``Literally, anybody with a
truck can get into the PCB brokerage business.''
   The manufacture of PCBs, most often used as insulators in
electrical equipment, has been banned since the late 1970s. The
nation faces a growing rate of PCB disposal in the coming years as
this equipment wears out.
   Synar said the broker loophole has resulted in PCB dump-and-run
cases across the nation. One broker who was paid millions of
dollars to handle disposal of 13{ million pounds of the chemicals
left them in Holden, Mo., and went bankrupt, leaving behind a site
cleanup bill of more than $30 million, he said.
   The legislation would require EPA to set up a system to keep
track of PCBs once they leave the original owner and to require
brokers to demonstrate they have the financial capability of
assuring safe disposal.
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said the bill has the support of the
environmental and business communities and of EPA, which is
drafting the type of regulations that would be required by the
legislation.
   Dave Colbert, an aide to Luken, said lawmakers feel EPA should
have a congressional directive to regulate PCB brokers in case the
president's Office of Management and Budget opposes such action.
   EPA and OMB have tangled during the Reagan administration over
the issue of whether the environmental agency should issue
regulations that haven't been specifically mandated by Congress.

   A father was arrested after an emergency
dispatcher heard a boy being beaten while the child sought help for
his father, who he believed had suffered a heart attack, police say.
   ``You can actually hear the child getting clobbered,''
Investigator Jack Simmons said.
   The emergency call made by the 11-year-old boy occurred May 12
and was recorded. Juvenile authorities investigating the case said
the boy feared his father was going to have a heart attack while
allegedly beating him.
   John Thomas Whiddon, 40, was arrested Wednesday, charged with
felony injury to a child and released on $2,000 bond.
   Simmons said Whiddon's son called the Fire Department's
emergency number and was describing his father's symptoms when a
man's voice was heard yelling, ``What are you doing on the phone?''
   ``The kid says, `I'm sorry, Dad,' then you hear blows, pops and
dull thuds and you hear the kid crying quite a lot,'' Simmons said.
   The call lasted less than two minutes because someone hung up
the telephone, Simmons said. The emergency dispatcher called police
and then redialed the number where the call originated.
   ``The dad gave the dispatcher a hard time,'' Simmons said. ``He
was cussing him out.''
   Simmons said six days elapsed between the incident and the
arrest because he did not get the case until Monday. The boy was
initially placed in the custody of Harris County Children's
Protective Services but has since been returned to his family.

   Carlos Lehder Rivas, the biggest
foreign drug dealer ever brought to trial in this country, was
found guilty today of running a smuggling operation that shipped
tons of cocaine from Colombia to the United States.
   The verdict against the reputed leader of Colombia's violent
Medellin drug cartel came just after 11 a.m. following seven days
of deliberation.
   Lehder, 38, and co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, were
convicted of conspiring to smuggle 3.3 tons of cocaine, by way of
Norman's Cay in the Bahamas, from 1978 to 1980.
   Prosecutors and government witnesses had described Lehder as a
one-time New York street hood who put together a vast
cocaine-smuggling empire after he was deported to his homeland.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle called him the Henry Ford of drug
trafficking, pioneering mass shipments of cocaine by air from
Colombia to the United States.
   At a news conference this afternoon, Merkle called the verdict
``a victory for the good guys.''
   Asked whether Lehder would spend the rest of his life in jail,
Merkle said: ``I certainly hope so. ... That is certainly going to
be my recommendation.''
   Lehder was found guilty on all counts: one count of conspiracy,
two of importation of cocaine, seven of possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute and one of engaging in a continuing criminal
enterprise.
   He looked down, then stared straight ahead as the court clerk
read the verdicts. Two jurors cried, with one sobbing and burying
her face in her hands, as the seven-month trial came to an end.
   Reed, of San Pedro, Calif., was convicted on a single conspiracy
count and faces up to 15 years in prison and $25,000 in fines.
Lehder now faces life plus 150 years in prison and up to $350,000
in fines.
   Following the verdict on the charges, the jury had to consider
whether Lehder should be forced to forfeit all his Bahamian
property, including large parts of Norman's Cay, several homes, an
airstrip and possibly a number of planes, to the U.S. government.
   The jury returned to deliberations after a brief hearing, and
attorneys both sides refused immediate comment. ``If it's any good,
it's worth waiting for,'' Merkle quipped when asked for reaction to
the verdict.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, commenting to reporters
outside Justice Department today, cited a ``fine job'' by the
prosecutor and investigating agents and said the case was ``an
excellent example of international cooperation ... against a major
drug trafficker.''
   Authorities said the Medellin Cartel, named for a city in
Colombia, was believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the
cocaine smuggled into the United States. Prosecutors called Lehder
the biggest foreign drug smuggler ever brought to trial in the
United States.
   Jurors' names have not been revealed for security reasons, and
U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton had the foreman sign the
verdict form only with his number.
   When Lehder was first brought to the Jacksonville federal
courthouse, a small army of police armed with shotguns and
automatic weapons surrounded the building. Security eased during
the trial, but each day up to 10 federal marshals were in the
courtroom.
   During the trial, witnesses told of Lehder's flamboyant
personality, which included admiration for both Adolf Hitler and
former Beatle John Lennon.
   Witnesses said Lehder, after initially smuggling the drug
himself and paying ``mules'' to fly between Colombia and the United
States, earned a stake that allowed him to fly his own shipments.
   Lehder allegedly paid off Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O.
Pindling to look the other way while his smuggling operation took
over the small island of Norman's Cay, a short hop from Florida.
   Pindling, himself reportedly a target of a Florida grand jury
investigation based in part on trial testimony, has called the
charges a ``fairy tale.''
   The principal prosecution witness was Ed Ward, an ex-marine
pilot running his own marijuana smuggling operation from the
island. He teamed up with Lehder, but eventually fell out with
Lehder's co-defendant Reed, he said.
   After he was arrested in early 1981, he began cooperating with
the DEA.
   Ward, who is under federal protection and has been given a new
identity, testified about hauling 1,600 kilograms of cocaine from
Colombia o Norman's Cay, and flying tons of cocaine from the
Bahamian island to airstrips in Florida and Georgia.
   The trial included a brief appearance by former CBS News anchor
Walter Cronkite, who testified about being chased away from
Norman's Cay in 1978 when he tried to anchor there. ``I was the
most naive yachtsman in the Bahamas,'' he said.
   Defense attorneys Edward Shohat and Jose Quinon hammered away at
the credibility of Ward and other prosecution witnesses. They
accused them of making deals to avoid punishment for their own
crimes, and said Lehder was a legitimate businessman being
victimized by drug investigators.
   In a surprise move, they presented no defense witnesses after
the prosecution rested, sending the trial immediately to the jury.
   Lehder was captured by the Colombian army on Feb. 4, 1987, after
a firefight outside a Medellin mansion. He was immediately flown to
Florida in a swift extradition move that caused controversy in
Colombia.
   A day before bringing in the verdict, the jury had reviewed a
videotape made by Lehder in 1985 when he was a fugitive in the
jungles of Colombia.
   ``This is about political action and cocaine has become, and
marijuana has become, a revolutionary weapon in the struggle
against North American imperialism. Stimulants from Colombia are
the Achilles' heel of imperialism,'' Lehder said.
   Merkle accused Lehder of threatening to kill federal judges if
he were extradited. Lehder's attorneys denied that, but the violent
history of the Medellin Cartel made authorities cautious.
   Hundreds of Colombian officials have been murdered by drug lords
connected to the cartel, including Justice Minister Rodrigo
Lara-Bonilla. The cartel also had a hand in the Louisiana slaying
of Adler ``Barry'' Seal, a top U.S. drug informant, according to
the Miami indictment.
   Lehder is also named in the Miami indictment for his role in the
Medellin Cartel. But that indictment was not included in his
extradition papers, and under the U.S.-Colombia treaty in effect at
the time, he apparently cannot be tried on the charges.
   Lehder also is reportedly the object of a sealed indictment in
Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Carol Burnett Donates Charwoman Costume to Smithsonian</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The orderly atmosphere at the Smithsonian's
National Museum of American History was broken by a shattering
``Tarzan'' yell on Thursday.
   School children and elderly vacationers looked around expecting
to see a group of noisy teens or someone dressed up like Edgar Rice
Burroughs' jungle hero.
   What they found was comedienne Carol Burnett emerging from a
news conference where she had just donated the charwoman costume
she made famous on her television program to the museum's History
of American Entertainment collection.
   ``I feel very proud,'' she said at the ceremony. ``This is a
ten, a definite ten.''
   A native of San Antonio, Miss Burnett developed the Tarzan yell
as a child and it has become one of her professional trademarks.
   ``I wish some of my folks were here,'' she said, ``especialy, my
grandmother who raised me. This would be a kick for her.''
   The costume consists of a plaid wool skirt, yellow checkered
apron, flower print blouse, a red bandana, a ragged brown sweater,
a mopcap, white gloves, sweat socks and high-top army boots.
   The charwoman character was created for Miss Burnett's 1963
television special, ``Carol & Company,'' in which the ragged
cleaning lady performed a modified strip-tease in her work clothes.
   Miss Burnett developed the skit after she heard a radio disc
jockey allude to the fact that some American housewives were fond
of practicing a strip-tease to David Rose's ``The Stripper'' while
doing their chores.
   ``It thought maybe I should do a charwoman cleaning up in a
burlesque house after everyone is gone and then imagines she's
Gypsy Rose Lee,'' Miss Burnett said. ``All I really took off was
the sweater and one long glove _ I decided there was enough
violence on TV.''
   The character, which the actress said never had a name or fully
developed persona, became as signature figure on her comdey-variety
TV series which ran from 1967 to 1978.
   Reminded that the gowns of the first ladies were also in the
Smithsonian, Miss Burnett said, ``Maybe we'll call her First
Charwoman.''

<TEXT>
   People infected by the AIDS virus may be more
likely to go on to develop the deadly disease if they also are
infected by a related virus that can cause a particularly fatal
form of leukemia, a study says.
   ``These laboratory results suggest that doubly infected
individuals have a worse prognosis for developing AIDS'' than those
who are infected only by the AIDS virus, said molecular virologist
Irvin S.Y. Chen, who published his study in Friday's issue of the
journal Science.
   ``The chances of any individual being infected by both viruses
are very slim, but among selected populations, such as intravenous
drug abusers, the chances are quite high,'' said Chen, of the
University of California, Los Angeles.
   Except among IV drug abusers, the leukemia virus is quite rare
in the United States. It is fairly common in southern Japan, the
Caribbean and parts of Africa, Chen said. So the study suggests
that people in those areas may be more likely to develop
full-fledged AIDS if they are exposed to the AIDS virus.
   But more study of people infected by both viruses must be done
to confirm the suspicion raised by laboratory studies, said Dr.
Stanley H. Weiss, chief of AIDS epidemiology at New Jersey Medical
School in Newark. Weiss is already undertaking such research in the
Newark and New York area.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which usually remains dormant in
infected people for years before it may be activated to cause
full-fledged AIDS, which cripples the disease-fighting immune
system.
   Previous studies suggested almost any infection may help trigger
the dormant AIDS virus into an active killer.
   Chen and his colleagues performed experiments in laboratory
culture dishes showing that AIDS-infected white blood cells called
T cells produce large amounts of active AIDS virus if the cells
also are exposed to the human T-cell leukemia virus type I, or
HTLV-I.
   People infected by HTLV-I have a 1 percent lifetime chance of
developing a blood cancer called adult T-cell leukemia, which often
kills quickly. It is an important cause of leukemia in southern
Japan and the Caribbean. HTLV-I also is linked to a potentially
fatal, degenerative nerve disease that causes spasticity and
paralysis of the legs.
   Last month, the American Red Cross recommended that all donated
blood be tested for HTLV-I as soon as scientists develop a
practical test. A Red Cross study found about one out of every
4,286 units of donated blood carries HTLV-I. The risk of AIDS virus
in blood has been reduced to about one in 40,000 units because
donors are tested for signs of AIDS infection.
   A study performed by Weiss when he worked for the National
Cancer Institute showed HTLV-I is spreading among intravenous drug
abusers, with infection rates of 12 percent among New Jersey
addicts, 33 percent among New Orleans addicts overall, and 49
percent among black addicts in New Orleans.
   Intravenous drug addicts also are high risk for infection by the
AIDS virus, which also is spread in blood on shared needles and by
sexual contact.
   Infection by HTLV-I apparently activates the AIDS virus by
stimulating AIDS-infected white blood cells to divide, according to
the study Chen performed with molecular virologists Jerome Zack,
Alan Cann and James Lugo.
   While the study in Science deals only with HTLV-I, unpublished
laboratory results suggest full-fledged AIDS also may be triggered
in AIDS-infected people who also are infected by HTLV-II, an
extremely rare virus that can cause another type of leukemia.
   The AIDS virus is distantly related to the leukemia viruses.
   Dr. Edward L. Murphy Jr., a National Cancer Institute expert on
HTLV-I, agreed with Chen that the problem of dual infection by the
AIDS and leukemia viruses is mainly a problem for U.S. drug addicts
and for people in areas such as the Caribbean.

<HEAD>Archaeology Student Finds King Tut Hoard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A student rediscovered a forgotten hoard of grain,
dried fruit, spices and insects from the 3,300-year-old tomb of the
Egyptian King Tutankhamun, archaeologists said Thursday.
   ``It obviously is extremely important archaelogically because
it's a very large amount of material,'' said John Evans, director
of the University of London's Institute of Archaeology.
   ``Very little work has been done on material of this period in
Egypt, and I understand that some of the species which have been
identified are, in fact, the earliest occurrences,'' Evans said at
a news conference.
   Most of the discovery consists of the food placed in
Tutankhamun's tomb to sustain him on his journey to the afterlife.
Scientists said the material is well preserved and could provide
best evidence to date of the diet and lifestyle of the Egyptians at
the time of Tutankhamun's death in 1323 B.C.
   For more than 50 years, the hoard has lain undisturbed in 30
cardboard boxes in a musty storeroom at the Royal Botanical
Gardens. The specimens were sent in 1932 by Howard Carter, the
British archaeologist who discovered Tutankhamun's treasure-laden
tomb in the Valleys of the Kings at Luxor, Egypt, in 1922.
   They were to have been cataloged by the botanist Leonard Boodle.
But Boodle and Carter both died in the 1930s before the work could
be completed, and the specimens were stored in boxes labeled ``From
Ancient Egypt.''
   In February of this year, the material was turned over to a
French graduate student at the archaelogical institute, 23-year-old
Christian Tutundjian de Vartavan, for research leading to a
master's degree in archaeobotany, the institute's speciality.
   He recognized notations on the boxes as those of Carter,
providing the first clue that they might be from Tutankhamun's
tomb. Scientific analysis confirmed his theory and eventually
fragments were matched with photographs taken by Carter.
   ``It all fit in. It was beyond coincidence,'' said
archaeobotanist Gordon Hillmann, who supervised the student's work.
Tutundjian de Vartavan did not attend the news conference.
   Professor David Harris, director of the archaeology institute's
Department of Human Environment, said the announcement was delayed
until it had completed scientific analysis.
   ``We were anxious to announce it as soon as possible, lest it
should leak out, but we felt we had to keep it under wraps as long
as possible, so that we could get as much work accomplished as we
could,'' Harris said.
   He acknowledged that one reason for the secrecy was concern that
the Egyptian government might demand possession before the
institute had completed its analysis.
   Last week, the institute informed the Egyptian Embassy in London
about the discovery and offered to return the material. As of
Thursday, the institute had received no reply, Harris said.
   The hoard includes fragments of funeral wreaths and more than
five pounds of seeds, fruits and spices placed in Tutankhamun's
tomb, Harris said.
   Among identified species are emmer wheat for making bread on the
journey, barley for brewing beer, a large quantity of watermelon
seeds to chew on, coriander, fenugreek, black cumin, sesame seeds,
two kinds of juniper berries, grapes and a datelike fruit known as
a jujube.
   The grains, fruits and seeds were intended as raw materials that
figurines known as shawabtis found in the tomb would cultivate into
food needed by the ``ka'' _ one of the king's souls _ in the
afterlife, Harris said.
   Dr. Ken Thomas, a specialist in insects, said the remains of
thousands of beetles also had been identified. The foods were to
sustain the boy king through eternity, Thomas said, ``but the
insects got through first and had a pretty good crack at them.''
   The find represents only a fraction of the food buried in the
tomb. Harris said the remainder is in 110 to 120 original wicker
baskets and several pottery jars in the Cairo Museum and the Dokki
Agricultural Museum in Egypt.

   NASA scientists who bounced radio waves
off cloud-shrouded Venus detected huge blobs that may be lava flows
and rings that may be volcanic crater rims, both very bright and
possibly rich in fool's gold, a new study says.
   The study provides more evidence that Venus' volcanoes erupted
within the last few million years and possibly within recent
centuries, said researchers from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Their findings appear in Friday's issue of the journal Science,
coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Pioneer
Venus orbiter, a spacecraft that still circles the second planet
from the sun.
   JPL radar scientists Ray Jurgens and Martin Slade and geologist
R. Stephen Saunders transmitted radio waves from Goldstone to
Venus' equatorial region. Half the waves bounced back to three
210-foot-diameter, dish-shaped antennas at the Mojave Desert
facility.
   The fuzzy radar pictures revealed bright, or highly reflective,
rings of material on the surface, as well as bright blobs.
   The largest blob, measuring 350 miles long and 180 miles wide,
apparently is a large lava flow and has a large mound, possibly a
volcano, at its west end, Jurgens said.
   The largest ring is roughly 60 miles across and appears to be
the rim of a crater caused by a meteorite impact. But other rings
about 18 miles across may be rims of large volcanic craters called
calderas, he said.
   The researchers speculate the blobs and rings are so highly
reflective to radar because the lava flows and crater rims are rich
in iron pyrite or other metallic minerals blasted to the surface of
the planet by volcanic eruptions or meteorite impacts. Iron pyrite
is known as fool's gold because it looks like gold.
   Because fool's gold or other metallic minerals should decompose
and lose their reflectivity over time, the discovery ``certainly is
evidence of relatively recent volcanism,'' since old craters lack
bright rings, Jurgens said.
   It isn't possible to say whether ``recent'' means within the
last few million years or last few centuries because researchers
don't know how quickly rocks break down on Venus, said Jurgens and
Saunders, who is project scientist for the Magellan Venus Radar
Mapper spacecraft, set for launch next April.
   Radar readings from Pioneer suggested volcanoes existed on
Venus. Previous radar pictures made from Earth and by Soviet
spacecraft in 1983 revealed lava flows, volcanic craters and
craters from meteorite impacts.
   But researchers don't know if volcanoes still are active on the
planet, which is covered by thick, acid-laden carbon dioxide clouds
that prevent direct observation by telescopes.
   In 1984, scientists announced that Pioneer detected lightning
bolts and a 50-fold increase in sulfur dioxide concentrations in
Venus' atmosphere after 1978. Because lightning and sulfur dioxide
can be caused by eruptions, the discoveries suggested a gargantuan
volcano may have erupted shortly before 1978.
   Other studies also found highly reflective features on Venus'
mountains, but scientists debated whether the brightness was from
volcanic metallic minerals or simply artificial brightness created
by rough landscape.
   The blobs and rings found by the JPL study are the first highly
reflective features discovered on Venusian lowlands, and thus
support the theory that the brightness is caused by metallic
minerals, Jurgens said.
   ``It's a good working hypothesis to say these (blobs) are young
lava flows,'' but the radar images aren't good enough to determine
which rings are volcanic craters and which are impact craters, said
Harold Masursky, a planetary geologist with the U.S. Geological
Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz.
   ``We'll settle this argument with Magellan,'' which is scheduled
to reach Venus in August 1990 and map most of the planet using
radar, he said.
   ``Some of the big volcanoes on Venus may still be active, which
would be ... interesting,'' Masursky said. ``The only other places
we have ongoing volcanism are the Earth and (Jupiter's moon) Io.''

   A high-ranking State Department official on
Thursday criticized plans by retreating Soviet forces to leave up
to $1 billion in equipment and facilities for the Kabul government,
and reaffirmed the U.S. intention to continue backing the Afghan
rebels.
   ``There have been indications that we have picked up that the
intention of the Soviets to turn over equipment and facilities will
be on a fairly large scale,'' said Michael H. Armacost,
undersecretary of state for political affairs.
   ``We've heard estimates ranging from a half a billion to $1
billion worth of equipment and, or, installations and facilities,''
he added. ``That doesn't strike me as a demonstration of tremendous
restraint.''
   He was referring to statements by Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, the
Soviet commander in Afghanistan, that the value of Soviet bases and
equipment left behind after the withdrawal would be 600 million
rubles, the equivalent of $1 billion.
   During negotiations that led to the Soviet agreement in Geneva
to withdraw its estimated 115,000 Red Army troops from Afghanistan,
Armacost and other U.S. officials proposed a mutual phase-out of
superpower military assistance to the Soviet-backed Kabul
government and U.S.-supported mujahadeen.
   The Soviets rejected the offer, but the United States kept its
promise on the table, saying it would match Soviet restraint with
``symmetrical'' reductions in aid to the mujahadeen. Otherwise,
U.S. support to the rebels would continue.
   Armacost said on Thursday, ``I would recall, simply, what we
said at the time we signed the Geneva agreement: that we retain the
right to support our friends. We will exercise the right in the
event the Soviets continue to supply equipment to Kabul. And we'll
have practical ways of accomplishing that purpose.''
   Armacost made the comments to reporters while outlining various
regional issues President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev are likely to discuss at their Moscow summit, May 29-June
2.
   He declined to predict whether Gorbachev would ask Reagan to
help ease the Soviet withdrawal by advising the mujahadeen to
refrain from harassing Red Army forces. As the first Soviet unit
crossed into its homeland on Wednesday, there were reports that
guerrilla attacks were continuing.
   ``The position we've taken on that has been generally that a
prompt timetable would be one which is more likely to elicit
cooperation from the mujahadeen.'' Armacost said. Beyond that, the
best way to protect withdrawing forces from attack is to make
``local arrangements'' with guerrilla groups, he said.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, the Afghan accord was criticized as
betrayal of the resistance and an invitation to chaos and civil war.
   With the superpowers continuing the arms flow, ``What's to
prevent a continuing series of civil wars?'' Rep. Chester Atkins,
D-Mass., said at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Asian and Pacfic affairs.
   ``My fear is we are going to see a continung inferno in
Afghanistan that in time will lead to some kind of Soviet presence
unacceptable to the United States,'' Atkins said.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., also said he was concerned about
the ``apparent contradiction'' in the United States and Soviet
Union vowing to halt ``interference'' in Afghan affairs while at
the same time reserving the right to aid the rival factions.
   Dan Burton, R-Ind., declared his ``disgust'' that ``our State
Department with its appeasement policy has settled for half a loaf.
... There is no substitute for victory and they (Afghan resistance)
were well on their way to victory. We stopped them short of it.''
   With the removal of Afghanistan as the No.1 issue on Reagan's
list of regional confrontations with the Soviets, more attention is
likely to be given at the summit to conflicts in southern Africa
and Cambodia.
   Armacost said he was optimistic about the prospects for progress
in resolving conflicts in southern Africa, in part because of what
he termed ``quite successful'' talks recently among officials from
the United States, Angola, South Africa and Cuba.
   The United States is seeking a formula under which all Cuban
troops _ estimated at up to 45,000 _ would be withdrawn from
Angola, and South Africa would turn over Namibia to an independent
government.
   Armacost said the United States is hopeful that the Soviets will
use their influence with Cuba and Angola, but he expressed concern
that a reported increase in the number of Cubans in Angola might
set back the process.
   To lay the groundwork for discussion of the issues at the
summit, Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker was in
Portugal on Thursday winding up talks with a Soviet deputy foreign
minister, Anatoly Adamishin.
   Armacost reiterated administration views that the regional issue
most ripe for settlement is the restoration of a neutral Cambodia,
which is controlled by an estimated 120,000 Vietnamese troops.
Vietnam, which is beset by major economic problems, has stated its
intention to withdraw its forces in the early 1990s.
   ``The principal things we would like to see from the Soviets
here are that they press Hanoi to accelerate the timetable for
their withdrawal,'' the official said. He also said the Soviets
should talk directly with Prince Sihanouk, who represents the
anti-Vietnamese factions.

<HEAD>Byrd Renews Call For Meese To Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
on Thursday renewed his call for the resignation of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III and said that if Meese doesn't quit, ``the
president ought to do it for him.''
   Meese has launched a counterattack against his critics and has
told conservatives that he won't quit in the absence of evidence of
wrongdoing.
   Byrd, asked about Meese's comments, said, ``I think Mr. Meese
ought to resign.''
   ``The perception is that there's a great loss of morale'' at the
Justice Department because of the ongoing investigations of Meese,
said Byrd.
   Later, Byrd said again that Meese should go and added, ``if he
doesn't do it, the president ought to do it for him.''
   Byrd was commenting a day after Meese met with conservative
senators to say again that he wouldn't quit.
   A Senate subcommittee report issued earlier this month accused
Meese of violating a White House policy by helping the
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   In addition, independent counsel James McKay has been conducting
a criminal investigation of Meese's involvement with Wedtech and
other matters. McKay is expected to issue a report within several
weeks which will raise ethical quetions about the behavior of
Meese, according to sources familiar with the investigation.
   According to Byrd, Meese and any occupants of high political
office should be willing to resign if their actions put their
offices ``under a cloud.''
   A president should tell his top appointees that ``if your
actions are such to put the office under a cloud, you'll have to
leave,'' Byrd said. He suggested that is what had occurred with
Meese.

   Toupee, or not toupee? That was the
question as a TV weatherman decided public opinion would determine
whether he should wear his hairpiece on the air.
   More than 3,900 of those who participated in the call-in poll by
station WFRV said they thought meteorologist Tom Mahoney should
remove the toupee he had worn on the air for six years, while more
than 2,800 said he should leave it on.
   Mahoney told viewers he thought he looked better with the
hairpiece, but felt better without it. To facilitate the viewers'
decision, he showed a picture of himself both with and without the
hairpiece.
   With the polls results in, he removed the hairpiece Wednesday.
News director Gerry Jensen said it will be auctioned off to benefit
a charity.

<HEAD>Sequoyah Plant Shut Down After Problem Develops In Non-Nuclear
Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, which
resumed power production last week after more than 2{ years, shut
down Thursday because a problem developed on the non-nuclear side
of the plant, officials said.
   Herb Abercrombie, Sequoyah site director, said the Unit 2
reactor automatically shut down after a level control valve caused
a problem in the feed water system.
   A Tennessee Valley Authority investigative team was looking into
the cause of the valve problem. Abercrombie said all emergency
systems functioned properly and the plant shut down safely.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was notified.
   TVA nuclear chief Steven A. White said he wants to make sure all
equipment is functioning properly before the plant is brought back
on line.
   TVA's nuclear program was idle for 2{ years because of safety
concerns.
   Sequoyah was generating power at about 73 percent of capacity
when the reactor was shut down at 2:15 p.m. Minutes before that,
White had said at a news conference that he expected the plant to
reach 100 percent production by Saturday.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham says he is unfazed
that a morality clause at Brigham Young University prevents him
from speaking there.
   ``I don't get too upset about anything,'' Mecham said Wednesday.
``It was just a group of young Republicans who wanted me to speak.
If they have a policy, they have a policy, and I won't speak.''
   The policy says that to appear at BYU, which is owned by the
Mormon Church, a speaker ``must not, in his or her personal life
(as reflected in the news media and common understanding of the
public), have committed acts of immorality, dishonesty or other
conduct that would make it inappropriate for the Church Education
System to feature him or her as a speaker. His or her life and
advice should make an appropriate model for students in an
educational system with our ideals.''
   Mecham, a Mormon, had been scheduled to speak at the Provo,
Utah, campus on May 26 or 27, in an appearance sponsored by Campus
Republicans, a student group.
   ``We do not allow to speak on campus people who are not worthy
examples,'' said Brad Hanesworth, a communications professor who is
the Campus Republicans' faculty adviser. ``I thought it was clear
that he did not meet the criteria'' on which speakers may appear at
BYU.
   ``We haven't decided that Evan Mecham is guilty, but now is not
the appropriate time for him to appear on campus,'' said Brent
Harker, a university spokesman.
   Harker pointed out Mecham is under indictment. Jury selection
began Thursday in Phoenix, Ariz., in Mecham's criminal trial on
charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   ``When a person is involved in (a court case), if he comes to
speak, that would imply an endorsement by the university,'' Harker
said. ``People would say, `Oh, he's speaking at BYU. They must
think he's OK.'''
   Mecham, 64, was impeached by the state House in February and
removed from office by the state Senate April 4.
   He could face up to 22 years in prison if he is convicted in the
criminal trial on all six felony counts on charges of perjury,
filing false documents and fraud.

   State-sponsored death squads and terrorist groups
are blocking economic development in Central America, southern
Africa and the Philippines, speakers at an international conference
said Thursday.
   ``People like agricultural extension workers will not go out
into rural areas organizing people into agricultural programs if by
doing so they are branded as communists and are liable to be
harassed, attacked and even murdered,'' said Ian Linden, general
secretary of the Catholic Institute for International Relations.
   Linden said the independent charity sponsored the two-day
conference on the ``growing phenomenon'' of development projects
shut down by death squads and vigilante groups. He said such
shutdowns, which had occurred in the Philippines, southern Africa
and Central America, had created anxieties in many development
agencies including the Catholic Institute.
   In Mozambique, a member of the country's ruling Politburo said
South African-backed death squads were ``destroying Mozambique's
potential for independent, self-sustaining economic development.''
   Jorge Rebelo blamed South African-sponsored attacks for severe
food shortages.
   A Haitian priest said ``repression and terror'' by
state-sponsored death squads remain the reality in his nation, the
Western hemisphere's poorest country.
   The Rev. Freud Jean, who is general secretary of the Roman
Catholic church's National Commission of Justice and Peace, said
there is no possibility for development if people continue to be
terrorized by the paramilitary Tonton Macoutes, which started
operating with backing from former President Francois Duvalier 30
years ago.
   In the Philippines, there is a growing perception that active
church members, anti-nuclear activists and proponents of agrarian
reform are communists or radicals, said a Philippine human rights
advocate.
   Dr. Maria Serena I. Diokno, head of the National Movement to
Disband Vigilantes, said these people and farmers have little
chance for judicial recourse if they are harmed because vigilante
groups enjoy government sanction.
   Mrs. Diokno said ``massive poverty and inequality, which cause
and nurture insurgency, must be attacked from the roots.''
   Author and university lecturer Jorge Caceres Prendes said that
in Central America, economic development has been hindered not only
by state-sponsored terrorism but by the continued U.S. intervention
in the region.
   Linden said virtually every speaker provided evidence that
national security forces are sponsoring vigilante groups and death
squads ``in one way or another.''
   Some speakers, such as Caceres, said one solution to these
paramilitary forces is for governments to be held accountable to
world opinion. Others called for threatened groups to form their
own self-defense units.
   But Linden said: ``Obviously the solution is going to be along
the lines of strengthening poor communities with education, with
community organanization and with the type of development projects
that will ... give them the courage and the mutual trust and the
solidarity among themselves to withstand some of these assualts.''

<TEXT>
   Israeli officials in the occupied territories
have jailed one out of every 200 Arab men over the age of 18 for
six months without trial, a legislator said Thursday.
   In addition to the 1,900 jailed under emergency regulations
requiring no trial or specific charges, another 8,100 Palestinians
are in prison awaiting trial or serving sentences for specific
actions, left-wing legislator Dedi Zucker said.
   ``The scale of the arrests shows the political echelon has lost
all control over the situation,'' Zucker, of the Citizens Rights
Movement, alleged.
   Army and Defense Ministry officials refused comment, saying only
they were checking Zucker's figures.
   Chief military prosecutor Brig. Gen. Amnon Strachnov said last
week that 5,000 Palestinians were jailed since the start of the
Arab uprising on Dec. 8. Of those, 1,700 were being held without
trial, he said.
   But former Cabinet member Amnon Rubinstein of the Center
Movement told Israel radio that close to 2,000 Palestinians were
being held without trial.
   Rubinstein, a law professor, also criticized authorities for
abolishing a legal safeguard that required administrative detainees
to appear before a judge within four days of their arrest.
   The requirement was scrapped when the number of administrative
detainees skyrocketed during the uprising, and Rubinstein demanded
reinstatement.
   Israeli officials have said the mass arrests have helped calm
the violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Also Thursday, the American-born director of the Jerusalem
Visitors Information Bureau, a Palestinian information service,
said she visited a village of 6,000 near the West Bank town of
Ramallah that was raided by Israeli troops for three straight days
this week.
   Lesley Abukhater, originally of Louisville, Ky., said she saw
five Arab homes with broken furniture and windows in the village of
Beita Laqya, and the owners told her Israeli troops were
responsible for the damage.
   She said six villagers were arrested in the raids and that local
residents said many people were beaten.
   Mrs. Abukhater said Beit Laqya apparently was targeted because
it is a so-called ``liberated'' village, meaning Arab residents
have blocked off roads to outsiders and fly the Palestinian flag,
outlawed in Israel.
   Two other ``liberated'' villages near Ramallah were raided
Wednesday, and one Palestinian was killed and 10 wounded, hospital
officials said. About 300 Arabs were detained.
   Zucker said that before the Arab uprising began, only about 70
Palestinians were held without trial under emergency regulations at
any one time.
   He said the present detainees were denied special privileges,
including access to radio, television and newspapers, that they are
supposed to enjoy since their detention is viewed as a preventive
measure instead of punishment.
   Zucker said he also conducted a random study of 3,300 Arabs held
for six months without trial and determined the average age of the
detainee was 25. Fifteen percent of the detainees were between the
ages of 16 and 21, while 58 percent were between 21 and 30 years
old.
   In other developments:
   _ The West Bank's military government permitted the
reunification of 40 Palestinian families as a goodwill gesture.
   The military government applies stringent standards in issuing
residency permits, for example often only granting temporary
tourist visas to the foreign-born spouses of West Bank residents.
As result, hundreds of Palestinian families are separated.
   _ In Tel Aviv, a district court judge rejected a motion to
release from custody four staff members of the ultra left-wing
newspaper Derech Hanitzotz.
   The four were jailed for unspecified security offenses.
Providing the first details on the case, the court said Thursday
the prosecution presented evidence the defendants were members of a
hostile organization, Israel radio reported.

   Interior Minister Tomas Borge was
quoted Thursday as saying a Nicaraguan journalist penetrated the
CIA as a Sandinista counter-intelligence agent.
   The reporter was identified as Maria Lourdes Pallais Checa, a
graduate of Columbia University in New York.
   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada quoted Borge as saying that
she was ``a counter-intelligence agent who worked in enemy ranks.''
   It said he made the remarks Sunday at an appearance on the
remote Caribbean coast of Nicaragua.
   Barricada said Pallais had lived for five years in the United
States and had been employed by various American and European news
organizations.
   (Pallais worked for The Associated Press in New York from August
1978 until November 1979, first on the editing desk of the Latin
American service and later in the New York City bureau.)
   Borge was quoted as saying: ``She carried out missions in the
heart of the CIA.''
   ``Some have been there for several years and continue there;
others we have been forced to take out of there for different
reasons, and one by one they will continue to be claimed back by
our people,'' he said.
   No one answered the telephone at Pallais' home in Managua
Thursday.
   Pallais' brother, Marcel Pallais Checa, a supporter of the
Sandinista National Liberation Front, was killed by the National
Guard of then-President Anastasio Somoza during the 1978-79
revolutionary war.
   (Pallais resigned from the AP in 1979, saying she wanted to
investigate her brother's death and help care for her ill mother.)
   The Sandinistas came to power in July 1979, ending 42 years of
rule by the rightist, pro-American Somoza dynasty.

   The method a smoker chooses to try to kick the
habit is less important than a doctor's firm advice and the
long-term support of others, a new survey says.
   ``There is no single intervention method clearly more effective
for all people than the other methods,'' said Dr. Thomas K. Kottke,
a Mayo Clinic heart specialist and co-author of the survey.
   He and his colleagues on the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
reviewed 39 studies of ways to stop smoking. Those techniques
ranged from ``one-shot'' strategies such as sensory deprivation and
injections, to combinations of techniques such as physician
counseling, nicotine gum and behavorial therapy.
   ``Success was not associated with novel or unusual
interventions,'' the team reported in Friday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   ``It was the product of personalized smoking-cessation advice
and assistance, repeated in different forms by several sources over
the longest feasible period.''
   Most effective were approaches in which physicians and
counselors worked with smokers, and the smokers also attended
stop-smoking groups and perhaps used booklets, videotapes and
homework, Kottke said.
   Nicotine gum was also helpful, though not everyone can use it,
he said.
   After a six-month period, such programs achieved a success rate
37 percent above that for individuals trying to quit on their own,
he said.
   Least effective, and often costly as well, were one-time
techniques such as sensory deprivation treatments, he said.
   A related report in the Chicago-based medical journal said a
blood-pressure drug called clonidine has been shown effective in
reducing the craving to smoke.
   Seventy-one heavy smokers who had tried unsuccessfully to quit
were recruited for the study.
   Thirty-three took clonidine and 38 took a tablet containing no
medication. Neither group knew what it was taking. All subjects
also underwent behavioral therapy.
   Six months after discontinuing medication, 27 percent of the
clonidine subjects reported they were still not smoking compared
with 5 percent of those who took the placebo, the researchers said.
   Clonidine, also marketed as Catapres, inhibits some of the
action of the nervous system and has previously been shown to
reduce opiate and alcohol withdrawal symptoms, the study said.
   Its success in helping people quit smoking is similar to that
reported with nicotine gum, but clonidine may eventually prove
superior because it doesn't perpetuate nicotine dependence, the
study suggested.
   But the researchers said larger studies over longer periods are
needed before it becomes a standard treatment.
   One surprising finding, according to Dr. Alexander H. Glassman
of Columbia University in New York, was that 61 percent of the
subjects had suffered from major depression at some time in their
past.
   People who have made several attempts to stop smoking and failed
often believe they have a ``moral weakness,'' the study said.
   But its findings suggest ``that for many smokers who try to stop
and cannot, the problem is not a moral one but rather an associated
vulnerability between affective (mood) disorder and nicotine.''

   Wilberforce, a black and white tomcat who was a
companion to four British prime ministers after straying into
Downing Street in 1973, died in his sleep Thursday at the age of 15.
   The feline, often seen lounging on the front doorstep of the
prime minister's official residence at No. 10 Downing St.,
developed a reputation for being ``the best mouser in Britain.''
   Wilberforce was found during the tenure of Edward Heath, and
served as a mouse-catcher and pet for successive administrations.
   ``He received lots of mail, people wanting to know how he was,
wish him luck,'' and the Downing Street staff answered for him, a
staff spokesman said.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher talked to Wilberforce when she
encountered him in the corridors of power, and she gave him a
special farewell present when he retired to a private home at an
undisclosed location in Essex, northeast of London, more than a
year ago.
   One of his last meals at Downing Street was a tasty tin of the
best Soviet pilchards _ a kind of herring _ picked out specially by
Mrs. Thatcher at a Moscow supermarket during a tour of the Soviet
Union.
   Mrs. Thatcher was saddened by the news of Wilberforce's death,
which was given to her at the end of a morning Cabinet meeting, her
press office said.
   Wilberforce will be buried near his home, the office said. He
had no known survivors.

<HEAD>Say Cheese: Museum Will Open With Pork Barrel Funding</HEAD>

   The new exhibit deals with a product that
comes from cows, but to many lawmakers it's just plain pork: The
New York State Museum of Cheese opened Thursday.
   Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann was scheduled to preside over the
ribbon cutting for perhaps the state's most notorious pork-barrel
project.
   The museum was developed with the help of money tucked into the
state budget at Hoffmann's request. The $425,000 museum received
$175,000 over the past three years from the state Legislature's
pork barrel, with the rest of the cost coming mainly from local
sources in this central New York community.
   The museum is housed in the former Weeks and Merry Cheese
Factory, which shipped cheese to England a century ago. The
building was moved from nearby Verona to Erie Canal Village here, a
re-creation of a mid-19th century Erie Canal community.
   Cheese-making tools and equipment, including curd knives, cheese
forms and a cheese press, were collected from barns and old cheese
factories across the state.
   While almost everyone else calls it pork barrel spending,
legislators and Gov. Mario Cuomo refer to the allocations such as
the ones to the museum as ``member items'' or ``legislative
initiatives.''
   The items, proposed by individual legislators, are reviewed by
the state budget division but in general don't get the kind of
scrutiny that major spending items do.
   Hoffmann, who admits that ``the Cheese Museum sounded kind of
funny the first time I heard it, too,'' said the project makes
``good economic sense'' for Rome, which lost more than 50 percent
of its manufacturing jobs in the last decade.
   ``The people of Rome have experienced three years of being the
brunt of everybody's joke and recurring stories about pork barrel
spending,'' said Hoffmann, a Syracuse Democrat.
   ``The cheese musem is something of which they are enormously
proud,'' she said.
   She added that she hopes the publicity ``can be turned into an
advertising plus for the tourist industry being developed by Rome.''
   Meanwhile, ``cheese museum'' continues to be synonymous with
``pork barrel'' and the brunt of jokes in the state capital, Albany.
   Even Cuomo got a few guffaws Wednesday when asked why he wasn't
attending the ceremony.
   ``I gave (scheduling aide Larry) Belinsky some beef when I found
out I was going to be in New York City instead of the cheese
museum,'' said Cuomo, who will be watching his chief of staff,
Gerald Crotty, receive an award from a citizens' group. ``It was a
close call, the cheese museum or Crotty.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Thursday
rejected indirect White House criticism of his refusal to accept a
U.S. Middle East peace plan and blamed Arab leaders for blocking
peace talks.
   Shamir did not directly criticize the Reagan administration for
issuing a statement that also praised his political rival, Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres, who supports the U.S. plan.
   But leaders of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc accused the White
House of interfering in Israel's domestic affairs, and warned such
actions would backfire in Israel's November election.
   ``This will just strengthen the Likud because we don't want to
be a banana republic,'' Likud legislator David Magen was quoted as
saying by the domestic Itim news agency.
   The White House statement, issued after a meeting in Washington
on Tuesday between Peres and President Reagan, praised Peres for
``the courage and wisdom to say yes when real opportunities arise.''
   In an oblique reference to Shamir, the statement criticized
``those leaders who are negative, consistently reject new ideas and
fail to exploit realistic opportunities to bring about
negotiations, make progress impossible. In the end, they will have
to answer to their own people for the suffering that will
inevitably result.''
   Labor and Likud have governed in a fragile coalition since 1984,
but the alliance has all but disintegrated because of the dispute
over the Middle East peace process.
   Peres backs the U.S. plan which calls for an international
conference to launch direct talks between the parties to the
conflict. The plan also provides for talks on a final settlement to
begin by the end of 1988.
   Shamir objects to the international conference and to setting a
timetable for negotiations.
   Responding to the White House statement Thursday, Shamir said he
did not believe it was directed at him.
   ``I think that if there are elements in the Middle East who
reject peace, who avoid peace talks, it's the Arab leaders,''
Shamir was quoted as saying by Israel army radio.
   Shamir also said he hoped the United States would continue its
policy of not interfering in Israel's internal affairs.
   Likud leaders, meanwhile, criticized Peres, saying he should be
recalled to Israel and had no authority to speak for the Israeli
government.
   Peres told Israel radio that ``we should always ask what's good
for the state, not what's good for the Likud. I think this was a
trip with important possibilities during which we explained
Israel's position in a positive way.''
   Peres was scheduled to return to Israel Friday after a two-week
trip that included stops in Hungary, Spain and the United States.
   Shamir also criticized Peres for meeting Tuesday in Washington
with Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States.
   Shamir demands that the Soviet Union establish diplomatic ties
with Israel before getting involved in the Middle East peace
process. Moscow cut the ties after the 1967 Middle East war.
   Peres told Israel radio an intensive dialogue with the Soviet
Union is in Israel's interest.

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham, removed from
office last month by impeachment conviction, went on trial Thursday
on criminal charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   About 100 prospective jurors were sworn in during the brief
opening session at Maricopa County Superior Court. Mecham did not
attend.
   ``I haven't broken any laws,'' he said Wednesday. ``I looked at
the laws. My attorney looked at the laws. We've had experts look at
the laws. We haven't broken any of them.''
   Mecham and his brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, Willard
Mecham, are charged with perjury, willful concealment and filing
false documents for failing to report a $350,000 campaign loan from
a developer.
   Mecham, 64, could face up to 22 years in prison if convicted of
all six felony counts. His brother could be sentenced to up to 9{
years if convicted of the three counts he faces.
   The former governor's attorney, Michael Scott, said Mecham
probably will attend court sessions next week, after the pool of
prospective jurors is narrowed and questioning of individuals
begins.
   Thursday, those in the jury pool were given a questionnaire
worked out by the prosecution, defense and trial Judge Michael Ryan
and designed to identify anyone biased for or against the former
governor.
   ``Please do not withhold any information in order to be seated
on this jury,'' Ryan told the prospective jurors.
   Thursday's session lasted about 15 minutes, and the prospective
jurors left as they completed the questionnaires. There were few
spectators besides reporters.
   The 99 questions included whether the panelists know anyone
involved in the case; whether they signed or circulated petitions
for or against Mecham while he was governor; whether they belong to
the John Birch Society; whether they have bumper stickers on their
cars. Also, they were asked whether they knew anyone on a long list
of people associated with Mecham or his criminal case.
   After the initial screening, the remaining prospective jurors
are to be called back for questioning Tuesday or later next week.
   On Wednesday, a state Supreme Court justice refused a defense
request to delay the trial until the high court considers a defense
motion to return the charges to the grand jury. The Supreme Court
is to hear arguments on that issue June 1.
   Evan Mecham has refused to predict whether he will fare better
in court than at his impeachment trial. The state Senate removed
the Republican governor April 4, 15 months into his first term by
convicting him of two impeachment counts.
   Prosecutors said the Mechams failed to report the $350,000 loan
from Tempe developer Barry Wolfson on personal or campaign
financial statements until after a newspaper reported the
contribution in October 1987.
   The defense filed two new motions released Thursday, one to
dismiss the charges based on a claim that the campaign and personal
finance reporting laws are unconstitutionally ``vague, ambiguous,
imprecise and overbroad.''
   The other asks that the charges be remanded to the grand jury
for a new finding of whether probable cause exists. That motion
argued that grand jury materials were improperly turned over to the
prosecutors in Mecham's Senate impeachment trial.
   The defense contended it was denied access to grand jury
transcripts, but the impeachment prosecutors were given documents
by the attorney general's office. However, officials have said
those documents were not transcripts of grand jury testimony.
   Ryan did not immediately schedule arguments on the motions.
   Assistant Attorney General Barnett Lotstein, co-prosecutor in
the criminal trial, said some of the defense requests were
``laser-beam mentality motions.'' The remark referred to Mecham's
claim earlier this year that Attorney General Bob Corbin's office
was using laser beams to eavesdrop on conversations in the
governor's office. Corbin denied doing so.
   Mecham was convicted in the Senate of trying to thwart a death
threat investigation and of misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund by loaning the money to his auto dealership.
   He also was impeached on charges of concealing the $350,000
loan, but the Senate decided not to consider that charge for fear
of prejudicing Mecham's criminal trial.

<HEAD>Baseball Players Prompt Suggestion that Right-handers Live Longer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of lifespans of baseball players leads two
doctors to suggest that right-handed people may live slightly
longer than left-handers.
   In a letter published Thursday in the science magazine Nature,
they said they studied The Baseball Encyclopedia and found that
right-handers averaged a lifespan of 64.64 years, compared with
63.97 years for left-handers.
   The letter was signed by Diane F. Halpern of the psychology
department of California State University and Stanley Coren of the
psychology department of the University of British Columbia.
   They said their study covered 1,472 right-handers and 236
left-handers, and excluded players who batted with one hand and
threw with the other.
   No discrepancies appeared until after age 33. After that, about
2 percent more right-handers than left-handers survive at each
following five-year period, the researchers said.
   They said the study gave no information about the possible cause
of the apparent discrepancy, but suggested three possibilities:
that left-handers may suffer stresses in the womb or around the
time of birth that affect their longevity; that genetic effects or
hormones may have hampered their immune system, or that
``left-handers may have more accidents in an environment designed
for a right-handed majority.''
   They concluded: ``These factors may act singly or in concert to
account for the fact that left-handers seem to have a shorter
lifespan.''

<TEXT>
   Senators renewed the government's pledge
Thursday to stand behind deposits in the nation's savings and loan
institutions, after a congressional agency reported the doubling of
red ink in the federal S&L insurance fund.
   ``There is absolutely no doubt the U.S. Congress stands behind
our deposit insurance program,'' Banking Committee Chairman William
Proxmire, D-Wis., said at a hearing by his panel.
   Frederick D. Wolf, director of the accounting and financial
management division of the General Accounting Office, said the
liabilities of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
exceeded its assets by $13.7 billion at the end of 1987, up from
$6.3 billion a year earlier.
   Further, he said, the money available to the insurance fund _
$28 billion over the next 10 years _ ``probably will not be
adequate'' to restore the industry's health by closing or merging
505 institutions listed as insolvent.
   Wolf estimated it would cost $30 billion to $35 billion to clean
up the S&L mess, which is primarily centered in Southwestern states
hard hit by depressed real estate and oil markets. That estimate
does not include an additional 435 ``barely solvent'' institutions,
he said.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates 3,120
federally insured institutions, says the cost will be $21.8
billion, but Wolf said that projection was based on some
``extremely optimistic'' assumptions.
   Private analysts, who testified after Wolf, put the price tag as
high as $64 billion and growing. Proxmire called that sum,
equivalent to 2.5 percent of the national debt, enormous.
   However, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the ranking Republican on the
committee, said the $64 billion estimate offered by Bert Ely, an
Alexandria, Va., analyst, was ridiculous.
   ``I don't want to minimize the problem. ... But let's not panic
the American people and create a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' Garn
said. ``I want to keep this in perspective. ... Not one single
federally insured depositor, up to the $100,000 limit, has lost one
dime.''
   The GAO report comes only nine months after Congress authorized
the sale of $10.8 billion in bonds over three years to bring in
money to the insurance fund. The bonds are being paid off through a
special assessment on savings institutions.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., considered the likely
successor to Proxmire when the committee chairman retires next
January, said Congress should be ready to act again soon after the
next president takes office.
   He accused the Reagan administration of papering over the
problem, adding, ``It's clear we have a big problem here. ... I
think it's getting worse, not better.''
   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, speaking with reporters
outside the hearing room, said it is too early to tell if FSLIC
will need more money. For now, he said, the bank board has $4
billion in cash on hand and enough additional money coming in over
the next two years.
   ``We don't think we can responsibly shut down thrifts at a
faster pace,'' Wall said.
   However, most of the private analysts appearing before the
committee urged swift action to stem mounting losses.
   Because the insurance fund needs to conserve cash, it has been
keeping hundreds of money-losing institutions open, hoping to
persuade private investors or healthy S&Ls to take them over with
federal assistance.
   If regulators are to move faster, the key question is who should
pay.
   Theo H. Pitt Jr., chairman of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the industry's largest trade group, stopped short of
calling for a taxpayer bailout, but he told reporters the industry
has reached the limit if what it can pay.
   ``We can't pay any more and not reduce the capital levels of
this industry to perilous levels,'' he said.
   Proxmire said he hoped a taxpayer rescue could be avoided, and
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said flatly he would oppose use of tax
money.
   However, Ely, Stanley C. Silverberg of the Washington-based
Golembe Associations and Stuart I. Greenbaum, a professor at
Northwestern University, said $30 billion to $40 billion in tax
money would have to be spent.
   ``The key thing the next president has to do is recognize that
the big hit must be taken quickly,'' Ely said.

   Bomb experts searched the Golden Temple
on Thursday after a 10-day standoff between militant Sikhs and
Indian security forces, and Sikh gunmen reportedly killed 25 people
to avenge the siege of the holy shrine.
   As the search for hidden explosives began, a committee of Sikh
elders that manages the 400-year-old temple began trying to work
out ways to reopen the temple to worshipers.
   Police Chief K.P.S. Gill said workers found four bodies inside
the shrine Thursday, one day after the last of the militant Sikhs
emerged and surrendered to Indian authorities.
   ``We are still searching for dead men and arms. It may be by the
weekend we can say it is all clear,'' Gill said.
   A curfew was in effect in the temple's immediate vicinity.
Residents were kept out of an area extending for 300 yards outside
the walls of the sprawling complex.
   The temple is the center for Sikh extremists who have waged a
guerrilla war since 1982 for an independent Sikh homeland in the
rich farming state of Punjab. Sikhs are a religious minority in
India but a majority in Punjab.
   Forty-five men and one woman walked out of the temple Wednesday
during a cease-fire by the 2,800 policemen, commandoes and
paramilitary troops posted outside.
   Twelve of the men, described by authorities as ``hard-core
terrorists,'' were charged with murder and possession of arms.
   At least 46 people, mostly militant Sikhs, died in the siege,
according to official statements. Four other militants committed
suicide.
   Despite the government's success in ending the siege, its
authority is still challenged by continuing Sikh attacks elsewhere
in Punjab state.
   The United News of India said Sikh gunmen shot and killed 25
people across Punjab in seven separate overnight attacks, raising
the death toll since the start of the year to 1,088.
   At least 40 people were killed Tuesday and Wednesday, including
30 migrant Hindu laborers shot to death as they slept at a camp
near the state capital, Chandigarh. A note found near the laborers'
bodies said the killings were to avenge the siege of the Golden
Temple.
   The temple siege _ the strongest government anti-terrorist
action since a 1984 army raid on the shrine _ began May 9 after
Sikh extremists inside fired at police commanders on an inspection
tour outside the temple. Five officers were injured.
   Eight hundred pilgrims and temple workers were evacuated from
the temple May 10, and 146 people, including some Sikh extremists,
surrendered during a cease-fire Sunday.
   During the surrender Wednesday, the last of the militants
emerged from the temple in small groups and were taken for
questioning by police.

   Hispanics have a swing-vote potential that
could affect the results of a close presidential race in several
states, according to a study released Thursday.
   The study, sponsored by the National Association of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials, said Hispanic voters can influence
the selection of 71 percent of the 270 electoral votes needed to
win the presidency.
   ``The Hispanic vote has the potential of being a true swing vote
in 1988,'' said Harry Pachon, the association's national director.
   California, which has 47 electoral votes, and New York, with 36,
are among nine key states where the Hispanic vote can alter
statewide results, the study said.
   NALEO is a national, nonpartisan civic affairs group with over
3,300 members nationwide.
   The other states mentioned by the group include Texas with 29
electoral votes, Illinois with 24, Florida 21, New Jersey 16,
Colorado 8, Arizona 7 and New Mexico 5.

   Rob Herman grew up thinking he was lazy. His
IQ was 156 but he couldn't read, he had trouble writing and his
teachers always made fun of him. He became the class clown.
   He obtained his high school diploma at a private school without
doing any work. He forged his transcript to get into the University
of Montana but flunked out after four semesters.
   Herman still calls himself a clown, but he's not in class
anymore. On Thursday, he and two other students became the first
graduates of Landmark College, the nation's only college for
dyslexics.
   ``This place changed my life,'' said Herman, a 26-year-old from
Great Neck, N.Y., with a beard, a quick smile and black curly hair
that falls to his shoulders. ``It gave me an opportunity to get an
education, to understand myself, to accomplish goals for myself.
   ``If I didn't come here, I don't know where I'd be _ probably
working a manual labor job somewhere,'' he said.
   Dyslexia is a language disability commonly known for the
reversal of letters. Dyslexics also have trouble organizing their
thoughts, writing them down, remembering names, taking notes and
learning languages.
   It affects 10 percent of the population. There is no known cure
for the disability, which has numbered Nelson Rockefeller, Thomas
Edison and Hans Christian Anderson among its sufferers.
   Since 1971, more than 2,000 young dyslexics have attended the
Landmark School in Prides Crossing, Mass. The affiliated college
opened in September 1985, in red and white brick buildings formerly
occupied by the bankrupt Windham College.
   The first year, 77 students enrolled in the pre-college and
college programs, the latter leading to an associate's degree in
general studies.
   The student population has doubled. Landmark's budget is strong,
it is a candidate for accreditation, and its five-year plan
includes more dormitory space, a better library and a scholarship
fund.
   ``I think things are going very well,'' President Jim Olivier
said in an interview in his office Wednesday. ``We've been
successful in doing what we set out to do, which is prepare
students for success in non-specialized colleges.''
   Landmark students have been accepted at more than 100 colleges
and universities.
   Olivier said although Landmark's curricula is not very different
from any other general studies college, teaching is very
individualized, with a student-faculty ratio of 3-1. Students are
expected to learn the same subject matter as students at other
schools, but they are given more time to read texts and take exams.
   Herman found out about Landmark through an education consultant.
The other graduates, Kevin Gott and Paul Hudson, read articles
about the program.
   Gott, a lanky, athletic man from Baltimore, found out he had
dyslexia in high school. He thought he could cut it at St. Olaf
College in Northfield, Minn., but he quit at the end of the year.
He said they had the facilities to help him but he was too
embarrassed to ask.
   Landmark helped him stick it out in school. ``I guess the
biggest thing for me is increasing my self-confidence,'' said Gott,
26, who was honored this year with two achievement awards.
   Hudson, a Canadian, also praised the school for raising his
self-esteem. A former computer programmer, he plans to become an
astronomer.
   ``I probably would have gone to some community college, some
low-level school, got a bachelor's degree and taken a job with
computers. And that would be it,'' said Hudson, 22, who as a child
often dreamed of the stars while visiting a Montreal planetarium.
``Instead of setting myself up for failure, now I know what I can
do.''
   The cost at Landmark College is a prohibitive $20,500 a year for
tuition, room and board, with limited financial aid from the
institution _ a fact that upsets the graduates.
   ``I hate seeing this school just be here for people whose
parents can afford it,'' said Herman, the son of a Pennsylvania
businessman, who said he'd like to start a scholarship fund.

<HEAD>House Approves Spending $1.4 Billion on Legislative Branch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved a $1.4 billion legislative
branch spending bill Thursday after voting a policy of zero
tolerance of drug use among its employees but refusing to extend to
them any civil rights protections.
   The bill, passed 277-104, would increase spending by Congress
and its agencies by 1.6 percent above current levels, including a
16.5 percent hike for its leadership staffs.
   The House rejected several amendments aimed at freezing or
cutting costs, accepting only a symbolic $5 million reduction in
its estimated postage costs.
   For the third straight day, the House approved an amendment
requiring that no federal funds go to a workplace where drugs are
used, sold or made.
   The provision, offered by Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., was
approved 286-98, despite complaints that it was an election-year
gimmick that wouldn't solve the problem.
   The amendment gives ``the impression that we've done something
about drugs, but ... we won't have done a whit,'' said Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis., who called it a ``garbage'' amendment.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., was forced to withdraw her amendment
requiring Congress to obey the civil rights law it imposed on the
rest of the nation 24 years ago. The amendment banning
discrimination based on race, sex, religion, age, national origin
or physical handicap was deemed out of order on the spending bill.
   The House bill, by tradition, does not include the allowance for
the Senate, where the bill was sent. The House Appropriations
Committee estimated the Senate portion would add $413 million to
the total.
   The bill did not address the question of pay raises for members
of the House and Senate, leaving that until later in the year when
President Reagan makes his annual recommendation.

   President Reagan said Thursday it is possible
a U.S.-Soviet long-range missile treaty can be reached before he
leaves office because Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev might not
want to wait for a new administration.
   While acknowledging that ``none of us really think'' such a
strategic missile deal could be completed at the coming summit in
Moscow, Reagan said he did not think Gorbachev necessarily wants to
take his time.
   In a wide-ranging interview with foreign broadcasters, the
president also maintained again that the clandestine sales of arms
to Iran did not amount to an arms-for-hostages deal and said the
Soviet Union should resume diplomatic relations with Israel if it
wants to take part in an international peace conference on the
Middle East.
   Asked whether he was worried about the impact on the May 29-June
2 summit of recent reports of astrological influences on White
House affairs, Reagan replied:
   ``Well, I hope that Mr. Gorbachev has heard some of the things
that I have been saying about those charges, because no decision
was ever made by me on the basis of astrology.''
   In the question-and-answer session in the Oval Office, the
president said he thought Gorbachev should be encouraged in the
reforms he is pushing in the Soviet Union. ``I think it is evident
that he is running into opposition, that there are those who want
to cling to more of the Stalinist policies,'' Reagan said.
   ``If there's any way that outside nations could be helpful in
this, they should,'' he said, ``because many of the reforms that he
has undertaken are aimed at the things that we have always
criticized in the Soviet Union. And if there is a way to be helpful
in that, certainly, to at least acknowledge our approval of what he
is doing, that we should do that.''
   Previewing the summit in Moscow, Reagan said he hopes more
progress can be made in the area of human rights, and that the
Kremlin still has not lived up to promises made in the Helsinki
accords on that subject.
   Asked whether he thought Gorbachev might take his time on the
strategic arms reduction talks in view of the few months remaining
in his own administration, the president said he didn't know if the
Soviet leader was ready to ``gamble that much.''
   He said ``we're working as hard as we can, and it's a far more
complex treaty than the INF (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces)
treaty signed by Reagan and Gorbachev last December.
   ``We'll continue to work there at the summit if it is not
completed (beforehand),'' Reagan said. ``And none of us really
think that it will be. ... But I think that it is possible that we
could have that, yes, while this administration is still here.''
   If that does not happen, he added, ``I would hope that whoever
is there and whoever is here in this office would recognize ...
that a nuclear war cannot be won and should not be fought.''
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators are working on a treaty that could
slash the superpowers' arsenals of long-range missiles by 30
percent to 50 percent.
   The president said he thought the atmosphere for arms control
had improved in recent years, in part because of the nuclear
reactor accident at Chernobyl in the Ukraine.
   ``Possibly, in the Soviet Union, it was their tragic experience
with Chernobyl, and to see that how an area was made unlivable for
the people that had lived all their lives there,'' he said. ``And
when you stop and think, that that explosion was less than the
power of one single warhead.''
   Reagan also defended anew his decision to permit the sale of
U.S. arms to elements in Iran during parts of 1985 and 1986, even
though Iran was on the State Department's list of terrorist
nations. Those sales, and the subsequent diversion of proceeds to
Nicaraguan Contra rebels, mushroomed into a major embarrassment for
his administration.
   In the interview, the president complained that ``I've labored
under a misapprehension here _ well, worldwide, I guess _ about the
so-called Iran-Contra affair.''
   ``We argued right in this room (Oval Office) about it,'' he said.
   ``Some people said, well, would that appear to be trading arms
for hostages? Well, no, because we're weren't giving them ... to
the kidnapers. We were doing nothing to make an advantage to them.''
   ``And I've likened it to, if I had a child that was kidnaped, I
don't think that you should pay ransom,'' Reagan said.
   ``But if I found there was another individual that could get
that child back for me in return for my doing something for him,
that would be all right ... And the truth was, we got two hostages
back.''

<HEAD>Scientists Debate How Dinosaurs Died, But Reach No Conclusions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BALTIMORE (AP)- Scientists presented new studies Thursday about
what may have killed the dinosaurs some 60 million years ago, but
leading advocates of two competing theories said neither side
gained ground from the data.
   ``This debate is going to rage on for 50 years,'' sighed Carl
Orth of the Los Alamos National Laboratory at the meeting of the
American Geophysical Union.
   The debate centers on a geologic event that occurred at what is
called the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. This rock formation, laid
down about 66 million years ago, marks some event that culminated
in a major extinction of plants and animals. Among the creatures
wiped out during, or perhaps just before, this era were the
dinosaurs.
   In 1980, a group of scientiests at the University of California,
Berkeley, led by Luis Alvarez, proposed that the extinctions were
caused by the impact on Earth of a massive meteorite. The impact,
they suggested, vaporized the space boulder and threw vast amounts
of fine material into the atmosphere. This material shaded the sun
and caused plants to die, disrupting the food chain and wiping out
hundreds of species.
   A competing theory proposes that the extinctions were caused by
volcanic eruptions that darkened the sun. The action caused a major
change in the Earth's weather, created a vast amount of acid rain
and diminished the ozone layer of the atmosphere.
   Scientists favoring the volcano theory have proposed that the
killer volcano was in what is now India and formed a lava deposit
called the Deccan, a formation that covers thousands of miles to a
depth of hundreds of feet.
   In a paper presented to the geophysical union, Vincent
Courtillot of the Institute of Geophysics in Paris, said that
samples of the Deccan show that it was laid down at about the time
of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. This supports the contention,
Courtillot said, that the volcano occurred at the time of the major
extinctions.
   ``This is an important finding for the vulcanism side of the
debate,'' said Charles Officer of Dartmouth. ``There are five
studies now that show the Deccan formed during the time of the
extinctions 64 to 69 million years ago.''
   But proponents of the impact theory said the volcano studies do
not explain the presence at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary of an
element called iridium. This element is rare in ordinary
formations, but is found in abundance at the CT boundary. Iridium
also is found in abundance in meteorites.
   Courtillot admitted Thursday that iridium is not found in the
Deccan
   Orth, however, said he has found an abundance of iridium at
formations he studied all over the American Southwest.
   In areas such as the Raton Basin in New Mexico, the
Cretaceous-Tertiary deposits have lain almost undisturbed for 66
million years. Samples show a clear, clean and significant level of
iridium precisely where the Alvarez theory said it should be, he
said.
   ``That iridium is not native,'' Orth said. ``It had to fall in
from somewhere.'' And the most likely source is from comets or
meteorites that fell to Earth 66 million years ago, he said.
   Orth said he first favored the volcano theory of extinction, but
feels the growing body of evidence ``now favors the impact theory.''
   But both sides, he said, still have fundamental flaws that
cannot be resolved yet.
   ``More study is needed,'' said Orth, ``but it's something that
will be argued for many, many years.''

   Shells crashed near the Syrian-held
airport highway Thursday as rival Shiite Moslem militias battled
with artillery and machine guns for a 14th day despite efforts by
Syria and Iran to end the fighting.
   Iran's chief mediator, acting Foreign Minister Ali Mohammed
Besharati, toned down his earlier public opposition to Syrian
military intevention to snuff out the fighting for control of south
Beirut's slums.
   The thud of shell explosions reverberated across Beirut. The
Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian Amal militia, who have
been battling since May 6, accused each other of starting the duel.
Shelling broke out at midafternoon and raged after nightfall.
   Police reported earlier that one man was killed and 10 people
were wounded in daylong machine-gun clashes between Hezbollah, or
Party of God, and Amal, Arabic for hope. Authorities said they had
no new reports of casualties.
   The Syrian command said no Syrian troops or positions along the
5-mile highway that abuts the shantytowns were hit in the shelling.
   Thursday's casualties brought the overall toll to 244 dead and
772 injured since fighting flared in the slums, where
Hezbollah-affiliated groups are believed to hold most of the 18
foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   In Jerusalem, Vernon Walters, U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, said he will return to Syria on Friday on a mission to
secure the release of the nine American hostages.
   He declined to go into details of his Damascus trip.
   Walters said his return to the region was prompted by concern
for the safety of the hostages as the fighting between Amal and
Hezbollah escalated.
   He also apparently is seeking Israel's assurances that it will
not conduct raids into Lebanon against Hezbollah and thereby
endanger the hostages. Israel has blamed Hezbollah for helping
Palestinian guerrillas attack northern Israeli settlements.
   The independent Beirut daily paper An-Nahar said Iran was
opposing a Syrian military deployment throughout the 16-square-mile
slums to quell the fighting. More than 80 percent of the estimated
250,000 residents have fled.
   But Besharati told reporters after meeting with Lebanese
Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite, on Thursday evening
that ``if the entry of the Syrian forces to the suburbs guarantees
security, we will not object.''
   He said Wednesday that Iran opposed Syrian deployment because
there was some opposition in the suburbs to such a move.
   There was no explanation for Besharati's change of heart.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, is Iran's principal
Arab ally. But the government of President Hafez Assad is alarmed
by Tehran's efforts through Hezbollah to dominate Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites, the country's largest single sect.
   Justice Minister Nabih Berri, who heads Amal, announced a
sweeping purge of the militia's military command because of its
poor performance against the outnumbered Hezbollah.
   The communique did not say whether new commanders had been named.
   A police spokesman said before the shelling that the fighting
had ``settled into mere exchanges of machine-gun fire'' between the
Amal fighters entrenched in the district of Shiyah on the northern
edge of south Beirut and Hezbollah gunmen in control of 90 percent
of the slums.
   He said most of the casualties were civilians injured in Shiyah
by sniper fire. One man was killed by a bullet in Shiyah as he
tried to check on his damaged apartment, the spokesman said.
   An-Nahar said Iran wants Syria to deploy only a ``disengagement
force'' to separate the fighters and rejects any effort to disarm
Hezbollah.
   Iran also wants ``the case of releasing (foreign) hostages to be
separate from the objectives of the Syrian deployment,'' the paper
added, without further elaboration.
   There have been unconfirmed reports that Hezbollah was
threatening to kill foreign hostages if Syrian forces moved into
the slums.
   Nine of the foreign hostages are American. The longest held is
Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was seized in west Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Syria deployed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks and armored vehicles
on the southern, western and northern edges of south Beirut on
Sunday and said the force was prepared to move in to quell the
fighting.

   Scriptwriters and producers will meet with a
federal mediator next week in an attempt to resume talks in the
11-week-old writers strike that has crippled the entertainment
industry, both sides said Thursday.
   ``The chief negotiatiors have been exploring a possible solution
to the impasse and feel a meeting at this time is in order,'' said
a joint statement from the writers and producers.
   Both sides refused further comment.
   Monday's meeting would be the third such mediated session
between the two sides. The last was a 20-minute meeting April 18;
talks March 14 also failed to bring results.
   The 9,000-member Writers Guild of America struck the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers on March 7 over issues of
creative control and residual payments for reruns and works
distributed in foreign countries.
   Federal mediator Leonard Farrell scheduled the meeting for
Monday afternoon at the alliance's Sherman Oaks headquarters.
   The talks come at a time when negotiating committees for the
guild are believed to be on the verge of signing at least 20
contracts with independent production companies desperate to resume
work. Another 60 companies are in negotiations with the guild.
   While the producers face the possibility of some companies
resuming work while others remain idle, the writers on Wednesday
sent letters to Walt Disney, Paramount, and several soap opera and
other production companies seeking the names of replacement
scriptwriters.
   The WGA letters appear to be the guild's first acknowledgement
that substantial numbers of replacement writers are being hired to
foil their strike.
   ``Your Company apparently has employed one or more persons to
perform WGA-covered writing services since the strike began. The
WGA is entitled under federal labor law to the name and address of
each of these persons,'' says the letter signed by WGA Executive
Director Brian Walton.
   ``We are asking for this information for the purpose of policing
our contract,'' said guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   The letters were sent to Walt Disney Co., Tri-Star, Viacom, W.F.
Productions, ``Supercarrier'' producer Charles Fries Enterprises
and Fox Square for ``The Late Show.''
   The letter also went to Paramount, which produces ``MacGyver,''
``Star Trek _ The Next Generation,'' ``Entertainment Tonight'' and
``Naked Gun''; Santa Barbara Productions for the soap opera ``Santa
Barbara''; Corday Productions for ``Days of Our Lives''; Bell
Dramatic Serial Co. for ``The Bold and Beautiful'' and ``The Young
and Restless''; Universal Pay TV Programming for ``Still The
Beaver,'' and ABC.

   Carlos Lehder Rivas, reputedly a
leader of a violent Colombian drug cartel responsible for most of
the cocaine imported to this country, was convicted Thursday of
smuggling more than three tons of cocaine into the United States.
   The verdict capped a seven-month trial on a federal indictment
charging him with taking over the island of Norman's Cay in the
Bahamas to smuggle cocaine into Florida and Georgia from 1978 to
1980.
   ``This is truly a major victory in the war on drugs,'' said U.S.
Attorney Robert Merkle, the lead prosecutor.
   Authorities say Lehder, 38, is a key figure in the Medellin
Cartel, responsible for up to 80 percent of U.S. cocaine imports,
and Merkle said the case threatens the cartel's operations.
   ``I would say they are looking over their shoulders,'' Merkle
said. ``I think their days are numbered.''
   But Lehder's attorney, Edward Shohat, said the conviction,
``sadly, means nothing at all.'' He accused the government of
creating hysteria, even convincing jurors their security was
threatened. He promised an appeal.
   Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Jack Hook called the
operation the world's largest drug trafficking ring. By comparison,
authorities say the French Connection drug ring smuggled in about
70 pounds of heroin from 1968 to 1971.
   ``This conviction sends a message to the kingpins of the cartel
_ you are not able to bribe, intimdate or muder your way out of
custody in the United States,'' Hook said. ``It has been a
tradition in Colombia, but not in the United States.''
   In Bogota, Colombia, Attorney General Horacio Serpa Uribe said,
``Everyone in Colombia was hoping for a guilty verdict.'' He
declined further comment, saying only, ``I understand that he was
tried in accordance with all the formalities of U.S. law.''
   The verdict was hailed by U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III,
who called it ``an excellent example of international cooperation
... against a major drug trafficker.''
   Lehder could face up to 150 years in prison and $350,000 in
fines for his convictions on all 11 counts, ranging from possession
of cocaine to running a continuing criminal enterprise. His
co-defendant, Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., was
convicted of one conspiracy count and faces a maximum 15-year
sentence.
   Asked if Lehder will spend the rest of his life behind bars,
Merkle said, ``I certainly hope so. That is going to be my
recommendation.''
   When the verdicts were read, Lehder looked down briefly, then
stared straight ahead. Two female jurors cried, one sobbing into
her hands, as their seven days of deliberations ended.
   Lehder's aunt in the audience also cried and slumped down on the
bench.
   Following the verdicts, the jury had to consider government
motions seeking the forfeiture of millions of dollars of Lehder's
property in the Bahamas, including land, homes, an airstrip and
planes.
   The seven-month trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115
government witnesses, along with mounds of documents. Lehder was
extradited to the United States last year following a firefight and
his arrest by the Colombian army at a Medellin mansion.
   During the trial Merkle called Lehder the Henry Ford of drug
trafficking, the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern,
high-tech operation, using airdrops and speed boats.
   Prosecutors and government witnesses described Lehder as a
one-time New York street hood who put together a vast
cocaine-smuggling empire after he was deported to his homeland,
becoming a key figure in the Colombia-based Medellin cartel.
   The cartel has been blamed for a wave of violence across
Colombia, including the assassination of a former justice minister
and the slaying of top U.S. DEA informant Adler ``Barry'' Seal in
Baton Rouge, La. Up to 10 armed marshals were visible in court
during Lehder's trial.
   Witnesses talked of his flamboyant personality, which included
admiration for Adolf Hitler and slain former Beatle John Lennon.
   They said Lehder, after initially smuggling the drug himself and
paying ``mules'' to fly between Colombia and the United States,
earned a stake that allowed him to fly his own shipments.
   He allegedly paid off Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling
to look the other way while his smuggling operation took over the
small island of Norman's Cay, a short hop from Florida.
   Pindling, himself reportedly a target of a Florida grand jury
investigation based in part on trial testimony, has called the
allegations a ``fairy tale.''
   The principal prosecution witness was Ed Ward, an ex-marine
pilot running his own marijuana smuggling operation from the
island. He teamed up with Lehder, but eventually fell out with
Reed, Lehder's co-defendant, he said.
   After his arrest in 1981, Ward began cooperating with the DEA.
   Ward, who is under federal protection and has been given a new
identity, testified about hauling 1,600 kilograms of cocaine from
Colombia to Norman's Cay, and flying tons of cocaine from the
Bahamian island to airstrips in Florida and Georgia.
   Defense attorneys Shohat and Jose Quinon hammered away at the
credibility of Ward and other prosecution witnesses. They accused
them of making deals to avoid punishment for their own crimes, and
said Lehder was a legitimate businessman victimized by drug
investigators.
   The prosecution testimony was a ``litany of lies,'' Shohat said.
   In a surprise move, they presented no witnesses after the
prosecution rested, sending the trial immediately to the jury.
   Lehder is also under indictment in Miami for his role in the
Medellin cartel. But that indictment was not included in his
extradition papers, and under the U.S.-Colombia treaty in effect at
the time, he apparently cannot be tried on the charges. Lehder also
is reportedly the object of a sealed indictment in Los Angeles.

   So-called ``type A'' hepatitis, a liver disease
traditionally linked to poor hygiene, is showing up more and more
in outbreaks among drug abusers, federal health researchers said
Thursday.
   Outbreaks of Hepatitis A among drug abusers have occurred in New
York, California and a variety of other locations across the
country in the past two years, the national Centers for Disease
Control said.
   In New York's upstate Cortland County, for example, 58 percent
of the hepatitis A cases last year occurred among ``known or
suspected drug abusers,'' the CDC said.
   Between 1982 and 1986, the percentage of hepatitis A patients
admitting previous use of injectible drugs rose from 4 percent to
19 percent, according to the CDC's Viral Hepatitis Surveillance
Program. Those statistics are not complete, since the program does
not cover all cases, CDC researchers stressed.
   ``How widespread this is, we can't really tell,'' said Dr. Craig
N. Shapiro, a CDC hepatitis specialist. ``Where there's a greater
percentage of drug users, there might be a greater problem.''
   Shapiro noted that health officials reporting hepatitis cases to
the Atlanta-based federal agency do not routinely report patients'
risk factors.
   Hepatitis B, a blood-borne disease, has for some time been known
to plague intravenous drug abusers, who can pass the disease
through sharing of contaminated needles.
   ``But it's only newly recognized that they are a risk group for
hepatitis A,'' Shapiro said. Hepatitis A is often transmitted in
cases of poor hygiene, through fecal contamination.
   About 25,000 cases each of hepatitis A and B were reported to
the CDC last year. Hepatitis is a serious inflammation of the
liver, causing fever and aches, which can, in rare cases, be fatal.
   Two explanations have been proposed for the new link between
hepatitis A and drug abuse, the CDC said. The illness may be spread
through use of drugs contaminated with the virus. Or the virus
might be spread in direct person-to-person contact, perhaps in
needle sharing, sexual contact or poor personal hygiene.
   ``Investigations of the various outbreaks ... have not revealed
clear modes of transmission,'' the CDC said in its weekly report.
``It is possible that each outbreak has multiple modes of
transmission.''
   In upstate New York, in addition to the Cortland County
outbreak, 87 cases of hepatitis A were reported in Monroe County
from December 1986 to May 1987; 24 patients were injectible drug
abusers, and eight more were sexual or household contacts of the
drug users, the CDC said.
   In northern California, in the wake of a food-borne hepatitis A
outbreak, 33 other patients not connected to that outbreak were
questioned; 24 of the 33 patients were abusers of injectible drugs.
   Other drug-linked outbreaks have occurred in recent years in
Alaska, Oregon, Washington state, southern California, Oklahoma and
Connecticut, the CDC said.

<HEAD>`Killer Bees' Found On Ship Arriving In Florida</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ten thousand super-agressive ``killer
bees'' almost got a free ride into Florida aboard a ship, state
agriculture officials said Thursday.
   The killer bee colony, complete with queen bee, that was
destroyed earlier this month aboard a freighter at Port Everglades
was the third and by far the largest swarm of the deadly
Africanized bees that have been found on ships arriving in Florida
within the last two years, officials said.
   There was chance that the swarm could have helped establish the
killer bee problem in the United States, but the odds were against
that happening because the bees would probably have bred with their
gentler cousins, officials said.
   The nasty little bugs, descended from South African bees that
escaped from a researcher in Brazil in 1956, attack much more
agressively when riled than do ordinary honeybees.
   They have been blamed for several deaths of humans and livestock
in the areas in South and Central America where they have taken
over, and are also a threat to the commercial beekeeping industry.
Some researchers fear they could spread across the Mexican border
into Texas as early as the end of this year.
   About 10,000 bees were clustered aboard the containerized
freighter Senate, carrying fruit and vegetables from Guatemala,
when it docked May 6 near Fort Lauderdale, said state Agriculture
Commissioner Doyle Conner.
   The inspector who destroyed the swarm, John Bastianelli, was
stung more than 100 times. But it takes about 2,000 stings to kill
an average adult, said Laurence Cutts, the state's chief apiary
(beehive) inspector.
   If they had gotten ashore, Bastianelli said, the bees could have
set up a hive and begun expanding because they included a queen,
the only member of a colony that can reproduce.
   But Cutts said a single colony is not much of a threat in itself
because bees do not inbreed. A single colony would breed with
European honey bees and the Africanized strain would be reduced
with each generation until eventually it would be bred out of
existence, he said.
   ``There's always a chance'' of the bees becoming established,
said Cutts. ``Just what that chance is, we don't know.''
   Since 1986, signs have been posted at ports urging crews and
dock workers to report swarms and its now common knowledge among
seaman that authorities want to know about bee activity on ships.
Also, bee-nesting lures have be placed at major ports to attract
bees before they can move inland, officials said.
   ``They'll go to a bee box before they go anywhere else,
hopefully,'' Bustianelli said. ``Once we find out there are bees
there we can get them, although we might have to fight them a
while.''
   In late 1986, a colony of killer bees was discovered and
destroyed aboard a ship docked in West Palm Beach. Another was
removed by a hobbyist beekeeper in April 1987 from a freighter in
Panama City and later destroyed by agriculture officials.
   The Port Everglades swarm was considerably larger than the
others, Cutts said, but it was still about a fifth the size of a
normal, established colony.
   The bees also were infested with Varroa mite, a honeybee pest
detected in Wisconsin two years ago and since found in 13 other
states including Florida, Cutts said.
   Like the killer bee, the mite is considered a potential major
threat to the beekeeping industry. The mite feeds on the body fluid
of bees and pupae, eventually causing high bee mortality and
weakening of colonies.
   The discovery of mites in the Port Everglades swarm has
increased suspicion the mite infestation that began two years ago
was caused by an Africanized colony which became established
without detection, Cutts said.

<HEAD>Armenian Activist Reports Mass Gathering in Yerevan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200,000 people gathered peacefully in a
square in Yerevan Thursday in the second large demonstration in the
Armenian capital this week, an Armenian activist said.
   Several assemblies were held this week in Armenia and Azerbaijan
to address ethnic unrest in the republics. Armenians want the
Nagorno-Karabakh area of neighboring Azerbaijan to become part of
their republic.
   Activist Rafael Popoyan said in a telephone interview from his
home in Yerevan that some people in the crowd Thursday carried
banners demanding annexation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
However, it was not clear who called Thursday's demonstration, or
what its purpose was, he said.
   There were rumors it had been organized by officials, and people
may have been attracted by curiosity, he said. But nothing happened
in the two hours after people began to gather at 6 p.m. (9 a.m.
EDT) in a square near the city opera house, he said.
   ``People were standing around; there weren't any microphones,''
Popoyan said.
   Police surrounded the square but did not interfere, he said.
   The majority of the people in Nagorno-Karabakh are Christian
Armenians, and Armenians say they are repressed by Azeris, who are
Moslems.
   Papoyan said there was a ``constant danger of an explosion'' of
rage in Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians had been forced out of the city
of Shusha in the region by other residents, and soldiers were
surounding Nagorno-Karabakh, he said.
   Other calls to officials and activists in Armenia and Azerbaijan
did not go through.
   Armenians began protesting in mid-February for the annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh. At the end of the month ethnic rioting broke out
in the Azerbaijan city of Sumgait. Thirty-two people, six Azeris
and 26 Armenians, were killed.
   The Soviet government rejected the demand to change jurisdiction
over Nagorno-Karabakh, opting instead for an expensive program of
social and economic development of the area.
   Popoyan and Moscow dissidents said about 150,000 people gathered
in Yerevan on Tuesday in a meeting called by the Karabakh committee
leading the effort to annex the section of Azerbaijan.
   They said the figure of 15,000 people reported earlier by other
Moscow dissidents was wrong.
   The rally was called a day after the first defendant in the
Sumgait riots was convicted of murder and sentenced to 15 years in
prison.
   Popoyan said protesters are demanding that trials of those
accused in the rioting be open and broadcast on television.
   The official Baku radio said young people, intellectuals and
workers attended ``crowded'' meetings Monday and Wednesday in
Azerbaijan.
   They called on the government and Communist Party to protect the
interests of Azeris living in Armenia, said the radio, reporting
from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
   The broadcasts, monitored by the British Broadcasting Co. in
London, did not say how many people were involved.
   It said ``incidents'' took place in some residential areas of
the Ararat district of Armenia on May 11 that had worried some
Azeris. It did not elaborate.
   Popoyan said there had been reports of clashes between Azeris
and Armenians in the region, but that he did not have details.
   Baku radio said members of the Central Committee of the
Azerbaijan Communist Party and of the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet met with some of those attending the meetings and urged
restraint.
   Vladimir Ryabokon, an editor of the dissident journal
Express-Khronika, said in a telephone interview that tens of
thousands of people gathered in Baku on Monday and Tuesday to
demand that courts not give the death sentence to any of those
charged in the Sumgait riots.

Court</HEAD>

   Oliver L. North and former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter made damaging admissions to Congress
about the Iran-Contra affair that could be used as evidence against
them in court, prosecutors said Thursday.
   Poindexter's statement that he approved North's plan to funnel
profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels and
admissions by him and North that they destroyed documents during a
1986 investigation were among numerous excerpts of congressional
testimony that prosecutors said were admissible in court.
   Even though they testified on Capitol Hill under limited grants
of immunity from prosecution, former National Security Council aide
North, Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim made statements that
can be used against them when the Iran-Contra case goes to trial in
federal court, the prosecution said.
   ``Volunteered testimony by defendants in their congressional
testimony is not immunized and may be directly introduced at trial
against them,'' independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said in
briefs filed in U.S. District Court.
   The three defendants are accused along with retired Air Force
Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, who gave congressional testimony
without an immunity grant, of conspiring to defraud the government
by diverting profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   The indictment includes charges that North destroyed documents
during the November 1986 Justice Department investigation of the
Iran-Contra affair that uncovered the diversion of arms-sale
profits.
   It also accuses Poindexter and North of lying to congressional
committees by denying involvement in private Contra resupply
efforts.
   Walsh offered to ``forego the use of congressional testimony''
to smooth the way for a quick trial as a way of satisfying defense
complaints that the prosecution illegally relied on immunized
statements of the defendants.
   However, Walsh cited hundreds of statements by North, Poindexter
and Hakim that were either voluntary or not responsive to the
specific question posed by the committees and therefore not covered
by the immunity grants.
   In a joint filing, defense lawyers called ``simply absurd''
Walsh's claim that the three defendants waived their privilege
against self-incrimination during the congressional hearing.
   ``Each defendant claimed his privilege at the very outset and
never relinquished it,'' the defense said. ``The court should
flatly reject the IC's (independent counsel's) attempt to
circumvent the immunity statute.''
   The defense also urged the judge to dismiss the indictment on
the ground that Walsh took insufficient steps to isolate his staff
from the defendants' immunized testimony, which ``has seeped into
every corner of this case.''
   The statements that Walsh maintains are not covered by the
immunity grants included Poindexter's assertion that the diversion
proposed by North ``was clearly a new aspect that I had not thought
about before. To make a long story short, in the end I thought it
was a very good idea ... and I personally approved it.''
   ``In my view,'' Poindexter continued, ``it was a matter of
implementation of the president's policy with regard to support for
the Contras.''
   Poindexter also admitted that he ``made a very deliberate
decision not to ask the president so that I could insulate him from
the decision and provide some future deniability for the president
if it ever leaked out.''
   The excerpts also include North's statements that he shredded
NSC documents while Justice Department officials were in the next
room during the November 1986 inquiry, prosecutors said in the
briefs.
   ``I remember shredding documents while they were in there
reading documents,'' North told the committee.
   ``Do you remember _ shredding them in their presence?'' asked
Arthur Liman, counsel for the Senate panel.
   ``I mean, they were sitting in my office and the shredder was
right outside and I walked out and shredded documents,'' North said.
   Walsh contended he could also use Poindexter's statements that
he intended to withhold information from the chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee and his belief that North was evasive and
withheld information from Congress.
   ``I testified that I have withheld information from Congress and
with regard to Cabinet officers, I didn't withhold anything from
them that they didn't want withheld from them,'' Poindexter told
the panel.
   Of North's testimony to the House Intelligence Committee,
Poindexter testified, ``I expected him to be evasive.''
   Poindexter said he was sure North's answers ``were very
carefully crafted, nuanced. The total impact, I'm sure, was one of
withholding information from the Congress.''
   Walsh, meanwhile, also asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell to set a trial date, arguing that defense claims that the
prosecution illegally relied on compelled congressional testimony
were meritless.
   He argued that Gesell should set a trial date and reserve
judgment on the immunity issues until later. ``A demand for any
further pre-trial hearings (by the defense) would constitute a
transparent attempt at delay,'' Walsh argued.

   Conservative Republicans, spurning appeals
from the Senate's GOP and Democratic leaders, urged colleagues on
Thursday to ignore the fast approaching U.S.-Soviet summit and
debate the medium-range arms reduction treaty for weeks.
   But Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said: ``It's our
president who will be in Moscow next week and he'd like to have
this treaty. I say that as Republican leader on behalf of a
Republican president.
   ``We have a special responsibility to President Ronald Reagan,''
Dole said.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty calls for the
elimination of all ground-launched missiles with a range of 300 to
3,400 miles.
   Shortly before Dole appealed to senators to bring any amendments
they may have to the Senate floor for action, Sen. Malcolm Wallop,
R-Wyo., told his colleagues: ``We should not be playing beat the
clock in our debate over the treaty.''
   ``We cannot feel rushed by the artificial deadline of next
week's summit,'' Wallop said. ``It should be beside the point to
meet a deadline.''
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said: ``Let us examine this treaty
carefully and let the public relations deadline in Moscow be
damned.''
   President Reagan's summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is set to open May 29.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., noting that no
amendments had been offered to the text of the treaty at that
point, asked unanimous consent to move to the resolution of
ratification.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the leading opponent of the treaty,
objected, saying amendments were being prepared by as many as four
senators.
   About an hour later, Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, introduced an
amendment that would prevent the treaty from going into effect
until the president certifies the Soviets are in compliance with
all other arms control treaties.
   He asked for separate roll call votes on all five sections of
the amendment, probably on Friday morning.
   ``The Soviets cheated in the past and I think we can expect they
are going to cheat in the future and I think each senator ought to
go on record whether he wants to condone cheating or not,'' Symms
said.
   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, noted that Secretary of State George P. Shultz
testified that the treaty ``stands on its own merits and should not
be linked to other arms control treaties or other issues.''
   ``It would be like cutting off our nose to spite our face,''
Pell said.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said that linking the INF treaty to
other issues ``is not in the best interest of our country.''
   ``The INF treaty is not a favor to the Soviet Union,'' he said.
``To make implementation depend on compliance with other treaties
is nonsensical.''
   ``To deny ourselves a national security option does not make
good sense,'' Lugar said. ``This treaty stands on its own merits.''
   Earlier, Wallop conceded the Senate eventually will ratify the
treaty, but he urged rejection of ``the drumbeat from the White
House and our leadership which demands our swift consent to the INF
treaty.''
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., raised the possibility a
filibuster may have begun and said, ``I think if we were to vote
tonight it would be a surprise if there were 10 no's. I think the
president of the United States deserves an opportunity for this
body _ before he meets in Moscow _ to say yes or no.''
   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., told him: ``I don't think now is the
time to start harping that we have to do this by a certain
deadline.''
   Wallop added: ``For us to be hurried to suit the climate of a
summit is just a wrong urging at this moment.''
   Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., a treaty supporter, said: ``This treaty
should not be asked to bear the burden of amendments which are
nothing more than thinly veiled attempts to delay its
ratifications.''
   Evans said hardcore arms control opponents have described the
treaty unfairly.
   ``For some, the treaty apparently would result in apocalyptic
military consequences,'' he said. ``That means we have had a steady
stream of misleading, false testimony from the very military
leaders we depend upon, and I don't think that's true.''
   ``We do this treaty a disservice if we treat it as something
more or less than what it is, a single step back from the nuclear
precipice,'' Evans said. ``I think it is time to focus on what is
in front of us instead of trying to bring in all of the
non-related, non-germane elements.
   Although debate was sporadic, Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss., the
Senate's most senior member, endorsed the pact, calling it a
``small first step in the long and difficult process'' of
``reducing the likelihood of a nuclear holocaust.''
   But Humphrey denounced it, saying, ``The INF treaty is a fraud,
a dangerous fraud.''
   The Senate voted 91-6 Wednesday to reject the first conservative
attack on the treaty. That was a point of order raised by Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who claimed Gorbachev wasn't authorized to
sign the pact and it was therefore invalid.
   Byrd told reporters on Thursday: ``The first vote would indicate
the Senate did not think it was a serious point. I did not think it
was.''

   A House subcommittee approved legislation
Thursday that would require television stations to limit
advertising during children's programs.
   The measure, approved 22-2 by the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on telecommunications, is a bipartisan compromise
stripped of earlier proposals to prohibit programs built around toy
manufacturers' products.
   Senate legislation on children's TV would bar these so-called
``program-length commercials.''
   The bill passed by the House subcommittee would limit TV
stations to no more than 10 1@2 minutes of commercials per hour
during children's shows on weekends and 12 minutes per hour during
these programs on weekdays.
   It also would require the Federal Communications Commission to
consider, when deciding whether to renew a station's license,
whether the station complied with the advertising limits and served
the educational needs of children in its overall programming.
   The full committee was scheduled to consider the measure next
week.
   The National Association of Broadcasters said it would not
oppose the House measure and predicted that no stations would have
difficulty meeting the limits in the legislation.

   Legislation designed to protect government
employees who disclose wrongdoing was approved unanimously by a
Senate committee Thursday.
   The bill's sponsor, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the measure
makes it easier for whistleblowers to win a reprisal case and
guarantees them the right to a hearing.
   The bill ``sends a strong message to federal employees that they
will not be punished for disclosing government fraud, waste and
abuse,'' Levin said.
   Thursday's approval by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
clears the way for consideration of the bill by the full Senate.
   Under the bill, the Office of the Special Counsel, an
independent federal agency, would have responsibility for
protecting employees who disclose wrongdoing.
   ``Recent statistics show that 70 percent of federal employees
claiming knowledge of waste, fraud and abuse fail to report it,''
Levin said. ``These statistics are proof that the current system
has failed to convince employees that they will be rewarded instead
of punished if they disclose government wrongdoing.''

   The Soviet Union lost up to 15,000 soldiers in
Afghanistan, a government official said Thursday as the first
contingent of Red Army troops was arriving home from the war with
Moslem guerrillas.
   Eduard Rosental, a political observer for the official Novosti
press agency, told reporters that a Western estimate of 12,000 to
15,000 Soviet deaths in the army's 8{ years in Afghanistan was
approximately correct.
   It was the first time a Soviet official gave any estimate of
Soviet losses in Afghanistan. Soviet officials have refused to
specify the death toll or even the number of Soviet troops deployed
there.
   In other developments Thursday, Pakistan's acting foreign
minister implied his country will continue to help arm the
anti-communist guerrillas, and Tass said Afghanistan's Foreign
Ministry complained to U.N. monitors that Pakistan was sending arms
to the Afghan guerrillas.
   The Soviet withdrawal began Sunday, in accordance with a
U.N.-mediated peace accord signed April 14 in Geneva. The first
1,300 Soviets to leave Afghanistan crossed the border into Soviet
Uzbekistan on Wednesday.
   Radio Moscow reported that the returning soldiers sent a message
to President Reagan urging him ``to use America's prestige and your
personal authority on behalf of this humane goal _ that of bringing
war in Afghanistan to an end and to ensure that no more bombs fall,
no more people die and no more children become invalids.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Thursday
that high-ranking Defense and Foreign ministry officials would meet
with reporters next week to discuss Afghanistan.
   Rosental was asked at a news conference how many Soviet soldiers
had died in Afghanistan.
   He reviewed various Western media assessments, including a
report by Agence France-Presse that 12,000 to 15,000 Soviets had
been killed.
   ``I think the figures cited by Agence France-Presse are more or
less correct, but you can obtain more correct figures from our
military men,'' Rosental said.
   A Soviet-inspired revolution in April 1978 brought a Marxist
leadership to power in Afghanistan. The Kremlin dispatched troops
and tanks in December 1979 to help the Kabul government fight
guerrillas.
   A State Department report released in December estimated the
number of deaths and injuries among Soviets serving in Afghanistan
since 1979 to be ``at least 33,000 to 38,000,'' with at least a
third of them fatalities.
   In addition, many soldiers died from diseases, the report said.
   If the death figures mentioned by Rosental are correct, the
Soviet Union suffered far fewer losses in Afghanistan than the
United States did during the Vietnam War, when about 50,000
Americans were killed or mortally wounded.
   Rosental rejected a reporter's suggestion that the Kremlin was
abandoning an allied government still beleaguered by a nationwide
insurgency.
   ``To withdraw troops does not mean to leave the country in the
lurch,'' he said. ``We leave many cultural and economic facilities
there.''
   The head of the Soviet contingent in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Boris
Gromov, told reporters in Kabul last week that more than $1 billion
in bases and equipment were to be left behind for the Afghan
government's use.
   Soviet soldiers have contended the Afghan army, estimated at
40,000 soldiers, can protect the government.
   Pakistan's acting foreign minister, Zain Noorani, returned
Thursday from a visit to Moscow.
   The official Pakistani news agency, APP, quoted him as saying
that although ``the purpose of the Pakistan mission to Moscow was
of goodwill,'' his country would abide by the Geneva accord and the
policy of ``symmetry.''
   Under that policy, the United States and Soviet Union will
continue to supply the guerrillas and Afghan government forces,
respectively, until one of the sides stops.
   ``I have been quoted as saying that Pakistan will stop all
assistance to the mujahedeen (rebels),'' Noorani said, according to
APP. ``This is incorrect ... We will fulfill all obligations that
we have taken upon (ourselves) in the Geneva accord and after (the
Soviet pullout) becomes operative on May 15, 1988.''
   Pakistan is bound by the accord to stop serving as conduit for
military supplies to the rebels, which mainly come from the United
States. Pakistan officially denies it has ever helped ship the arms.

   Two Iraqi agents were killed when a bomb
they intended to plant along a railroad line in Iran exploded
prematurely, an official Iranian report said Thursday.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said a
third man fled the area near the Arak-Ahvaz railroad line in
southwestern Iran after the bomb exploded May 10.
   A number of bombs have exploded or been defused in Iranian
cities in recent months. Several people have been arrested in
connection with the blasts.
   Iraq and Iran have been at war for 7{ years.

<TEXT>
   A man who served three years in prison for
killing one sister's boyfriend has been booked on a murder charge
for fatally shooting another sister's boyfriend, authorities said
Thursday.
   Alvin Hilliard, 31, said he shot Abe Anderson early Wednesday
``because he was going to fight everyone in the house.'' He said he
had similar fears for his family's safety on Thanksgiving Day 1982
when he killed a man with an ax.
   Hilliard was held on a murder charge Thursday at the Pike County
Jail. Bond was set at $15,000.
   Anderson, 25, was dead on arrival at the hospital, killed with
one 12-gauge shotgun blast to the left back, Pike County Sheriff
Harold Anderson.
   The sheriff, who is no relation to Anderson, said the dead man
got into an argument with Johnny and Alvin Hilliard.
   ``Johnny Hilliard sustained several knife wounds to his arm and
leg. Shots were fired from a .22 caliber rifle and a 12-gauge
shotgun,'' the sheriff said.
   Hilliard said his 24-year-old sister Dorothy and Anderson had
dated on and off for two years. The shooting occurred, he said,
after Anderson beat his sister, tried ``to take over the house''
and cut another family member so badly that he required more than
100 stitches.
   ``I got a gun and shot him. I wanted to stop him,'' Hilliard
told The Montgomery Advertiser in an interview published Thursday.
   Hilliard was paroled on June 2, 1986, after serving one-third of
his manslaughter sentence for killing Henry Bean. Hilliard said he
hit Bean with an ax because Bean was beating his 35-year-old
sister, Mary.
   A parole violation warrant against Hilliard is expected to be
issued soon because he was on parole from the 10-year manslaughter
sentence.

   A protege of former President Leonid Brezhnev
embezzled $1.1 million in state money and used it to buy furs,
foreign cars and crystal chandeliers for himself and his family, a
newspaper said.
   The article about the late Interior Minister Nikolai Shchelkov
struck another blow at the legacy of Brezhnev, who ruled the
country for 18 years before he died in 1982. The piece by writer
and juriest Arkady Vaksberg appeared Wednesday in the weekly
Literaturnaya Gazeta.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has branded Brezhnev's rule as
stagnant and corrupt. The newspaper article charged that Shchelkov
was one of the most corrupt people surrounding Brezhnev.
   Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, was appointed Shchelkov's
first deputy. He is now under arrest and facing trial on corruption
charges.
   Soon after taking power, Yuri Andropov fired Shchelkov.
   Shchelkov died in December 1984 at age 73 and was buried without
ceremony in a Moscow cemetery. He is thought to have committed
suicide because of an investigation of his affairs.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta said Shchelkov bought nine Mercedes cars
for the ministry but then gave vehicles to his son, daughter and
himself. Foreign cars were registered to other family members as
well, the paper said.
   He used $80,000 in state money to buy 62 crystal chandeliers for
himself, his friends and relatives, and had several apartments in
Moscow neighborhoods, the paper said.
   Shchelkov's personal staff included an architect, photographer,
biographer, cook and other personnel, it said.
   He spent $67,000 on furs in his last three years as minister and
almost $12,000 on perfume, the paper said.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta said the total loss to the state from
Shchelkov's theft was $1.1 million, but an investigation recovered
about $780,000 of that.

   Undersecretary-General Diego Cordovez has
been offered the post of foreign minister of Ecuador in the
government of President-Elect Roderigo Borja, the United Nations
confirmed Thursday.
   Francois Giuliani, spokesman for Secretary-General Javier Perez

   There was no word from Cordovez' office on whether the Ecuadoran
diplomat will accept the post.
   Cordovez was the mediator of the accord under which the Soviet
Union is withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan. He has been
mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize.
   He is the secretary-general's special representative overseeing
all aspects of the Afghan settlement. He said this week he is is
trying to promote talks between different segments of Afghan
society to promote a broad-based government.

   A military transport train derailed
Thursday in northwestern Poland, killing 10 soldiers and injuring
at least 16, the official PAP news agency said.
   The report said the train ``tore apart'' the station at Pila, a
city of 68,000 people about 240 miles northwest of Warsaw.
   PAP did not say how many troops were aboard or give the
destination.
   It said cause of the derailment was being investigated.
   PAP identified three of those killed as career soldiers,
indicating the other seven were draftees serving a mandatory two
years in the military.
   The agency said none of the 16 victims being treated at military
and civilian hospitals appeared to be critically hurt.
   The derailment appeared to be Poland's worst train wreck since
April 13, 1981, when 23 people were killed near Zabrze in southern
Poland.

   A bomb explosion at an apartment
building occupied mainly by native Melanesians injured four people
Thursday in this French South Pacific territory, police said.
   No one claimed responsiblity for the attack in suburban
Montravel, outside the capital of Noumea.
   The explosion occurred shortly before a government-appointed
delegation from Paris was to arrive to study the situation in New
Caledonia.
   The bomb, placed on the second floor of the apartment building
before dawn, caused considerable damage.
   Melanesians, also known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of the
territory's 142,000 people. Most favor independence from France.
   The rest of the inhabitants of New Caledonia are European
settlers, Asians and Polynesians who, for the most part, wish to
remain French.
   France has governed New Caledonia, a former French penal colony,
since 1853.
   On May 2, a bomb wrecked a car belonging to a European man
working for the Kanak Socialist Liberation Front, the main
separatist group. A group calling itself the National Committee
against Independence claimed responsibility.
   The Liberation Front condemned Thursday's bombing and said ``the
more the Kanak people suffer, the more our determination will be
reinforced.''
   The French mission sent here was appointed by Premier Michel
Rocard and includes three high-ranking public servants and three
religious leaders.
   New Caledonia, 1,000 miles east of Australia, has been the scene
of sporadic violence since November 1984.
   In April and May, Melanesian separatists raided a police station
on Ouvea island, killing four gendarmes and abducting two dozen
others.
   On May 5, French security forces freed the hostages in a rescue
operation that killed 19 Melanesian militants. Twenty-nine
separatists were arrested in the incident and will be tried in
Paris.
   On Thursday, police arrested Chanel Kapoeri on Ouvea, one of the
Loyalty Islands northeast of the main island. They said he was
suspected of having led the attack at the police station.

   The International Helsinki
Federation, a non-governmental group monitoring violations of human
rights, opened a 3-day meeting in this Yugoslav capital Thursday,
its first in a communist country.
   The executive director of the Vienna-based Federation, Gerald
Nagler, said earlier this week the gathering hoped to ``build
bridges between Yugoslav officials and local human right
activists.''
   The meeting was held in a local hotel without much publicity.
   ``We never asked for permission to meet here. The Yugoslavs are
not exactly welcoming us with open arms, but they are tolerating
us,'' David Matas, a Canadian lawyer from Winnipeg, told The
Associated Press.
   A six-hour discussion was held on the human rights situation in
Eastern Europe.
   Among those attending the meeting were members of an unofficial
human rights forum set up in Yugoslavia last year to operate along
with the Federation.
   The Yugoslavs sketched cases of what they considered human
rights violations in this country _ which is communist but outside
the Soviet bloc _ to about 20 to 30 fellow members of the
Federation.
   Representatives came from the United States, Canada, West
Germany, Italy, Norway, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and
other countries, Matas said.

   Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas of San
Salvador called on the United States and the Soviet Union Thursday
to stop intervening militarily in Central America and instead send
tools that will promote growth.
   He said nations in the region must find political solutions to
their difficulties and the problems must be tackled from within.
   ``Instead of sending weapons, the United States should send
implements for development,'' Rivera Damas said. ``But no matter
how much we shout to them not to send arms, they will keep sending
them as long as the other side (communist countries) keeps sending
them.''
   ``The problems in Central America are geopolitical,'' he said.
``In some countries the United States intervenes and in others the
socialist bloc and through them, the Soviet Union.''
   The archbishop is in Puerto Rico attending a conference on peace
in Central America. He said the Roman Catholic Church has always
supported ``non-intervention and the self-determination of our
peoples.''
   He said Central American leaders should intensify efforts to put
into effect the peace accord proposed by President Oscar Arias of
Costa Rica in August 1986 at Esquipulas, Guatemala. But he admitted
that talks between the Salvadoran government and the guerrillas
have been a ``dialogue of the deaf.''
   ``The Church thinks Esquipulas II (the agreement) is an
opportunity we should not let go by,'' he said.
   The 65-year-old church leader criticized repression by Central
American governments of political opponents, saying, ``We can't
exclude dissidents just because of their ideas.''
   He noted that ``death squads'' are still active in San Salvador,
but less so than in the past.
   More than 70,000 people have died in San Salvador in violence
since 1981, including Rivera Damas's predecessor, Monsignor Oscar
Romero.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright on Thursday denied he
violated ethics rules and said a watchdog group's call for an
official investigation was based on ``unsubstantiated allegations.''
   But a right-wing opponent of the speaker said pressure for a
House probe was increasing.
   Common Cause, a non-profit group which promotes tougher campaign
and ethics laws, called Wednesday for the House ethics committee to
hire an independent counsel to examine two possible breaches of
conflict-of-interest rules by Wright which have been the subject of
newspaper reports.
   In one case, Wright has received far above the normal percentage
of royalties for a book he wrote. The publisher was a campaign
supporter who received more than $250,000 in business from Wright's
re-election committee in the 1985-1986 period.
   Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said the ethics committee
needed to examine whether the speaker's campaign committees were at
all involved in publishing or selling the book, which he said could
be a violation of House or other federal conflict-of-interest rules.
   Wright on Thursday denied there was a campaign link.
   ``My campaign committee did not pay any amount for publishing
the book, nor did it purchase any copies of the book,'' he said. He
said the House rules ``clearly authorize members of Congress to
receive royalty payments of this kind.''
   Wright also denied anything improper in a second issue raised by
Common Cause, his efforts to help constituents, including some
campaign contributors, in their dealings with the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board.
   ``Nothing in the House rules prohibits a member from acting as
an ombudsman for the citizens he represents _ in fact it is
considered to be an important part of our job as representatives of
the people,'' he said.
   Conservative opponents of the speaker, led by Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., have been spotlighting reports of his personal
dealings.
   But they have not formally asked the ethics committee for an
investigation. If a member makes such a request, the ethics
committee is required to respond.
   Gingrich said Thursday his plans to submit such a complaint had
been delayed by GOP lawyers examining the case, but he hoped to
have it ready early next month.
   ``If you are going to take on the second most powerful elected
official in America, you have got to have arguments that are
ironclad,'' he said.
   The Common Cause request, Gingrich said, means the ethics
committee will face an ``overwhelming burden to at least initiate
an investigation'' when he makes his own request.

   A senior government minister announced
Thursday that Indian troops battling Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka will
withdraw from the island nation.
   ``The government is very keen to see the Indian peacekeeping
troops leave,'' the land and river development minister, Gamini
Dissanayake, told Parliament. ``They are definitely going.''
   India has more than 50,000 troops in Sri Lanka to enforce an
accord designed to end the five-year war by militant Tamils
fighting for a separate homeland.
   Dissanayake said the Indian troops would leave in a phased
pullout, but that the date for the initial withdrawal had yet to be
discussed.
   Official sources in the capital, Colombo, said the matter was
likely to be discussed this month when India's defense minister,
Krishna Chandra Pant, visits Colombo. President Junius R.
Jayewardene said Pant will visit the capital May 30.
   Pant is also likely to discuss peace proposals with Tamil
militants, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   India, this island nation's northern neighbor, has a large Tamil
population of its own and mediated the peace accord signed last
July. The accord grants some autonomy to Tamils in exchange for a
surrender of weapons, but it has been rejected by the main Tamil
guerrilla group, the Liberation Tigers of Eelam.
   Indian officials have been holding talks with Tamil rebel
leaders to try to persuade them to accept the accord, but Tamil
rebels say it doesn't go far enough in giving them autonomy.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million population, They claim they are discriminated
against by the majority Buddhist Sinhalese.
   Many Sinhalese also have rejected the peace accord on grounds it
makes too many concessions to the Tamils. Sinhalese extremists have
threatened to kill politicians and others who support it.
   A senior police official said Thursday that Sinhalese extremists
killed a candidate of the governing United National Party in the
central Kandy district. The officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, identified the victim as Jayaratna Heenbanda, who was
going to run in provincial council elections.
   A 19-year-old student, Aruna Saman Dissanayake, also was killed
when gunmen shot at another governing party candidate, Sella
Jayakody, at Horona town, just south of Colombo.

Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine black police officers have quit the
Tampa police union to protest its staunch support of a white
officer fired for making racist and sexist slurs.
   Mayor Sandy Freedman's firing last week of Officer Charles W.
Glass, who admitted making the remarks, was criticized by the
Police Benevolent Association, who said the firing was a violation
of due process.
   The association's support of Glass in turn caused nine black
officers to withdraw from the union in protest.
   R. Jeffrey Stull, an attorney for the police union, urged the
mayor to reinstate Glass, but the mayor was awaiting the return
next week of Public Safety Director Robert Smith, mayoral spokesman
John Dunn said Thursday.
   Then-acting police chief Col. George Fox reprimanded Glass last
month after Glass told police investigators he made sexually and
racially derogatory comments about Officer Vicky Thomas.
   The mayor's policy, however, calls for a punishment of at least
15 days suspension or possibly dismissal for such violations, said
Dunn. The mayor fired Glass last Friday.
   Dunn said there has been no decision on whether Fox should be
disciplined for not following the policy. Both Fox and Police Chief
Austin McLane were out of town Thursday and unavailable for comment.
   One of the nine officers who quit the union said his decision
was prompted not only by the association's backing of Glass but
union president Bob Sheehan's criticism last month of a stinging
manuscript on race relations by Hillsborough County sheriff's Maj.
Arnie Myers, who is black.
   Excerpts of the manuscript were published in The Tampa Tribune
and sparked a flood of complaint calls to the sheriff's office.
   ``The PBA is not in my best interest,'' said detective Bob
Wright, 32, a 10-year officer and union member for the past two
years who said he supported Glass' firing.
   Sheehan met with 20 black officers for three hours Wednesday. He
said the group discussed forming a minority officers' committee to
address complaints, but no action was taken.

<HEAD>Catholic Schools Can Stave Off Enrollment Drop, Educator Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ninety percent of Catholic educators and
church officials surveyed believe enrollment in Catholic schools
will decrease by more than half in the next 15 years, according to
a survey released Thursday.
   Although the survey did not ask respondents why they thought
enrollment would drop, one Catholic educator suggested three
causes: fewer children being born, more parochial schools being
closed, and new schools not opening as people move around the
country.
   The educator, the Rev. Thomas Gallagher, the United States
Catholic Conference secretary for education, suggested that
Catholic education can be marketed better to draw more students.
   He urged parochial schools to return to incorporating the gospel
and academic excellence, a sense of church and community, public
service to that community, and prayer.
   The survey, sponsored by the National Catholic Educational
Association, was released as the weeklong Catholic Education
Futures Project conference got under way Thursday at the University
of Dayton.
   Gallagher said this was the first time 22 groups in Catholic
education have met to discuss religious education problems. More
than 300 people were expected to attend the conference.
   Among the findings in the survey were comments by a few
respondents that Catholic schools were becoming elitist because of
their expense and their dwindling numbers.
   ``Education will be in the hands of the rich because of the
cost,'' wrote one respondent.
   NCEA member and conference chairwoman Sister Suzanne Hall said
of the comments on elitism: ``My sense from all these folks is that
we don't want Catholic schools, Catholic education to become
elitist. I don't see it as inevitable. ...
   ``I think a lot more things need to be done on collaboration at
the parish level,'' she said.
   Gallagher said schooling traditionally has been a community
responsibility deserving of parish subsidy but that this attitude
has faded as fewer parishoners have had children to send to school.
   The report surveyed 336 people representing 18 Catholic
educational organizations, including traditional parochial schools,
youth ministries, adult religious education, Catholic universities
and seminaries. They agreed or disagreed with 50 statements about
the future of Catholic education and said whether they thought the
expected result was desirable.
   Ninety percent of the respondents predicted enrollment in
Catholic elementary and secondary schools would drop to slightly
more than 1 million by 2007, compared with 2.9 million in 1985.
More than 4,300 Catholic schools have closed since the mid-1960s.
   Among other responses to the questions, a majority felt it
unlikely that the government will provide much financial support to
church schools.
   And although most respondents felt that Catholic schools and
parishes will cooperate with one another to broaden religious
education, some felt that pastors are ``too provincial'' or that
high schools ``do not value cooperation.''

   A 5-year-old schoolyard preacher and his
sister were suspended again Thursday for violating school rules,
while angry parents circulated a petition to stop the children's
sermonizing on school grounds.
   The children, Matthew Strode and his 6-year-old sister Pepper,
returned Thursday morning to Eastfield Elementary School from their
third suspension in 18 days, arriving in a car driven by their
mother, Robin. When they refused to go into the school, they were
suspended yet again.
   They stood at an entrance, surrounded by a crowd of reporters,
TV cameras and other schoolchildren, and waited for a cue from
their 10-year-old brother, Duffey, who was outside the school gate.
   Duffey was suspended for 10 days last Friday for refusing to
stop proselytizing and go to class.
   ``For God so loved the world ...,'' Duffey called from the gate,
setting off a stream of preaching from his younger brother.
   ``Now is the day of salvation,'' Matthew cried as Pepper stood
beside him holding a Bible. ``Hell has enlarged herself and opened
her mouth without measure.''
   ``Fools make a mock at sin,'' the younger boy shouted at
Principal Jim Gorst when asked repeatedly to come inside the
school. Both children were then suspended.
   Though she stood beside her brother, Pepper does not preach
because she doesn't want to, the children's father, David, has said.
   Officials at the school, which has an enrollment of 370, call
the preaching a disruption. But the children's parents, who moved
to Marion 17 months ago from Pennsylvania, call the suspensions an
attack on their constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and
freedom of religion.
   Gorst said parents appeared increasingly disturbed by the
preaching on school grounds, and were circulating a petition asking
the Strodes to stop it. Some had complained that their own children
were frightened by the fire-and-brimstone images conjured up by the
sermons.
   He added that the Strode children were being suspended not for
their preaching, but for remaining outside the school building when
school rules require them to be inside.
   ``If the news media was not here and if the offers for talk
shows were not present, I believe in my mind they'd be back in
school,'' he said. He said if the children would agree to come to
school Friday and discontinue preaching, the suspension would be
dropped.
   Hazel Strickland, a school parent who signed the petition, said
she did so because ``they're talking about demons (and) devils, and
(the other children) don't like it.''
   ``I'd just as soon have my young ones home safe,'' said Elaine
Harris, another parent.
   Mrs. Harris said she drove her three children to school Thursday
morning, but turned the car around and drove back when she caught
sight of reporters and two sheriff's cars at the school.
   ``I send my kids to school to get an education,'' Mrs. Harris
said. ``I take them to church on Sunday to get their education in
church. And I don't need some 11-year-old or whatever telling (my
son) he's going to die or we're going to die and all go to hell.''
   The children's father said the people who signed the petition
were ungodly.
   ``Of course that would be the reaction,'' David Strode said.
``If you're in an ungodly community, who would want preaching going
on?''
   As for the school officials, he said, ``They will have to answer
to the Lord for kicking three children out of school. ... One day,
they'll deal directly with the Lord, Jesus Christ.''

   A member of Cuba's cycling team who was
jailed this week for trying to defect to the United States has been
accepted as a political refugee by U.S. authorities, El Norte
newspaper said Thursday.
   The local daily said Cuban Roger Vazquez Vazquez, 25, was taken
Wednesday to Laredo, Texas, on the border with Mexico after the
U.S. government telephoned him in Monterrey with news of his
acceptance.
   Vazquez was in the office of El Norte columnist Federico Arreola
when the call came from U.S. authorities, Arreola wrote in
Thursday's newspaper. Arreola's brother, who is a member of
Mexico's cycling team, gave Vazquez lodging for nearly two weeks in
Monterrey as he tried to get political asylum.
   In a letter addressed to El Norte and published Thursday,
Vazquez thanked his Monterrey friends for their support and
described himself as one ``who abandoned his beloved country to
seek the liberty that we lost 29 years ago and that we're going to
regain in the future.''
   Vazquez abandoned his team following a race in Mexico City last
week.
   The U.S. Consulate in Monterrey noted that the U.S. government
cannot offer asylum to people until they are physically present in
the United States.
   Consulate spokesman Bob Brown said, however, ``We can help them
get to the United States as a refugee if they qualify.''
   Mexican cyclists gave Vazquez refuge in Monterrey and took him
to the U.S. Consulate last week, where his case was being
considered.
   Vazquez became impatient and tried to leave Mexico on his own.
He was apprehended Sunday as he tried to pass through a federal
migration checkpoint at Nuevo Laredo about 16 miles south of Laredo.
   He was jailed in Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo Leon state
about 135 miles south of Laredo, but was later released.
   Vazquez told El Norte he will fly to Miami to join family
members there.

<HEAD>Politburo To Meet Before Party Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tass said Thursday that the policy-making Central
Committee of the Communist Party will meet in what is likely to be
a key session before next month's important party conference.
   The official news agency said the ruling Politburo endorsed a
draft program for the conference, due to open June 28, and that it
would be submitted to the Central Committee and workers for
consideration.
   A meeting of the 300-odd Central Committee members could be held
next week in conjunction with an expected session of the Supreme
Soviet, which is likely to ratify the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning
intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   That would allow time for the largely formal nationwide
discussion of the program before the conference opens.
   Tass did not say what program for the party conference was
endorsed.
   But earlier this week a Central Committee official, Dmitri A.
Lisovolik, said the conference would take up proposals to limit the
term of the party general secretary, the post held by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   In speeches this year, Gorbachev also has said the conference
will consider reforms to strengthen the legal and judicial systems.
   He has said a full meeting of the Central Committee will be held
to discuss the question of relations among the Soviet Union's more
than 100 ethnic groups.
   Politburo membership can be changed at a Central Committee
plenum, and the conference that follows also gives Gorbachev a rare
opportunity to strengthen his support on the Central Committee.
   Gorbachev himself has called for creating a system to replace
aging party officials and has been especially critical of the
18-year rule of President Leonid I. Brezhnev as a period of
stagnation and corruption. Brezhnev died in 1982.
   Lisovolik, chief of the U.S. section of the Central Committee's
International Department, said proposals before the conference will
call for limiting the general secretary to two or three eight-year
terms.
   Reports of a serious policy dispute between Gorbachev and Yegor
K. Ligachev, the No. 2 man in the Kremlin, surfaced in Moscow last
month. Some reports said the dispute rose from the newspaper
Sovietskaya Rossiya's running an article in March questioning
whether Gorbachev's reforms had gone too far.
   Some commentators in the official Soviet press suggested that
the article was the start of an effort by conservatives to halt
Gorbachev's reforms at the party conference.

   A police recruiting stand at a

seven officers and six civilians, authorities said.
   It was not immediately clear what caused the blast and whether
it was intentional.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said one officer was hospitalized
with burns but the other injuries were minor. Four of those hurt
were children, police said.
   The annual Royal Ulster Agricultural Show was in full swing at
the Balmoral Show Grounds, packed with thousands of people on a
clear evening, when the blast occurred.
   The crowd panicked. Parents and children were separated as

   A man who says he is prejudiced ``against
anything that isn't white'' was indicted by a federal grand jury
Thursday on a charge of threatening to kill black presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson.
   Londell Williams, 30, of Washington, Mo., was named in all four
counts of the indictment. His wife, Tammy, 27, was named in three
of the counts, but she was not accused of being involved in the
threat on Jackson's life.
   The indictment said that on or about May 10 Williams ``knowingly
and willfully did threaten to kill and inflict bodily harm upon
Jesse Jackson.''
   The indictment charges both of the Williamses with possessing an
AR-15 rifle that had been altered to make it fully automatic. That
gun has been identified by the government as the weapon that was to
be used in a plot to kill Jackson.
   The pair also were charged with two counts of threatening to
harm a government informant in retaliation.
   The indictment said the Williamses used intimidation and threats
of physical harm on an informant ``with the intent to hinder, delay
and prevent the communication of information relating to the
possible commission of a federal offense.''
   Prosecutors and the couple's attorneys met for several hours
after the indictments issued Thursday but declined comment
afterward. Cynthia Short, Mrs. Williams' lawyer, would say only
that ``They (the Williamses) are scared.''
   Williams, a construction worker, faces a maximum penalty of
three years in prison and $250,000 in fines on the first count. On
each of the other three counts, the Williamses can be sentenced to
10 years in prison and fined $250,000.
   U.S. District Judge Edward L. Filippine set the Williams'
arraignment for 9:30 a.m. Monday.
   In an interview Wednesday at a federal detention center in
Belleville, Ill., across the Mississippi River from St. Louis,
Williams denied conspiring to kill Jackson and said that although
he sympathized with white supremacists, he did not belong to any
extremist group.
   ``I deny that there is a crime done,'' he said. ``I did not
conspire with anyone to kill any presidential candidate.
   ``I do have prejudices ... against anything that isn't white,''
Williams said. But he added regarding Jackson: ``If the man makes
it to president, more power to him.''
   The Williamses, who live in rural eastern Missouri with their
three daughters, have been held without bond in Belleville since
federal agents arrested them at their apartment Friday. The arrests
were announced Tuesday.
   Federal agents initially said Williams claimed he belonged to
two violent white-supremacist groups: the Covenant, the Sword and
the Arm of the Lord (CSA), and The Order.
   But Tom Den Ouden, who heads the Springfield, Mo., FBI office,
said he had found no evidence Williams or his wife belonged to The
Order or the CSA.
   Franklin County, Mo., Sheriff Paul J. Bruns said the case
stemmed from an incident earlier this month, when his department
received a call about a domestic argument in which a woman
brandished and fired into the air what appeared to be an automatic
weapon.
   An informer told investigators that Williams not only possessed
a rifle that had been converted to fire as a machine gun, but that
he was also part of a plot to kill Jackson on June 21 or July 4,
Bruns said.
   The sheriff said the informer led officers to a wooded area,
where they found the altered AR-15 assault rifle. Federal
authorities were brought into the case May 10.
   A Secret Service agent testified Tuesday that agents taped a
conversation in which Williams told the informer the Covenant
wanted the rifle back and was planning Jackson's assassination.
   According to a criminal complaint, Jackson was to be killed
because he ``was getting too close to being president of the United
States.''
   Williams said he had lived in a part of southern Missouri known
for attracting members of extremist groups. He said he knew of
former CSA leader James Ellison, who is serving a federal prison
sentence, and that he knew Richard Butler, the head of the Aryan
Nations, which spawned The Order.
   ``I have been raised the very same way a lot of them have been
raised,'' he said, ``but I'm not part of their activities and I'm
not a member of their groups.''
   Williams' mother, Mildred, of Norris, Ill., said she spoke with
her son by telephone Wednesday. She said her he told her he made up
the story about the assassination plot at a drinking party and the
informer believed it.

<HEAD>Official Hints Pakistan Will Continue Arming Afghan Guerrillas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan's acting foreign minister,
Zain Noorani, returned Thursday from a goodwill visit to Moscow,
but indicated that this country will continue to help arm
anti-communist Afghan guerrillas.
   A leader of insurgents fighting Afghan and retreating Soviet
troops told The Associated Press his forces might concentrate on
taking a provincial capital in northern Afghanistan.
   Noorani, minister of state for foreign affairs, returned to
Karachi from a three-day visit to the Soviet Union which he was
reported as saying was ``more than satisfactory.''
   It was a notable restoration of harmony for two countries long
at opposite sides of the war in Afghanistan.
   Pakistan's official APP news agency quoted Noorani as saying
that although ``the purpose of the Pakistan mission to Moscow was
of goodwill,'' Pakistan will abide by the April Geneva accord and
the concept of ``symmetry.''
   He was referring to the agreement signed by Washington, Moscow,
Kabul and Islamabad that outlined the withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan. The United States and Soviet Union agreed they
will keep supplying the guerrillas known as the mujahedeen and
Afghan communist forces, respectively, until one side or the other
stops.
   ``I have been quoted as saying that Pakistan will stop all
assistance to the mujahedeen. ... This is incorrect. ... We will
fulfill all obligations that we have taken upon (ourselves) in the
Geneva accord and after (the Soviet pullout) becoming operative on
May 15, 1988,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The Geneva accord covered four basic principles: the pace and
time frame of the nine-month Soviet withdrawal, the halt of foreign
interference in the Afghan conflict, the right of Afghans to
determine their own government and the safe return of some 5
million refugees from Pakistan and Iran.
   Pakistan is bound by the accord to stop serving as conduit for
mainly U.S. military supplies to the guerrillas, known as the
mujahedeen, although Pakistan officially denies it has ever done so.
   There have been confirmed reports that dozens of trucks have
crossed the loosely guarded border from Pakistan to Afghanistan
with arms and ammunition for the Moslem insurgents.
   ``It is for those who matter (the United States and the Soviet
Union) to stop the supply of arms to any individual faction of
Afghan people,'' Noorani was quoted as saying. ``This is a simple
case as the physicians can diagnose themselves.''
   Noorani's remarks indicated he reached an understanding with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that Soviet-Pakistani
relations should improve, although Pakistan has served as
headquarters for the guerrillas fighting Kabul's Marxist government
and the Soviet troops who have supported it since December 1979.
   The visit commemorated the 40th anniversary of Soviet-Pakistani
relations.
   Moslem Pakistan achieved statehood in 1947 when it was
partitioned from Hindu India under an agreement with the British
empire.
   As Noorani was speaking in Karachi, the chairman of the
seven-party muhjahedeen alliance said in Peshawar, Pakistan that
the insurgents would begin attacking Afghan army strongholds which
the muhahedeen felt they can take easily.
   ``We will be sure enough we can occupy and the enemy cannot
resist,'' Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the revolutionary
Hezb-I-Islami guerrilla party, told the AP.

   Soul singer James Brown was released from
jail on $24,218 bond Thursday after his second arrest in a
continuing feud with his wife.
   Brown, 55, was charged with possession of PCP, unlawful
possession of a pistol, resisting arrest, simple assault and
battery against his wife and failure to stop for police.
   After spending the night in jail, he was released on bond and
ordered to appear in court June 6.
   Deputies went to Brown's Beech Island home Wednesday after his
wife, Adrienne, went to neighbors and said Brown was beating her,
Aiken County Sheriff Carrol Heath said.
   Police in Bedford, N.H., said Mrs. Brown would be charged Friday
with possession of PCP, in addition to criminal mischief and arson
charges already filed against her in connection with a fire in her
Bedford hotel room May 10.
   Police Chief Richard Audette said Thursday that a container
confiscated during the incident was found to contain the drug.
   Brown was charged April 4 with assault with intent to murder,
aggravated assault and battery after allegedly beating his wife
with a pipe. He also was charged with firing a gun into a car while
she was inside.
   Mrs. Brown was arrested April 9 in nearby Augusta, Ga., on drug
charges.
   Brown, known to fans as the ``Godfather of Soul,'' won his
second Grammy award last year for his recording of ``Living in
America.''

   Heinz Ruhnau, the chairman of the
airline Lufthansa, said Thursday that Europe's skies are
overcrowded with commercial aircraft and military airspace should
be reduced.
   He told a news conference that increases in airline traffic in
recent years have filled the skies over Europe's major cities and
stretched airport capacity to the breaking point.
   Ruhnau said the amount of airspace reserved for military
aircraft must be reduced if civil aviation authorities are to cope
with the growing demand for air traffic.
   Large portions of the sky over West Germany and other European
nations are reserved for military flights and maneuvers.

   U.S. and Soviet negotiators agreed
Thursday that negotiations toward a peace settlement in southern
Africa offer the warring parties a good chance of resolving their
differences.
   ``The issues have been clearly identified and the structure (for
a settlement) is in place if the parties wish to take advantage of
it,'' said Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
African affairs.
   Crocker made the remarks in the Portuguese capital a day after
meeting with Anatoly Adamishin, Soviet deputy foreign minister, to
discuss progress towards a comprehensive peace agreement among
Angola, Cuba and South Africa.
   ``The United States and the Soviet Union are trying reach an
agreement that will provide a political framework for the countries
in conflict to resolve their own problems, '' Adamishin told a
separate news conference.
   Their talks were aimed at supporting efforts by the countries
involved to end Angola's 13-year civil war and bring independence
to the neighboring South African-ruled territory of South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia.
   Crocker spoke on Thursday with Jose Manuel Durao Barroso,
Portuguese deputy foreign minister. Angola is a former Portuguese
colony.
   Angola's war pits the Soviet- and Cuban-backed Angolan
government against the UNITA rebel movement supported by the United
States and South Africa.
   South Africa, backed by the United States, is calling for an
estimated 40,000 Cuban soldiers to withdraw from Angola before it
agrees to implement a United Nations Security Council resolution
granting independence to Namibia.
   A South African newspaper said Thursday that Cuban troops in
Angola are less than 50 miles from the border with Namibia.
Business Day cited South African intelligence sources it did not
identify.
   Angola says 9,000 South African soldiers, using warplanes,
long-range artillery and armored cars have been operating up to 185
miles inside Angola since last year.
   Both Crocker and Adamishin said their governments rejected the
idea of partitioning Angola into two territories, dominated
respectively by the Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola government in Luanda and UNITA, or the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola.
   Crocker confirmed he will report to President Reagan and
Adamishin said he will report to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
before the Moscow summit May 29.
   Crocker attended a May 3-4 meeting in London among Angolan,
Cuban and South African negotiators. The South Africans and
Angolans last Friday held a separate meeting in Brazzaville, Congo
where another four-party negotiating session was expected next week.
   Crocker said Thursday any further meetings prior to the Moscow
summit are ``unlikely.''

   More than 100 people from minority
ethnic groups marched Thursday to demand federal protection from
majority Albanians in a southern province, an official report said.
   The Tanjug news agency said the marchers represented about
50,000 people, mostly of Serbian and Montenegrin nationalities, who
signed a petition. They threatened ``an organized exodus'' from
Kosovo province if their efforts fail.
   According to official estimates, about 24,000 Serbs and
Montenegrins have emigrated from the province since 1981. Many
claim discrimination by ethnic Albanians who make up about 85
percent of the population in Yugoslavia's least developed region.
   In 1981, bloody riots broke out in the province, and some
Albanians called for increased autonomy for Kosovo.
   Tanjug said the petition representatives appealed in a meeting
with the president of the Parliament, Dusan Popovski, for an
``urgent undertaking of measures without which there is no peace,
survival and freedom of the Serbian and Montenegrin people in
Kosovo.''
   They said that otherwise Serbs and Montenegrins will ``organize
their own self-defense of their freedom, dignity and honor.''
   ``If we fail, we will have to resort to an organized exodus from
the province,'' Tanjug quoted the petition as saying. The agency
did not elaborate.

   Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami of the
Mediterranean island nation of Malta is forsaking Libyan military
protection and seeking closer ties with the United States, the
Italian news agency ANSA reported Thursday.
   It quoted Fenech Adami, a nationalist, as saying his government
is trying to restore good relations with foreign nations,
especially Western ones.
   In 1984, a Libyan-Maltese treaty, arranged with the Socialists
who then governed Malta, provided that Libya would come to Malta's
defense if Malta's neutrality was jeopardized. Malta lies 200 miles
north of Libya, the North African nation under the leadership of
Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   Before Fenech Adami's party, allied to the Christian-Democrats,
came to power a year ago, Malta was governed for 16 years by
Socialists. Critics accused them of playing Libya and the United
States off each other.
   Fenech Adami's remarks came during a two-day visit to Rome this
week, the news agency reported.
   He was quoted as saying he will discuss promoting U.S.
investment on Malta during a visit with President Reagan in the
United States in July.

   A white man was convicted Thursday of
hitting a black man over the head with a piece of concrete after a
1987 civil rights march that attracted more than 20,000 people.
   Randall Allen Norton, 31, of Toccoa, was found guilty of assault
after the jury deliberated 2{ hours in Forsyth County Superior
Court. He was to be sentenced Friday.
   Norton had been tried on the charge in December but the jury
failed to reach a verdict. His brother, Roger Dale Norton, 29, was
also arrested in the attack of Dennis Alfredo Edwards of Smyrna and
is to be tried in July.
   Edwards has a piece of his skull missing as a result of the
attack, said District Attorney Rafe Banks III.
   The civil rights march in Forsyth County was a response to
attacks by Ku Klux Klan members and others on a smaller march held
the week before in the virtually all-white county north of Atlanta.

   An air force helicopter crashed near
the capital, killing the co-pilot and injuring the pilot, the
Defense Ministry said Thursday.
   The ministry statement said authorities were investigating why
the Soviet-made MI-25 helicopter crashed. It went down Wednesday at
Lake Managua, about six miles east of Managua.
   The Soviet Union has provided supplies to the leftist Sandinista
government in its war against U.S.-supported Contra rebels. The
government and Contras have recently held talks on ending the
fighting, which began in 1982 and has killed more than 26,500
people.

   A moderate earthquake shook the Guatemalan
capital and surrounding areas Thursday, the Seismological Institute
said. No injuries or damage were reported.
   Guillermo Songton, an employee at the institute's monitoring
station in the southern part of Guatemala City, said the quake
measured 4.0 on the Richter scale, occurred at 4:29 p.m. (6:29 p.m.
EDT) and lasted eight seconds.
   Its epicenter was on the grounds of the University of San Carlos
of Guatemala, on the capital's southwestern edge.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   A quake with a magnitude of 4 can cause moderate damage.

   A Libyan Foreign Ministry official on Thursday
denied Australian charges that Libya was responsible for a riot in
the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, JANA news agency
reported.
   The Libyan agency, monitored in Rome, quoted the unidentified
official as dismissing allegations of Libyan involvement as
``baseless and not true.''
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia had charged ``there is no
doubt about a Libyan connection in Vanuatu'' following reports in
the Australian news media that Libyan-trained activists were
involved in Monday's violence.
   JANA quoted the Libyan source as saying such a statement
represented ``a plain attempt to justify the open Australian
interference in the internal affairs of an indepedent state _
Vanuatu.''
   Riots in Vanuatu's capital, Port Vila, killed one person was
killed and injured nine Monday. Police said 30 people were arrested
after a march by 2,000 villagers over land-leasing rights turned
violent, with protesters looting shops and smashing store windows.
   Australia and New Zealand airlifted riot control gear there at
the request of the government. Vanuatu lies about 1,200 miles east
of Brisbane, Australia.
   Vanuatu sent shockwaves through the generally pro-Western South
Pacific in 1986 when it decided to establish diplomatic ties with
Libya and the Soviet Union.
   Formerly the Anglo-French New Hebrides, Vanuatu was administered
jointly by Britain and France from 1906 until 1980, when it
achieved independence. It has a population of about 130,000.

   Anger and guilt but ``no satisfying
answers'' remain for the families and friends of 27 people killed
in a fiery bus crash, a priest said Thursday at the funeral for
three of the victims.
   Seven of the dead were buried Thursday, all but two at the North
Hardin Memorial Gardens graveyard that abuts the high school they
would have graduated from one day.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson declared a day of mourning, with flags at
half-staff throughout the state.
   ``The saying is trite but painfully true: They had their whole
lives before them,'' said the Rev. Leo Craycroft during Mass at St.
Christopher Church in Radcliff for Mary Catheryn Daniels, 14;
Denise Ellen Voglund, 13, and Amy Christine Wheelock, 14.
   Twenty-four children and three adults were killed Saturday night
when a pickup truck traveling in the wrong direction on Interstate
71 struck a church bus, rupturing its fuel tank and setting it
ablaze.
   The crash occurred in Carroll County, 100 miles northeast of
this Army post town, as the bus owned by Radcliff First Assembly of
God church carried members of the church's youth group and their
guests home from a day at the Kings Island amusement park north of
Cincinnati. The driver of the truck allegedly was drunk.
   ``Why do bad things happen to good people? None of us can answer
that question,'' said the Rev. Gene Waggoner at a citywide evening
memorial service. ``And if we could, it wouldn't take away your
grief.
   ``I suggest that you do not blame anybody on that bus. I suggest
that you don't blame God; God did not cause this. There is sin in
this world ... and there are those who make wrong choices, and
innocent people pay the price.''
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Tait, commander
of nearby Fort Knox, were among dignitaries in attendance at the
service in the football stadium of North Hardin High School.
   Bleachers in the stadium can hold 2,400 people, and chairs were
set up on the field to boost capacity to about 4,000. Rows of
people crowded around the perimeters of the field.
   Most of those in attendance broke down during the singing of
``What a Friend We Have in Jesus'' at the start of the service, and
many clasped hands and supported others during prayers.
   W. Don Tennison, pastor of the Radcliff First Assembly of God
Church, read letters from President and Nancy Reagan and Vice
President and Barbara Bush during the memorial.
   ``Your pain and loss is ours too,'' said the letter from the
Reagans. ``Your countrymen are with you in prayer.''
   After the ceremony, Wilkinson and the preachers who led the
service slowly made their way down a row of family members to
express their sympathies.
   The stadium lies at the edge of North Hardin Memorial Gardens
cemetery, where five of the victims of Saturday's crash were buried
earlier Thursday.
   The first victim to be buried was Julie Ann Earnest, 12,
following a graveside ceremony that coincided with the Mass. The
four girls attended Radcliff Middle School, and their graves are
all in the same section of North Hardin Memorial Gardens cemetery.
   A fifth middle-school pupil, eighth-grader Tina Michelle
Mustain, 14, was buried near Chandler, Texas, after a funeral in
Tyler, Texas. And eighth-grader Chad Witt, 14, was buried in
Liberty, Ky.
   Fourteen-year-old Joshua Conyers, credited with pushing his
younger brother, Aaron, through a window to safety as the bus
burned, also was buried in the cemetery adjoining North Hardin High
School, where he was a freshman.
   Conyers was from nearby Vine Grove, where his funeral was held.
His father, Larry Conyers, said survivors of the crash told him
Joshua could have escaped, but ``jerked away from the others, ran
back and crammed Aaron out a window.''
   Aaron Conyers, 13, remained in critical condition at Kosair
Children's Hospital in Louisville.
   ``There are no real satisfying answers,'' Craycroft said during
the Mass, which drew an overflow crowd to the small brick church on
a hilltop overlooking the middle school.
   ``We expect older people to die. ... Children in their prime do
not die,'' Craycroft said. ``We may feel guilty, we may feel angry,
and all of these are quite natural.''
   Speakers were set up outside St. Christopher to accommodate
mourners who could not be seated inside. The coffins were decked
with flowers and wreaths and lined end-to-end before a flower-laden
altar.
   The driver of the pickup, Larry W. Mahoney, was in the prison
unit of Humana Hospital-University of Louisville, where a
spokeswoman said Mahoney's family refused to allow release of
information about his condition. Mahoney has been charged with 27
counts of murder.
   Thirteen bus passengers besides Aaron Conyers remained
hospitalized Thursday. Six, including Aaron, were in critical
condition.

<HEAD>Cardinal Turns Down Request To Push For Marcos' Return</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's leading Roman Catholic
churchman rejected an appeal Thursday by Ferdinand Marcos' wife to
ask the president to allow the ousted leader back into the
Philippines for his mother's funeral.
   Imelda Marcos said in a radio interview Friday that she and the
former president were sure to go home eventually because ``we are
on God's side.''
   Cardinal Jaime Sin, archbishop of Manila, said he received a
telegram from Mrs. Marcos ``pleading with me to voice an appeal to
the government to allow former President Marcos to return to the
country for the funeral of his mother.''
   The cardinal said he forwarded the request without comment to
President Corazon Aquino and other government officials who have
``better information.''
   Marcos' mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, died May 4 at age 95. No
date has been set for the funeral.
   Mrs. Aquino, citing national security reasons, has refused to
allow Marcos to return from exile in Hawaii. He fled there after a
popular uprising toppled his 20-year government on Feb. 25, 1986.
   Cardinal Sin was a strong opponent of the Marcos government. In
1986, he appealed to his followers to go into the streets to
protect soldiers who broke with Marcos.
   Hundreds of thousands heeded his call, triggering the uprising
known here as the ``people power revolution.''
   In her telegram, Mrs. Marcos said: ``I plead to you as the
spiritual leader of the Filipino people to voice an appeal of a
mother to allow a son, my husband, Ferdinand, to return to his
motherland and pay a final homage to his mother.''
   In a telephone interview Friday with radio station DZXL, Mrs.
Marcos said her husband was grieving over the death of his mother.
   ``The other day we thought we would have to bring him to the
hospital because of the hardship and embarrassment he is
experiencing,'' she said. ``In any part of the world, even a
convict, a criminal, would be allowed to go out on the wish of a
mother to visit her.''
   ``I am sure that I and the president will go home because we are
on God's side,'' she said.
   Marcos' supporters have staged several rallies in Manila since
Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' death to demand their leader's return. On
Wednesday, police used tear gas to break up about 5,000 Marcos
followers who were marching toward the American Embassy.

<TEXT>
   Joining a growing number of jurists, a federal
judge here on Thursday declared unconstitutional the sentencing
guidelines implemented last fall for federal crimes.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene ruled that the 1984 law
setting up a commission appointed by the president to write the
guidelines violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of
powers.
   The judge found that Congress had unconstitutionally delegated
legislative power to the seven-member U.S. Sentencing Commission.
   ``The system thus departs from the basic principle that those
who make or administer this nation's laws shall be accountable for
their actions,'' Greene ruled. He accused lawmakers of
relinquishing their power ``to insulate Congress from extended
debate and political complaint.''
   ``It also departs from the Constitution's requirement for clear
delineations between and among the three branches of government,''
he said of the system.
   The judge, however, stayed his order pending Supreme Court
review of the question. So far, 59 federal judges have struck down
the guidelines as unconstitutional, while 31 have upheld the
regulations.
   Public Citizen, a Ralph Nader group that is challenging the
guidelines on behalf of criminal defendants, and the Justice
Department on Thursday petitioned the Supreme Court to review a
decision by a federal judge in Kansas City that struck down the
guidelines.
   The petition seeks high-court review before the decision is
appealed to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis.
   The guidelines, intended to eliminate wide disparities in
sentences for the same crimes, provide a complicated formula for
determining prison terms for defendants convicted of federal crimes.
   Greene said he was particularly troubled by the lack of
accountability for the way sentences are imposed under the
guidelines, which took effect last fall for crimes committed after
Nov. 1.
   ``No one _ criminal defendant, victim, and the public _ can know
who or what branch of government is responsible for sentences that
are imposed, and there is no one who can legitimately be held
accountable, politically or otherwise, for sentences that may be
regarded as too lenient,'' Greene wrote.
   ``The simple and constitutionally tested system of allocating
responsibility for crafting sentencing policy to Congress and for
imposing individual sentences to a particular judge is essentially
gone, replaced by a hodge-podge of contributions to sentencing from
personnel from several different branches'' of government, he added.
   The commission includes three judges who are appointed by the
president from a list of six federal judges submitted by the U.S.
Judicial Conference.
   Unlike the delegation of legislative powers to regulatory
agencies, ``the matters being delegated involve not the regulation
of economic forces and factors but basic policy decisions of law
enforcement, of criminal control and of punishment,'' Greene said.
   The case before Greene involved a defendant convicted last month
of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute. Defense attorney
Greg English said that under the old sentencing rules, client
Wilbert S. Brodie would face a minimum imprisonment of five years.
   English said the guidelines would require a much longer minimum
sentence but that without the probation department's report it
would be impossible to predict what the regulations would prescribe.

   The top U.S. and Soviet diplomats
assigned to African affairs discussed on Wednesday progress in
negotiations toward peace in southern Africa in preparation for
superpower summit.
   Anatoly Adamishin, deputy foreign minister, and Chester Crocker,
assistant secretary of state for African affairs, met at the U.S.
Embassy to talk about efforts to end Angola's 13-year civil war and
to secure independence for South-West Africa (Namibia).
   ``This meeting was agreed on at their last meeting in London two
weeks ago,'' U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde told reporters
outside the mission gate.
   ``They're here to discuss the (southern African) regional issues
_ certainly the Angolan and Namibian points _ and to look at the
situation in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa.''
   Reporters were not allowed into the embassy complex in this
Portuguese capital, and Ms. Clyde said neither Crocker nor
Adamishin would make any public statements on the meeting Wednesday.
   Both envoys were scheduled to give news conferences Thursday
before leaving to report to their governments before the Moscow
summit May 29 of President Reagan and Kremlin leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Angola is a former Portuguese colony. Namibia is ruled by the
Pretoria government in defiance of a U.N. resolution.
   U.S.-brokered mediation seeking a comprehensive peace settlement
in southern Africa were stalled for years over demands by each side
that the other withdraw its forces from Angola first. Talks
progressed in recent weeks following a joint Angolan-Cuban proposal
in March for the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.
   Previously, Angola's Marxist government, the Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola, demanded that South Africa pull its
troops out of southern Angola and Namibia before Angola would
consider sending home the estimated 40,000-45,000 Cuban support
troops on its soil.
   South Africa, backed by the United States, initially demanded a
Cuban withdrawal first. However, it has since joined delegations
from Angola, Cuba and the United States in a May 2-3 negotiating
session in London. It also attended a second meeting with the
Angolans in Brazzaville, Congo, last week.
   The Angolans also want both South Africa and the United States
to halt all aid to the Angolan rebel movement UNITA _ the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola.

   Soul music legend James Brown, charged last
month with trying to kill his wife, was arrested again Wednesday
after allegedly fleeing from officers responding to a call at his
home.
   Later in the day, authorities said Brown was charged with
possession of the drug PCP following tests on a substance found in
his car.
   Deputies were dispatched to Brown's Beech Island home Wednesday
afternoon after Brown's wife, Adrienne, went to a neighbor's house
and said her husband was abusing her, said Aiken County Sheriff
Carrol Heath.
   When officers arrived, Brown sped away in his car but was
overtaken about a mile and a half away, Heath said.
   Brown told officers he was late for an appointment and was
speeding to make up time, the sheriff said. A scuffle ensued, but
no injuries were reported.
   The 55-year-old singer, known to fans as the ``Godfather of
Soul,'' was charged with failure to stop for police, resisting
arrest, assault against an officer and illegal possession of a
weapon _ a revolver found in the car, Heath said.
   Heath also said 7 grams of a substance later identified as
phencyclidine, the hallucinogen PCP, was found in the car.
   Brown remained jailed Wednesday night at the Aiken County
Detention Center pending a bond hearing Thursday morning, said
Magistrate B.J. Millwood.
   On April 4 Brown was charged with assault with the intent to
murder, aggravated assault and battery after allegedly beating his
wife with a pipe. He also was charged with firing a gun into a car
while she was inside.
   The singer, who was released on bond the next day, has denied
those charges. Mrs. Brown subsequently filed for divorce.
   Mrs. Brown was arrested on April 9 in nearby Augusta, Ga., on
drug charges, which she claimed was a set-up by a friend of her
husband's.
   Brown, whose hits include ``Please, Please, Please'' and ``It's
A Man's World,'' won his second Grammy award last year for his
recording of ``Living in America.''

Aide Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev appears to have
recognized that ``disinformation'' _ the planting of false stories
in the world press _ also hurts the Soviet Union, a senior U.S.
government official said Wednesday.
   Charles Z. Wick, director of the U.S. Information Agency, also
said the Soviet leader has promoted measures to establish a freer
flow of information between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``I believe that Mr. Gorbachev has recognized that
disinformation is also contrary to Soviet interests,'' Wick told a
meeting of the Council on Foreign Relations, a policy study
foundation.
   He said that during the U.S.-Soviet summit last December,
Gorbachev ``agreed that disinformation was counterproductive to his
efforts to reduce tensions, eliminate misunderstandings and create
greater trust between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.''
   Wick said that for several years, the Soviets ``planted stories
in the Third World media, and spread them throughout the world,
that U.S. military scientists had created the AIDS virus as a
biological warfare weapon.''
   But Wick said that during Gorbachev's visit to Washington last
December, Gorbachev ``agreed that disinformation was
counterproductive to his efforts to reduce tensions.''
   Wick said that later, ``following a confrontation between
Gorbachev and (U.S. Secretary of State George) Shultz, the Soviets
admitted they had erred when they claimed AIDS to be a creation of
U.S. germ warfare research. Yet they continued sporadically to
spread the AIDS disinformation story. ''
   After a Soviet-American meeting in Washington April 20-22 to
discuss media relations, Wick said ``promises were made that this
disinformation would now cease.''
   ``Already we have seen _ perhaps _ the first fruits of our
discussions on disinformation,'' Wick said. He said future Soviet
actions would determine how sincere the Soviet undertakings are.
   In a later interview Wednesday with editors and reporters of The
Associated Press, Wick cited other Soviet moves to improve
U.S.-Soviet contacts. He said these included a Soviet agreement to
allow the Voice of America, the USIA's radio network, to cover the
Moscow summit this month.
   He added that ``it also looks like'' Voice of America will be
allowed to open a bureau in Moscow. ``Amerika,'' USIA's
Russian-language magazine, may be allowed to increase its
circulation from 14,000 to 100,000 copies.
   Wick said Soviet citizens will also be able to purchase American
books by mail order at a permanent American book display in Moscow.
   In Moscow, the weekly Moscow News reported Wednesday that
officials have lifted restrictions on the sale of American and West
European newspapers and magazines, which will be sold at ordinary
newsstands in the future.
   Wick also said that Soviet officials promised this month to stop
interfering with U.S. domestic radio broadcasting ``through Cuban
transmissions.''
   Three U.S. stations operating on the frequency of 1,040
kilohertz complained last year that English-language Soviet
broadcasts from Cuba were interfering with their operations.

   Philippine Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said
Wednesday U.S.-Philippines relations are on an upswing.
   ``I am confident our relations will continue to be strong and
will be reinforced in the future,'' Ramos said after meetings with
Secretary of State George Shultz and Michael Armacost,
undersecretary of state for political affairs.
   Earlier, he held extensive talks with Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci, his official host, and met with members of congressional
committees on Asian and military affairs.
   The meetings ``were very fruitful ... in terms of expediting
delivery of military equipment and joint projects'' under U.S. aid
programs, Ramos said.
   Progress also was made on plans for restoring the monument at
Corregidor, the site of a historic struggle against the Japanese
invasion of the Philippines in World War II, he said. U.S.
veterans' organization are to provide some of the financing for the
project.
   Ramos has declined to comment on talks in Manila on the future
of American military installations in the islands, saying the
matter is being handled at another level. But he said other
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations recognize
the security value of the bases to the region.
   However, he spoke Wednesday about his country's nuclear weapons
ban that could threaten the future of U.S. bases in the islands.
That ban is outranked by the ``higher interest'' of national
security, he said in a television interview on Cable News Network.
   Those who have sponsored a bill in the Philippines Senate that
would enforce the ban against U.S. ships ``do not really represent
all of the security opinions in the Philippines,'' he said.
   The Philippines constitution contains a clause banning nuclear
weapons but ``it is also equally true that in the same constitution
that this ban should be consistent with our national interests,''
Ramos said. ``While there is a nuclear-free interest, there is to
my mind a higher interest which is the national security interest,
so the door is not completely closed....''
   ``After all, this is just a bill that still has to be passed by
the House of Representatives and go through the complete
legislative process,'' he continued. ``It's not yet the law ...
it's not yet the closed door.''
   The United States has said enforcement of the ban would be
incompatible with American policy of refusal to confirm or deny the
presence of atomic weapons on particular vessels.
   Ramos said the Philippines request for higher payments for U.S.
use of military bases in the Philippines is not a matter of ``just
plain dollars and cents,'' but of the value of the installations to
the security of Southeast Asia and the South China Sea.
   ``If we are to be full partners there must be a better
balance,'' he said. ``The Philippines is very concerned about being
dragged into the global responsibilities of the United States, and
it is on the basis of this recognition of each other's roles that
the bases review is now being conducted.''
   The secretary said he agrees with President Corazon Aquino's
policy of preventing her deposed predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos, now
in Hawaii, from returning to the Philippines. ``I was part of the
Cabinet Crisis Committee that recommended this step and, in fact,
the cabinet as a whole unanimously recommended'' Marcos' exclusion,
he said.
   Ramos was scheduled Thursday to address the Council on Foreign
Relations and meet with media executives in New York City, and he
said was looking forward to a class reunion Friday at his alma
mater, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.
   Ramos also planned stops in Fort Bragg, N.C., Atlanta and Los
Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco in California before leaving
for Manila on May 26.

   The man accused of conspiring to
assassinate Democratic presidental candidate Jesse Jackson says he
sympathizes with white supremacists, but denies belonging to
extremist groups.
   ``I do have prejudices ... against anything that isn't white,''
Londell Williams said Wednesday from a federal detention center.
   The 30-year-old Missouri man and his 26-year-old wife, Tammy,
were being held without bond in this city across the Mississippi
River from St. Louis. Federal agents arrested them at their
apartment Friday. The arrests were announced Tuesday.

   Wall Street's underlying dread of another stock
crash has been aggravated by two significant events: an upward
spike in interest rates and the first notable selling by big
institutional investors in several weeks.
   Unresponsive to good news and obsessed with the bad, the stock
market took another sharp spill Wednesday, depressing the Dow Jones
industrial average to its lowest point in more than three months.
Broader market indexes also fell sharply.
   The declines themselves were not particularly new or alarming,
because prices have been bouncing up and down for a while in a
post-crash market dominated largely by brokers buying and selling
to each other.

   European governments are resisting a renewed U.S.
push to ban all trade-distorting farm subsidie throughout the world
by the year 2000.
   American and European officials staked out sharply differing
positions on agriculture policy in an opening round of talks on
Wednesday among trade and finance ministers from 24 leading
industrial countries.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng called for an early
commitment by America's trading partners to phase out government
subsidies used to prop up domestic farm prices and help boost
agricultural exports. President Reagan first proposed this last

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III is launching
a counterattack against his critics and telling conservative
senators he won't resign in the absence of evidence of wrongdoing.
   Meese's private lawyers said Wednesday that a Senate

violating a White House policy by assisting scandal-plagued Wedtech

   The Senate has overwhelmingly rejected the
first conservative attack on the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile
treaty and backers say the chamber should now move quickly to
ratify the pact.
   In a key early test, the Senate voted 91-6 against a point of
order raised by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who claimed that Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev wasn't authorized to sign the treaty
and the Senate should therefore not ratify it.
   After that tally late Wednesday, Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., said, ``I think the vote we've just had is an
indication of the strong support we have for this treaty. Let's get
on with it.''

   The nation's cable television subscribers will
face ``massive blackouts'' in service under a new federal policy
allowing local stations to buy exclusive rights to syndicated
programs, cable industry officials say.
   Under the policy approved 3-0 by the Federal Communications
Commission on Wednesday, cable TV systems that broadcast the same

<HEAD>Vietnamese Army Deserters Languish in Refugee Camps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHANAT NIKHOM, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 500 to 600
Vietnamese army deserters languish in Thai refugee camps, largely
forgotten and unwanted.
   Thailand doesn't want them to stay.
   Vietnam won't take them back, even if they wanted to go back.
   Western countries, including the United States, for the most
part refuse to resettle them as refugees, even though they maintain
they are victims of Vietnam's communist system.
   The deserters are men who were sent to fight guerrillas opposing
the Vietnamese-backed government in Cambodia.
   The most are at the refugee camp here in Phanat Nikhom near
Bangkok, where about 430 live together in ramshackle bamboo and
canvas huts, isolated from other Vietnamese who fear them as part
of the communist government they fled.
   This rejection and the trauma of the war and their flight have
created what one Western relief worker called a ``hopeless,
helpless, lost subculture.''
   In a camp where most refugees are preparing for new lives in the
West, many deserters have remained for years, deep in depression.
Some have attemped suicide, officials said. Still others have
turned to drugs and violence.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and now has 125,000 troops
fighting 50,000 or more guerrillas.
   More than 1,000 Vietnamese soldiers have fled to Thailand since
1981, according to Thai officials, but desertions have decreased in
more recent years, probably because the fighting no longer is near
the Thai-Cambodian border, which made it easy for soldiers to
desert.
   Some 300 deserters arrived in Phanat Nikhom in 1985, when
thousands of Vietnamese troops overran guerrilla bases near the
border, but only 80 came in 1987 and just two so far this year.
   The deserters, usually single males with few skills or ties
abroad, are among the most difficult refugees in Thailand to
resettle.
   Canada has taken the most, nearly 150 since 1981.
   Two-thirds of the 76 deserters resettled last year were taken by
Scandanavian nations, which traditionally accept difficult cases.
   The United States, by far the biggest resettler of Indochinese
overall, has taken only about 100, largely because it considers the
deserters part of an occupying army that persecuted others.
   Some aid officials criticize the refusal to accept more
deserters as being based on political, not humanitarian,
considerations.
   ``People don't think of us as people who escaped the army of the
communists,'' complained Hoang Manh Chuong, a 27-year-old deserter
who has been here since 1984 and was rejected by the United States
in January. ``They think we are still bad people.''
   Chuong said he fled while on guard duty in August 1983, a month
after arriving in western Cambodia. He wandered into the jungle for
five days with nothing to eat, following the sunset to the Thai
border, he said. He added that Khmer Rouge guerrillas held him
captive for two months and beat him as a suspected spy. He was then
jailed in Aranyaprathet in Thailand for 10 months before reaching
Phanat Nikhom.
   Like several others interviewed, Chuong said he deserted because
the communists persecuted his family after 1975. He said his
father, a former South Vietnam soldier, was held in political
``re-education'' camps for six years.
   Chuong said Vietnamese who flee to Thailand as boat people and
get more favored treatment as refugees are rich people who can
afford to pay for boat passage. The deserters, he added, are poor.
   Chuong said he continues to study English in hopes of getting to
the United States, but he added that many other deserters are ``too
angry ... and don't care any more.'' They get drunk and wind up in
the camp jail, he said.
   Another deserter, Le Truong Truc, 29, became addicted to heroin.
   ``I felt very sad. ... I've been in this camp a long time,'' he
explained. He had been accepted by Finland but the Finns withdrew
their approval after he was arrested on a charge of buying drugs
from a Thai trader in January.

<HEAD>German-Israeli Relations Better but Unease Remains</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Fromm, a naval cadet with the first West
German military unit ever to visit Israel, said he had mixed
feelings about being here _ ``We don't know what the reaction is
going to be.''
   Moshe Biermann, 54, a Holocaust survivor, felt anxiety about the
young sailors being on Israeli soil _ ``When I see German uniforms,
I still feel a stab in my heart.''
   The scene at the port of Haifa recently reflected the state of
relations today between West Germany and Israel on its 40th
anniversary as a nation.
   ``If you look back on the history of the two peoples, we both
have come a long way,'' said Aviv Shir-on, the Israeli Foreign
Ministry spokesman. ``Relations today generally are very good.''
   But both Israelis and Germans professed lingering unease when
dealing with each other on a personal level, and experts say that
is because neither nation has come to terms with the past.
   ``The Germans feel the need to forget. There is a strong current
to minimize the Holocaust,'' said Professor Yeshayahu Nir of Hebrew
University, who produced a documentary on Israeli-German youth
exchanges.
   ``In Israel, the subject has been given ritual treatment in
public celebrations, but it isn't discussed openly in the families,
and not given enough attention in the schools.''
   The unease was apparent when the West German cadet ship Gorch
Fock pulled into Haifa harbor in early May, with 21-year-old Peter
Fromm and six other cadets shopping around warily for souvenirs and
Moshe Biermann feeling the stab in his heart.
   Nir said German and Israeli teen-agers he filmed for the
documentary became friends on a superficial level, but ``there was
an undercurrent of subjects they didn't want to touch.''
   When the discussion did turn to the Holocaust, hidden barriers
often became visible.
   In Nir's film, a German teen-ager identified as Eva summed up
the attitude of many of her peers: ``The Israelis thought we should
feel guilty because of what our fathers and grandfathers did. But I
don't feel guilty. I didn't do it.''
   An Israeli youth responded: ``I don't feel that Eva should feel
guilty personally. But I do expect her to remember, to feel bad
about it and to have the courage to ask about it.''
   Writer Lea Fleischmann, who taught high school in Germany until
emigrating to Israel in 1979, said German teen-agers face a
difficult task because most of the older generation remained silent
about the Nazis.
   ``If the Germans after the war had punished the guilty, they
would have washed themselves clean of this part of the history,''
said Ms. Fleischmann, 40, the daughter of Holocaust survivors.
``They should have done it for the younger generation.''
   Things are better on a government-to-government level. A close
network of economic, cultural and scientific ties binds them:
   _Trade last year reached $2 billion. Israel exported $640
million worth of goods, mainly fruit, flowers and clothes. Germany
exported $1.4 billion, including industrial machines, cars,
electronics and chemical products.
   _Israeli and German scientists cooperate on more than 80
projects, including cancer research, physics and solar energy.
   _Israel sends more youth groups to West Germany than to any
other country, and for Germany, Israel is second only to France in
that regard.
   As the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors reach adulthood,
there are signs that many Israelis no longer reject all things
German as a matter of principle.
   Thousands of Israelis drive German-made cars and most don't
bother to remove the hand-sized ``D'' (Deutschland) sticker
identifying the country of origin as West Germany. German-made
washing machines and kitchen appliances are common in Israeli
households.
   More and more Israelis are studying the German language.
   A travel agency in downtown Jerusalem advertises flights to
Frankfurt on Lufthansa, the West German airline. In the 1950s,
Israelis couldn't have made the trip because their passports were
stamped ``Valid for all countries except Germany.''
   The Arab uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories has
brought the two nations evewn closer, partly because the West
Germans have not criticized Israel's reaction to it.
   When Philip Jenninger, the president of West Germany's
Parliament, visited Jerusalem recently, he told Israeli leaders he
had come to show that Germany was a loyal friend, especially at a
time when the Israel is the target of international criticism.

<HEAD>Fall Outlook: Law and Business Schools Are Hot, Medicine Is Not</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As college students sort out their academic and
career choices for next fall, law school looks hot. So does
business. But engineering, a craze five years ago, keeps sliding.
   Teaching, down and out since the 1970s, shapes up as next fall's
comeback story.
   Medicine and nursing continue to fall from favor. But there are
hints that the sharp, decade-long enrollment slide may be slowing.
   College admissions counselors add it all up this way: most
students still put great weight on financial prospects in making
career and study choices.
   But social service seems to be slowly resurfacing as a goal
among at least some of next fall's students.
   ``I see a little bit of a rise in idealism again,'' said Beth
O'Neil, a spokeswoman for the Law School Admissions Council.
   Here, in brief, is what officials say is the fall outlook for
half a dozen major fields of study.
   _Law: The nation's 175 accredited law schools are being flooded
with more than 300,000 fall applications from 75,000 students, 19
percent more than last year and the most since 1980, according to
the Law School Admissions Council. Applications dropped in the
mid-1980s but began recovering last fall and are now surging.
   At Georgetown Law School, applications rose 32 percent, while
Berkeley saw a 30 percent increase. The University of Michigan
stopped accepting applications for its 370 openings at 5,500.
   ``Starting salaries in excess of $65,000 and $75,000 have not
gone unnoticed,'' said O'Neil.
   What's unclear to admissions officials is whether the increase
is just a blip caused by factors like the televised legal fireworks
of the Iran-contra hearings and the Supreme Court confirmations or
the popularity of the TV drama ``L.A. Law.''
   _Teaching: The national attention showered on teaching, improved
starting salaries and hints of renewed idealism are pushing next
fall's enrollments up. A few top graduate schools like Harvard
report 50 percent gains in applications for next fall.
   More typical, however, is the University of South Carolina,
where the number of teacher candidates next fall is expected to
exceed slightly the 215 of last year, but come nowhere near the
peak of 650 in the mid-1970s, according to Leonard F. Maiden,
director of student services of the College of Education. ``The
news is getting out that teaching does pay reasonably well,''
Maiden said. The national average is now $28,000.
   In addition, he said, ``I get more and more women who say, I
want to be a teacher, because I see that bringing much joy in my
life. I hear that weekly, and sometimes daily.''
   _Nursing: Undergraduate rolls at nursing schools dropped 21
percent from 1983-87, according to the American Association of
Colleges of Nursing, which represents 400 schools of nursing.
   The 1987-88 school year counted 85,477 undergraduate students,
down 14.5 percent from 99,923 the previous year. Only 4 percent in
an annual national survey of freshman attitudes expressed interest
in nursing, compared with 10.2 percent in 1974.
   Starting salaries are up, exceeding $30,000 in some cities. But
nursing is still having trouble competing with other career
opportunities for women.
   ``I don't think the shortage is going to be resolved quickly,''
said Diane McGivern, chairwoman of New York University's graduate
nursing school, where next fall's freshman class will number just
30, down from about 80 in 1980.
   ``I think the demographics are still against us. But I think
nursing will start attracting students again because service as a
value is coming back a little bit,'' she said.
   _Business: Despite Wall Street insider scandals and last
October's market crash, business has lost little of its luster. One
quarter of entering college freshmen express interest in business
careers, continuing a steady increase since the early 1970s.
One-quarter of all bachelor's and master's degrees awarded last
year were in business, far ahead of any other field, according to
the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business.
   But some schools report applications for next fall are not up as
spectacularly as in previous years.
   Nancy Anderson, director of admissions at NYU's graduate school
of business said fall applications were up 5 percent to 2,500 for
her school's 360 spots. A year ago, application gains of 20 percent
were commonplace at NYU and other leading schools.
   ``Our sense is that we will see a slow increase every year. An
MBA (master's degree in business administration) is quickly
becoming the equivalent of an undergraduate degree as a requirement
for entry level jobs,'' Anderson said.
   She and others report that Wall Street's woes have led business
majors to consider such alternatives as marketing, management and
real estate.
   _Medicine: The nation's 127 medical schools will receive a
projected 26,700 applications for about 15,000 freshman spots, a
4.7 percent decrease from the previous year. No one sees the
14-year downtrend reversing yet, but this fall's expected decline
is about half that of the previous year, said Joan Hartman Moore,
spokeswoman for the Association of American Medical Colleges.
   Cost is probably the biggest factor. A year at a public medical
school averages about $13,000 for residents. At private colleges,
the cost typically runs $24,000, according to the association.
   Eighty-two percent of medical students graduate in debt,
averaging $35,621, and 20 percent have debts exceeding $50,000.
That, plus rising malpractice insurance costs and starting salaries
averaging about $25,000, has made students think twice about
medical careers.
   Even top schools have seen a falloff in applications since the
peak year of 1979, but some report interest is picking up slightly
for next fall.
   Thomas Lentz, assistant dean of admissions at Yale University
medical school, said his school has received 2,154 applications for
about 100 freshman spots, ahead of the 1,935 last year, but
considerably less than the 3,261 in 1979.
   _Engineering: The number of undergraduates doubled from 201,000
in 1974 to a peak of 406,000 in 1983, but the number has since
tailed off to about 369,000. And the number of freshmen engineering
students has likewise fallen, from 115,303 in 1982 to the current
99,238, according to the Engineering Manpower Commission in
Washington.
   At Texas A&M, which has one of the largest engineering schools,
admissions director Bill Lay said the school has admitted 2,732
students for next fall, compared with 3,566 in 1982.
   The decline is not necessarily unhealthy, said commission
spokesman Richard Ellis. ``It's not a craze or fad anymore,'' he
said. ``Interest is now reverting to people wanting an engineering
career for its own sake, not just because of the economics of a
given era.''
   Engineering's surge five years ago was fueled by the Reagan
defense buildup and job booms in aerospace and electronics. The job
market remains fairly strong, according to Ellis, especially for
civil engineers, and first-year engineers often command salaries of
$30,000 or more.

   Louis Gossett Jr. and LeVar Burton,
reunited for the first time since the blockbuster 1977 miniseries
``Roots,'' predict the Christmas sequel will become a classic in
itself, a kind of American answer to Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas
Carol.''
   ``I think it's very wonderful to be able to anticipate sitting
down with my loved ones and watching not only the Dickens classic,
but `Roots Christmas' as well, and hopefully year after year. It
has the potential be a classic,'' said Burton, 31, whose career was
launched by the miniseries 12 years ago.
   ``This is as close to Dickens as we can get in an American
story,'' Gossett said on a break in filming on the grounds of the
Hermitage, the plantation home of President Andrew Jackson. ``This
is ours and we should cherish it. It's our American classic.''
   ``Roots'' still ranks as the highest-rated miniseries ever, and
Part 8 was the third highest-rated television show in history,
according to A.C. Nielsen.
   The two-hour sequel, scheduled to air Dec. 11 on ABC, also stars
Avery Brooks, Shaun Cassidy, Michael Learned and Kate Mulgrew.
   The story was written by David Eyre based on an outline by Alex
Haley, who grew up in the small western Tennessee town of Henning
and wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning book ``Roots'' after tracing
his ancestry 200 years.
   In the sequel, Kunta Kinte (Burton) and Fiddler (Gossett)
clandestinely plan to lead a group of slaves to freedom on
Christmas Eve in 1770.
   Gossett, who in 1982 won an Academy Award for his supporting
role in ``An Officer and a Gentleman,'' said he expected a new
generation to discover ``Roots'' through the sequel.
   ``It's a new kind of audience, the young people that maybe
couldn't have grasped what the show was about the first time,''
Gossett said. ``It's very special, very spiritual.
   ``It's even better because of, I guess, the mutual growth of all
of us and the growth of America especially,'' he said.
   ``Twelve years ago, do you think Jesse Jackson would have the
chance to win anybody's primary, much less running or thinking
about it? The consciousness of America has evolved.''
   Producer Mark Wolper, the son of executive producer David L.
Wolper, said the sequel evolved from his father's idea that there
were too few black Christmas shows.
   ``In thinking about what black kind of Christmas show he could
tell, he called Alex Haley,'' the younger Wolper said.
   ``And Alex Haley said, `Oddly enough, I've just been thinking
about examining my relatives' roots at Christmas. And the two of
them said, `What a great idea, let's write a `Roots Christmas.'''
   The film's budget is about $4 million, expensive for a two-hour
television movie, said Bernie Sofronski, co-executive producer. In
comparison, the last 12 hours of ``Roots'' cost $6 million, he said.
   ``When something has the history of `Roots,' there's a lot at
stake for the producers and actors involved to do this again,''
said Sofronski.
   ``We're also hoping, if we do our job right, that this will be a
perennial Christmas show.''
   Burton said the quality of the script convinced him he should
participate in the sequel. Before this, he said, he avoided roles
similar to Kunta Kinte.
   ``For the first five years of my career, I did whatever I felt
was necessary in order to create distance between Kunta and
LeVar,'' he said. ``Five years ago, the thought of playing the
character again and perhaps forever and inextricably linking LeVar
and Kunta was a lot more scary.
   ``I don't feel the fear so much of never being able to step out
of the shadow of Kunta.''
   Burton has shed the image in a successful new role as a member
of the crew in the syndicated television series ``Star Trek: The
Next Generation.''
   Gossett said he was especially enthusiastic about working with
Burton again. ``I'm astounded at LeVar's growth as a person and as
an actor,'' he said. ``He doesn't know it, I guess, but I've been
learning a lot from his growth. We were pretty close before, but
we're much, much, much closer now.''
   ```Roots' was my first job,'' said Burton. ``It is not often you
get an opportunity to play a character as powerful as this twice in
your career.''

   BACK TO `JUAREZ' _ That one-hour pilot for the series ABC killed
earlier in the season, ``Juarez,'' will be shown by the network May
28. The hero is Mexican-American lawman Rosendo Juarez (Benjamin
Bratt Banda) who takes on criminals in El Paso, Texas, along the

<HEAD>Erie's Cleaner Now, No Fires in Almost 20 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOROTHY GAST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 20 years after the Cuyahoga River last
caught fire, officials say Lake Erie and its tributaries are
cleaner than they have been in decades.
   Scores of Lake Erie beaches will be open in Ohio this year, and
more than 25 million walleye thrive in Erie's waters. Boating has
become so popular that many marinas in the Toledo area are running
out of dock space.
   A few decades ago, Lake Erie had only three clean beaches, and
fish were dying at a rapid rate. An oil slick on the Cuyahoga
caught fire June 22, 1969.
   The dramatic improvement has been caused primarily by a decrease
in phosphates and other nutrients that caused algae to flourish in
Lake Erie, using up oxygen and killing fish, said Laura Fay, a
research associate for the Center for Lake Erie Area Research.
   Phosphate pollution levels were decreased largely through
improvement of sewage treatment plants, she said.
   Half the people living in the Great Lakes basin live near Lake
Erie, including residents of Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit and Erie,
Pa. Eleven million people use Lake Erie for their drinking water,
Ms. Fay said.
   Although fish now appear to be thriving in the shallowest of the
Great Lakes, Ms. Fay said the bottom of Lake Erie and its
tributaries has sediments contaminated with such materials as
mercury and cancer-causing PCBs.
   Funding for research and cleanup on the Great Lakes has been
decreasing, she said, even though contaminated sediments are a more
chronic problem than phosphates.
   ``I hate to see people sit back and rest on their laurels,'' Ms.
Fay said. ``We've really come a long way, but the toxic problem is
something we really can't see. Some of the effects are really going
to be subtle. We might have lower reproductive efficiency of
walleye or darter, but we're not going to see that for a while.''
   The Cuyahoga River, which has ignited three times since 1936,
remains an area of concern, along with several other Lake Erie
shipping channels, because of the pollutants that have settled on
the bottom.
   The International Joint Commission on Great Lakes Water Quality,
in a 1987 report, said sediments in the Cuyahoga are tainted with
PCBs, ammonia, cyanide and lead.
   Because of the contaminants, the Ohio Department of Health
advises people not to eat catfish caught in the channel and carp
caught in the open waters of Lake Erie, said Deborah Gray, a
toxicologist in the Division of Epidemiology.
   Catfish and carp feed on the bottom of Lake Erie, she said, and
tests have shown that nearly half have PCB concentrations that
exceed levels recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   The Health Department also has issued an advisory for all fish
caught in the Black River in Lorain and the Ashtabula River in
Ashtabula, which empty into Lake Erie. There is no advisory for the
Cuyahoga.
   ``An advisory is just that _ an advisory,'' she said. ``We're
talking about a very small incremental risk to someone who would
eat this fish. But what we're saying is that there are still fish
exceeding the FDA limit and we think people should know about
this.''
   But shallow Lake Erie is cleaner than many of the Great Lakes,
largely because it is is able to flush itself every 2.6 years,
officials said. The flush time for some of the upper lakes, which
are 1,000 feet deep, is more than a century. Ms. Fay said Lake Erie
also has more organic substances that bind up toxic materials.
   Bob Wysenski, environmental scientist for the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency, said Ohio's beaches generally are safer for
swimming now than at any time in the past decade.
   He cited water quality statistics at 20 Lake Erie beaches that
show a general downward trend in fecal coliform, a bacteria that
can cause flu-like symptoms or ear and eye infections.
   There have been no documented cases of severe illnesses caused
by swimming in Lake Erie in the past decade, he said.

<HEAD>When Bad Things Happen to Good News</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's more than one way to improve the bottom
line in your business or in your household account or in the trade
balance of your country.
   In each instance you can cut your buying and spending, raise
your income, or do both simultaneously.
   In the latest trade report, for March, the figures showed the
United States raising its gross exports sharply, a decidedly
bullish sign for the economy. But, imports rose, too, and that gave
a bearish cast to the news.
   Among other things, the news also created confusion in the minds
of those who couldn't understand why an improvement in the trade
figures could lead to lower stock and bond prices, and fears of
inflation and recession.
   Wasn't this glittering news? Yes. But it was accompanied by bad
news.
   The goods news was this:
   _The United States is able to export. U.S. goods are competitive
abroad in both price and quality. The U.S. manufacturing sector,
whose weakness once was exemplified by the term ``rust belt,'' has
regained strength.
   The result: More U.S. jobs, a strengthening manufacturing
sector, a boost to an economy that for too long has been dependent
on consumption and that may not be able to depend on consumers much
longer.
   _The turn was dramatic. It was strong enough to suggest that
henceforth the trade deficit would decrease gradually, thus
returning to the United States some of the dollars left overseas
for goods imported during the past 20 years.
   Fewer dollars overseas means less borrowing by the United
States. It also reduces U.S. dependence on foreign investments in
real estate, stocks and bonds. Less foreign dependence means less
risk of volatility in U.S. markets.
   The bad news was this: Domestic consumption remains strong, as
indicated by a simultaneous growth of imports. True, exports surged
to an all-time high of $28.97 billion. But imports rose, too,
although at a lesser rate, to $38.7 billion.
   It means the United States is still trying to have its cake, eat
it and smile at the same time, which is as difficult a stunt
economically as it is culinarily.
   Reacting almost immediately to reports of a shrinkage in the
trade deficit, Wall Street was at first elated. It meant strength.
Securities prices improved.
   Then it looked at the rise of imports, and saw trouble in the
form of an overheated economy. It questioned whether the United
States could expand its foreign markets and domestic markets
together without overheating.
   Overheating is an apt and vivid term in economics, and one of
the clearest in a very foggy environment. When an economy strains
to produce more than it is equipped to produce it gives off smoke
in the form of inflation.
   There is a way out, and that is to hire more people and expand
capacity.
   One way to expand capacity is to reopen idle factory space, but
in all probability that space has remained idle because it was the
least efficient. Hiring more people might help, but they are likely
to be the least skilled.
   With American production facilities being utilized at 82.7
percent of capacity in April, highest in eight years, many
economists fear that strains are appearing. If capacity hasn't been
reached, they claim, it soon will.
   At the same time, the latest civilian unemployment rate fell to
5.4 percent, considered low by most modern standards and
representing a continuing decline from monthly rates above 7
percent as recently as 1986.
   Balancing the good news against the bad, many economists and
investors felt the latter outweighed the former. They reasoned the
economy was overheating and that a coolant was needed. That coolant
would be higher interest rates.
   There are notable and vociferous exceptions to the consensus.
Some economists insist the news is good on balance, but that no
amount of good news will convince a nation predisposed, and for so
long a time, to seek the bad.
   And, as you might expect, there are investors today who believe
that when news is viewed so negatively it is time for them to pick
up bargains.

<HEAD>Incinerator or Recycler? Company Makes Product From Hazardous
Waste</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MORGAN CITY, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Kent is making money and enemies at
both ends of the 275-foot-long contraption he runs near this town
of oil men and shrimp boats.
   His hazardous waste kiln at Marine Shale Processors _ big as a
football field with a smokestack 140 feet high _ is a high-profile
presence on the flat southern Louisiana horizon.
   It's also a target of two groups that want to shut it down: some
local residents who suspect it's dangerous and business competitors
who accuse the company of skirting environmental regulations.
   Marine Shale, which employs about 240 people, denies the claims
and insists that it cooperates fully with regulators.
   In Washington as well as Louisiana, the debate centers on
whether Kent's contraption is an incinerator, which must meet one
set of regulations, or a recycling plant, required to meet others.
   Kent charges $200 to $300 per 50-gallon drum to take in
hazardous wastes from the companies that make them, ranging from
glues to various petroleum by-products, but excluding PCBs,
dioxins, asbestos, explosives, mercury compounds or
disease-carrying materials. He receives 720 tons a day.
   He heats the waste to about 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit for 2{
hours while running it through a whirling kiln that looks like an
elongated cement mixer. He sells the resulting aggregate as
material for road beds and parking lots. He has about 10 customers
so far.
   If Marine Shale's claims about its process and product are found
valid by state and federal officials examining the company's
operations, it could render competitors' incinerators obsolete
while revolutionizing the way a growing national hazardous waste
disposal problem is handled.
   It could also be very lucrative for Marine Shale. Company
attorney and vice president George Eldredge says a patent is being
sought for part of the process and licensing arrangements will
follow.
   Eldredge likes to say that incinerators create hazardous waste
for storage in landfills, while Marine Shale eliminates it in the
creation of a product.
   At Marine Shale, next to Bayou Boeuf, conveyors lift piles of
various materials _ some sludgy, some solid and some that serve as
their own fuel _ into a huge rotating cylinder.
   Cameras at both ends monitor the inside of the kiln, which looks
like Hollywood's vision of hell, red hot with glowing embers and
tumbling debris. A computer keeps tabs on temperature, gases and
pressure, shutting down the operation if anything goes awry,
according to Eldredge.
   Earlier this year Marine Shale gave members of Congress clear
plastic letter openers containing a small amount of the aggregate
in the handle. The public relations gimmick prompted Richard
Fortuna, lobbyist for a trade group representing competitors, to
write to the lawmakers and urge them to contact the Capitol's
safety engineer ``to arrange for the transportation of this
material to a permitted facility for proper disposal.''
   ``Sure, we did it,'' acknowledged Fortuna, director of the
Hazardous Waste Treatment Council. He contends the Marine Shale
product is dangerous.
   Kent says envy motivates the Treatment Council. He's charging
less than half what his competitors do to take in hazardous waste,
and then turns it into a product that sells for $1 a ton.
   ``It makes them sad,'' he says sardonically.
   The Treatment Council has joined South Louisianians Against
Pollution, or SLAP, to fight Marine Shale.
   Sally Herman, head of SLAP, says she opposes Marine Shale
because she believes, admittedly without evidence, that the company
may be a factor in the area's unsually high cancer rate.
``Personally, I think they're contributing to it,'' she said.
   SLAP and Fortuna's group have threatened a federal suit to try
to halt Marine Shale's operations.
   The battle has spread to Congress.
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., attacked the company in April in a
subcommittee hearing, suggesting that laws might be needed to close
loopholes that allow Marine Shale to operate without an incinerator
permit.
   Kent suggested that Breaux was acting on behalf of his friend
Bill Broadhurst, whose law firm has represented Rollins
Environmental Services Inc., a Treatment Council member. Broadhurst
is the attorney and lobbyist who accompanied former presidential
candidate Gary Hart on the ship ``Monkey Business'' with Donna Rice.
   Breaux spokesman Bob Mann labeled Kent's suggestion ridiculous.
   The 140-foot emissions stack at Marine Shale puts out a steady
plume of vapor, which the company says is clean. Water used to
``scrub'' the gases of particles that might pollute the air is
re-used in the process, he said. Emissions pass through a ``bag
house,'' where, according to Eldredge, they are filtered through
more than a thousand bags, resembling vacuum cleaner bags, before
release into the air.
   Eldredge stressed that none of the water from the Marine Shale
process is discharged into the bayou. He cited state Department of
Environmental Quality records showing that traditional
incinerators, such as the one run by Rollins in Baton Rouge,
contaminate ``scrub'' water that must be treated before it is
discharged into the Mississippi River, a source of drinking water
for New Orleans and other communities.
   About 1,750 companies that generate hazardous materials in 42
states ship them to Marine Shale, according to spokesman Larry
August. The materials are tested to ensure that they can be safely
put in Marine Shale's kiln, he said.

   ``They shift wastes, they don't treat them,'' Fortuna asserted.
   When Fortuna complains that the Marine Shale aggregate doesn't
meet specifications to be declared non-hazardous, Eldredge counters
that those specifications are meant to apply to hazardous wastes _
not to a product that meets industry standards for use as road
material.
   The EPA has taken samples of the product regularly and so far
has found no reason to stop its distribution, said a lawyer for the
agency, James Neet.
   ``We're not saying the aggregate is pure,'' he said. ``What
we're saying is that the aggregate does not pose an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the public health or environment.''
   Fortuna's group complains that Marine Shale, by calling itself a
recycler instead of an incinerator, is avoiding the stringent
regulations of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
   If Marine Shale did go through the permit process under that
act, Eldredge said, it could take three years, during which the
company would have to shut down, eliminating a payroll approaching
$10 million. That would probably shut the company down for good, he
said.
   ``What you've got here is really an economic battle,'' observed
Neet, who said the EPA has been investigating Marine Shale for two
years, partly to determine whether it should indeed be regulated as
an incinerator.
   Neet said two federal grand juries are also looking into Marine
Shale's operations, but he declined to give details.
   ``One thing to remember is that their entire facility is
governed by the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act,'' he said,
adding that the Treatment Council has been falsely implying that
Marine Shale isn't regulated.
   Indeed, Chris Roberie of the Department of Environmental Quality
said Marine Shale's air quality permit is stricter than the one
issued for Rollins' Baton Rouge plant because it was issued four
years ago when the facility had to meet tougher rules than when
Rollins' permit was issued about 18 years ago.
   State and federal regulators have cited Marine Shale for several
alleged ``opacity violations,'' meaning smoke or vapor emanating
from the plant was darker than it should have been.
   The state last month ordered Marine Shale to install equipment
for constant monitoring of its stack, and the company has announced
it signed a $750,000 contract for such a system.
   Water quality on Bayou Boeuf is another concern.
   Mike Schurtz of the state environmental agency said it's true
that Marine Shale re-uses, rather than discharges, waste water.
But, he said, the agency has ordered the company to clean up oily
material it believes was leaked into the bayou from a storage barge
and an ``oyster bucket'' used to transfer material.
   The agency's order also calls for Marine Shale to apply for a
stricter water quality permit. Schurtz said Marine Shale must make
sure rainwater that runs off the site doesn't carry dangerous
materials. Eldredge said the company will meet all requirements.
   Ms. Herman is unconvinced. She dismisses criticism that her
group is being manipulated by Treatment Council companies that have
been accused of polluting the environment.
   ``I'm not taking up for Rollins,'' she said. ``But what does it
matter what somebody else is doing? If you're wrong, it doesn't
matter what anybody else is doing.
   ``My main concern is my family and the people in this
community.''

   They came to Appalachia in the late
1960s and early 1970s as eager, young college students determined
to wipe out something most of them had never experienced firsthand:
rural poverty.
   As they prepare for a reunion on Memorial Day weekend, former
members of Volunteers in Service to America, Appalachian Volunteers
and other federal volunteer programs say their work showed the
power of community action but often put them at odds with local
officials.
   If they made some difference in the lives of poor people in West
Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia, the volunteers also
agree their own lives were changed.
   Then-volunteer, now-U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller called his VISTA
work in the tiny community of Emmons a turning point in his life.
   ``After two years, I got hooked,'' said Rockefeller, who later
gave up his plans for a foreign service career to serve in West
Virginia's Legislature and as secretary of state and governor
before winning election to the Senate in 1984.
   Linda Cooper Elkinton, who served in Kentucky, said the
experience of recruiting ``500 eager agents of social change''
started her on a life of community organizing.
   ``I was not a politically aware person at 18,'' said Elkinton,
who now works for a social service agency in Huntington. ``But I
certainly was three years later after volunteering.''
   The volunteers' first hurdle was gaining acceptance.
   ``The poor people up the hollows accepted them pretty well,
particularly once they got to know them a little bit,'' said Jeff
Monroe, who headed West Virginia's Office of Economic Opportunity
from 1964 through 1968.
   But Monroe said the next step, acceptance by local officials,
often failed.
   As long as anti-poverty workers helped repaint schools, organize
recreation programs and teach nutrition classes, there was little
trouble with local power brokers. But the volunteers' activism
didn't stop there.
   To young, idealistic college students who had taken seriously
President Johnson's challenge to ``replace ... despair with
opportunity,'' it soon became apparent that local politicians were
often part of the problem.
   ``When you start fixing up a one-room school, you start
wondering, `Why didn't the local school board fix this up a long
time ago?' Then you ask, `Why aren't there books?' One step at a
time, you start seeing a pattern,'' said Gibbs Kinderman, a former
volunteer who recently completed a series of radio shows about
Appalachian volunteers for the West Virginia Humanities Foundation.
   Volunteers realized Appalachian residents had little power to
influence their own affairs because of unresponsive and often
corrupt bureaucrats who controlled county jobs and welfare benefits.
   ``Organizing power groups is a scary thing for any structure
that's taking advantage of people,'' Monroe said. ``They (local
officials) were very threatened.''
   Many impoverished Appalachian residents knew well what they were
up against and ``were mad about it _ strip mining, the roads, the
schools, lack of jobs, the courthouse gang,'' said Ronnie Sue
Jaffe, now a hospital worker in New York City and an organizer of
the May 29 reunion in Twin Falls State Park.
   Kinderman described county governments in the coal-mining
regions of Appalachia as ``set up to do things the way the coal
companies wanted it.''
   Huey Perry, whose novel ``They'll Cut Off Your Project''
describes anti-poverty, anti-corruption efforts in Mingo County,
said the ``whole system was as corrupt as it could be.''
   Elections, he said, were ``more like sporting contests. And
after the election, the losing party would just say, `They were
able to buy more votes than we were.'''
   Perry said it would be hard to beat the voter turnout in Mingo
County, where the 1960 federal census showed 19,879 voting-age
residents but county records listed 30,331 registered voters.
   A Fair Elections Committee, supported by anti-poverty volunteers
but run by local residents, purged the voter registration books of
5,000 people who were dead or who had moved away.
   Still, the volunteers differ over whether their reform efforts
had much longterm success.
   In Mingo County recently, more than 50 present and former public
officials, among them the head of the anti-poverty program, were
indicted on charges of conspiracy to subvert the free election
system.
   But, said Monroe, ``That they've been indicted at all shows a
change. There was a time when people did a lot and never got
indicted for it.
   ``There was a time when getting a teaching job, getting on
welfare and staying on it, even getting a job on the state highways
(department) were all controlled,'' he said. ``I'd venture to say
that doesn't exist. At least, it's much improved. Of course, there
are those who think I'm naive to say that.
   ``You could say we didn't make any significant changes,'' he
added, ``but I think we did.''
   The percentage of Appalachian households below the federally
defined poverty level has dropped from 31.2 percent in 1960 to 14
percent in 1980, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission
in Washington, D.C.
   The high school dropout rate among the region's 18- to
24-year-olds has declined in the same period from 31.5 percent to
25.3 percent, the commission said.
   But the average annual jobless rate in the region increased from
5.4 percent in 1970 to 7.4 percent last year, according to the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   ``There are still terrible pockets (of unemployment) in West
Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky,'' said commission statistician
Judith Maher.
   Would a new War on Poverty work today?
   VISTA has shrunk from a peak of 4,580 full-time volunteers in
1975 to 2,740 today.
   Anti-poverty programs declined mainly because of resistance from
local politicians and the government's growing preoccupation with
the Vietnam War, Perry and other observers said.
   But Milton Ogle, who recruited volunteers in Kentucky and now
works at the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund in Charleston,
said more young people would volunteer today if national leaders
again stressed social issues.
   ``I'm not being political,'' he said. ``The fact is, there has
been a major reduction in these programs.''
   How is the '60s and '70s volunteer effort recalled by those
meant to be its beneficiaries?
   ``At least it provided some hope,'' said Herb Meade of Kermit.
``People slowly but surely realized that some changes could be
brought about. And it did away with the fear, the intimidation,
that we had among the people. You don't find that much anymore.''
   Mae Shrewsbury of Shady Spring agreed the VISTA workers helped.
``They gave us more courage than anything else,'' she said.

   Details in the deaths of the young man and
woman bore chilling similarities.
   Both had changed their hair color _ she to black, he to yellow.
Both had come to Hollywood from far away, hoping to be in the
movies. Both ended up hustling on the streets. And when their young
bodies were found, they were in pieces _ hers severed with surgical
precision, his dismembered with a chain saw.
   Elizabeth Short and Tracy Leroy Nute died 40 years apart.
   Miss Short, a drifter from Massachusetts, became known as the
``Black Dahlia,'' but her murder in 1947 was never solved. She died
at 22.
   Nute, a drifter from Kansas City, Mo., was killed last summer.
He was 19.
   Max Franc, a 57-year-old Fresno university professor, was
charged with first-degree murder.
   In the dream capital, many young runaways find only nightmares.
   ``It makes you wonder how many got chopped up who we just never
found out about,'' said Gary Yates, a psychologist who specializes
in the runaway problem for Los Angeles Children's Hospital.
   Police and social service workers guess the young runaway
population in Hollywood numbers 1,000-5,000.
   ``If you stay out there long enough, you're going to be a victim
or a suspect,'' said police Lt. Ed Hocking, who is in charge of
Hollywood Division detectives.
   Kids congregate at the famous intersection of Hollywood and
Vine, where the brass stars on the Walk of Fame give tourists a
glimpse of glamour. Down on Sunset Boulevard, the boys and girls
can be found hustling ``tricks,'' despite efforts by police.
   They tell officers they are 18 years old but are often 15 or
younger, say Hocking and Yates. They say they can go home anytime,
but they're often unwanted there.
   ``The real story,'' Yates said, ``is that they usually come from
a history of terrible abuse _ physical and sexual abuse.''
   Their new life is little improvement. Hollow eyes, scabs and
roughened skin are signs of drug and alcohol abuse and chronic
malnutrition.
   Sleeping in abandoned buildings called ``squats,'' the children
often fall victim to pimps, drug dealers and ex-convicts who, like
Fagin in ``Oliver Twist,'' need young prey.
   ``A lot of pedophiles live in Hollywood,'' said Lois Lee, who
founded Children of the Night in 1979. ``It's like they all moved
here when they heard this is where the kids are.''
   Ms. Lee's agency is a non-profit volunteer group that helps
young people escape the streets. Her volunteers help about 100
children a month, almost all of whom have fallen into prostitution.
   Ms. Lee believes otherwise inexplicable deaths are tied to the
pimps. She described a diabetic girl who died in a hotel room.
``She was locked in her room without her medicine.''
   Many of the street children are middle-class youngsters running
from homes in the Los Angeles suburbs. But Yates keeps records on
cases from 47 states.
   ``There has always been a draw to Hollywood,'' he said. ``This
isn't like Haight-Ashbury in the '60s, though. Those young people
were college-age. They were rebelling against their parents. These
kids in Hollywood are much younger. They've been rejected by their
parents.''
   With no place to belong, the new arrivals in Hollywood turn to
older people who will feed them first, then degrade them, Ms. Lee
said.
   ``Their parents say they can't come home. ... In a sad way, with
prostitution, they've got job security.''
   For those not yet tied to a pimp, life is hand-to-mouth. So they
seek security with the pack, Hocking said. They steal to survive.
   ``Some of them, girls as well as boys, shave their heads so the
pimps won't want them,'' Hocking said. ``Everyone rips them off, so
they hang together.''
   In the squats, which are often covered with satanic grafitti,
they listen to ``heavy metal'' tapes on pilfered cassette players.
   ``It's sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll,'' Hocking said. ``But I
haven't met one who wants to stay on the street.''
   At the storefront office of Children of the Night, an
18-year-old girl calling herself Mimi stopped in and said she
didn't know where she was going to stay.
   The squat she had stayed in the night before was set afire by
someone looking for a girl named ``Star,'' she said. ``He says
he'll keep burning places down until he finds Star.''
   Mimi said she'd like to be a model and that she left home
because her father tried to rape her. She said she met a ``sweet
boy'' who gave her a gold ring. The ``boy'' is about twice her age.
   Another girl at Children of the Night said that during her years
on the street, she lived with older drug-dealer boyfriends until
she joined an out-call prostitution ring. The adults in the ring
moved her into an apartment.
   ``They gave me my food. They washed my clothes and gave me an
I.D.,'' said the girl who called herself Cheryl. ``I hung out for a
couple of months until I got sick of it.''
   Cheryl says she is off the streets and going to school.
   Yates, Hocking and Ms. Lee say young people can be rescued. Each
cited success stories of kids who returned to school or got jobs.
But many will never return home because the home was unsuitable.
   ``We need programs that get them out of the law enforcement
system and into the social service system,'' Hocking said, calling
for shelters that offer refuge, hygiene and counseling.
   In 1983, Ms. Lee and police discovered dozens of street kids in
the biggest squat of them all, a crumbling apartment they called
``Hotel Hell.'' Next door to the famed Chinese Theater, the
building was once home to comedian Stan Laurel and other
celebrities.
   ``We found evidence of everything there. There was disease,
malnutrition, drug abuse. Some kids were shooting whiskey in their
veins for a cheap high,'' said Yates, who gathered medical
histories on the youngsters evacuated from the fire trap on
Hollywood Boulevard.
   Sacramento lawmakers toured ``Hotel Hell'' and legislation
followed to fund a program called Project Homeless Youth,
supervised by Children's Hospital. The 20 shelter beds are
constantly filled and many young people must be turned away.
   The ones who opt for counseling and intervention at the shelter
often get away from the exploitation of the streets, Yates said.
   ``They need an adult they can trust and a situation where there
is no manipulation,'' said Ms. Lee, who hopes to raise enough money
to start a shelter run by Children of the Night.
   ``We have to try to get them to somewhere where somebody gives a
damn about them,'' Hocking said.

<HEAD>Bush Wants to Be `Education President' But Offers Few Specifics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Everywhere he goes, Vice President George Bush
talks about wanting to be ``the education president,'' singling it
out as one area he would emphasize more than President Reagan.
   But the Republican nominee-in-waiting has offered few specifics
on how he would carry out that mission, apart from proposing a new
tax break for college savings accounts and promising to support the
Head Start program for disadvantaged children.
   At a recent campaign stop in Indiana, pressed to explain how a
Bush administration would handle education differently, the vice
president said he would bring outstanding school teachers to
Washington for recognition ceremonies. He also called for
restoration of ``the four R's: reading, 'riting, 'rithemetic and
respect.''
   But those are precisely the kinds of bully pulpit efforts that
Reagan and his secretary of education, William J. Bennett, have
specialized in. School recognition programs are already a regular
Rose Garden feature, blossoming in the Reagan years even while the
president sought to slash the education budget.
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, whom Bush identifies as
one his education advisers, said in an interview, ``I think he's
not yet spelled out his views in a number of areas and I'm looking
forward to his doing that.''
   The former governor, who launched a 10-point program in
Tennessee that included a controversial, ground-breaking
career-ladder plan for teachers, said he expects Bush will ``put
education right up there with peace and prosperity as a concern of
his administration. .... If he carries through with that for eight
years, he will have a massive effect on how Americans value and
view education.''
   Alexander said the next president should look ``for ways to help
communities make schools better, including helping to pay the
bill.''
   Bush told Republican activists at a fund-raiser in Fort Wayne,
Ind., last month, ``I don't want to have the federal government
come in and tell the superintendents in these schools, `Here's your
curriculum. Here are the A, B's and C's and you got to follow it.'
... But I do want to see the federal government used to put more
emphasis on excellence.''
   Pressed to spell out what he meant, Bush said: ``I want to build
on education, add to the concept of an education president. Because
as I look at our ability, and some would say inability, to compete,
the answer is education. ... It's not going to be a radical
philosophical change; it's going to be a question of emphasis.''
   ``It won't be turning my back on a record that I have identified
with,'' he added.
   Bush recently visited Garfield High School in the barrio of East
Los Angeles, where scores of Hispanic students have won honors in
calculus under the tutelage of prize-winning teacher Jaime
Escalante. A new movie, ``Stand and Deliver,'' celebrates
Escalante's success story.
   When one of Escalante's pupils asked the vice president if money
would be available to help them attend college, Bush replied, ``I
think the federal government has a responsibility _ there will be a
change of priorities to some degree'' under his administration.
   But Bush added, ``The problem is there is always going to be a
limitation in what the federal government can do. In this country,
if you can afford to pay for a kid's education, you should do it.''
   In Vandalia, Ohio, when a Butler High School student asked how
Bush would help public schools in financial trouble, he replied:
   ``The federal government should not create increased funding for
the public schools. That's not the function of the federal
government the way I see it,'' he said.
   Bush, a product of prep schools and Yale, supports tuition tax
credits for private-school parents, but has not made clear whether
he would seek, as Reagan did, vouchers that poor parents could
spend on public or private education.
   He told the students in Vandalia, ``I like the idea of trying to
get as much competition going between the schools as possible. ...
I wouldn't want to do anything to weaken the public school system,
although I think we should have the challenge and diversity that
we've got in the way of private schools and parochial schools.''
   Elsewhere, Bush has said the federal government pays 7 percent
of schools' bills and ``that's about right.''
   The National Education Association, which tracks school finance,
contends the federal share of public elementary and secondary
expenditures has dropped during the Reagan administration from 9.2
percent to 6.2 percent.
   Bush has said, ``I love the concept of Head Start,'' the $1.2
billion preschool program for disadvantaged children.
   Although Head Start was included in the 1982 Reagan ``safety
net,'' it serves only 445,000 children, or 16 percent of those
eligible, according to the Children's Defense Fund.
   The government's biggest school aid program, the $4.5 billion
Chapter 1 remedial program for the disadvantaged, reaches nearly 5
million children, but still only half those who need it.
   Reagan twice sought to cut the Department of Education budget by
$5 billion. The only increases he proposed were in election years:
1984 and 1988. In his first term, Reagan sought deep cuts in
Chapter 1 as well as aid for teaching the handicapped, bilingual
education and help for college students. Congress, nevertheless,
has boosted the education budget to more than $21 billion from less
than $15 billion.
   Bush also speaks frequently about his desire to ``strengthen
student aid for those that need it,'' including loans for college,
Pell Grants and the college work-study program.
   But he will have to reconcile those intentions with another
promise: his plan to seek a modified four-year freeze on the
federal budget, with the exception of Social Security, that would
allow spending to rise no more than 4 percent a year.
   Education accounts for only a tiny portion of the
trillion-dollar federal budget, but most school programs fall into
the category of discretionary spending where the pressure from a
freeze would be greatest.
   Bush says with disdain that, ``The liberals, Dukakis and
Jackson, their answer is, `Hey, if you really believe in education,
double the spending' ... I'm going to be saying, `Great. How are
you going to pay for it and why is it better to have it dictated
from Washington?'''
   Bush's wife, Barbara, has been a longtime activist in the fight
against adult illiteracy, and he frequently tells audiences that 13
percent of America's 17-year-olds are functionally illiterate. Bush
often extols public-private sector partnerships as a tool in the
fight against illiteracy.
   Bush says he is also getting education advice from David
Packard, the Hewlett-Packard Co. founder who headed a federal panel
that called two years ago for more federal support for university
researh.
   After a recent tour of coal research facilities at West Virginia
University in Morgantown, Bush said: ``The people working in
research institutions around this nation ... pushing back the
frontiers of human understanding will have more of an impact on the
21st century than all of us down in Washington, D.C.''

   Like millions of abandoned children in
Brazil, Leonardo Arcanjo lived on the streets, stealing and
begging. He faced an adulthood of misery and crime.
   But late last year, the Sao Paulo Child Welfare Department
persuaded him that he could be more than a beggar or a thief, and
today the 15-year-old street kid is learning to be a carpenter with
the guarantee of a job when he finishes.
   Leonardo is one of about 9,000 children being helped in a new
program praised by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as
``unique, creative and forward looking.''
   ``Our basic aim is to provide alternative educational and job
training programs that will give the abandoned child the
self-respect he never had and detour him from the path that usually
leads to a life of crime,'' said Alda Marco Antonio, head of the
Child Welfare Department.
   To achieve her objective, Marco Antonio created a multi-approach
program that includes boarding houses where the children receive
medical and dental care and are fed and clothed.
   After a process of adaptation in which they overcome ``the
fears, hatred and skepticism caused by years of abandonment,'' the
children are placed in schools or sent to vocational training
centers.
   One of the most innovative parts of the program is its
job-training project in which children learn a trade of their
choosing at one of several companies owned and operated by the
state of Sao Paulo.
   Leonardo, for instance, is learning carpentry at the Sao Paulo
State Bank's Supply, Maintenance and Operations Center. Other
children learn how to become computer programmers, printers,
electricians and auto mechanics.
   At the end of the six-month program, each child is guaranteed a
full-time job.
   Since May 1987, when the project was created, 258 children have
learned a trade and been hired; 1,177 others are now being trained.
   Marco Antonio said one reason for the success of the program is
that it involves ``no coercion or locking up.''
   ``It has been proven that forcing children to do what they don't
want to do and locking them away in detention centers does not
work,'' she said in an interview. ``They are worse off and more
violent when they leave than when they go in.''
   She described the state's juvenile detention centers as
``repressive places where children lose all their self-esteem.''
   Jose Roberto Melo, a spokesman for the state foundation that
runs the centers, said, ``Of the 2,500 children currently detained
only a small minority can be considered dangerous. Most are there
because of vagrancy or because of some petty crime like
purse-snatching.''
   Marco Antonio said eventually her program would expand ``so that
one day the detention centers will be empty of all but the most
dangerous individuals who have committed crimes like murder or
rape.''
   To take part in her program ``a child must decide for himself
that he wants to be helped and of course we help him reach this
decision,'' Marco Antonio said.
   The first contact a child has with the program is through one of
the 120 ``street educators'' _ psychologists, sociologists, social
workers, lawyers and other professionals who look for abandoned
children and win their friendship and trust.
   When that relationship is established, a process that could take
several months, the street educator introduces the child to the
program and guides him through its initial phases.
   Leonardo said, ``For years I lived on the streets begging and
stealing or shining shoes or selling candies in the subway.
   ``A street educator once approached me and told me about the
program, but I didn't trust her. I thought she wanted to lock me
away somewhere.''
   Then Leonardo was arrested for vagrancy and police planned to
send him to a juvenile detention center.
   But, the street educator intervened out ``and that's when I
decided to give the program a try,'' Leonardo said. ``It was the
best decision I have ever made.''
   John Donahue, UNICEF's representative in Brazil, called the
program ``one of the most coherant and complete efforts at dealing
with abandoned children.''
   He said it was unique because ``it simultaneously reduces the
number of street children and prevents others from taking to the
streets to survive.''
   He said it should serve as a model for other Brazilian cities
and other countries.
   The National Child Welfare Foundation estimates the number of
abandoned children in Brazil at 7 million. They are among 36
million who lack education, health care, housing and parental
guidance and affection.
   Marco Antonio said one of the basic reasons for the large number
of street children ``is society's abandonment of adults who are
exploited by low wages and who therefore cannot properly care for
their children.''
   Most Brazilian workers earn the equivalent of about $125 a month.
   Marco Antonio also cited a poorly structured public school
system ``that excludes the poor.''
   ``There may be enough classrooms and teachers, but the poor
cannot send their children to school simply because they can't pay
for supplies and uniforms,'' she said.
   ``Most street children start off begging for food. Little by
little they start committing petty thefts and as they grow older
they start stealing cars or pushing drugs. So, from innocent
vcitims of society's injustices, they end up the aggressors.''
   One 17-year-old street kid, identifying himself only as Beto, is
one a group of 12 boys 11 to 18 years old who hang out in a large
square in front of the Roman Catholic cathedral.
   ``We prefer to earn our living by either asking people for money
or selling things,'' he said ``but when the money is short and
hunger sets in, then of course we are going to steal.''
   When they are not stealing, begging or selling, they sleep on
benches or under store awnings or theater marquees. They bathe and
wash their clothes in public fountains.
   No official figures have been compiled on the number of crimes
committed by street children, said Jairo Pires, spokesman for the
Sao Paulo State Security Department.
   The Rev. John Drexel, a Roman Catholic priest who has worked
with poor children in Brazil for more than 25 years, said children
often are exploited by adults ``for whom a street kid is a useful
instrument to commit crimes.''
   ``It is a grownup who buys the watches, bracelets and necklaces
stolen by a child,'' he added. ``It is a grownup who drives away
the car first broken into by a kid, and it is a grownup who uses
children as messengers in drug transactions.
   ``And most of this kind of exploitation is usually done by
adults who were once street children themselves.''

   When Jimmy Carter as president needed to get away for a while
before he went to Camp David with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, his thoughts turned to
fly fishing.
   ``When I was president, Rosalynn and I fly fished out West,'' he
says. On the pre-Camp David trip, ``I took along with me the
briefing books that I would be using to prepare myself for the
Mideast negotiations, so it was a combination of delightful
surroundings, good companions...and also just clearing my mind when
I was ready to embark on one of the major challenges of my
presidency.''
   He now fly fishes throughout the world, but loves to come home
to north Georgia to the little log cabin he furnished with his
handmade wooden furniture.
   ``The cabin is within 20 feet of Turnip Town Creek, which has a
fairly good native population of rainbow trout. It's the perfect
environment for writing in placid, beautiful surroundings, in
almost total isolation. When Rosalynn and I are there, which is
never enough, it makes for good thoughts and productive days.''
   The former president has written a new book, ``An Outdoor
Journal: Reflections and Adventures,'' recalling favorite fishing
experiences. Writing it, he said, was ``a labor of love.''
   Jack Hemingway: ``I bet I was the only American in World War II
who parachuted into Occupied France with a fly rod. I used it,
too.''
   The son of legendary fisherman and writer Ernest Hemingway now
lives in Ketchum, Idaho, between angling excursions to distant
parts of the globe. But some of his most vivid memories are of his
happy days on clear rivers with his father.
   ``When I was 6, before I'd ever picked up a fly rod, I spent one
whole summer watching him fish the Clark's Fork River of the
Yellowstone,'' Hemingway says. ``Finally, at the very end, when I'd
spent the whole summer building up the need to fish, my father
taught me how to cast.''
   Author of ``Misadventures of a Fly Fisherman,'' Jack Hemingway
says his love for the sport has lasted throughout his life. Not so
for his late father.
   ``Dad had a big nice trunk, outfitted with all his rods and
reels and tackle, everything he had collected over his years of fly
fishing,'' remembers Hemingway. ``Right after that wonderful summer
on the Clark's Fork, in the fall of 1939, he had the trunk shipped
by railway express, and they lost it. He never trout fished again.
I think it was as if he felt he'd have to start all over again and
it just wasn't worth the trouble.''
   Paul Volcker: ``I took my wife fishing on our honeymoon and she
hasn't been since,'' says the former chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board.
   Volcker now teaches at Princeton University and is chairman of a
New York investment banking firm. When he resigned from the Fed
last year, he said he planned to go fishing.
   ``I went maybe eight times last summer, I ought to be doing
more,'' says Volcker, who's cast for trout in Scotland, England,
and Yugoslavia. ``You're out with nature and all that stuff. It's
nice to be more or less alone, testing your wits and skill. But I'm
a real amateur.''
   In the winter, he ties his own flies at his Manhattan home and
plots a warm weather assault on distant rivers, perhaps in New
Zealand or Montana. ``From now on I'm going to grab fishing
whenever I can get it.''
   Linda Morgens: ``On the first date with my future husband my
train into New York was late, so he occupied his time by going to
Abercrombie & Fitch and buying some artificial flies. He was very
surprised when he showed them to me and I started identifying them.
Our mutual enthusiasm for fly fishing was certainly a plus.''
   Mrs. Morgens is a veteran member of Trout Unlimited's board of
directors and chairs the nominating committee.
   ``Both my parents were fishermen _ my mother once held a blue
marlin record _ and since I was an only child I spent a lot of time
doing male sort of things with them. I grew up before the women's
lib thing, so fishing taught me how to do things on my own, taught
me I could go off alone without needing any help. In those days
there weren't that many things which could teach women to be
independent, but fly fishing was one of them.''
   Mrs. Morgens and her husband, Ned, live in South Norwalk, Conn.
   Curt Gowdy, who for 20 years hosted The American Sportsman on
ABC: ``When we'd go fishing, my dad would say, `Curtis, remember
the buffalo. There were millions of them before the white man wiped
them out for money. That could happen to trout, too.' So from the
very beginning, when I learned to fly fish at the age of 8, I was
always a catch-and-release fisherman.''
   He fishes almost everywhere now, and wherever he goes he
preaches conservation.
   Gen. John Piotrowski, commander in chief of the United States
Space Command and the North American Aerospace Command, puts in
crowded workdays in his Colorado Springs headquarters, ``but
sometimes in the evenings I can slip away, up into the mountains,
and fly fish.
   ``I always like to match wits with a trout. It's great when you
win, but the alternative isn't desirable. It's very humbling to
come home empty-handed.''
   William Horn, assistant secretary of the interior, is partial to
fishing in Montana, Alaska and Wyoming, but spends more time
fishing on the East Coast. ``Before I was working and got married
and had kids I went fly fishing 40 or 50 times a year,'' he says.
``Now I'm lucky if I go 15 times a year. But I dream about it a
lot.''
   ``I like companions who have the same appreciation for the
sport's traditions and ethics as I do, and who provide just enough
subtle competition on the stream to make it intriguing.''

   Fine craftsmanship, the kind expected of a
classic, is part of the aura of the 1988 Audi 90. It's in the
impeccable stitching of the leather along the door interiors and on
the seats.
   It's in the understated cockpit design of this new, downsized
Audi. It's in the stable, firm ride and the smooth shifting of the
five-speed manual transmission.
   You wouldn't guess that the Audi 90 _ along with its companion
vehicle the Audi 80 _ are the first new cars that Audi has
introduced in the United States since 1983. They seem to be so
well-honed that one might think they have been around for years.
   And sadly, you wouldn't know by the sales figures either that
they are impressive new competitors in the European luxury car
market.
   Hindered by publicity of complaints that the larger, Audi 5000
cars have suddenly accelerated out of control on some U.S. drivers,
the Audi 80 and 90 autos have not been selling as well here as had
been hoped.
   While the company had expected up to 28,000 sales annually, it
now looks for maybe 8,000 Audi 90 sales and another 8,000 Audi 80
sales in the United States in the current model year, a company
spokeswoman said.
   There are no projections for the 1989 model year, she added. The
federal government, by the way, continues to monitor sudden
acceleration complaints on the Audi 5000s. Audi has installed shift
locks on the cars which require that the brake be depressed before
the vehicle can be shifted out of park.
   The Audi 80-90 series is a replacement for the Audi 4000 line
and is not directly part of that controversy, but some consumers
seem to be shunning Audi nameplates altogether.
   That's unfortunate, because the Audi 90 test car was admirable
in many respects. Audi engineers thought ahead in their
installation of the anti-lock braking system.
   Unlike many other European luxury cars, the Audi 90 allows
drivers to turn the ABS off with a switch on the dashboard. That
might be needed, for example, on gravel roads where a buildup of
dirt and stone ahead of the tires could help a driver slow down or
stop.
   Anti-lock brakes, which prevent wheels from locking, wouldn't
necessarily allow that to happen. Audi engineering also was evident
in the sleek, aerodynamic shape. The Audi 90's drag coefficient,
which indicates how easily it cuts through air with little
resistance, was low, thanks to a raked windshield, flush window
glass, aerodynamic headlights and door handles that are integrated
into the car body.
   Such aerodynamics are designed to reduce wind noise and reduce
driver and passenger fatigue. The Audi 90's new, five-speed
transmission was flawless and smooth. The engine _ a 2.3-liter,
fuel-injected, in-line five-cylinder _ could produce up to 130
horsepower, was steady and performed well.
   The white paint outside was a special pearlescent metallic that
really shone. Leather seats _ the front ones were heated at an
optional $225 _ were comfortable. Rear leg room ranged from
acceptable to roomy, depending on the location of the front seats.
   There were fasteners to keep the floor mats in place, and there
were child-roof rear door locks, as well as a feature that locked
the rear windows and turned off the rear cigarette lighter from a
switch on the driver door.
   The center arm rest in the front adjusted to different heights _
nice for different drivers. A vehicle monitoring system was
engineered with two types of warning signals: red if some systems
were in really bad shape and needed immediate attention and yellow
if corrections needed to be made soon.
   My biggest concern was the Audi 90 trunk. It did not go back
very far and seemed small. But that's a small complaint for a small
car that packages superbly some wonderful, luxury car features from
its bigger rivals.
   In sum, the Audi 90 test car was solid and conveyed the casual
elegance of a classic, inside and out. Base price for the Audi 90
is $24,330, putting it in the ballpark of such competitors as the
BMW 325, which starts at around $24,000, and the Mercedes-enz 190E,
which starts at more than $29,000.
   Target buyers of the Audi 80-90 cars are mostly male, most
mostly married, mostly college graduates, between 35 and 44 with
median family income of $68,900, the Audi spokeswoman said.
   Because the Audi 90 is a new vehicle, there are no reliability
reports.

   Bregman Partners of Canada has terminated its
consideration of the possible acquisition of certain International
Multifoods Corp. business units, International Multifoods said
Thursday.
   The company said it had received a letter from Bregman Partners
ending its consideration, and that the letter effectively
terminated a standstill agreement between International Multifoods
and the group.
   Bregman Partners had agreed not to purchase additional
International Multifoods shares during talks between the two.
   It was not immediately clear whether Bregman Partners' letter
was an indication the group was renewing its consideration of an
acquisition of the entire company. Company spokespeople could not
immediately be reached for further comment.
   International Multifoods stock fell 12{ cents to $26.12{ a share
on the New York Stock Exchange. The letter was disclosed after the
market closed.
   Bregman Partners, which consists mainly of the Bregman baking
family of Toronto and Belzberg banking family of Vancouver, said
last year it might seek control of International Multifoods, an
international food manufacturer and distributor.
   The company said it would oppose any takeover by Bregman
Partners, and in October filed suit alleging that the partnership
had illegally caused speculation in its stock and filed misleading
government disclosure statements.
   Bregman Partners disclosed in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing in December that it held 10.7 percent of
International Multifoods' outstanding common stock. Earlier, it had
sought federal government clearance to raise its stake to as high
as 25 percent.
   The filing said the partnership had held discussions with
Multifoods' financial adviser about the ``possibility of entering
into negotiations'' to buy certain assets of the company. But ``no
negotiations were held and no agreement or understanding was
reached'' during the discussions, the filing said.

<TEXT>
   Concerns about rising interest rates are depressing the stock
market and the single-family home segment of the construction
market, analysts say.
   On Wall Street, stock prices slumped Wednesday for the second
consecutive session, sending one widely-watched market indicator to
a three-month low.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 35.32 to 1,951.09,
the lowest level since it closed at 1,914.46 on Feb. 9. Broader
market measures also tumbled.
   Bond prices fell broadly, pushing interest rates higher. The
yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, regarded as an indicator of
interest rate speculation, rose to 9.29 percent from 9.21 percent
late Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said single-family home building dropped
6.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.10 million
units last month.
   Construction of multi-family units, which swing widely from
month to month, soared by 23.3 percent to a rate of 466,000 units.
   Overall, housing construction rose 0.5 percent in April to a
seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units, following
gains of 2.3 percent in March and 9.9 percent in February, the
report stated.
   But housing activity was still 4.5 percent below last year.
   Economists said the increase in apartment building probably was
an aberration and rising mortgage interest rates likely would
depress single-family construction.
   ``The single-family number is not a bad number, but I think it's
an indication that as rates rise through the year, it's going to
impact the housing market,'' said Martin A. Regalia, chief
economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions.
   Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages were just under 10
percent through March, but began edging up in April and averaged
10.4 percent last week.
   Housing permits, considered a good sign of future construction
activity, fell 4.1 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.42 million units. Single-family permits fell 6.8 percent,
while multi-family units rose 2.2 percent.
   In other economic news Wednesday:
   _President Reagan's chief economic adviser, Beryl Sprinkel, said
there will be a loss of more than 600,000 jobs if Congress
increases the minimum wage from the current $3.35 to $4.65 an hour
over three years. Sprinkel said in a letter to Rep. Thomas E.
Petri, R-Wis., that the job losses ``would be concentrated among
younger, less skilled and minority workers.''
   _U.S. imports of crude oil rose 24.1 percent in April from
year-earlier levels while total domestic production declined 2.7
percent, the American Petroleum Institute reported. The trade group
said that unlike previous months, the latest domestic production
figure did not include a year-to-year increase in Alaskan output to
partially offset a decline in the lower 48 states.

   Oil futures prices have slipped in the wake of
an industry report showing buildups of crude and heating oil
inventories, and weaker-than-expected demand for gasoline, analysts
say.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark U.S. crude, fell 33 cents to settle at $17.43 per
barrel Wednesday.
   Among June contracts for refined products, wholesale prices for
unleaded gasoline fell 0.51 cent to 52.23 cents per gallon, while
heating oil fell 0.71 cent to 47.07 cents per gallon.
   The declines followed Tuesday night's release of a report on the

Friday by the Washington-based American Petroleum Institute.
   Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst at E.D.&F. Man
International Futures Inc., said the report's indication that
stocks of heating oil were up by more than 3 million barrels, and
crude stocks were up by 1.6 million barrels were negative for the
market.
   Increased supplies amid stable or shrinking demand put downward
pressure on prices.
   Lebow also said an assessment of gasoline production and
imports, together with changes in inventories over the last four
weeks, indicated a 5.7 percent decline in gasoline consumption,
compared with the same period last year.
   ``That flies in the face of all the talk about booming demand,''
he said. ``We haven't seen that pre-Memorial Day surge in demand
for gasoline yet.''

<HEAD>Macmillan Stock Jumps Above Buyout Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street has propelled Macmillan Inc. common
stock above the $64-a-share price suggested in a $1.5 billion
buyout proposal from a group led by Texas investor Robert M. Bass,
indicating invsetors expect a higher bid is expected.
   Macmillan chairman Edward P. Evans, meanwhile, told the
company's shareholders at their annual meeting Wednesday that the
publishing and information services concern isn't for sale.
   Securities analysts speculated the Bass proposal could attract
others, possibly foreign companies, to become involved, touching
off a bidding war.
   Macmillan stock soared $18.25 a share to close at $68.87{ on the
New York Stock Exchange after trading as high as $71.62{ earlier in
the day.
   Some analysts have speculated the company could sell for as much
as $85 to $90 a share in a bidding contest.
   Bert Boksen, a publishing analyst for Raymond James & Associates
in St. Petersburg, Fla., estimated Macmillan could command a price
of $90 a share or more based on prices paid for other publishing
companies in recent months.
   Wayne Johnson, who follows Macmillan for H.G. Wellington & Co.
in New York, said he doubted the Bass group expected to be able to
buy Macmillan for $64 a share. ``I suspect it was a manuever to
encourage others to buy at a higher price,'' he said.
   The Bass group owns about 2.4 million Macmillan shares, or about
9.1 percent of the company's 26 million common shares outstanding.
   The analysts said foreign-based buyers, benefitting from the
decline in the dollar that has boosted their own buying power, have
shown an avid interest in U.S. publishing companies.
   French media giant Hachette SA recently agreed to buy Grolier
Inc., and Pearson PLC of Britain agreed to buy Addison-Wesley &
Sons Inc. Last year, Harper & Row was acquired by Australia's News
Corp.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. underwent a costly
recapitalization last year to fend off a takeover bid by British
publisher Robert Maxwell.
   Boksen said the Bass group's proposal could force Macmillan to
find a friendly buyer or to propose a restructuring or a leveraged
buyout under which the company would be taken private.
   Bass, who heads Robert M. Bass Group Inc. in Fort Worth, Texas,
made the proposal in a letter to Evans on the eve of Macmillan's
annual meeting.
   As the meeting convened Wednesday morning, Evans said he had
received the inquiry, but Macmillan's board had not had a chance to
discuss it.
   He said management was confident about Macmillan's growth
potential, and added: ``This is why the company is not for sale.''
   The meeting was adjourned before shareholders could ask any
questions.
   Bass said the offer was conditioned upon approval by the
Macmillan board, sufficient financing being obtained and Macmillan
not issuing any additional equity securities.
   A proposal to authorize issuance of new preferred stock was on
the agenda for Macmillan's annual meeting, and the company said
shareholders approved it.
   Macmillan, based in New York, publishes textbooks aimed at
elementary through college grades as well as books of general
interest. It is a leader in children's books and the fast-growing
computer book field.
   Other businesses include instructional services, such as Berlitz
language training, and retail operations through its Gump's
department stores.
   Macmillan had an after-tax profit of $70.7 million on revenue of
$955.8 million in 1987.
   Publishing accounted for about 45.9 percent of revenue and 41.4
percent of operating income in 1987. Information services accounted
for 23.9 percent of revenue and 40.1 percent of income.

<HEAD>Irving Denounces Bank Of NY Questioning Of Proxy Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp. has denounced as ``totally
without merit'' hostile suitor Bank of New York's questioning of
preliminary results of a heated proxy battle that indicated Irving
retained control of its board of directors.
   Bank of New York claimed Wednesday that the preliminary count
Irving released earlier this week excluded at least 650,000 shares
that holders attempted to vote in favor of Bank of New York's
nominees.
   It also claimed the holders of a preferred stock issue it is
attempting to have invalidated provided a 318,000-share block
favoring Irving.
   The stock was issued three months ago to 15 private investors as
a defensive measure against the Bank of New York. Each share
guarantees voting rights beyond those of common shareholders.
   ``If we got the 650,000 shares counted for us ... and the
preferred stock not permitted to be counted ... I believe that
might be sufficient to swing the election in our favor,'' Bank of
New York spokesman Owen Brady said.
   Brady said the company had not formally challenged the proxy
count, but simply was announcing its belief that the contest still
was in doubt.
   Irving attorney Robert Falise called the complaints ``totally
without merit'' and said the company was confident the final tally
would jive with preliminary results.
   Irving said its shareholders at the May 6 annual meeting
re-elected the incumbent directors, by 52 percent to 48 percent,
over Bank of New York's slate of 16 nominees. Final results were
expected to be released at a reconvened shareholders' meeting on
May 24.
   Re-election of Irving's board would constitute a vote of
confidence in the company's defensive restructuring plan and
friendly merger with the state-run Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA,
Italy's second-largest bank, and rejection of against Bank of New
York's hostile buyout offer.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Irving
closed up 12.5 cents to $61.50 Wednesday while Bank of New York
fell 75 cents to $30.37{.
   Bank of New York, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is
offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of
Irving's common shares outstanding. The offer is valued at around
$64 a share or $1.1 billion.
   Bank of New York said it would be willing to raise the stock
portion of its bid to 1.675 Bank of New York shares, adding $3.20
per share to the deal pushing its value to around $1.2 billion.
   The offer would be amended only if Irving agrees to a negotiated
merger.
   Bank of New York said if Irving refused to negotiate, it would
buy the Irving shares tendered as of May 24 and operate the bank as
a subsidiary for five years, thereby avoiding the poison pill.
   Bank of New York said it owned or had been tendered about 50
percent of Irving's 18.5 million outstanding common shares.
   Banca Commerciale is offering $75 a share for 9.5 million Irving
shares, or about 51 percent, valued at $707 million. In addition,
it said it would pay shareholders interest on the purchase price
from May 31 until the deal closes.
   The Banca Commerciale bid is part of a complex restructuring
plan that includes asset sales, cost-cutting measures and a
$10-a-share special cash dividend. Irving said the offer has a
blended value of between $65.20 and $72.55 a share.

<HEAD>U.S. Steelmakers Demand Negotiation, Threaten Litigation Over
Import Quotas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Failure to renew U.S. steel import quotas may
trigger a wave of trade litigation by American companies against
foreign competitors, including Canada, the head of the main
domestic industry trade group says.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. steelmakers said Wednesday the recovery that
trade protection helped made possible in their industry may have
peaked for the time being.
   ``The American steel industry, so hard at work to make itself
internationally competitive, will not stand idly by and watch that
work undone by a repeat of the import abuses which threw our
companies into a five-year bath of red ink,'' said Thomas C.
Graham, whose election to a rare third term as American Iron and
Steel Institute chairman was announced Wednesday.
   Voluntary restraint agreements negotiated by the Reagan
adminisration with 31 foreign steelmaking nations expire in
September 1989. The five-year quota plan was instituted partly to
end a barrage of steelmaker lawsuits, many of them aimed at the
government-subsidized mills of Europe.
   ``If a VRA extension is deemed unecessary by those in
government, then we're prepared to flood the (International Trade
Commission) with trade case filings, if need be, in numbers which
will make what came before the VRAs seem trivial by comparison,''
Graham said in a speech at the AISI's annual conference.
   ``We do not want protection from efficient competition, nor do
we need it,'' he said. ``We need and expect only a climate of fair
trade and legal trading practices.''
   Earlier Wednesday in a panel discussion, Graham said Canada, the
United States' largest trading partner and the largest steel
exporter not covered by the voluntary quotas, is vulnerable to a
trade suit.
   The AISI, to which Canadian mills belong, wants Canada included
if the quotas are extended.
   Canada boosted its share of the U.S. steel market from what
Graham said is its fair share of 2.4 percent to 3.7 percent in
1987. The increase disadvantages Europe, Japan and other quota
nations, he said.
   John D. Allan, chairman of the Canadian steelmaker Stelco Inc.,
said in a speech Monday in Toronto that U.S. steel exports have
surged from 4.5 percent and 4.8 percent of the Canadian market in
1985 and 1986 respectively to 5.5 percent last year. Allan also
said Canadian steel is fairly traded.
   Separately, other industry leaders said steel's recovery may
have peaked if, as they fear, customers soon stop building
inventories.
   ``We're forecasting a decrease in the production rates in the
automobile, appliance and private housing sectors. So we don't see
any driving forces for a continuation of the demand we're seeing
today,'' said Armco Inc. Chairman Robert E. Boni.
   Boni said 1988 shipments probably would tail off to 75.5 million
tons, roughly even with the 76 million tons shipped in 1987 and
considerably shy of the 80 million tons talked about earlier this
year, the second year of the industry's long-awaited recovery.
   The shipping rate bears directly on profits and employment.
   ``The reduction of 5 million tons obviously ... is going to
reduce profits,'' Boni said without offering specific figures.
   But officials said they doubted such a slowdown sales would
force any plants to close.
   ``The most difficult thing for us to call in this equation is
customer inventory'' because no accurate surveys are available,
said LTV Steel Co. President David Hoag.
   ``We know the customers built a lot of inventory last year. We
feel certain they built some in the first half of this year and at
some point they will discontinue building those inventories,'' he
said. ``I think that will begin to occur sometime in the second
half.''

   When the going got tough, one oil patch company
turned to the newspaper classifieds for help.
   ``Please send MONEY. Manufacturing Corporation needs cash to
keep 50 people in jobs,'' said the Houston Chronicle ad placed by
Federal Flange & Fitting Co.
   ``I had hoped I would never have to (place such an ad),''
company president Tom Lyons said Wednesday. ``I'm not good at
begging, but I think it has come to be just that.''
   The ad, which appeared Tuesday, said contributors would not
receive stock or securities, but merely a thank you from the
company. The ad included a post office box where contributions
could be sent.
   By early Wednesday afternoon, about 150 people had called the
Houston company since the ad appeared, most asking for the
company's address, Lyons said.
   ``They just indicated they would be putting something in the
mail,'' Lyons said.
   Federal Flange, which produces pipe flanges used in oil fields,
suffered severely in the energy downturn. The company slashed its
workforce from 160 employees to about 50, including three of Lyon's
12 children and two of his nephews, he said.
   Annual revenue has plunged to about $3.5 million from about $15
million in the early 1980s.
   Lyons said the small ad also will appear in the Chronicle's
sports section Sunday. He said the newspaper had delayed printing
it by a few days to make sure there was nothing wrong in printing
it.
   Lyons said he has been thinking about placing such an ad for
months, but finally decided to do so after hearing about a Dallas
radio announcer who asked for money and got it.
   KVIL-FM announcer Ron Chapman asked listeners to send in $20
without telling them why, and the station received $243,120 in four
days. It later gave the money to charity.
   But Lyons said Federal Flange's need for money was no joke. He
needs it to pay overdue bills and help keep him from having to file
for bankruptcy.
   ``I find people in the United States are very, very generous,''
he said. ``I have a lot of confidence in the generosity of people.''
   Lyons, who has been battling Hodgkin's disease for two years,
said he also prays for his company's survival _ not money _ during
mass.
   ``I don't believe in praying for money,'' he said.

<HEAD>Europeans Hold Out Against U.S. Farm Proposal</HEAD>

   Experts from 24 leading industrial countries met to
discuss sharply different positions on agriculture policy but
failed to reach accord, the top trade official of the European
Economic Community said today.
   ``They made some progress, but I don't dare to say that there is
yet complete agreement,'' said the official, Willy De Clercq,
adding that the ministers planned to debate the issue further over
lunch.
   The experts met overnight to attempt to reach consensus on farm
policy reform, where the Americans and Europeans are at odds with
each other.
   Trade and finance ministers from 24 countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development opened the
meeting Wednesday. They were scheduled to issue a joint communique
on agriculture and other economic issues at the close of today's
meeting.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III today reiterated that
the Reagan administration was commited to ending all agricultural
subsidies by the year 2000, but only if all other countries agreed
to do the same.
   ``Such subsidies impose an enormous cost on consumers and
taxpayers alike,'' he told a breakfast meeting with reporters.
   Baker said Washington had succeeded in reducing its farm
subsidies from $26 billion in 1986 to a projected $17.5 billion for
1988. He said the figure was expected to fall further next year.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng called for an early
commitment by America's trading partners to phase out government
subsidies used to prop up domestic farm prices and help boost
agricultural exports. Reagan first proposed this last June.
   Leaders of the 12-nation EEC rejected the idea as unrealistic.
They said the reform emphasis should be on short-term measures such
as production quotas that would reduce global surpluses.
   At a reception Wednesday evening, President Francois Mitterrand
underscored the European view that negotiations on world trade
liberalization should not single out farm issues.
   ``One cannot rush into negotiations while forgetting that all
matters have to be discussed, not only agriculture, but also
industry and services,'' Mitterrand said.
   U.S. officials said they also want to see tangible progress by
December in trade negotiations being conducted by the 96 member
countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
The Americans put special emphasis on reaching agreement on farm
issues.
   Trade ministers from the GATT countries are to meet in Montreal
in December to review progress in the negotiations, which are just
beginning. The next scheduled GATT meeting on agriculture is in
early June.
   Lyng said Congress would be watching closely for results from
the Montreal session.
   ``Undoubtedly, if progress seems blocked, the sentiment will be
to legislate more policies and programs to offset the unfair trade
practices of other nations,'' Lyng told Wednesday's ministerial
meeting.
   De Clercq told the meeting that such U.S. attacks on unfair
trading practices were unnecessary and ``worsen the climate for
negotiation'' on farm issues.
   He also criticized Washington for cutting sugar imports,
reducing or abandoning efforts to hold some farmland out of
production, and contesting long-standing EEC subsidy programs for
farmers.
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
secretariat said in a report published on Tuesday that aid to
farmers in the 24 member countries amounted to about $245 billion
in 1984-86. That is roughly double the total for 1979-81, it said.

<HEAD>London Share Prices Recover From Lows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices recovered by midday Thursday in
London after opening broadly lower in a response to earlier
declines in Tokyo and in New York on Wednesday.
   Traders said the market was steadying after its early jitters,
helped in part by neutral British economic news reported late in
the morning.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 14.8
points, or 0.8 percent, at 1,762.8 at about 12:15 p.m. local time.
The index had been down as much as 24.3 points earlier in the
session.
   Volume was 280.0 million shares, up from 255.3 million shares at
midday Wednesday.
   Earlier in the session, the market withstood a barrage of
economic reports which traders said appeared to paint a neutral
picture of the U.K. economy.
   A provisional 0.9 percent rise in the money supply was
considered equal to or better than market expectations. Industrial
production and earnings data also suggested the economy wasn't
overheating. Unemployment, which dropped to 8.8 percent in April
from 9 percent in March, was lower than expected.
   ``People aren't really worried about inflation'' as they were
earlier in the week following the U.S. March trade figures, said a
London trader. ``What we're waiting for is Wall Street.''
   Another weak start to the New York market could unnerve London
traders. Several said the Dow Jones industrial average's drop of
more than 35 points on Wednesday left Wall Street vulnerable.

<HEAD>Four Savings and Loans Merged in Southwest Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By READ MARTIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators provided a $2 billion
assistance package to combine four insolvent thrifts into a
Dallas-based savings and loan as part of the federal plan to revive
the flagging industry.
   Southwest Savings Association, the state's 18th largest thrift,
agreed to acquire 78 offices and branches of the four troubled S&Ls.
   The plan, announced Wednesday, may be the largest merger in the
federal Southwest Plan designed to rescue the state's ailing
thrifts, officials said.
   The four thrifts to be acquired within the next year are
Stockton Savings Association of Addison, Lamar Savings Association
of Austin, the state's 11th largest S&L, City Savings and Loan
Association of San Angelo and Briercroft Savings Association of
Austin, said George M. Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan
Bank of Dallas.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will spend a record
$2 billion on the deal over a 10-year period, Barclay said.
   Southwest is contributing $25 million of subordinated debt to
the consolidated company as equity, but no outside capital will be
used.
   The thrifts have combined assets of more than $4 billion, 75
percent of which are in commercial and ``non-conventional'' real
estate, and combined deposits of more than $4.4 billion, Barclay
said.
   ``There's no desire to create mega-thrifts,'' Barclay said.
``But when you absorb four institutions, you've got a lot of work
in front of you. We don't have much larger institutions so we don't
anticipate much larger transactions.''
   Barclay said even though the merger will begin with a large,
116-branch outfit, Southwest will quickly begin shutting down its
duplicated services.
   ``Within six months of the transaction, Southwest will make a
substantial reduction in branches, especially where there is
duplication,'' he said.
   C. Todd Miller, chairman and chief executive of Southwest
Savings, said the company planned to substantially reduce the
number of branches.
   ``We don't know how many branches we will close,'' Miller said.
But he said customers of all the thrifts will be notified of branch
closings by mail.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has now resolved the problems
of eight Texas thrifts under the Southwest Plan, which was
announced by the board in February and initiated last week.
   The Southwest Plan goal is to fold 109 or more insolvent S&Ls
into 25 to 30 surviving institutions. Last year, Congress granted
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. authority to raise up
to $10.8 billion from the industry to fund recapitalization of
surviving thrifts.
   The merger of four ailing thrifts into Houston-based Coastal
Banc Savings was the first consolidation under the Southwest plan
in a transaction that involved a $138 million contribution from the
FSLIC. That transaction included $3.5 million from a private
investment group.
   ``All of these transactions will be unique,'' Barclay said.
``This one doesn't include outside capital. Some transactions in
the future will have significant outside capital.''
   As part of its assistance in the deal, the FSLIC will provide
Southwest Savings with a 10-year note worth about $483 million.
   In exchange, the FSLIC will receive warrants to purchase 50
percent of Southwest's common stock. The FSLIC will receive 90
percent of Southwest Savings' first $60 million in profits.
   David Colgren, a spokesman for the FHLB, said officials believe
Southwest Savings will show a profit within two years.
   Stockton Savings had total assets as of March 31 of $543 million
with a net worth of negative $347.7 million and deposits of $784
million.
   Lamar Savings Association, the object of a lawsuit filed by the
FSLIC for regulatory violations, has total assets of $1.9 billion,
a net worth of negative $331.9 million and deposits of $2.1 billion.
   City Savings and Loan Association has assets of $687.3 million,
a net worth of negative $221.9 million and deposits of $866.2
million. Briercroft has total assets of $868.1 million, a net worth
of negative $22.7 million and deposits of $658 million.
   Before Wednesday's purchase, Southwest Savings had total assets
of $1.48 billion, a net worth of $27.6 million and deposits of $998
million.
   Miller said the Southwest Plan should be completed within the
next 12 months.

<TEXT>
   Amfac Inc. management, led by the president of
the San Francisco-based conglomorate, has proposed an all-cash
buyout for the purchase of the company at a value of $41 per share.
   ``The company stated that it has been advised that management
has been discussing financing for the buyout with a leading
financial institution and is confident that such financing can be
obtained,'' the company said in a statement issued on Wednesday at
a special board of directors' meeting.
   However, the statement added that ``there is as yet no firm
commitment.''
   The buyout would be led by Amfac President and Chief Executive
Officer Richard L. Griffith, 57.
   The proposed buyout is ``strongly supported by operating
management,'' said Griffith.
   He said it ``strengthens our ability to develop Amfac's Hawaii
asset base in a paced and profitable manner in concert with the
state's economic needs and long-term growth goals.''
   The plan is ``subject to obtaining the financing as well as a
number of other conditions,'' including approval of the board, the
company statement said.
   Meantime, the board decided not to proceed with the sale of the
Fred Harvey Resort operations and a 50 percent joint venture
interest in its Hawaii land and agricultural operations. The
company had received an offer of $166 million for Fred Harvey.
   Amfac is a diversified services company with main lines of
business in food processing, hotels and resorts, retail,
agriculture and property.
   Revenues in 1987 were $2.2 billion.

<HEAD>Texas Banking Industry May Suffer Worst Year Ever, FDIC Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Texas banking industry may record
its worst year ever in 1988 although the problems of Texas banks
will top out this year, the chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. says.
   ``It seems clear that the problems will peak this year,''
chairman William Seidman said Wednesday. ``Most of the major banks
have been dealt with or will have been handled.''
   More than half of Texas banks reported lower earnings during the
first three months, and one-third of the state's banks lost money,
he said.
   Among larger institutions _ ones with assets of more than $100
million, two-fifths lost money, with charge-offs growing at twice
1987 levels, FDIC officials reported.
   Bank failures in Texas, including 25 already this year, should
reach 70 by yearend, Seidman said. In the last five years,
one-third of the banks closed were less than five years old.
   Seidman also said regulators are in negotiations with potential
purchasers of First RepublicBank Corp.
   ``We are talking to people. We hope we can arrange some
resolution to that situation in the near future. How soon, only
time will tell,'' Seidman told reporters.
   The FDIC is studying methods to remedy inequities in policies
that now allow it insure all deposits in large failing banks, while
limiting exposure to the normal $100,000 maximum at smaller
institutions, he confirmed.
   The agency in March provided such blanket coverage for deposits
held by First Republic, prompting complaints by area independent
bankers.
   Regulators believe there has been no mass redistribution of
funds to First Republic as a result of the expanded guarantee,
although, ``We have had a great number of protests about the
inequities,'' Seidman said.
   Seidman said ``banks in the area,'' not foreign institutions,
pulled funds from First Republic, triggering the company's solvency
crisis and eventually the FDIC's $1 billion cash infusion in March.
   Comparing the earlier woes at First City Bancorporation of Texas
Inc., which last month completed a $1.5 billion federally assisted
recapitalization. Seidman said that bank ``never had the kind of
run that developed at First Republic.''
   The FDIC did not prompt First Republic to suspend interest
payments on all debt last week, raising the specter of a bankruptcy
filing, was not prompted by the FDIC, Seidman said.
   ``The (First Republic) board acted on its own judgment,'' he
said. ``We are in daily contact with them. We have people stationed
in the bank, so we are aware of what they are doing.''
   Seidman also said that Albert V. Casey, 68, lured out of
retirement to run First Republic, has not been instructed to shrink
the bank so that it might be more appealing to potential purchasers.
   Seidman blamed the continuing Texas troubles on the duration of
the state's recession and lack of an established branch-banking
system ``which tended to make it (Texas) much more susceptible to
problems.''
   Texas's once-buoyant economy shielded bankers from the
conservative lending practices of more recession-prone areas,
Seidman said.

   Unemployment in Britain fell to a seasonally

March, the government said Thursday.
   The figure was down from 10.8 percent in April 1987.
   The seasonally adjusted number of unemployed was estimated at
2.455 million people in April, down from a revised 2.504 million
people in March and 3.021 million people in April 1987, the
Department of Employment said.
   The department said it was the first time the seasonally

<HEAD>Beef Prices Increase In Latest Survey, NCA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average price of beef rose 12 cents a pound
over a month ago, the Denver-based National Cattlemen's Association
said Wednesday.
   The average price in its May 12 survey of prices in 19 cities
nationwide was $2.82 per pound, up from $2.70 in the survey on
April 14.
   Seasonal increases in demand _ especially for steak _ helped
trigger the higher costs for consumer beef, the association said.
   Sirloin, for example, was $3.62 per pound, up from $3.30 a month
ago, while round steak was up from $2.47 to $2.52. T-Bone steak
averages rose from $4.62 to $4.89.
   Ground beef prices also rose from $1.40 in April to $1.42 in
May, while chuck roast, the only category to come in lower in May,
dropped from $1.74 to $1.68. The NCA said demand for roasts
generally drops during summer months.
   The five-cut average, which also was above the average of $2.71
of May 1987, rose in 14 cities and was down in five.
   The five-cut average ranged from a low of $2.42 in Des Moines to
a high of $3.41 in both Baltimore and Washington, D.C.

<TEXT>
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. has assigned a
single-A-3 rating to 300 million West German marks of Eurobonds
issued by China and due in 1992, Moody's Japanese subsidiary said.
   Moody's Japan K.K. said in a statement Wednesday that it was the
first time a bond issued by China had been rated by a U.S.
credit-rating agency. The single-A-3 rating indicates that the
Eurobond issue is a safe investment.
   Moody's rates bonds in 27 categories from single-C-3, the
highest investment risk, to triple-A-1, the lowest risk.
   The Moody's statement said the rating was ``based on China's
current low level of debt, the expectation that future borrowing
will remain within a comfortable range relative to the nation's
debt-servicing capacity, and the progress made in stabilizing
Chinese politics since the death of Chairman Mao Zedong in 1976.''
   Moody's said China's foreign debt is low by international
standards, totaling an estimated $27 billion at the end of last
year. That represents 9.3 percent of China's gross national product
and 75 percent of its current foreign-exchange receipts, the
statement said.
   ``China has adopted a conservative policy toward reliance on
foreign debt and ... this policy is likely to continue,'' the
statement said.
   However, it said, ``the scope and the nature of the changes
underway are unprecedented, with major policy contradictions yet to
be resolved.''
   ``Discontent has emerged, primarily because of the dramatic
shifts in the control of resources and in the distribution of
benefits, but also because progress on political liberalization has
been slow,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Japan to End Voluntary Auto Export Limits to United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan plans to end its voluntary limit of
automobile exports to the United States effective next April,
according to a news report disputed by the government.
   Kyodo News Service reported Thursday that the government plans
to end the limits. However, officials of the automobile department
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry told The
Associated Press Thursday night they had not discussed the matter
yet.
   Kyodo quoted unidentified MITI sources as saying ministry
officials believe there is no possibility that automobile exports
to the United States will become an issue again because the high
value of the yen makes Japanese exports more expensive.
   Also, Japanese car makers now have production plants in the
United States. Major Japanese producers, led by the Toyota Motor
Corp., also are concentrating now on exporting deluxe cars to the
Untied States that compete with South Korean exports, it said.
   Japan began limiting its auto exports to the U.S. market in
fiscal 1981 under strong pressure from Washington and the slumping
American auto industry. The limit first was set at 1.68 million
vehicles, but was raised to 1.86 million in fiscal 1984.
   The United States stopped asking for the restraints in 1985, but
Japan voluntarily continued limiting car shipments to the U.S.
market to the 2.3 million vehicles exported there in fiscal 1985.
   Japan auto exports in fiscal 1987 were 2.21 million _ below the
limit.

   The deficit in the fund that insures deposits
in the nation's savings institutions more than doubled last year
and congressional action ``may well be needed'' to keep it
operating, the General Accounting Office said today.
   The GAO, the auditing arm of Congress, said the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp.'s liabilities exceeded its assets at the
end of 1987 by $13.7 billion, up from the deficit of $6.3 billion a
year earlier.
   In testimony prepared for the Senate Banking Committee, the GAO
said the fund, which guarantees individual deposits up to $100,000
in 3,120 S&Ls, was in ``precarious financial condition.''
   It said the money available to the fund ``probably will not be
adequate'' to resolve the problems of the nation's 505 insolvent
institutions.
   ``While FSLIC has the resources to continue operating in the
near future, it may not have sufficient resources to effectively
deal with the industry's current and future problems,'' Frederick
D. Wolf, director of the GAO's accounting and financial management
division, said in the testimony.
   Replying to the GAO, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, which regulates federally insured S&Ls, said the
deficit does not mean the insurance fund lacks cash to deal with
current problems. He said it has $4 billion and S&L customers
``should be assured their deposits are fully insured.''
   Wall said the fact that FSLIC may need more money down the road
``comes as a surprise to no one.'' But he added, ``The thing I'm
sensitive to is that there not be any kind of unneccessary concern
in the time sense. We clearly have significant amounts of resources
available to deal with (the worst 200 institutions.) After that,
you get into predicting the future.''
   The GAO report comes only nine months after Congress authorized
the sale of $10.8 billion in bonds over three years to bring the
fund enough money to clean up the ailing industry, which has been
hard hit by the bust of oil and real estate markets in the
Southwest.
   ``We believe that further congressional action, beyond that
already taken, ... may well be needed to enable (the fund) to
continue to meet its obligations and provide the deposit insurance
it is mandated to provide,'' the accounting office said.
   Although Wolf did not explicitly say a taxpayer bailout will be
required, he said ``it appears unlikely that the industry would
have the resources to provide such funding.''
   Officials of the bank board expect the bond sales, the premium
fees it charges institutions and the proceeds from selling the
assets of closed institutions to provide about $20 billion over the
next three years and $28 billion over 10 years.
   However, Wolf said, ``We view FSLIC's projections with
significant reservations.'' He said the agency's estimates of both
the cost of the bailout and the money it will have to spend are too
optimistic.
   Bank board officials last month had estimated the FSLIC deficit
at $11.6 billion _ $2.1 billion less than the GAO figure. They also
said it would cost $15.3 billion to take care of the worst-off 204
thrift institutions and a total of $21.8 billion to rescue all
insolvent thrifts.
   However, the GAO said it would cost $17.4 billion to resolve the
problems of ``the more than 200 hopelessly insolvent institutions''
and $26.4 billion to $36.4 billion to clean up all insolvent S&Ls.
   The GAO warned that this figure does not include an additional
435 institutions, which it said are ``barely solvent.''
   Private analysts have estimated the total cost of restoring the
industry to health to be as high as $60 billion.
   In making its $21.8 billion estimate, the bank board is assuming
that interest rates will not increase significantly and that
virtually no new problem cases will develop in the next 10 years _
a view Wolf called ``extremely optimistic.''
   Regulators also are assuming that insured deposits would grow by
7 percent a year and that nearly all healthy S&Ls would remain in
the insurance fund even after a law blocking their withdrawal
expires in August. Growth of deposits slowed in 1985, 1986 and 1987
and has only been accelerating since last October.
   Also, if a special insurance premium assessed S&Ls is continued
as the bank board expects, healthy thrifts would be encouraged to
leave FSLIC to avoid the added cost. That would reduce its deposit
base and income further, Wolf said.
   But, he said, ``Without continuing the special assessment, there
is no shred of hope of resolving FSLIC's financial plight without
turning to the taxpayer.''
   Bank board officials also project the interest rate on bonds
floated to recapitalize the insurance fund will remain below 10
percent even though rates already are edging higher.
   And, they assume they will take care of most ailing S&Ls by
merging them with healthier institutions, a cheaper alternative
than shutting down an institution and paying off depositors.
   However, the GAO noted that over the last five years, 37 percent
of the cases have been resolved through liquidations, and of the
remaining cases resolved by merger, some have resulted in
institutions that are still weak, only bigger.
   Wolf also said regulators are counting on investors to take
FSLIC notes, rather than cash, in exchange for taking over an
ailing institution. That, he said, ``remains an open question.''
   Wall replied that because the economy has strengthened it is
``clearly not the case anymore'' that there is a lack of interest
in mergers.
   ``We have more interest in these institutions (in Texas) than we
ever expected. ... We have an embarrasment of riches in that
sense,'' he said.

   The federal official who headed the White
House's latest study of the financial market crash defended its
recommendations today, saying the recent dramatic price swings on
the markets do not require dramatic fixes.
   But members of the House telecommunications and finance
subcommittee said they were dissatisfied with the study.
   ``The issue of daily volatility, although an expressed public
concern, is not in the category of systemic threat, in my
opinion,'' said Treasury Undersecretary George D. Gould. ``However
disconcerting such volatility can be on a short term basis, it is
important not to attempt cures that can do more harm than good.''
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., the subcommittee's chairman,
criticized Gould's report, saying, ``history will judge your work
product far more harshly than (did) your boss, President Reagan.''
   The White House has praised the stock market study that Gould
and his associates produced.
   Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, of New Jersey, ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, said of the report's conclusions, ``They certainly
did not go far enough.''
   The working group that produced the study consisted of Gould,
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman David S. Ruder and Commodity Futures
Trading Commission Chairwoman Wendy Gramm.
   Their report recommended that the nation's stock, futures and
options markets set up a ``circuit breaker'' that would allow them
to halt all trading on days when the Dow Jones Industrial Average
plunges by historic levels.
   The study suggested that improvements be made in the credit,
clearing and settlement systems the markets use to conduct and
complete transactions. In addition, the group said it should remain
in existence ``to function as a coordinating and consulting
mechanism for intermarket issues.''
   The report offered no proposals for limiting computer-driven
program trading, a strategy that involves futures and stock
transactions that critics say has helped fueled the markets'
volatility in recent months.
   Also absent were recommendations to change the levels of
margins, or downpayments, for futures transactions, a move that
supporters say would diminish speculation.
   In addition, the group did not endorse a proposal advanced by an
earlier White House panel, headed by investment banker Nicholas F.
Brady, that a single federal agency _ probably the Fed _ should
oversee issues that concern all of the markets.
   Instead, the officials seemed to shrug off the contentions of
many lawmakers and investors that dramatic steps need to be taken
quickly to avoid repeats of days like last Oct. 19, when the Dow
plunged a record 508 points. Since that time, many small investors
have left the market.
   ``When you get a shock to the system that occurred on Oct. 19,
people withdraw,'' Greenspan said Monday. ``It's a cycle. They come
back, they leave, they come back. ... They will be back.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell more than 35
points Wednesday and was at its lowest level in more than three
months.

<HEAD>General Mills Selling Talbots, Eddie Bauer Subsidiaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills Inc. said it will sell its
Talbots women's clothing chain and its Eddie Bauer outdoor apparel
unit, the only remaining subsidiaries not related to food products,
for $585 million.
   The food giant said Wednesday that Jusco Co. of Tokyo will
purchase Talbots for $325 million, and Spiegel Inc. will pay $260
million for Eddie Bauer. Both are cash transactions.
   Proceeds from the sales will result in an after-tax profit of
more than $200 million, or a minimum $2.35 a share, said General
Mills Chairman and Chief Executive Officer H.B. Atwater Jr.
   Much of the remaining $400 million will be used to repurchase
stock in the coming months, Atwater said. General Mills has 84.3
million common shares outstanding.
   General Mills announced in January that it was considering
selling the two retail units, the only remaining subsidiaries not
related to food processing or food marketing.
   Talbots, based in Hingham, Mass., sells classic women's apparel
and accessories in 126 stores in 26 states. Its annual revenue,
including catalog sales, exceeds $340 million, which represented
about 6 percent of General Mills' total revenue.
   Jusco, one of Japan's largest retailers with annual sales of
about $7.6 billion, plans to continue to operate Talbots with its
existing employees, management and headquarters.
   Jusco has had a business relationship with General Mills since
1982, when the two companies formed a joint venture to develop and
operate Red Lobster restaurants in Japan.
   Eddie Bauer, a specialty retailer that sells sportswear, gifts
and outdoor equipment through catalogs and 58 retail stores in 14
states and in Canada, has annual sales of about $255 million.
   John J. Shea, president and chief executive officer of the
Chicago-based Spiegel, said Eddie Bauer will continue to be based
in Seattle.
   He called the acquisition ``a very significant step in Spiegel's
growth plans.''
   Spiegel markets women's and men's apparel, home furnishings and
other general merchandise through catalogs and had revenue of more
than $1 billion in 1987.
   ``Eddie Bauer's customer base for both its retail and catalog
operations is composed principally of men in upper income
households, whereas Spiegel caters primarily to upper income
women,'' Shea said.
   Both transactions are expected to be completed within six weeks,
General Mills said.

   Stock prices eroded sharply this morning in
moderate trading, extending the slide of the past two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit the
lowest point in more than three months on Wednesday, was down 24.86
points to 1,926.23 as of 11 a.m. EDT on Wall Street.
   Among broader market indices, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues fell 1.28 to 141.23. On the
American Stock Exchange, the market-value index fell 2.48 to 290.31.
   Losing issues outnumbered gains by nearly 5-to-1 on the NYSE,
with 1,004 down, 214 up and 468 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled
53.41 million shares after the first 90 minutes.
   Despite a rash of good economic news, stock prices have been
falling over fears of inflation and rising yields in the bond
market, which make bonds more attractive than stocks as an
investment.
   Union Carbide, a component of the Dow average, was among the
most-active NYSE issues, down 3[ to 17~. The company announced
plans Wednesday to cut its dividend and issue more stock.
   Hewlett Packard, which dropped 4| Wednesday on analyst
disappointment with its earnings report, fell another 1[ to 55~.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 35.32 points
to 1,951.09, the lowest close since 1,914.46 on Feb. 9.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4-to-1 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 1,288 down, 283 up
and 417 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 209.42 million shares vs. 133.85

day April 15.

   Grain and soybean futures bounded sharply higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade as a rally fueled by dry
growing conditions continued.
   Within minutes of the opening bell, some new-crop soybean
contracts surpassed $8 a bushel and wheat futures traded above
$3.50 a bushel.
   The latest forecasts for weekend weather in the Midwest were
divided, with some meteorologists calling for widespread rain and
others predicting only scattered showers.
   The National Weather Service predicted normal precipitation in
the northern United States and dry conditions in the South for the
first half of next week.
   Analysts said speculative activity in the grain markets has
increased markedly in the past two weeks as prices have hit new
contract highs almost daily.
   ``We're getting phone calls from people who have never been
involved with this stuff before looking to get in,'' said Walter
Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   In early trading, wheat was 13{ cents to 16} cents higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.37 a bushel; corn was 7
cents to 8{ cents higher with May at $2.16{ a bushel; oats were 3\
cents to 5\ cents higher with May at $1.66{ a bushel; soybeans were
18 cents to 22 cents higher with May at $7.78{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were sharply lower and pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .32 cent to .75 cent lower with June at 73.50
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to 1.10 cents lower with
May at 80.65 cents a pound; hogs were .17 cent lower to .15 cent
higher with June at 53.40 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.50 cent lower to .13 cent higher with May at 53.50 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly higher on Wednesday while pork

<HEAD>Arthur Andersen Consulting Chief Dismissed, Journal Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Arthur Andersen & Co.'s domestic
consulting operation has been dismissed for allegedly planning to
leave Andersen and take the operation with him, according to a
newspaper report.
   The Wall Street Journal, in today's editions, said Gresham
Brebach, the head of domestic consulting who is also a partner in
Andersen, confirmed he had been relieved of his duties but denied
that he was trying to take away Andersen's consulting business.
   Andersen had no immediate comment on the Journal article, said
Michele Bondy, a spokeswoman for the accounting firm.
   Andersen, based in Chicago, is one of the ``Big Eight''
accounting firms, which are the nation's largest and best known.
Its domestic consulting business is the largest in the United
States, according to the Journal.
   Brebach acknowledged that many of Andersen's consulting partners
have a major disagreement with top management ``over the strategic
direction and philosophical approach'' of the firm, the newspaper
said.
   Revenues from consulting operations are generally growing at a
faster pace than fees from auditing and tax accounting, according
to the Journal.
   Brebach told the paper his dismissal probably resulted from a
meeting he called of 11 other Andersen consulting partners in New
York two weeks ago to discuss opposition to a proposed amendment in
the firm's bylaws. The amendment would have required a departing
partner to wait a full year before soliciting Andersen clients or
trying to hire other Andersen partners.

   Stock prices eroded sharply this morning in
moderate trading, extending a two-day slide that brokers have
blamed on rising fear of inflation and higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit the
lowest point in more than three months on Wednesday, was down 15.91
points to 1,935.18 as of noon EDT on Wall Street. Broader market
indices also dropped.
   Despite a rash of good economic news, the stock market has
instead focused on rising yields in the bond market, a barometer of
inflation and interest rates. With 30-year Treasury bonds yielding
9.3 percent, the highest since the October stock crash, many
investors are finding bonds more attractive.
   ``The market today is continuing the selloff that's been in
progress for the last couple of days, primarily in reaction to the
fact that the bond market is providing some very meaningful
competition in attracting money,'' said Jonathan Groveman, head of
equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.
   ``The stock market is trying to go down to a level where it can
attract some buyers relative to the bond market,'' he said.
   Losing issues outnumbered gains by about 4-to-1 on the NYSE,
with 1,069 down, 267 up and 468 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled
78.35 million shares in the morning, vs. 119.31 million Wednesday

   Corporate takeover artists are waging their own
political campaigns this election year. They call them proxy
contests.
   Rather than merely throwing money at shareholders to buy their
way into companies, raiders are exerting new pressure on their
targets by trying to infiltrate the boardroom.
   Convinced they can do more with a company's assets than
incumbent management, outsiders are asking shareholders to cast
their lots with them by voting in a new regime. Often without track
records of their own, raiders promise shareholders handsome returns
in exchange for their support of a rival slate of board candidates.
   The process is not for the faint of heart or purse. Experts
estimate it can cost up to $10 million to wage a full-blown proxy
battle, replete with newspaper ads, mass mailings and phone
solicitations.
   While that's a steep price tag for a fight that usually favors
management, it's sometimes worth the expense. By testing the hinges
on the palace gates, some proxy warriors have stirred entrenched
managers to make big changes and raise the value of their stock to
the delight of common shareholders.
   Corporate gunslingers have had few dead shots with the proxy
weapon, but their aim is getting better. In recent weeks,
managements at Gillette Co. and Irving Bank Corp. came perilously
close to losing control of their boards in heated proxy contests.
   Even more revealing, a study of 60 proxy fights between 1978 and
1985 conducted by the University of Rochester found that, in many
cases, top managers eventually resigned even after beating back
challenges from outside.
   A challenger's typical tactics include painting a ``broad-brush
picture of managerial inefficiency, using a variety of
easy-to-convey criticisms such as poor operating profits or an
allegedly inadequate dividend payout,'' said Harry DeAngelo, a
professor at the University of Rochester who co-authored the study.
   Until recently, proxy contests were not waged against corporate
heavyweights. Experts say the new wave is a result of corporate
defensive maneuvers like poison pills and state laws that make
unwanted takeovers cumbersome.
   Poison pills and new legislation ``have become significant
deterrents to the purchasing of a major stake in a company,''
DeAngelo said.
   Aggressors believe their allies, if elected, can work to rescind
poison pills that may be in place and can help push for a deal.
   The proxy battles that ensue are ``a form of pressure on
companies ... an amplification of takeover strategy,'' said
attorney Todd Lang, chairman of the American Bar Association's
committee on proxy fights and tender offers.
   He noted that until recently, raiders used proxy battles ``as a
way to obtain control of a whole company without paying for it ...
but now we're finding a lot of these contests are connected with
tender offers.''
   California investor Burt Sugarman sought seats for himself and
two allies on the board of Media General Inc. in conjunction with
his $1.8 billion tender offer for the communications company.
Sugarman's bid was complicated by two classes of stock, one of
which put control of the company in the hands of the Bryan family,
owners of 70 percent of Media General's more powerful Class B
shares.
   Management's main advantage in these fights is financial.
Because they control the pursestrings, corporate chieftains can
spend a lot of money to make their own case.
   ``They have all the corporte resources at their disposal _ and
that's shareholder money _ to do as many mailings as they want,
which is tremendously expensive,'' said James Heard, executive
director of United Shareholders Association, a shareholder rights
organization headed by T. Boone Pickens Jr.
   Management also has a better idea who the major shareholders are
and can court them quickly.
   Some experts estimate as much as 50 percent of a corporation's
stock is held in street name, or the name of a broker or another
nominee instead of the customer who will vote the shares.
   Proxy solicitors hired by outsiders spend countless hours trying
to trace shareholders through a confusing web of surface
organizations.
   Institutional shareholders, who control a major portion of
corporate America, often are more inclined to side with management
because of possible reprisals. ``They know if they don't, they will
be punished,'' DeAngelo said.
   In Gillette's case, for example, institutional investors were
believed to hold as much as 65 percent of the 115 million
oustanding shares.
   One source involved in a recent, high-profile proxy battle noted
that ``management has a lot more political strings to pull than the
people from outside who have to persuade stockholders.''
   Difficult to document but nonetheless pervasive are management
threats and behind-the-scenes arm-twisting. One source said
management puts pressure on institutions with which it has business
relationships, sometimes threatening to sever those ties if
dissatisfied with their vote.
   ``That's a tremendous advantage and it's very unfair,'' the
source said.
   Winning or losing is not so easy to judge in these affairs,
however. Joel Reed, chief financial officer of Desert Partners
L.P., notes that it all depends on how success is measured.
   Desert Partners, which has had an outstanding tender offer for
USG Corp., had sought six seats on the company's board. Although
the results of the vote won't be available for some time, Reed
noted that Desert Partners made its point even if USG's directors
are re-elected.
   ``Anytime a board is facing an election contest, management
becomes increasingly concerned about how shareholders view the job
they are doing,'' he said. ``In the case of USG, I question whether
management would have ever proposed the recapitalization plan that
they did ... were it not for the battle for our slate of
candidates.''
   Reed was referring to USG's plan to spend about $2.2 billion to
pay shareholders a one-time dividend that includes cash, stock and
notes for each common share.
   Despite the expense and emotional wear-and-tear of a proxy
battle, some say raiders merely are hoping to cash out at a higher
price. Reed bristled at that suggestion, noting that ``our
objective is to acquire the company.''
   ``You do see success in terms of what I think is a increased
accountability to stockholders on the part of incumbent management
and the board,'' Reed said.
   Despite the advantage management might have, Reed said the proxy
process is a good one.
   ``I would hate to see any barriers to free elections of
directors. I think the free-election process has tremendous
motivation for incumbent management and boards to be responsive to
the wishes of their constituents.''

   Winning a proxy contest is no job guarantee for
current managers.
   According to an analysis of 60 proxy contests, management
resignations typically follow a proxy battle even when outsiders
fail to win seats on a company's board of directors, according to
two researchers at the University of Rochester.
   Professors Harry and Linda DeAngelo, who studied the contests
between 1978 and 1985, noted that about two-thirds of the time, top
managers resigned within three years of a proxy fight, with the
majority of the changes coming within one year.
   That includes managers who lost their jobs when disssident
shareholders won control of their companies, which happened about
30 percent of the time.
   Perhaps even more significant, the two found that only about 20
percent of the companies they studied remained publicly held
corporations run by the same management teams three years after the
proxy contests.
   Harry DeAngelo pointed to two examples:
   _Samuel B. Casey, president and chief executive officer of
Pullman Inc., resigned in November 1978 even though dissident
shareholders were defeated in a proxy fight. Two years later, the
company was acquired by Wheelabrator-Frye Inc.
   _In the case of Management Assistance, a group of dissident
shareholders backed by Asher Edelman won four out of 10 board seats
in an April 1984 proxy fight. Four months later, the company's
president and chief executive officer Raymond Kurshan resigned.
Within a year, the company was liquidated.
   The DeAngelos say their findings raise serious questions about
claims that proxy contests are an inefficient way to discipline
managers of publicly held corporations.
   In many cases of management resignations, the new manager is
designed to accommodate the dissidents' interest, Harry DeAngelo
said.
   ``These findings suggest that, independent of its immediate
outcome, a proxy challenge does pose a serious threat to managerial
tenure,'' the study said.

<HEAD>With BC-Proxy Fights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The more proxy contests, and the grizzlier, the
more business booms for proxy solicitors.
   Solicitors are responsible for the gritty legwork in a proxy
battle. They track down shareholders and talk to them, draft
letters and write newspaper ads, send out mailings, tally votes,
and serve as general hand-holders to whichever side they happen to
represent.
   ``They've got it down to a science,'' one observer remarked.
   The Carter Organization, one of the largest solicitors with 1987
fee income of more than $22 million, has had a hand in several
major proxy fights recently.
   Donald Carter, the group's president, said the cost of a proxy
battle can range anywhere from $1 million to $10 million.
   Because a large precentage of any company's stock is held by
institutional investors or in street names _ names other than the
actual shareholder _ simply identifying just who owns the
outstanding shares is a job for a first-rate sleuth.
   At Georgeson & Co., the nation's oldest proxy solicitor,
managing director John Wilcox said he relies on a database that has
been built up over time linking individuals and their securities
holdings.
   Once shareholders are identified, solicitors have to convince
them to vote in a particular direction. Carter estimates his people
talk by phone with 2 million shareholders a year in an attempt to
influence voting.
   Some firms have even been known to hire actors to use Southern
accents in an attempt to sway shareholders in Southern states,
observers say.
   Carter said new technology allowing shareholders to vote by
phone has ``added a new dimension'' to solicitation. ``When we get
finished speaking with a shareholder, we give them a toll-free
number and ask them to call immediately if they agree with us,'' he
said.
   ``Within five minutes, we know if they're telling the truth that
they're going to vote with us.''
   If the shareholder doesn't call in with a vote, Carter's people
are back on the phone.
   Newspaper ads are also crucial to the proxy process, but they
are not directed toward the individual shareholder. Rather, they
are aimed at the investment community _ both large institutional
investors as well as brokers who may be asked for advice from
individual clients.
   Joel Reed, chief financial officer of Desert Partners L.P., said
solicitors are ``totally key to the entire process. They help
identify and contact shareholders, they give you their prognosis of
how the vote is stacking up and they make sure proxies are properly
executed so they don't get thrown out on a technicality.''
   Desert Partners sought seats on the board of USG Corp. in a
recent proxy contest. The partnership also launched a tender offer
for USG shares.
   As for the latest wave of proxy battles that has come to center
on large corporations, ``business is the busiest ever'' for
solicitors, Wilcox said.

   Authorities today captured the last two of seven
men charged in a wire transfer scheme that siphoned $70 million
from the First National Bank of Chicago to banks in Austria,
authorities said.
   However, U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said Wednesday that the
conspiracy was cracked before the suspects could withdraw the money
transferred illegally from the accounts of three of First
National's corporate customers.
   Valukas said authorities had filed charges of illegal wire
transfer of funds against two First National employees, a third
Chicago man, and three men from Detroit. He identified Armand
Moore, 30, of Detroit, as ringleader of the failed scheme.
   Four of the men were arrested late Tuesday or early Wednesday. A
fifth man, bank employee Gabriel Taylor, 27, has been charged but
is cooperating with authorities.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Mendeloff said the arrests were
made early today in Detroit. He identified the two as Leonard
Strickland, about age 50, and the Rev. Ronald G. Carson, but added
that no further details were available immediately.
   Valukas said that $70 million was transferred illegally Friday
from the accounts of three of First National's corporate customers
_ Chicago-based United Airlines; New York-based Merrill Lynch &
Co.; and Louisville, Ky.-based distiller Brown-Foreman Corp. _ to
two New York banks.
   The money then was transferred to three accounts in two banks in
Vienna, Austria.
   Valukas said no money had been withdrawn from Citibank and Chase
Manhattan in New York, or from Creditanstalt and Focobank in
Austria.
   ``But you could call this sophisticated in that the money
actually made it to the (Austrian) banks,'' said Valukas.
   First National spokesman Anthony Zehnder said neither the
nation's 10th-largest bank nor the three corporate customers whose
accounts were involved in the wire-transfer scheme would lose any
money.
   Valukas said authorities were attempting to determine whether
the accounts at the Viennese banks were fictitious. Two were in the
names of companies, Lord Investment Inc. and GTL Industries, and a
third was in the name of Walter Newman.
   ``Our investigation into whether others are involved is
continuing,'' Valukas said.
   He said evidence would be presented to a federal grand jury as
it considers further charges.
   Four of the suspects appeared for an initial bond hearing late
Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Bernard Weisberg.
   The four _ Moore and Neal Jackson, 31, both of Detroit; and
Herschel Bailey, 30, and First National employee Otis Wilson, 30,
both of Chicago _ were returned to the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center pending another bond hearing Friday.
   Federal agents began investigating the scheme after Merrill
Lynch officials uncovered a $24 million shortfall Monday and
notified the bank, which in turn notified authorities, Valukas said.
   Valukas said the Detroit-to-Chicago connection involved Moore
and Bailey, who is Moore's cousin.
   He said that Moore recruited First National employees Wilson and
Taylor, both of whom allegedly participated in the scheme by
providing confidential information such as code words and
confirming messages for the transactions. That enabled the schemers
to circumvent the bank's security procedures, Valukas said.
   Valukas said Taylor agreed late Tuesday to contact several other
members of the alleged scheme and discuss the matter while wearing
a recording device.

   Prices on the London Stock Exchange fell Thursday
as the market was pressured by a slump on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 17
points, or 1 percent, at 1,760.6. Volume was a moderate 438.1
million shares, compared with Wednesday's 536.1 million shares.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as much as 25
points in the last hour of London trading, disappointing many
London players. Several dealers said rumors of large stock sales in
New York by Japanese investors also did not bode well for the
London market.
   A large computer-generated trading program involving disposal of
several stocks late in the London afternoon also contributed to the
pressure, some traders said.
   ``I would say it's more a case of lethargy than outright
pessimism,'' said one equity salesman, adding that ``unless we get
some more bids and corporate activity, we won't have anything to
keep the market alive.''
   A battery of U.K. economic indicators released earlier Thursday
were digested by the market without causing much of a stir, dealers
said.
   A provisional rise in the money supply of 0.9 percent in April
was equal to or better than market expectations. March industrial
production rose 1.2 percent and the annual rate of increase in
average earnings remained unchanged at 8.5 percent in March,
suggesting the British economy was not immediately overheating.
Unemployment, which dropped to 8.8 percent in April from 9 percent
in March, was lower than expected.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar traded in a narrow range Thursday
in quiet European trading amid uncertainty about currency's
direction. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said dollar trading was dull because of
a lack of conviction among market players on where the U.S.
currency is headed in the short-term.
   Dealers were also uncertain whether this week's U.S. trade
figures, which revealed the trade deficit fell to $9.75 billion in
March from $13.8 billion in February, were an aberration or the
beginning of a trend.
   In London, the British pound finished mixed. It was quoted at
$1.8665 late Thursday, more expensive for buyers than $1.8605 late
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Wednesday's prices,
included: 1.6990 West German marks, down from 1.7055; 1.4155 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4215; 5.7542 French francs, down from 5.7700;
1.9042 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9090; 1,262.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,265.50; and 1.2442 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24125.
   Earlier, the dollar fell 0.73 yen to a closing 124.80 yen in
Tokyo, in what traders said was a correction following sharp gains
on the back of the trade report. In London, the dollar was quoted
at 124.87 yen.
   Gold prices rose in active European trading.
   In London, the metal was quoted at a late bid price of $456.90 a
troy ounce, up from $453.70 late Wednesday.
   Dealers said a rush to buy soybeans by commodity dealers in
Chicago helped boost gold prices. Higher prices for the beans
following dry weather in the U.S. plains threaten to cause an
increase in food prices and inflation and thus make gold _ a
favorite hedge against inflation _ more desirable.
   In Zurich, the bid price for gold was $458, up from $454 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.02 to close at a bid $457.56.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid $6.72 a troy ounce, up from
Wednesday's $6.58.

<HEAD>US, Europe Set Aside Differences On Farm Trade Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conference of leading industrial nations ended
Thursday after the United States failed to persuade European
governments to accept its proposal for ending public aid to farmers
by the year 2000.
   However, trade and finance ministers from the 24 members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said they
would work together to reform global farm trading rules.
   The European countries held out against U.S. efforts to set a
timetable for phasing out subsidies designed to prop up farm prices
and boost exports.
   These efforts already are under way, with little apparent
progress, in the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
a Geneva-based body that sets and monitors world trade rules.
   U.S. officials said they would have preferred a more specific
commitment to press ahead with farm policy reforms, but that
differences with the Europeans were not insurmountable.
   ``We're basically on the same wave length,'' said Clayton
Yeutter, the U.S. special trade representative.
   ``What we achieved in this meeting is a recognition of the fact
that ... we've got to begin to develop the specifics of the
negotiating outlines,'' he added.
   Officials from other countries took a more modest view of the
meeting's outcome.
   Kjell-Olof Feldt, Swedish finance minister and chairman of the
meeting, told reporters the Americans wanted a commitment to start
reforming farm trade rules in 1989, while ``others believed it
should be a gradual process.''
   ``I wouldn't dare to say this has been resolved,'' he said.
   Willy De Clercq, the top trade official of the European Economic
Community, told reporters the EEC, or Common Market, would never
accept the U.S. idea of eliminating all farm subsidies.
   ``For us it is a question of reduction (of subsidies), not
phasing out,'' he said.
   The United States and the EEC both spend about $25 billion a
year on farm subsidies. They agree that this aid has become too
burdensome, but they disagree over how to correct the problem.
   Bill Hayden, the Austrialian foreign minister, told reporters he
was pleased the Paris meeting had avoided an open clash over what
he called apparently irreconcilable differences between U.S. and
European officials.
   De Clercq made a similar assessment.
   ``The main thing was to avoid a needless ... clash which would
have been a counterproductive signal,'' De Clercq said.
   The Paris communique said the GATT negotiations in Geneva should
achieve solid progress in all areas _ including rules for trading
in services such as banking _ by December, when a review conference
will be held.
   ``As they enter their more difficult phase, it is vital to
ensure the momentum of these ambitious negotiations,'' the joint
declaration said.
   The trade and finance ministers, in a broad review of the state
of the world economy, said economic growth was much stronger than
had been expected in the immediate aftermath of last October's
stock market crash.
   They said world trade was growing robustly, inflation was
holding at a low level, global trade imbalances were improving and
international cooperation on economic issues was growing.
   The ministers added, however, that problems remain, including
protectionism, or actions by governments to protect domestic
industries from foreign competition.
   The statement said the top priority for the United States should
be to further reduce its federal budget deficit.
   Japan was praised for its efforts to increase imports and
stimulate domestic consumer demand.
   Europe was urged to increase the flexibility of its labor and
financial markets and to reform its agricultural policies.
   The ministers also agreed the current approach to easing the
debt burdens of poorer nations should be continued. They said each
debtor's situation should be considered individually rather than
applying an across-the-board formula for financial relief.

<HEAD>Directors Urged To Reject Proposal to Divide Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc. executives will urge the
board of directors to reject a proposal that would split the
company, giving California industrialist Burt Sugarman more than
one-fourth interest in the firm's broadcast operations, according
to a published report Thursday.
   Lawyer Nicholas Chimicles of Haverford, Pa. proposed the
restructuring in a May 5 letter. Chimicles represents Harvey M.
Jasper of New York and Sarah Shields of Florida, who claim in a
federal court lawsuit that Media General officers and directors
breached their fiduciary duty to stockholders by rejecting
Sugarman's $61.50-per-share offer to buy all of the company's stock.
   Sugarman has since increased the offer to $70 per share, or
about $2 billion. He also is waging a proxy fight to have himself
and two associates elected to Media General's board of directors at
Friday's annual meeting.
   The takeover proposal will not be voted on at the meeting.
   James S. Evans, president and chief executive officer of Media
General, told the Richmond News-Leader ``management intends to
recommend against pursuing'' Chimicles' proposal.
   ``We are not recommending any form of recapitalization at this
time,'' he added.
   Chimicles said in his letter his proposal would be better than a
clear victory by either side in court. He said a Sugarman defeat
would result in a decline in Media General stock.
   A Sugarman victory would benefit shareholders, Chimicles said,
``but perhaps not the the degree available'' under his plan.
   The lawyer said he retained a Philadelphia investment banking
company, Howard, Lawson & Co., to formulate a plan that would boost
stockholder value in Media General, divide the company into two
units, give Sugarman ``a fair return on his investment'' and enable
members of the D. Tennant Bryan family to retain control of the
company's newsprint and newspaper businesses, which include the
News-Leader and the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
   Sugarman and his associates own 10.1 percent of Media General
Class A stock, an investment of more than $111 million.
   Bryan family members own 70 percent of the company's Class B
stock which, in effect, controls the company, and about 12 percent
of the publicly traded Class A stock.
   Chimicles said Media General's cable franchises in Fairfax
County and Fredericksburg, three commercial television stations in
the Southeast and a broadcast services operation are valued at
about $580.5 million.
   Under the plan, Sugarman would be given 27 percent of the new
company, based on his Media General investment. Each Media General
stockholder would receive one share in the new company for each
Media General share held. Under that structure, the broadcast
company would be capitalized with more than 34.9 million shares of
common stock, valued at about $16.50 each.
   Chimicles said the new company would be operated under a
one-share, one-vote principle.
   The company less its broadcast properties would be operated as
Media General is now, with Class B stock closely held and
controlling the firm, and Class A stock publicly traded but with
less voting power.

   Tandy Corp. is phasing out its Radio Shack Model
200 laptop computer, a mainstay for journalists, and expects to run
out of inventories by around the end of the year, the company said
Thursday.
   The Model 200, which has a flip-up, flat-panel screen, has been
reduced to a clearance price of $499, down from $799. That makes it
the same price as the Model 102, which has a smaller, built-in
screen and will remain in production.
   The Model 200 enjoyed its greatest market penetration in the
newspaper business, where reporters used it to write stories while
away from the office, said Ed Juge, director of market planning for
Fort Worth, Texas-based Tandy.
   Juge said the Model 200 was squeezed from the bottom by the
Model 102 and from the top by the Model 1400, a $1,499 computer
introduced last August that has more memory and runs
industry-standard MS-DOS software.

<HEAD>California Company to Manufacture Guns in China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California gun manufacturer will make
semiautomatic carbines similar to the Israeli Uzi in China under a
contract described as the first such agreement with a communist
country, the company announced Thursday.
   Weaver Arms Corp. of San Diego will sell the first shipments of
its 9mm Nighthawk carbines in the United States, and plans to sell
the guns to American police agencies, private citizens and Third
World military, said Robert Weaver, company president.
   The initial production agreement, which the company said was
approved by the State Department, prohibits sale of the guns to
China, but the company hopes eventually to open that market, Weaver
said.
   The State Department's public affairs office did not immediately
respond to a request for confirmation that it was the first time an
American gun company had been allowed to make weapons in China.
   One arms industry analyst downplayed the value of such a weapon
to the military or police, saying there are plenty of other
semiautomatic weapons available to them.
   Semiautomatics fire once each time the trigger is pulled. It is
legal for civilians to own semiautomatic weapons in this country,
but fully automatic guns are illegal.
   The principal value of the deal would be to give Weaver a cheap
product for sale to American collectors and others who value guns
that look like the short-barreled Uzis they see on television, said
the analyst, Gregory Fetter of Forecast International, the Newtown,
Conn., publisher of World Weapons Week.
   ``Everybody wants to walk around being macho these days,''
Fetter said. ``The gun-loving public wants something that makes
them look like a special forces trooper yet is legal.''
   Weaver signed an agreement with the Chinese government at a
ceremony May 14 in Beijing, and expects to begin production in 90
days, with the first shipment of 10,000 guns planned by January
1989.
   ``We're very excited,'' Weaver said. ``It's an agreement that's
never been accomplished before between a Western arms company and a
communist country.''
   Weaver refused to divulge the value of the contract or the
location of the factory in China, saying the Chinese insisted on
secrecy for the time being.
   The guns are expected to sell for $525 retail. The Uzi goes for
$698 in this country, and the other similar gun, the German HK94,
retails for $800, Weaver said.
   The publicly held company also has designed a 9mm pistol and an
ultralight submachine gun, but neither is yet in production, Weaver
said.

   Stock prices eroded today in moderate trading,
extending a two-day slide that brokers have blamed on rising fear
of inflation and higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit the
lowest point in more than three months on Wednesday, was down as
much as 25 points this morning although it rebounded to 1,950.27 as
of 3 p.m. EDT, down 0.82. Broader market indices weakened.
   Despite a rash of good economic news, the stock market has
instead focused on rising yields in the bond market, a barometer of
inflation and interest rates.
   With 30-year Treasury bonds yielding about 9.3 percent, the
highest since the October stock crash, many investors are finding
bonds more attractive.
   ``The market today is continuing the selloff that's been in
progress for the last couple of days, primarily in reaction to the
fact that the bond market is providing some very meaningful
competition in attracting money,'' said Jonathan Groveman, head of
equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.
   ``The stock market is trying to go down to a level where it can
attract some buyers relative to the bond market,'' he said.
   Losing issues outnumbered gains by about 3-to-2 on the NYSE,
with 905 down, 553 up and 485 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled
141.86 million shares with an hour of trading left.
   Union Carbide, a component of the Dow average, was among the
most-active NYSE issues, down { to 18\. The company announced plans
Wednesday to cut its dividend and issue more stock.
   Amfac jumped 6} to 45[ after the diversified company's
management announced a plan to buy the company for $41 a share.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Up Sharply As Grains, Soybeans Advance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures closed sharply higher Thursday on
the Chicago Board of Trade and contracts for future delivery of
other grains and soybeans also extended their weather-related
advance.
   With the winter wheat crop in need of a good soaking to finish
off its critical heading stage before harvest, wheat traders are
worried that a continuing run of dry weather could do enough damage
to significantly decrease yields, analysts said.
   Weekend weather forecasts were mixed and the National Weather
Service called for normal to below-normal rainfall across the
country for the first half of next week.
   Corn and soybean prices also ran up sharply early in the day but
retreated on profit taking after contracts for May delivery expired
at noon. But wheat prices remained firm through the close.
   ``I think the wheat market is beginning to take on a life of its
own,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``It hasn't really been in an uptrend
like corn and soybeans and there's some concern about the condition
of the crop in Kansas and Nebraska.
   At the close, wheat was 8{ cents to 11} cents higher with July
at $3.42{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 3 cents higher with July
at $2.17{ a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 3{ cents higher with July

   In its annual study, National Utility Service Inc. said the
nation's 24 largest investor-owned utilities charged their
non-residential customers an average 6.28 cents per kilowatt-hour
over the 12-month period, compared with 6.29 cents a year earlier.
   That slight decrease compared with an overall inflation rate of
3.9 percent over the same period, the firm said.
   ``Price reductions by some utilities could be attributed to the
recent decline in oil prices,'' said Marvin Lauterbach, executive
vice president of the Park Ridge, N.J.-based firm.
   But Lauterbach warned that the apparent stability masked an
upward price movement by half of the utilities surveyed.
   ``Some of these increases are a direct result of having
industrial and commercial users offset the costs incurred in the
building of nuclear power plants,'' he said. ``Most of these
nuclear power plants still lack a license to operate.''
   Looking to other countries, the firm found that electricity
costs also fell in Ireland, by 4.87 percent, and Belgium, by 1.98
percent. That compared with inflation rates of 2.5 percent and 0.96
percent, respectively.
   In France, the average cost remained constant, while inflation
rose by 2.4 percent, the organization said.
   Countries where businesses paid more for electricity, with
percentages of increases and national inflation rates were:
   _Canada, 8.7 percent, 4.1 percent.
   _Australia, 5.9 percent, 6.8 percent.
   _United Kingdom, 5.5 percent, 3.5 percent.
   _Sweden, 4.6 percent, 5.4 percent.
   _Italy, 3.17 percent, 4.9 percent.
   _Netherlands, 1.1 percent, 0.5 percent.
   _West Germany, 0.2 percent, 0.8 percent.
   National Utility Service is an international utility
cost-consulting firm with offices in 12 nations.

<HEAD>Exxon Announces Earnings Upswing At Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp., the nation's largest oil company,
entered this year on a ``definite earnings upswing'' despite two
years of severe oil price volatility and market disruptions,
Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said Thursday at the company's annual
meeting.
   Exxon's net income of $1.46 billion for the first quarter of
1988 was up 36 percent over the first quarter of 1987, even though
average crude oil prices in this year's first quarter were about $2
a barrel lower than the first quarter last year, Rawl said.
   ``The effect of these declining oil prices on our exploration
and production earnings was cushioned somewhat by increased
production from new and existing fields,'' Rawl said of the New
York-based corporation. ``More importantly, however, petroleum
product prices _ both here and abroad _ were relatively firm.''
   Firm prices helped improve margins in Exxon's refining and
marketing sectors, said Rawl, who added that the company also
profited from sharp production increases in its chemical operations.
   ``After two consecutive years of record earnings, chemicals
began this year with the best quarterly earnings ever,'' Rawl said.
   The company last month reported first quarter earnings of $1.06
per share, up 41 percent over the first quarter of 1987.
   Exxon spent $1.8 billion in 1987 to acquire producing oil and
gas properties in the United States, Canada and Australia and the
company plans to continue investment in high-quality, attractively
priced reserves, Rawl said.
   In an effort to make exploratory drilling ventures more
cost-effective, the company is concentrating on a select group of
high-quality prospects _ a policy that led to significant
discoveries last year in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
Australia and Columbia, Rawl said.
   ``This success,'' Rawl said, ``has encouraged us to budget an
increase from 184 to about 240 exploratory wells this year.''
   Exxon also invested about $524 million in overall research and
development last year, including research into new generation
synthetic fuel technologies, Rawl said. He said the research will
allow Exxon to take advantage of its sizeable holdings of coal, oil
shale and other resources.
   ``Continuing to operate in a very difficult and uncertain
business environment requires us to continue improving our
efficiency and keep a sharp eye on near-term performance,'' Rawl
said. ``We must look further out and invest in those emerging
technologies that are essential for our company's long-term growth
and profitability.''

<TEXT>
   Flamboyant financier Paul Bilzerian, now
chairman of Singer Co., is the target of major Securities and
Exchange Commission and federal grand jury investigations for
possibly violating a litany of securities laws, a published report
said Thursday.
   The Wall Street Journal said that documents it obtained and
interviews conducted with business associates show Bilzerian may
have engaged in such crimes as insider trading, tax fraud, filing
false documents with the SEC and ``parking'' stock in accounts that
conceal its ownership.
   The investigations stem from the Ivan Boesky insider trading
scandal. The Journal also said new details of possible securites
law violations surfaced in the SEC lawsuit filed last week against
Ohio developer Edward DeBartolo, Sr.
   Bilzerian, an eccentric high school dropout who amassed a
fortune through real estate, stock market speculation and takeover
raids, used a number of possibly illegal tactics to ``force large
corporations into unwanted takeovers or liquidations that gained
him hundreds of millions of dollars,'' the Journal said.
   A spokesman at Singer headquarters said Bilzerian had no comment
on the Journal report.
   In one case early on in his takeover career, Bilzerian secretly
purchased and parked 58,000 shares of H.H. Robertson Co., a
Pittsburgh construction company he said he would acquire for $250
million, the Journal said.
   But Bilzerian never followed through with a formal bid and did
not file any documents detailing his offer with the SEC, as
required by law, the paper said. In the process, the Journal said,
Bilzerian alienated Canada's wealthy Belzberg family, which owned
17 percent of Robertson.
   Bilzerian also reneged on an agreement to buy back the Robertson
shares he parked at Jefferies & Co., leaving the Los Angeles
securities firm with a $250,000 loss, the paper said.
   Later, however, Bilzerian partly reimbursed Jefferies, and then
sent the firm two phony invoices for $75,000 each when he leared
the firm had recouped a good portion of the loss on its own, the
Journal said.
   In his next deal, the paper said, the Florida raider secretly
enlisted the aid of the DeBartolo in his bid for Cluett, Peabody &
Co. SEC documents do not reveal any links between the two, but the
Journal said DeBartolo bought large blocks of Cluett stock for
himself and arranged for others to buy more, sometimes after
talking with Bilzerian.
   The Journal said documents indicate DeBartolo lent Bilzerian
millions of dollars to purchase Cluett shares. Bilzerian and his
investor group walked away with $82 million after West
Point-Pepperell Inc. surfaced as a ``white knight'' and bought
Cluett.
   The paper also said Bilzerian had an arrangement with Jefferies
that the firm would buy stock in Hammermill Paper Co., his next
target, and hold it for him to buy at a later date. Between
Jefferies and his own purchases, Bilzerian's stake totaled more
than 5 percent, though he did not report it to the SEC as required
by law, the Journal said.
   An hour before Bilzerian launched a $900 million bid for
Hammermill, he purchased an additional 1.7 million shares, the
paper said.
   The Journal noted that Bilzerian did not report he was again
working with DeBartolo, who was amassing his own block of
Hammermill shares.
   Bilzerian and his group made $54 million when Hammermill was
rescued by International Paper Co.
   The paper said Bilzerian parked at least 800,000 shares of Armco
with Jefferies in late 1986. To realize a $500,000 profit when the
stock rose in price, he sent Jefferies an invoice for consulting
services payable on Jan. 2, 1987, in an attempt to defer the gain
for tax purposes, the paper said.
   The Journal noted that Bilzerian and Jefferies severed all
relations shortly after Nov. 12, 1986, when the government's
investigation into insider trading violations swung into high gear.
   In March 1987, Boyd Jefferies, chairman of the investment firm,
agreed to settle SEC charges, pleaded guilty to two felonies and
agreed to cooperate. The SEC then began investigating the
transactions involving Cluett, Hammermill and other companies that
Bilzerian had a hand in, the Journal said.
   Bilzerian acquired Singer in a $1.06 billion hostile bid on the
heels of the stock market crash, putting him at the helm of one of
the nation's oldest corporations.

<HEAD>Bear Stearns Re-evaluating Index Arbitrage Position</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bear Stearns & Co., one of several major Wall
Street investment firms to cut back on program trading, said
Thursday it will reconsider the move after a government official
said such restrictions could destabilize the market.
   Bear Stearns went further than four other investment firms when
it announced last week it would not only stop index arbitrage
trading for its own accounts but for those of customers as well.
   Salomon Brothers Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co., PaineWebber Group
Inc. and Kidder Peabody & Co. halted index arbitrage for their own
accounts amid concern that the popular form of program trading was
at least partly responsible for the stock market's volatility.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that
excessive restriction of index arbitrage would limit market
liquidity and tend to destabilize the market.
   In testimony before the House telecommunications and finance
subcommittee, Greenspan said that ``insufficient arbitrage between
cash and futures can be a destabilizing force in a declining
market.''
   In index arbitrage, traders use computers to buy or sell baskets
of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to help
them profit from brief price discrepancies.
   Greenspan noted that ``reduced arbitrage implies less connection
between cash and futures markets and more price disparities across
these markets.''
   Partly citing those comments, Alan Greenberg, Bear Stearns'
chairman and chief executive officer, said the firm would
``re-examine its position on index arbitrage.''
   Greenberg said Bear Stearns had been ``monitoring closely the
action and the liquidity problems of the stock market for the past
week.''
   He also pointed to other firms' ``suspension of index arbitrage
activity for themselves but (continuation of) those activities for
customers'' as further reason for the firm to re-evaluate its
position.
   ``If we do decide to re-enter index arbitrage, we will consider
limiting our activities to buying on a downtick and attempting to
sell on an uptick in the stocks involved,'' Greenberg said in a
statement.

   Oil futures prices edged fractionally higher
Thursday.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed up 2
cents at $17.45 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among June contracts for refined products, wholesale prices for
unleaded gasoline rose 0.03 cent to 52.26 cents per gallon, while
heating oil rose 0.56 cent to 47.63 cents per gallon.
   Chris McCormack, an analyst at the investment firm Drexel Burham
Lambert Inc., said an oversupply of crude in June kept prices for
that contract down for most of the day before a late rally pushed
it into the black at the close.
   He said technical factors dominated the session's activity,
rather than any specific news.

   Assets of the nation's 425 money market mutual
funds rose $3.70 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $274.12 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $3.35 billion drop to $270.41 billion in the
funds' assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 212 general purpose funds rose $1.05 billion to $83.9
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds rose $652 million to
$115.78 billion, and assets of 116 institutional funds rose $2.0
billion to $74.44 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.27 percent from 6.14 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.17 percent from 6.12 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
39 days, down from 40 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.70 percent as of Wednesday from 5.68 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.95
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 6.93 percent
the previous week. Yields were 7.28 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
7.23 percent; 7.70 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.65 percent;
and 8.18 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.12 percent.

<HEAD>Congressional Committee Looks at Northrop Payments in Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional subcommittee is trying to
determine if $6.5 million Northrop Corp. invested in a hotel
project in Korea was actually intended to influence sales of the
company's ill-fated F-20 jet fighter, a committee aide said
Thursday.
   A Northrop spokesman denied any violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices act, and portrayed the company a victim of fraud by its
Korean partner in the deal.
   Northrop has filed a fraud suit against the Korean company,
which was its partner in a 50-50 joint venture to build a hotel in
Seoul, said Tony Cantafio, a spokesman at the company's Los Angeles
headquarters.
   Northrop never began commercial production of the F-20 because
it failed to win sufficient orders.
   The probe by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee's
subcommittee on investigations focuses on Northrop's payment of
$6.5 million in 1984 to Asia Culture Travel Co.
   Cantafio said the payment was part of a so-called offset program
in which the company was to invest in Korea's economy in return for
receiving the fighter contract. Such arrangements are common among
aerospace companies dealing with developing countries and are
allowed by U.S. law.
   The committee, chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., is probing
whether the payment was intended to buy influence rather than build
a hotel, said a subcommittee staff member who refused to be
identified. It would be a violation of the Corrupt Practices Act if
the company meant the money as payment to individuals.
   One aspect of the arrangement that aroused suspicion, the
Dingell aide said, was that the money intended for the development
company was deposited in a Hong Kong bank account.
   ``We were defrauded by a group of people in Korea,'' Cantafio
said. ``We tried and tried again to get that hotel under way and
when it became evident that the hotel wasn't going to be built we
filed for arbitration, and then we filed this suit.''
   The suit, filed in Korea in December 1987, accuses the Asia
Culture Travel Co. and 12 individuals of defrauding the company.
   The committee also is probing Northrop's payment of $1.5 million
to terminate an agreement with a Korean company that was supposed
to help it market the jet in Korea. The committee staff has
questioned the size of January 1984 payment to the Dong Yang
Express Group because the agreement didn't bring any sales, the
Dingell aide said.
   Cantafio declined to comment on the Dong Yang agreement.

<HEAD>Chrysler Looking to Improve Profits while Holding Market Share</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. is looking for ways to improve
profits on its auto business without sacrificing sthe market share
it gained by holding down prices and offering aggressive buyer
incentives, Chairman Lee Iacocca told shareholders Thursday.
   ``We are in a real dog fight in this market,'' Iacoccasaid. ``We
intend to price as aggressively as we have to. Our goal is market
share ... We want all the ground we can take.''
   Chrysler increased its share of the U.S. vehicle market to 14.5
percent at the end of April from 13.3 percent a year ago while
industry leader General Motors Corp. continued to lose market share.
   The No. 3 U.S. automaker pushed up its share by keeping its
prices the lowest among the Big Three company and offering ``the
biggest rebates and incentives the world has ever known,'' Iacocca
said.
   The pricing strategies and continuing expenses from Chrysler's
August acquisition of American Motors Corp. have pushed down
profits. A United Auto Workers contract ratified last week will put
further pressure on earnings.
   In addition, Chrysler has increased spending on new product
research and development by 25 percent, or $150 million, in 1988 _
a necessary expense for updating its cars and trucks with new
engines and transmissions in the 1990s.
   Chrysler's immediate capital spending on new products and
facilities will be about $2.8 billion in 1988, nearly even with $3
billion in 1987, Iacocca said.
   Iacocca predicted Chrysler would earn more in the second quarter
than the $183.7 million it earned in the first quarter, but would
not do as well as analysts are projecting because of costs
including continuing incentives.
   ``I can't tell you how long it will be before we can do
something to improve our profit margins _ that is, without giving
up any of the market share we've taken,'' he said.
   Bennett Bidwell, president of product and marketing for Chrysler
Motors Corp., Chrysler's core automaking business, said Thursday
Chrysler is looking at increasing prices in 1989 to improve profits.
   ``At some point in time you reach a point of diminishing
returns'' selling cars and trucks by offering rebates on top of low
prices, Bidwell said.
   For example, the Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant are Chrysler's
best-selling cars. But Chrysler is selling them as part of its
America series with a $6,995 base price and more standard equipment
than in previous years and including the cars in its rebate
campaign.
   ``That doesn't leave much on the table,'' Bidwell said. Chrysler
will replace the K-car after 1989 with the Dodge Spirit and
Plymouth Acclaim, a bigger, more modern version of the same car
that goes on sale in January.
   Despite intense conflict between Chrysler and its 66,000 UAW
workers in the months before and during negotiations on the new
two-year contract, only a handful of UAW representatives other than
President Owen Bieber _ a member of Chrysler's board _ attended the
meeting.
   Mike Allen, an official with UAW Local 624 at Chrysler's New
Process Gear plant in Syracuse, was assured by Iacocca Chrysler
does not plan to sell any of its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary
plants beyond the four already announced _ three in the Detroit
area and one in Van Wert, Ohio.
   Chrysler wound up in early contract negotiations with the UAW
because it entertained a $2 billion offer for Acustar, which
includes the Syracuse plant. Chrysler turned down the offer after
workers threatened to cripple the company with plant-by-plant
strikes.
   Iacocca said Chrysler had underestimated ``how strongly our
employees felt about remaining part of this Chrysler family.''

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar drifted lower Thursday against most
major currencies except the West German mark and the British pound
in a sluggish market weighed down by continued concern about
inflation and interest rates.
   Gold prices edged higher. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid price for gold of $455.70 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EDT,
up from $455.50 late Wednesday.
   Traders said the foreign exchange markets lacked conviction
about the dollar's likely direction in the near term. A rally
sparked by Tuesday's positive government report on U.S. trade
performance in March came to a halt Wednesday, and the markets have
been casting about for new signals.
   ``After the trade deficit (report), people are resting on their
laurels,'' David Godwin, a currency dealer at United Bank of
Switzerland's New York office.
   The currency markets have caught the inflation anxiety gripping
the stock and bond markets, traders said. The Federal Reserve has
refrained in recent days from aggressively seeking to push interest
rates higher.
   Many dealers expected the Fed to drive interest rates higher in
an effort to rein in inflation. Fears of renewed inflation were
aggravated Tuesday by the March trade figures and a report that
U.S. factory use increased in April.
   A move by the central bank toward higher interest rates would
tend to bolster the dollar.
   ``Certainly, people are looking for more movement from'' the
Fed, said Graham Broyd, vice president of foreign exchange at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.73 Japanese yen to a closing 124.80
yen. Traders described the decline as a correction to the dollar's
earlier rally.
   Later in London, the dollar edged up to 124.87 yen. By the end
of the trading day in New York, the dollar settled at 124.86 yen,
down from 124.93 yen late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8665, more
expensive for buyers than $1.8605 late Wednesday. Later in New
York, the pound retreated to $1.8635 from $1.8675 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.7017 West German marks, up from
1.7007; 1.4177 Swiss francs, down from 1.4182; 5.7540 French
francs, down from 5.7575; 1,262.00 Italian lire, down from
1,263.50; and 1.2427 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2463.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6990 West German marks, down from
1.7055; 1.4155 Swiss francs, down from 1.4215; 5.7542 French
francs, down from 5.7700; 1.9042 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9090;
1,262.00 Italian lire, down from 1,265.50; and 1.2442 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.24125.
   Dealers said a rush to buy soybeans by commodity dealers in
Chicago helped boost gold prices. Higher prices for the beans
following dry weather in the plains states threaten to cause an
increase in food prices and inflation and thus make gold _ a
favorite hedge against inflation _ more desirable.
   In London, gold was quoted at a late bid price of $456.90 a troy
ounce, up from $453.70 late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, the bid price for gold was $458, up from
$454 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.02 to close at a bid price
of $457.56.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
settled at $457.40 a troy ounce, up from $457.30 late Wednesday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid of $6.72 a troy ounce, up
from late Wednesday's $6.58.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery settled at
$6.612 a troy ounce, down from $6.685 late Wednesday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in early May, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 cracked the $3 trillion
mark, rising $3.3 billion to a seasonally adjusted $3,000.9 billion
in the week ended May 9 from $2,997.6 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased $4.5 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,773.7 billion from $3,769.2 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell $7.2 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $769.1 billion from $776.3 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $2,974.7 billion, an 8.7
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,746.5 billion, up 8.1 percent, while M1
rose 5.5 percent to an average of $765.2 billion.
   The Fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for
M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The Fed
has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $506 million in
the week ended May 11, compared with a gain of $1.65 billion a week
earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $406 million, up from $349 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled $584 million
in the two weeks ended Wednesday, down from $621 million in the
previous two weeks.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $275.5 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $276.5 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Jump As Dryness Prompts Yield Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices bounded higher Thursday amid increasing
fears that disease and drought could significantly reduce yields
from the rapidly maturing winter wheat crop.
   Other grain futures also moved higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade and soybean futures finished mixed.
   On other markets, cattle futures were sharply lower while pork
futures were mixed; precious metals were mixed; energy futures and
stock-index futures advanced.
   With the winter wheat crop in need of a good soaking to finish
off the maturation process before harvest, wheat traders were
worried that a continuation of the recent dry weather could do
enough damage to cut yields, analysts said.
   Weekend weather forecasts were mixed and the National Weather
Service called for normal to below-normal rainfall across the
country for the first half of next week.
   In addition to weather problems, reports have surfaced of
disease damage to wheat in Kansas and Nebraska, said Walter Spilka,
an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Although most of the wheat crop has been reported in good
condition, concerns about potential damage have become strong
enough that ``the wheat market is beginning to take on a life of
its own'' instead of following the corn and soybean trends, Spilka
said.
   Indeed, corn and soybean prices also ran up sharply early in the
day but retreated on profit-taking after grain contracts for May
delivery expired at noon. Wheat prices remained firm right through
the close.
   ``The wheat is in the heading stage, when it normally does need
a good rain to finish off the crop and ensure good yields,'' Spilka
said. ``So the wheat may be trading on some dryness of its own.''
   Wheat settled 8{ cents to 11\ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.42\ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 3 cents
higher with July at $2.16 a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 3{ cents
higher with July at $1.72\ a bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents lower
to 1} cents higher with July at $7.68 a bushel.
   The early runup in grain prices had a strong negative impact on
cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Higher grain prices would mean higher feed prices and narrower
profit margins for cattle producers, which could ultimately lead to
higher beef prices and a corresponding drop in demand for beef,
analysts said.
   ``The threat of higher feed costs in the future and the
potential for tighter supplies of feed grains .... certainly threw
some indecision into the live cattle futures,'' said Dale
Durchholz, market analyst for AgriVisor Services Inc. in
Bloomington, Ill.
   In addition, hot weather is drying up the Western ranges, which
could force early sales of cattle to feedlots and boost supplies of
market-ready animals, Durchholz said.
   The weakness in the cattle futures carried over into the
neighboring pork pits but expectations of a seasonal drop in hog
supplies limited losses and helped hog futures close on a mixed
note, he said.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .87 cent lower with June at 73.12
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .62 cent to 1.23 cents lower with
May at 80.65 cents a pound; hogs were .17 cent lower to .42 cent
higher with June at 53.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.20 cent to .80 cent lower with May at 53.05 cents a pound.
   The precious metals markets also were watching grain prices,
especially soybean prices, which are considered a rough indicator
of inflation, analysts said.
   Gold futures on New York's Commodity Exchange hit their highs
early in the day, then sold off as soybean prices fell, said Peter
Cardillo, an analyst in New York with Josephthal & Co.
   The profit-taking was more pronounced in the silver market,
where futures prices settled sharply lower following a strong rally
on Wednesday.
   Gold settled 20 cents lower to 10 cents higher with June at
$458.20 a troy ounce; silver was 7.3 cents to 7.5 cents lower with
May at $6.612 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures edged higher in dull trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 34 cents
higher with June at $17.45 a barrel; heating oil was .08 cent lower
to .56 cent higher with June at 47.63 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .07 cent to .25 cent higher with June at 52.30 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures posted modest gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 1.80 points higher at 252.90.

   Stocks barely broke a two-day losing streak
Thursday in a partial recovery that traders attributed to bargain
shopping and slightly eased tension over inflation, but the outlook
on Wall Street remained bleak.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 56.54 points
on Tuesday and Wednesday and dropped another 25 points in early
trading, rebounded and finished up 7.63 points to 1,958.72. Broader
market indices were mixed.
   To a large degree, the Dow average's behavior echoed movements
in the bond market, which in turn echoed movements in the Commodity
Research Bureau index, a key measure of inflation that tracks
commodity futures prices in Chicago.
   The CRB index rose sharply in the morning, heightening inflation
fears, raising yields in the bond market and depressing stock
prices as bonds became a more attractive alternative to stocks.
   The CRB index later retreated when soybean futures weakened,
easing bond yields and helping the stock market rise.
   ``The funny thing is how the market is so tuned to inflation, it
turned on the commodity price index, which was turned on and off on
soybeans,'' said Lawrence Wachtel, a senior vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``This shows how graphically the stock market has become a
commodity business,'' Wachtel said. ``We're subject to the vagaries
of traders in the pits of Chicago.''
   Some traders said eased yields in the bond market was viewed as
a reason by some investors to buy selected well-known stocks that
had fallen over the previous two sessions, making them potential
bargains.
   But they said any more indications of higher inflation likely
would weaken stocks again. One possibly destabilizing figure was
the Labor Department's consumer price index for April, to be
released Friday morning.
   ``The market is fragile enough to react very negatively to
almost any figure,'' said Joseph Barthel, strategist for the
investment firm Butcher & Singer Inc. ``The market is seeing the
bogeyman when it comes to inflation.''
   Others said they saw little reason to be optimistic about the
market, which has been ignoring signs of economic health that defy
the dire predictions issued after the crash seven months ago.
   ``What we're seeing now are apathetic investors who are using
economic news to get out of stock market,'' said Peter DaPuzzo,
manager of retail equities at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``The
whole thing now is negative psychology.''
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4-to-3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
843 down, 640 up and 496 unchanged. NYSE volume totaled 165.16
million shares, down from 209.42 million shares in the previous
session.
   Among the most-active blue chip issues, Union Carbide fell 2| to
18\ after announcing plans to cut its dividend and issue more
stock, but other components of the Dow average compensated for
Union Carbide's drop. Woolworth rose 1[ to 51, IBM rose 1{ to 110],
American Express rose | to 23|, and General Electric rose 1 to 40].
   Amfac jumped 6} to 45[ after the company's management offered
$41 a share to buy it. Chrysler fell } to 21} after chairman Lee
Iacocca told shareholders at their annual meeting that the
automaker's second-quarter results probably wouldn't meet analyst
expectations.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 190.26 million shares.
   The Wilshire Associates 5,000 Equity Index, the market value of
5,000 NYSE, American and OTC issues, rose by $6.48 billion.
   The NYSE index rose 0.50 to 143.01.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.21 to 292.97,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 1.22 to 252.57.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 1 to
291.79. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
closed at 366.25, down 0.74.

<HEAD>Irving Asks Fed To Reconsider Bank of NY Approval</HEAD>

   Irving Bank Corp. said Thursday it asked the
Federal Reserve Board to reconsider the conditional approval of
Bank of New York Co.'s hostile takeover bid, in light of a proxy
vote that retained Irving's board of directors.
   Irving is backing a merger with the state-run Banca Commerciale
Italiana SpA, Italy's second largest bank.
   In a letter to the Fed, Irving said the Bank of New York should
be required to file a new application for approval due to changes
it proposed for the takeover bid.
   For one thing, Irving noted, the Bank of New York offered to
raise the stock portion of its bid to 1.675 Bank of New York shares
from 1.575 shares, adding $3.20 per share to the deal and pushing
its value to around $1.2 billion.
   The offer, which includes $15 in cash, would be amended only if
Irving agreed to a negotiated merger.
   In addition, Irving said, Bank of New York's subsequent threat
to buy the Irving shares tendered to it if negotiations failed and
operate the bank as a subsidiary were not in keeping with the
approval by regulators in February.
   Bank of New York said Tuesday it would buy the shares provided
at least two-thirds of Irving's 18.5 million outstanding stock were
tendered. But it also said it would run Irving separately to avoid
activating the company's ``poison pill'' takeover defense.
   Irving contends the Fed did not approve ``a proposal by BNY to
acquire a majority of IBC's shares in the absence of a feasible
plan for a prompt second-step merger of the two institutions.''
   In a response, the Fed asked the Bank of New York to reply to
the issues Irving raised.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said, ``We consider the
questions posed by the Fed to be exactly what we expected.''
   Banca Commerciale is offering $75 a share for 9.5 million Irving
shares, or about 51 percent of the stock outstanding, for a total
of about $707 million. The bid is part of a complex restructuring
plan that would include asset sales, cost-cutting measures and a
$10-a-share special cash dividend.

   The U.S. dollar opened slightly higher against the
Japanese yen in early trading Friday, while stock prices rebounded
following an overnight rally on Wall Street.
   The dollar opened at 124.85 yen, up from Thursday's close of
124.80 yen.
   ``The dollar has not moved very much since Tuesday's
announcement of the U.S. trade figures for March,'' said an
exchange dealer at a major commercial bank.
   According to figures released by the U.S. Department of
Commerce, the American trade deficit narrowed to $9.75 billion in
March from 13.83 billion dollars in February, the best monthly
performance in three years.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, down a sharp 394.34 points Thursday, rose 117.71
points to 27,490.95 in the first 15 minutes of trading.
   The decline on Thursday had been the key market index's biggest
single-day loss this year.

   A federal appeals judge on Thursday halted a
shareholder vote scheduled for Friday over control of Allegheny
International Inc., the second time in this week the vote has been
blocked.
   Judge Carol Los Mansmann of the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in
Philadelphia postponed the vote, scheduled to take place at
Allegheny's annual meeting, until the federal court could review
the case. A review was expected next week.
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Alan Bloch had overturned a
U.S. Bankruptcy Court's order issued Monday that blocked the
meeting.
   Bloch said the proxy vote could be stopped only if there was
fraud, violence or other illegalities.
   Two New York investment firms are leading a proxy fight by
dissident shareholders to gain control of the Pittsburgh consumer
products company. The group has nominated candidates for seven of
13 seats on the Allegheny International board of directors.
   Unsecured creditors claim that a change in management would
delay the company's emergence from bankruptcy proceedings, and have
asked the appeals court to cancel the proxy vote.
   Company management also opposes the dissidents, claiming they
have no experience in the company's business and no definite plan
for the future.

<HEAD>Brazil Announces New Industrial Liberalization Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Sarney on Thursday
announced a plan to remove restrictions on imports and exports, and
``open Brazil to international markets.''
   The plan ends a decades-old policy of import-substitution, under
which the government provided hefty fiscal incentives for companies
that produced industrial goods previously found only on
international markets.
   ``Our new industrial policy signals the democratization of
Brazilian industry,'' Sarney told journalists and government
ministers. ``The country's new-found freedom hadn't arrived in the
industrial or economic sectors, they hadn't felt the benefits of
our new-found democracy.''
   Sarney said the new measures would cut through thick Brazilian
bureaucracy and clarify the government's position in the future.
   The measures would:
   _Free up imports, with some exceptions. Imports have been
restricted to build the trade surplus and national industry, but
now any company can buy most goods on international markets as long
it pays hefty import dues.
   _Revoke all fiscal incentives for industry, except in the area
of technology. Companies working in this area can receive tax cuts
of up to 8 percent.
   _Ease export of industrial goods, with less paperwork and less
government control.
   _Create a five-minister commission to govern industrial policy.
   Details of how the policy was to be implemented were to be
worked out at a later date.
   ``The new policy will modernize Brazil and open the economy to
international markets,'' Sarney said.
   Initial business response to the new measures that reversed a
40-year policy of government-led growth was favorable.
   ``Industry now has clear rules and freedom to grow with less
government intervention,'' business leader Andre Beer told TV
Globo, the nation's largest private network.
   Brazil returned to civilian government in March 1985, after 21
years of military rule.

   The U.S. dollar was slightly stronger against the

<HEAD>Navistar Posts 49 Percent Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks
boosted Navistar International Corp.'s second quarter profit by 49
percent from a year earlier, the truck manufacturer said Wednesday.
   Navistar posted net income of $70 million, or 24 cents a share,
for the three months ended April 30. That compared with a profit of
$47 million, or 15 cents a share, for the same period a year
earlier.
   Sales increased 13 percent to $1.05 billion from $930 million in
the second quarter of 1987, the Chicago-based manufacturer stated.
   Navistar said workers at its Springfield, Ohio, assembly plant
have been working overtime due to strong demand.
   The company said it would increase its heavy truck production
schedules by about 9 percent and its medium-duty truck production
rates by 3 percent on Monday, and was exploring other options to
further expand production.
   Increased industrial production and inter-city freight tonnage
were important factors in Navistar's second-quarter performance,
James C. Cotting, chairman and chief executive, stated.
   But higher prices for aluminum and steel cut into the company's
profit margin, as did production phase-in costs at Navistar's new
foundry in Indianapolis and new paint plant in Springfield, Ohio,
Cotting said.
   Results included a $15 million gain from partial recovery of an
Australian investment that had previously been written off. In
addition, the results included a reduction in the carrying value of
the company's investment in Tenneco preferred stock to $105 million
from $120 million.
