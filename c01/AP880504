   Three French hostages held in Lebanon since 1985
were freed Wednesday and headed home, and one of them said his
liberation was ``a rebirth.''
   The plane carring journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann and diplomats
Marcel Fontaine and Marcel Carton stopped briefly in Salonica,
Greece, and in Corsica on its way to Paris. In Corsica, it was met
by Interior Minister Charles Pasqua and a medical team.
   ``It's the most beautiful day of my life. There are no other
words,'' Kauffmann told RTL radio, whose reporter Roger Auque _
himself a former hostage _ was permitted to board the plane in
Salonica.
   ``It's a rebirth, because for three years I won't say we lived,
we survived,'' he said.
   ``It's the end of a nightmare, a nightmare that lasted three
years and then some,'' Carton told RTL.
   ``At first we were together, then we were separated,'' he said.
``We saw other hostages, but we did not know exactly who they
were.''
   Wednesday's release leaves 18 foreigners, including nine
Americans, missing and believed held captive in Lebanon by Moslem
extremists.
   Renee Veyret, the second secretary at the French Embassy in
Beirut, told The Associated Press that Carton, 62, Fontaine, 45,
and Kauffmann, 44, were set free at 7:20 p.m. (1:20 p.m. EDT)
Wednesday near the Summerland Hotel in the seaside Jnah
neighborhood of the Lebanese capital.
   There were reports in Beirut this week that France had agreed to
pay Iran $670 million still owed to Iran on a billion-dollar loan
made by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The French government
froze payments after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.
   The kidnappers in Lebanon were believed to have loyalties to
Iran.
   Kauffmann and Fontaine both spoke of being blindfolded and
chained.
   ``No longer to have a blindfold ... chains,'' Kauffmann said.
``I wouldn't say we were in a tomb but, after all, it is a little
like that.''
   Kauffmann said the hostages had heard little news. He did not
know who was running in Sunday's second round of French
presidential elections.
   ``I knew my wife fought for me, not only for me, but for us,''
he said.
   Joelle Kauffmann made several trips to Beirut and made frequent
public appeals for the hostages' release.
   Fontaine said, ``To have had a blindfold over your eyes, and
chains on your hands and feet, that makes a change. It is the
difference between night and day.''
   In Strasbourg, France, conservative Premier Jacques Chirac, who
faces incumbent Socialist Francois Mitterrand the presidential
election this Sunday, announced the men's release Wednesday at a
campaign rally.
   ``I have been informed just now that the three French hostages
in Lebanon were freed and have been turned over to a representative
of the interior minister,'' he said.
   ``I am thinking of the horrible time they've been through, which
they didn't deserve. ... I am thinking of the one who, alas, was
the victim of these kidnappers and has not returned,'' Chirac said.
   He was referring to Michel Seurat, 39, who was kidnapped May 22,
1985. Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group, claimed it
killed him March 5, 1986. His body was not found, but his wife says
French officials confirmed his death.
   A total of 10 French hostages now have been released since
Chirac took office in 1986.
   Mitterrand, appearing later on national TV, expressed happiness
about the release but sorrow for ``the one who did not return,
Michel Seurat, and for his family, as well as for the foreign
hostages still held in Lebanon.''
   In Washington, the State Department said it was awaiting details
of the release.
   ``We would be concerned by any sign that concessions were
made,'' the State Department said. ``We believe concessions
encourage future kidnappings and could prolong the captivity of
other hostages.''
   The release followed weeks of reports that Chirac's government
was working feverishly, through contacts with the Iranian
government and elsewhere, to win the men's freedom.
   Hostage negotiations, shrouded in official secrecy, were the
subject of continuing press speculation. Last December, France
expelled 17 Iranian exile opponents of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
but denied this had any connection with hostage talks.
   French negotiator Jean-Charles Marchiani, personal
representative of French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, met the
freed captives at the headquarters of the Syrian army in Beirut,
embassy secretary Veyret said.
   Marchiani, a former intelligence officer, made several trips to
Beirut in recent weeks.
   He had negotiated the freedom of two other French captives,
Auque and Jean-Louis Normandin, last November.
   In Damascus, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said in a
statement: ``As in the past, Syria exerted efforts to ensure the
release of hostages.''
   Pasqua said the former hostages would be taken to a military
hospital in Paris.
   In Beirut, the Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation quoted a
reporter at the Summerland hotel as saying the three Frenchmen were
brought there in a black Mercedes that had no license plates.
   Carton, the embassy vice consul in Beirut, and Fontaine, an
embassy protocol officer, had been missing since March 22, 1985.
Islamic Jihad said its members kidnapped them.
   Kauffmann, a journalist working for the weekly magazine
L'Envenement du Jeudi, and Seurat, an academic researcher, were
kidnapped May 22, 1985.
   The longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon is Terry A.
Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The November release of Auque and Normandin reportedly involved
France agreeing to let Wahid Gordji, an employee at the Iranian
Embassy, leave France. Gordji was wanted for questioning in
connection with terrorist bombings.

   A partial list of the 95 people aboard Aloha
Airlines Flight 243, which was blown apart last Thursday during a
flight from Hilo to Honolulu, was released Tuesday by state
Attorney General Warren Price.
   Aloha had repeatedly refused to release the names of the 89
passengers on board the ill-fated flight, saying it wanted to
protect them from unsolicited legal advice and to protect their
privacy.
   The names of pilot Robert Schornstheimer, co-pilot Mimi Tompkins
and flight attendants Michelle Honda, Jane Sato-Tomita, and
Clarabelle Lansing, who was killed, were released last Thursday.
   Price said he released the list because of media requests. It
includes only the 63 people who were transported to or treated at
Maui Memorial Hospital after the plane, with 20 feet of its upper
fuselage ripped off, made a safe emergency landing at Kahului
Airport on Maui.

<HEAD>Lebanon Action Shows Willingness To Use Military Might</HEAD>

   The army's thrust into south Lebanon may signal
a new phase in a simmering guerrilla war, one in which Israel again
is ready to use its military might even if it means raising
tensions with Syria.
   The fact that helicopter-borne troops landed Tuesday in a
village only four miles from Syrian lines in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley
was likely to be viewed as a challenge by Damascus.
   Syria's initial reaction was to put its troops on alert. But
there was no corresponding war of words, and Israeli officials
stressed they sought to avoid a confrontation with Syria.
   ``Our intentions are limited. We are not out there to go to war
with Syria but simply to control the security of our northern
border settlements,'' said Col. Renaan Gissin, deputy army
spokesman.
   ``We made it very clear to the Syrians as well as the population
in the area that we intend to complete this search mission and
return our forces back,'' he said in an interview on Israel's army
radio.
   The disclaimers were reinforced by the makeup of the mechanized
brigade that entered Lebanon. Only a few tanks were involved, and
the use of artillery was extremely limited. ``It was not a combat
force,'' said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Friday, United Nations peacekeepers reported seeing six
Israeli F-4 Phantom jets fire 30 missiles in the direction of
Syrian lines in the Bekaa Valley. Beirut newspapers said a SAM-6
surface-to-air missile was launched, but there was no confirmation
from either side.
   The last war of nerves with Syria came in November 1985 after
Israeli warplanes patroling over Lebanon chased two Syrian jets
into Syrian airspace and shot them down.
   Some observers said tensions with Syria would divert attention
from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the army has been
fighting daily battles with rioters since Dec. 8.
   But Israeli officials rejected such suggestions and insisted the
primary motive was to keep Palestinian guerrillas from building up
new bases in Lebanon like the ones they had before Israel's 1982
invasion.
   ``This operation is aimed at searching for the terrorists, at
trying to locate groups and weaponry, and to deliver a message to
residents of the villages ... that we would not agree to an
increase of hostile activity,'' said Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, the
head of the northern command.
   The new strike into Lebanon was an unusually well-publicized
campaign accompanied by a stream of public statements. It seemed
designed more to send a warning about Israel's readiness to use the
military option than it was to fulfill the declared mission of
capturing guerrillas.
   The warning was directed at the Palestinian factions who carry
out the raids, at the Syrians who provide the protective umbrella
and at villagers who provide guides and shelter. There was also a
hint of more to come if the infiltrations continued.
   Israel's new thrust into Lebanon was the army's first major
ground offensive since February 1986, overcoming a reluctance to
get involved in Lebanon that lingered from an unpopular three-year
occupation ending in 1985.
   ``We will not wait to engage in defensive activity only...and we
want to initiate activity in the field which would make it harder
for terrorist groups to operate,'' said Peled.
   The new campaign in Lebanon, like last month's assassination of
PLO military chief Khalil Wazir, appeared designed to show off
Israel's military potency.
   Many believe such actions will help restore the army's image as
a force to be reckoned with, an image that has suffered as a result
of the West Bank riots and guerrilla infiltrations.
   ``The message is we will get the terrorists whereever they
are,'' said an army official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But to a nation suspicious of any longterm involvement in
Lebanon, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Israel radio ``I
think there is totally no danger of entanglement.''
   The army was prodded to go into Lebanon by a rebirth of
Palestinian guerrilla activity in south Lebanon, where the PLO had
amassed a large military presence before Israel's 1982 invasion.
   A dozen infiltration attempts since last November have claimed
11 Israeli lives and alarmed residents living along Israel's
northern border. They have in turn put pressure on the government
to take action.
   There has also been a marked increase in attacks on a 2,000-man
Israeli-allied Lebanese militia and the few hundred Israeli troops
permanently stationed in south Lebanon.
   In March, there were 105 anti-Israeli operations mounted by
Palestinians, Lebanese Communists and pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems,
said a security official in Lebanon who monitors the warfare.
   Two pro-Israeli militiamen were killed in the March fighting
along with eight guerrillas. Three Israelis and 16 fighters in the
Israeli-backed militia were wounded.
   The official said it was the highest monthly casualty count
since October 1985, when there were 130 operations in which six
pro-Israeli militiamen were killed and 8 others wounded.

   In its confrontation with Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, the United States seems to have been maneuvered
into an awkward position by the military strongman.
   The U.S. government had pledged to remove the commander of the
Defense Forces, the de facto ruler of this country, from office and
from Panama.
   Now the Reagan administration appears to be offering Noriega a
deal he had hinted at more than a month ago: that he leave power,
but not the country. He also wants his U.S. indictments on drug
trafficking charges invalidated.
   The apparent U.S. policy shift has managed to alienate
opposition leaders. They now privately use the word
``incompetence'' when referring to the way the United States has
handled the general.
   Noriega denied on Saturday that he had reached any agreement
with the United States. But Treasury Secretary James A. Baker said
on Sunday that talks with Noriega continued during the weekend and
that ``progress is being made.''
   Initially, the United States encouraged the opposition as it
demanded both Noriega's ouster and exile. Washington imposed
economic sanctions and froze Panamanian government assets in the
United States, causing a severe economic crisis in this country,
where the dollar is the legal currency.
   The United States recognized as Panama's legitimate president
Eric Arturo Delvalle, a man Noriega himself had picked as president
and whose only merit, opposition leaders say, was that he later
tried to fire the general.
   But Noriega, a military leader with the populist tactics of a
Latin American politician, vowed he would not leave under pressure.
He clung to power in spite of the crisis, whipping up Panamanian
nationalism and the sympathy that Latin American nations feel for
anyone who confronts the United States.
   ``The gringos overestimated the opposition and underestimated
Noriega,'' said Maj. Edgardo Lopez, a spokesman for the general.
   As late as April 16, State Department officials were telling
opposition members the U.S. position had not changed, and that
Noriega had to leave soon.
   ``If they (United States) are now offering a deal that would
enable Noriega to stay in Panama, then it is a serious mistake,''
said Ricardo Arias Calderon of the Christian Democratic Party.
   ``All Panamanians know that allowing Noriega to stay in Panama
is not a solution,'' said Guillermo Endara, spokesman for the
Authentic Panamanian Party, the largest opposition party.
   Concerned about a possible U.S.-Noriega deal that might bypass
them, the opposition parties met on Monday for the first time ``to
discuss the serious crisis we are suffering.''
   The opposition includes the National Civic Crusade, an umbrella
organization of private, professional and labor groups that since
June has mounted demonstrations against Noriega's rule.
   Opposition leaders feel the U.S. government created Noriega by
sustaining his 15,000-member Defense Forces and allowing him to
impose and depose presidents during the past five years.
   ``The change in attitude on the part of the United States to
support democratization in Panama now is not the result of
solidarity with our people,'' said Arias. ``It merely recognizes
that its interests in Panama are more compatible with the struggle
for democracy than with the support of a dictatorial regime.''
   Noriega has insisted that the American decision to topple him
was political because he refused to cooperate with U.S. attempts to
involve Panama in incidents to embarrass the leftist Sandinista
regime in Nicaragua. The Reagan administration supports the
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   Noriega said on Saturday that he would not leave unless the
``popular forces,'' meaning the Defense Forces and his political
base, ``negotiate their security.''
   ``He will leave on his terms now,'' said an opposition party
leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Aides said the general also wants the economic sanctions lifted.
   ``Noriega is more concerned about lifting the economic sanctions
than any discussion about his departure,'' Lopez said.
   ``He is not going to resign under U.S. pressure and he is not
going into exile,'' he said. ``We have learned to be wary of the
United States, a country that historically had been our friend.''

   Britain's top two confectioners, Cadbury Schweppes
PLC and Kit Kat-maker Rowntree PLC, have become tempting targets
for U.S. and Swiss bidders in what the British have dubbed the
candy bar wars.
   The bidding and stake-building reflect a trend among consumer
companies to go global by acquiring existing, strong brands, which
are almost prohibitively expensive to create from scratch, analysts
say.
   The moves also reflect Swiss companies' concerns about the
approach of 1992, when the Common Market is to become one
barrier-free market of 320 million consumers.
   Because Switzerland is not a member, Swiss companies are eager
to buy operations within the 12-nation European Community, said
Felicity Smith, an analyst with the London investment firm Hoare
Govett Ltd.
   The candy bar wars also underscore the key roles Cadbury and
Rowntree play in the industry and the importance of Britain as a
confectionery market.
   The two companies rank among the world's largest
chocolate-makers, as do the Swiss suitors for Rowntree, Nestle S.A.
and Jacobs Suchard S.A.
   The American company General Cinema Corp., which said it wants
to increase its stake in Cadbury, has interests in movie theaters
and soft drink bottling.
   In Britain _ the third-largest chocolate consuming country in
the world after Switzerland and Norway _ Cadbury has the largest
share of the $3.9 billion chocolate market, or 30 percent,
according to the London brokerage firm Henderson Crosthwaite Ltd.
   Rowntree comes in a second with 26 percent, and U.S.-based Mars
Inc. is third with 24 percent, the firm said.
   Cadbury's brands also include Canada Dry soft drinks.
   Many Britons are not happy that two of their venerable
institutions are being raided by foreigners.
   ``The fate of the (Rowntree) Yorkie bar has stirred the nation
into a fit of patriotism,'' the Daily Telegraph newspaper said.
``The Little English lobby has been in a lather...''
   Rowntree hasn't made a direct approach to the government about
possible intervention, but it is discussing the matter with ``one
or two people,'' a Rowntree spokesman said on Tuesday.
   In accordance with British practice, the spokesman wasn't
identified.
   In Cadbury's case, General Cinema, which is headquartered in
Chestnut Hill, Mass., said last week that it would increase its
17.7 percent stake in the British company, possibly through a
tender offer.
   London-based Cadbury, whose brands include Peter Paul's Mounds
and Almond Joy candy bars, said any involvement or interference
from General Cinema would be ``unwelcome, and strongly resisted.''
   It was more than a year ago that General Cinema first became a
major shareholder in Cadbury, whose shares fell 15 cents to finish
at $6.51 on London's Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Rowntree, which is based in York, England, last week
became the reluctant target of a hostile, $3.9 billion bid from
Nestle, the world's largest food company with interests in
chocolate and coffee.
   Nestle, which has acquired almost 7 percent of Rowntree, offered
$16.64 a share for the company, which rejected the bid.
   The offer from Nestle _ whose brands include Nestle's Crunch _
is said to be the largest by a non-British bidder for a British
company. Nestle, based in Vevey, Switzerland, also recently reached
an agreement to acquire the Buitoni SpA foods group, including its
Perugina chocolates business, from Italian businessman Carlo de
Benedetti.
   Separately, competing suitor Jacobs Suchard, another Swiss
company with chocolate and coffee interests, has amassed a 21
percent stake in Rowntree, which didn't welcome that move, either.
   Zurich-based Jacobs Suchard, which makes the triangular
Toblerone chocolate bars, initially paid $11.78 a share for its
Rowntree shares.
   Rowntree's shares finished at $17.30, up nine cents, on Tuesday.
   Nestle currently has a 3 percent share and Suchard, 2 percent,
of the British chocolate market.
   ``What it is all about is globalization of consumer products
markets,'' said David Lang, a food analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.
   ``You have the multinational companies at the moment trying to
accumulate tremendous brand strength in a narrow product line, but
internationally.''
   Lang added: ``The scramble for shelf space is some of it and the
big brands are the only ones that can get it.''
   ``Satellite advertising and international travel are creating a
greater homogenization,'' Lang said. ``The supermarket shelves of
the world are starting to look like one another.''
   Rowntree, which traces its origins back to a Quaker grocer's
shop in York, northeast England, in the 18th century, had pre-tax
profit of $210 million on sales of $2.67 billion in 1987.
   Cadbury, which began as a seller of tea and coffee in Birmingham
in 1824, had pre-tax profit of $329 million on revenue of $3.8
billion last year.

   Convincing parents that top prep schools are
``worth'' tuitions exceeding $10,000 isn't always easy. But even
harder are the challenges of ensuring classrooms are filled in
future years with ethnically diverse students and faculty.

   Perhaps the least of the
challenges facing the private school that proclaims itself ``the
pearl of the Midwest'' is explaining to parents why it's worth
$12,000 annual tuition.
   The 300-acre campus of Cranbrook Kingswood School outside
Detroit has the requisite prep-school luxuries: a hockey arena,
bowling alleys, indoor and outdoor tennis courts where players'
strokes are videotaped, and an old-time swimming hole called Lake
Jonah, so named because it's shaped like a whale.
   For its 800 students, each day is an aesthetic feast _ from the
tapestries and art deco light fixtures down to the very doorknobs
and lunchroom chairs. These, and practically everything else, were
designed or influenced by famed Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen,
who lived and taught here from 1925 to his death in 1950.
   But just as the virtues of top private schools like this aren't
just skin-deep, neither are the problems.
   With the school-age population declining and prep school
tuitions sometimes rivaling Ivy League colleges, officials worry
about future enrollments and are casting their recruiting nets from
coast to coast.
   The nation's approximately 1,700 independent private schools,
those not receiving tax or church funds, enroll some 600,000
students, up 9.7 percent over the last decade.
   But the number of students taking private school admissions
tests dropped by 14 percent in the last two years, according to the
National Association of Independent Schools.
   A few years ago, Cranbrook Kingswood could almost fill its
classes with students just from Michigan and surrounding Midwestern
states. Now the school recruits from as far away as southern
Florida and California.
   ``If we didn't do that kind of thing we wouldn't be in good
shape in five years because of the demographics. The best schools
are out there all the time,'' said admissions director Bruce
Kridler, whose travel budget has risen from $500 to $15,000 in
recent years, and who now makes routine visits to 35 cities in 17
states.
   Like other prep schools, Cranbrook Kingswood has constantly
fought a perception of elitism. The formerly all-white,
predominantly Episcopalian school is now 25 percent Jewish and 25
percent ``persons of color'' including Indians, Asian-Americans and
blacks, a change due largely to aggressive minority student
recruiting and a $15.8 million endowment that helps make sizable
scholarships possible.
   Cranbrook Kingswood is the most expensive boarding school in
Michigan, and among the most expensive in the Midwest. But it is a
bargain compared with the priciest Eastern schools.
   Leland Academy, in Franklin, Mass., is the nation's most
expensive private college preparatory school, charging $18,500 for
a year's tuition, fees, room and board. Cranbrook Kingswood, at
$12,000, ranks 44th in the nation.
   Another stubborn problem is finding minority teachers. Of 90
upper-school faculty members, four are black, one is Hispanic, one
is Asian-American.
   But such challenges seem remote at 8 a.m. as English teacher
Peter Fayroian poured the coffee in his carpeted classroom for a
dozen students, about half the size of most public school classes.
   He kicked off a discussion on the religious and moral
implications of Herman Hesse's classic ``Siddhartha'': ``Should we
prepare to come to the presence of the holy on a motorcycle?'' he
asked. ``What should be the relationship between technology and the
holy?''
   In Russ Conner's biology lab, nine juniors toil on a typically
complex question: At what wavelengths does chlorophyll in plants
absorb the most light?
   ``They use a college text,'' Conner said. ``And I don't give
them a whole lot of answers.''
   ``Academically I've never seen anything like it,'' said Jerry
Rubino from nearby Sterling Heights, Mich., whose daughter Lisa is
an 11th-grade day student. ``Public school kids might come home at
2:30 or 3 in the afternoon, but my daughter typically isn't home
until 6 or 7 at night, and then she buries herself in the books.''
   It's a school rule that the 270 boarding students must be in
their rooms studying every evening Sunday through Thursday.
   Upon graduation, each student's name is hand-carved into the oak
walls of Alumni Court. Those names include such luminaries as
Wyoming Senator Alan K. Simpson; Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the
Pentagon Papers; poet Brad Leithauser, and New Republic editor
Michael Kinsley.
   Nonetheless, schools that tout themselves as training grounds
for future leaders in an increasingly diverse world simply can't
ignore the issues of race and ethnicity any longer, said school
president and acting director Lillian Bauder.
   Yet private schools remain overwhelmingly white, according to
the NAIS's own statistics. In 1986-87, independent school
enrollments were 4.7 percent black, 1.8 percent Hispanic, 4.7
percent Asian-American and 0.1 percent Native American.
   ``I recruit in Cabrini Green,'' said Kridler, referring to an
all-black Chicago housing project, ``and I go to Mexican-American
neighborhoods.
   ``Inner city kids think we're not affordable. I talk a lot about
financial aid opportunities,'' Kridler said.
   About 24 percent of students in the upper school, grades 9-12,
get financial aid, covering two-thirds of need on average. Still,
22 students accepted last year did not enroll for money reasons.
   Low teacher salaries remain a source of frustration, especially
for younger faculty, even though median salaries have risen $7,000
in five years. Nationally, beginning private school teachers make
$12,000-19,000 and average salaries for all such teachers was
$23,000, about $5,000 less than public school teachers.
   Fayroian, a 25-year-old first-year teacher, earns $16,300. He
says he is up at 4 a.m. and in bed at midnight, spending his day
and evening grading papers, teaching classes and meeting with
students. The salary ``can be disheartening for the amount of work
we do,'' he said.
   Top scale at Cranbrook Kingswood is $34,000, and the median is
$25,600. There's no teacher union and no tenure.
   On the other hand, private school teachers generally have more
freedom to choose textbooks and shape their lessons free of
bureaucratic interference.
   At Cranbrook Kingswood, the resulting curriculum is so rigorous
many students find college easy by comparison. The school recently
studied its recent graduates and found their freshman grades often
improved compared with their grades at Cranbrook Kingswood.
Students who averaged 2.0 to 2.5 at the prep school averaged 2.86
as college freshmen, for example.
   What makes the grind worth it is the extraordinarily high
probability of admission to one of the better U.S. colleges.
   Of 190 graduates in 1987, 187 went to college, 14 as national
merit finalists. Their Scholastic Aptitude Test scores averaged
1100 of a possible 1600, compared with a national average of 906.
   Mark Botvinick, a 17-year-old senior from Bloomfield Hills,
whose public schools lead the state, nonetheless chose to come here
and was recently granted early acceptance at his dream school, Duke
University.
   Denise Brainard, a 12th grader from Crosslands, W.Va., says
there's no comparison between what she gets here and what she would
have gotten at her hometown school.
   ``Private schools are very stereotyped,'' she said. ``People
think they're very snobby. But we're not; we come here for the
education. I don't know what my chances would have been at Nitro
High School in Crosslands, W.Va.''

   Fidel Garcia has guided hundreds of
illegal aliens to new jobs and new lives, escorting them through
the hills and canyons dividing the United States and Mexico.
   But fear has kept the 29-year-old alien smuggler from seeking a
new way of life for himself as time runs out on the yearlong
amnesty program.
   ``I don't want to lose my money, my family, my house,'' Garcia
told a U.S. Border Patrol agent who accompanied two journalists
Sunday. ``I want to know if I can make it (pass legalization
requirements) or not.''
   Garcia said he has documentation from three employers and has
spent 15 years in the United States. But, he said, he feared his
dozens of arrests for alien smuggling would make him ineligible for
amnesty and lead to his deportation.
   His wife and three children live in Los Angeles, he said.
   At sunset Sunday, hundreds of illegal aliens, mainly Mexicans,
gathered on the so-called Soccer Field on Otay Mesa just north of
the international border in Tijuana, Mexico. The site is about 12
miles south of downtown San Diego.
   Most were waiting for darkness before venturing north. Vendors
hawked used clothing, coffee, beer, tostadas.
   Many people knew little about the immigration law. Several who
believed they qualified for amnesty hadn't realized the time to
apply runs out midnight Wednesday.
   Many aliens were uncertain whether they would find work in the
United States, but they were convinced the odds were more favorable
there than in Mexico or South or Central America.
   Some people took advantage of bilingual Agent Stuart Kutz's
unusual presence among them to press for information about the
immigration law.
   Kutz, a 12-year veteran of the border force, was amused by the
attention. ``One asked me what time was the best to cross. I said,
`No hour, because I'm going to be there looking for you.' They all
got a good laugh.''
   ``If there is only three more days then you should give us a
chance to cross tonight,'' Jamie Garcia Hernandez, 23, a native of
the Mexican state of Michoacan, suggested to Kutz. ``If we no find
work, we'll come back (to Mexico) and leave you without work.''
   To qualify for amnesty under the 1986 Immigration Reform and
Control Act, illegal aliens must prove they have been living
continuously in the United States since Jan. 1, 1982.
   Under the law, employers face sanctions if they hire illegals
without documentation.
   So far, the new law doesn't appear to have lessened the Border
Patrol's workload. Arrest figures, accepted as a measure of border
traffic, dropped 30 percent last year but have steadily increased
this year.
   In April, agents in the agency's San Diego sector arrested
41,815 illegal aliens, 20 percent more than were apprehended the
same month last year. In April 1986, 71,910 undocumented migrants
were arrested.

   Long before ``What's your sign?'' replaced ``Come here often?''
as a lounge lizard's opening line, people sought their fortune in
the stars, planets and signs of the zodiac.
   Astrology assumes that the planets and stars, in some way,
predict or rule the lives of humans.
   Soothsayers searched the skies for omens in Babylon of the 18th
century B.C., but what is now known as astrology developed during
the Hellenistic period from the 3rd century B.C. to the 3rd century
A.D., according to the Encyclopedia Britannica.
   The World Book Encyclopedia says that astrological forecasts, or
horoscopes, are based on four elements: the Earth, the planets, the
zodiac _ the 12 signs that divide up the heavens and comprise an
astrological year _ and 12 ``houses,'' or elements of personality
associated with 12 imaginary divisions of the Earth's surface.
   Astrology assumes the Earth is the center of the solar system.
   ``Newtonian physics eradicated a belief in astrology among the
educated. The practice of the now pseudoscience continued among
nonintellectuals in the West, gradually losing contact with its
rich tradition and becoming more and more fraudulent,'' the
encyclopedia says.
   But popular interest in astrology grew after newspapers began
printing horoscopes in the 1930s.
   Nazi leader Adolf Hitler is known to have consulted astrologers,
as did his deputy, Rudolf Hess, who was captured on a bizarre peace
mission to England in 1941. Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick, head of the
British Foreign Office in 1941, said that Hess was ``a simple,
stupid'' person whose astrologer had told him he would bring peace.

   Jesse Jackson scored a runaway victory over
Michael Dukakis in the District of Columbia primary Tuesday,
duplicating his 1984 primary win. It was Jackson's first primary
election victory since he won Puerto Rico in March.
   With about 70 percent of the vote counted, Jackson had 41,694 or
80.2 percent, while Michael Dukakis had 9,215 or 17 percent.
Jackson captured 13 of the district's 16 Democratic convention
delegates with Dukakis winning 3.
   The results maintained Jackson's strong nationwide showing among
black voters; about two-thirds of the district population is black.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush had 3,111 or
88.5 percent; Sen. Bob Dole, 279 or 6.5 percent and Pat Robertson
170 or 3.9 percent.
   Elections director Emmett Fremaux said a light turnout resulted
from a lack of campaigning and the fact that Dukakis and Bush have
all but wrapped up the presidential nominations for their parties.
   In other balloting, Del. Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., running
unopposed in his party's primary. Seeking his 10th term to
Congress, Fauntroy will face Republican William Reed in November.
Reed also ran unopposed.
   Jackson spent the day in the district, doing radio interviews
and speaking at a local high school.
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr., an active Jackson backer, voted early
and said it would be tough for Jackson to win the Democratic
nomination, but that Jackson would stay in the race all the way to
the Atlanta convention.
   Jackson delivered an anti-drug message to students at Roosevelt
High School and in a WOL radio interview he supported patrols by
Nation of Islam members designed to curb drug traffic at two
apartment complexes.
   In 1984, Jackson won all but three of the delegates on the
primary ballot. The only other primary he won was Louisiana. This
year Jackson has won primary elections in Georgia, Alabama,
Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Puerto Rico. He won caucuses
in Alaska, Delaware, Michigan and South Carolina.

   A ranking Republican on the House labor
committee says the Democratic leadership has tried to quash a
non-partisan report indicating that an increase in the minimum wage
to $5.05 could cost up to 500,000 jobs.
   Rep. Thomas E. Petri, R-Wis., ranking GOP member on the House
labor standards subcommittee that handled the minimum wage
legislation, said Tuesday that the Democratic leadership is not
interested in objective analysis.
   ``They're just interested in ramming their bill through with
brute force _ no matter who gets hurt,'' Petri said in a floor
statement.
   The Congressional Budget Office studied the Democratic-sponsored
legislation, which would raise the minimum wage from $3.35 an hour
to $5.05 an hour over the next four years.
   Petri said that although the CBO found the legislation could
wipe out 500,000 jobs and boost inflation, ``the folks who run the
Labor Committee didn't want that kind of information, and ordered
it removed from the CBO report before the minority could see it.''
   Stanley L. Greigg, a CBO spokesman, said it followed its normal
procedure of sending a copy of the report to both Rep. Augustus F.
Hawkins, D-Calif., labor committee chairman, and Rep. James M.
Jeffords, R-Vt., ranking GOP member.
   ``We followed the same procedure we always do,'' said Greigg.
``A copy went to both of them simultaneously. We were baffled by
the suggestion (of Jeffords) that he made three requests for a copy
of the report.''
   The House is expected to take up the minimum wage bill sometime
this month.
   The CBO, the research arm of Congress, has disputed news reports
that the agency has become politicized in issuing a report on the
cost estimates of the legislation.
   In a letter to the House Education and Labor Committee, CBO
acting chairman James L. Blum said the budget office was ``fully
responsive to the requests made of us by the committee staff and
that nothing has transpired to change the non-partisan,
professional conduct of our office.''
   At the specific request of the staff, Blum said, the CBO
provided the committee with an assessment of the possible impact of
the measure on the economy.
   ``Our cost estimates normally provide information only on the
possible budget impacts for federal, state and local governments,''
Blum said.
   Susan McGuire, committee staff director, sent a letter last
Thursday to all panel members in which she said the staff requested
CBO to provide a second submission ``because the first CBO cost
estimate included an analysis not required by the Budget Act or
House Rules for inclusion in the committee's report.''
   ``This analysis has been available to any member requesting it,
and the staff's action in requesting CBO to conform ... in no way
constituted suppression of the analysis or improper pressure on the
Congressional Budget Office.''

   African guerrilla leader Sam Nujoma is asking
presidential hopefuls Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson to pressure
South Africa into relinquishing control over South-West Africa, the
territory known as Namibia.
   Nujoma, who heads the South-West Africa People's Organization,
said he had met with campaign managers who promised him a meeting
with the two Democratic candidates within the coming week. GOP
contender George Bush has not responded to a similar request for a
meeting, Nujoma said in an interview Tuesday.
   Nujoma, 58, said that despite claims to the contrary, South
Africa is trying to strengthen its hold over the mineral-rich
territory which it rules in defiance of a 1978 U.N. resolution
calling for Namibian independence.
   Nujoma, who lives in exile in Angola, accused South African
troops of arson and bombing attacks against Namibia's 1.5 million
residents, including the burning of 14 church-run schools last
month.
   South Africa has denied the charges, accusing SWAPO of the
attacks.
   South African President P.W. Botha paid a rare visit to the
territory on April 8, and proposed increased powers for his chief
representative there. The proposal would weaken the
``transitional'' government established by South Africa in 1985
with a view to eventual independence for Namibia.
   ``South Africa has no intention whatsoever to leave Namibia,''
said Nujoma. The South Africans will have to be ``forced out by the
combined resistance of the Namibian people and international
pressure.''
   He called on the next U.S. administration to pursue steps
similar to the trade sanctions legislated by Congress in 1986
against South Africa.
   Nujoma said he had requested a meeting with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz but had not received any response. A State
Department official confirmed Nujoma had asked for a meeting, and
said Shultz had yet to reply.
   Shultz has been criticized by conservative members of Congress,
such as Rep. Patrick Swindall, R-Ga., for allowing Nujoma into the
country in view of his organization's guerrilla activities and
support from the Soviet Union. In a letter to Shultz, Swindall
called Nujoma a ``terrorist and Soviet puppet.''
   The United States supports a South African pullout and an
independent Namibia, but its contacts with SWAPO have been limited.
   U.S. representatives are taking part in two days of talks in
London with representatives from Angola, Cuba and South Africa on a
plan for the pullout of South African forces from Namibia and Cuban
troops from Angola.
   Cuba has an estimated 37,000 soldiers in Angola. Estimates for
the South African military presence in Namibia range from 40,000 to
100,000.
   Nujoma said he was sure Angola would protect his group's
interests at the talks and press its demands for Namibian
independence. ``It will be a package, I am assured of this by the
Angolan government,'' he said.
   If an agreement is worked out, SWAPO will stop its attacks
against South African troops, he said. SWAPO says it killed more
than 90 South Africans this year, but its claims cannot be verified.
   Nujoma conceded that SWAPO gets most of its arms and training
from the Soviet Union, Cuba, Yugoslavia, Angola and several other
members of the Organization of African Unity.
   But he added that if the United States wants to supply SWAPO
with weapons, ``we will certainly accept it with great pleasure.''
   Nujoma is on a three-week visit to the United States to attend
several U.N.-sponsored seminars on Namibia and to highlight his
organization's demands.

   The 1988 campaign for the White House slows
dramatically in coming weeks, with only a handful of primaries
through the rest of May as the candidates gather strength for a
final push into California.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis is coasting a bit after winning Indiana
and Ohio on Tuesday, making his record 7-1 in recent primaries.
Jesse Jackson won Tuesday's primary in the District of Columbia.
   The front-runner will campaign in West Virginia and Nebraska _
the site of next week's contests _ for a day later this week before
taking some time off in Boston.
   Not only has Dukakis surged nearly 600 delegates ahead Jackson,
his only remaining rival, but the Massachusetts governor is also
favored to win the lion's share of the remaining eight primaries,
including the biggest prize of all _ California, with 314
Democratic delegates at stake.
   That single state, with more delegates than the other remaining
states combined, will host most of the campaigning for Jackson and
Dukakis in the next five weeks. Each candidate plans at least 10
days there.
   Republican nominee-to-be George Bush will be campaigning across
the country in the coming weeks, even though he already has enough
delegates to win the nomination at the GOP National Convention in
New Orleans in August. He will spend considerable time in
California, and not to campaign against Pat Robertson, who
technically remains in the race.
   Bush, like Dukakis, is looking to the general election campaign
when California will once again be the biggest electoral prize of
all on Nov. 8.
   The next stops on the 1988 presidential trail for both parties
come next Tuesday in Nebraska and West Virginia. The campaigns have
spent little time in the states, since only 62 Democratic delegates
are at stake and 37 GOP ones on May 10.
   Dukakis leads the polls in both. In West Virginia, the Dukakis
edge over Jackson was 43-14 in a recent poll of likely Democratic
voters. In Nebraska, a poll taken last week put Dukakis at 54
percent and Jackson at 15 percent among registered voters.
   Then on May 17, Oregon weighs in with the first West Coast
primary. Once again Dukakis is ahead in the polls, taking a 36-24
margin over Jackson in one recent survey. Forty-five Democratic
delegates will be awarded that day, as will 32 Republican slots.
   The next week brings Idaho, which holds a Democratic beauty
contest primary with no delegates at stake. The delegates were
allocated in a caucus system that began March 8. On the Republican
side, 18 delegates are available.
   After a two-week pause comes the primary season finale for the
Democrats.
   With California leading the way, 466 Democratic and 265
Republican delegates will be awarded that day in balloting that
also includes New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana.
   Next to Super Tuesday on March 8 _ when most of the Southern and
border states held primaries _ June 7 is the biggest delegate day
of the 1988 primary season.
   In California, Dukakis is the leader again in the polls. The
latest California Poll gave Dukakis a 44-33 edge over Jackson with
14 percent undecided.
   The final GOP primary day of 1988 is June 14, when North Dakota
votes. There was to be a beauty contest on the Democratic side, but
no one filed to win a place on the ballot. Sixteen delegates are at
stake on the Republican side, but no major candidate filed to
oppose Bush in North Dakota.
   In addition to the primaries, at least eight other states and
territories will be allocating Republican delegates in the next
five weeks. On Friday, Hawaii will hold its state convention to
choose 20 delegates and Wyoming will do the same on Saturday for
six delegates.
   On May 14, Arizona, Delaware and Virginia hold either state
conventions or congressional district meetings to pick Republican
delegates.
   On May 21, Vermont and the Virgin Islands make their GOP
choices. And Colorado's June 4 state convention will pick 36
Republican delegates.

   Three-term Republican Sen. William V.
Roth Jr. declared Tuesday he will seek re-election, creating an
uphill battle for the winner of September's Democratic primary
between Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo and civic activist Samuel Beard.
   Roth said he already has raised about $800,000 toward the $1.2
million he estimates he'll need for the campaign, which kicked off
in Georgetown, with similar announcements later in Dover and
Wilmington.
   Roth, 66, said his campaign will focus on issues important to
Delaware families, including the economy, job, affordable child
care, a secure national defense and making sure Social Security is
available for future generations.
   ``It's important that we continue to prepare for tomorrow. And
tomorrow depends on our young people,'' Roth said.
   Roth said he has supported the war on drug abuse and stiffer
penalties for drug dealers, in addition to fighting against child
pornography.
   Roth probably became best-known nationally as co-author, with
Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., of the Kemp-Roth multiyear tax-reduction
legislation. The measure was eventually endorsed by President
Reagan and enacted in large part by Congress as a prime feature of
Reagan's first-term economic program.
   Roth was a two-term congressman when in 1970, he replaced
retiring incumbent Republican Sen. John J. Williams. Roth was
re-elected in 1976 and 1982.
   Roth's wife, Jane, a Harvard law graduate, was appointed a
federal court judge in Wilmington in 1985 by Reagan. The Roths have
two children, William V. Roth III and Katharine K. Roth.

   Veterinarians urged cat owners in
Berkshire County to keep their pets indoors after 25 cats became
sickened, apparently by a deadly illness that may be linked to a
wild bird disease.
   The Berkshire Veterinary Hospital in this western Massachusetts
city has been treating cats for the past three weeks for an
infection that evidently hit some animals after they ate wild
songbirds, Barry Kellogg of the hospital said Tuesday. At least
three cats have died, he said.
   Kellogg said humans were not in danger of contracting the
disease and that it did not appear to be communicated from cat to
cat.
   Outbreaks of the disease have been reported in western New York,
Vermont and parts of New Hampshire, said Dr. Fred Scott, director
of the Feline Health Center at the New York State College of
Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, N.Y.
   He said the illness appeared to be related to a malady killing
wild songbirds in the same areas.

   They said Masue Zaitsu, 71, Satsuko Kumagai, 57, and Kaoru
Yoshizumi, 79, all drowned during the rainstorm Tuesday night.
   Washed away by a flash flood and still missing were Yuji Ueda,
9; his brother Hiroshi, 3, and Haru Goto, 65, police reported.
   They said flooding from the overflowing Ofuna River also
disrupted transportation in Kumamoto.

<HEAD>Environmentalists in House Fight To Stop Refuge Drilling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are looking to the House
Interior Committee in their efforts to reverse a congressional tide
that is running toward oil development in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge.
   The focus of the biggest energy-vs.-environment battle of the
100th Congress shifted to that panel Tuesday after the House
Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee approved a bill to open the
Alaska preserve to oil rigs.
   Tim Mahoney of the Alaska Coalition of drilling foes said he is
optimistic about stopping the bill in the Interior Committee,
chaired by Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., who opposes developing the
nation's largest refuge.
   ``It's been a friendlier committee to us traditionally,''
Mahoney said. ``The committee is always split 50-50 on tough
developmental issues. ...Our strategy is pretty simple. We believe
in the just-say-no strategy.''
   Mahoney and other anti-drilling lobbyists are trying to slow
down the bill, which is similar to a measure approved narrowly
earlier this year by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee.
   He said he thinks the chance of a drilling bill getting through
Congress this year are ``very low. There are a lot of people who
prefer not to vote on controversial issues in an election year.''
   Drilling opponents hope to stall final action until 1989 on the
theory that a new administration will be less eager than the Reagan
administration to develop the 1.5 million acre coastal plain of the
19-million-acre refuge.
   Randy Snodgrass of the Wilderness Society said that Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis has pledged to make the coastal plain
a no-development wilderness area.
   Drilling advocates, including Interior Secretary Donald Hodel,
say the refuge's potentially rich oil deposits must be tapped as
soon as possible in order to reduce the nation's growing dependence
on imported petroleum.
   The Merchant Marine Committee approved its drilling bill 28-13
after rejecting bipartisan pleas by some members that Congress
postpone a decision on the issue until a new president can study
the matter and formulate a new national energy policy.
   ``This is the first positive energy step we've made since
1973,'' said Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, a principal proponent of
tapping what the Reagan administration and the oil industry say may
be a major supply of petroleum.
   Young was referring to Congress' approval of the pipeline that
carries Alaskan oil from Prudhoe Bay, the huge field about 70 miles
west of the refuge boundary and the source of about 20 percent of
U.S. oil production.
   An opponent, Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., said the drilling
legislation backed by Young and crafted by chairman Walter Jones,
D-N.C., was ``ill-conceived and ill-timed.''
   ``The resources of the Arctic will wait, and we can await the
arrival of a new president and a new energy secretary,'' said
Studds, predicting a bitter battle if drilling legislation reaches
the House floor.
   ``We will have a donneybrook of such dimensions that it will be
recalled for some time,'' Studds predicted.
   The Jones bill would allow drilling to begin within 21 months of
enactment. It would bar rigs from a caribou calving area and
earmark federal revenue from refuge oil for national wildlife and
conservation programs.
   The closest drilling opponents got to victory was a 23-18 vote
against a plan to allow pre-leasing activities, which would take
two or more years, to be carried out while the National Academy of
Sciences studied the nation's future energy needs and how they
could be filled by conservation and renewable sources of energy.
   The foes also tried to add language to force the administration
to reverse its decision to lower the auto fleet economy standard
from 27.5 mpg to 26 mpg. Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., said that over
the long term oil saved this way could equal what the refuge may
contain.

   Tears streamed down Nazi hunter Simon
Wiesenthal's face as he toured a concentration camp mock-up built
for a movie about his years in death camps during World War II.
   Filming of ``Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story,''
which stars Academy Award-winner Ben Kingsley in the title role,
began at the set outside Budapest this week. The movie is based on
a book of Wiesenthal's recollections.
   Wiesenthal, 79, told reporters Tuesday he long resisted the idea
of making a film about his life in the camps and as a tracker of
Nazi war criminals after the war.
   ``I read every version of the script to make it accurate,'' he
said. ``In four hours you cannot bring everything that happened.
But they are doing a fine job.''
   The film is being shot entirely in Hungary and is expected to
take nine weeks to complete. The set includes barracks and a
crematorium built into a limestone quarry ringed by barbed wire,
guard towers and stone wall.

   Suspense author Mary Higgins Clark says her new
multimillion-dollar contract with Simon & Schuster-Pocket Books
shows mystery writers have a ``lot of readers out there.''
   The contract announced Tuesday guarantees her $10.1 million for
four novels and a book of short stories, said her literary agent,
Eugene Winick.
   By the time the fourth novel is published, the sum of $10.1
million will reach $11.6 million, depending on the earnings of the
previously published books, Winick said.
   ``For the whole mystery field it is an acknowledgement that we
do have a lot of readers out there,'' said Ms. Clark, 60, who was
the 1987 president of the Mystery Writers of America.
   The first book, to be published next spring, will be ``While My
Pretty One Sleeps,'' a novel of suspense set in New York City,
according to a Simon & Schuster statement.
   Ms. Clark's most recent book, ``Weep No More My Lady,'' was on
The New York Times best seller list for 17 weeks, the publisher
said.

   Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher, who broke the color
barrier at the University of Oklahoma School of Law in 1948, was
honored as a civil rights pioneer who led a ``peaceful
desegregation'' of higher education.
   The Legislative Black Caucus presented Mrs. Fisher with a plaque
during a House session Tuesday to mark the 40th anniversary of the
U.S. Supreme Court's May 3, order making her the first black to
attend the school.
   University of Oklahoma President Frank E. Horton said Mrs.
Fisher's 3{-year fight to enter the school was a ``notable example
of courage and determination'' and ``a giant step toward the
peaceful desegregation of higher education in the state of
Oklahoma.''
   ``I am a native of Oklahoma, and I have been a part of the
history of Oklahoma for 40 years,'' the 64-year-old Mrs. Fisher
told House members. ``I'm proud of Oklahoma. I hope Oklahoma can be
proud of me.''

   Boston Celtics Coach K.C. Jones says
he's decided to retire at the end of the season because he's not
ambitious and wanted to spend more time with his family.
   Jones, who led the Celtics to two National Basketball
Association championships during his previous four seasons as
coach, made the surprise announcement Tuesday, a day before Boston
plays the New York Knicks in the third game of their best-of-five,
first-round playoff series.
   Boston leads 2-0 and can wrap it up with a victory tonight.
   ``It's something I wanted to do. I'd been giving it
consideration since last summer,'' the 56-year-old Jones said of
his retirement.
   Jones said he will be succeeded by assistant coach Jimmy Rodgers.
   The decision had to do with ``not being ambitious and wanting to
... win another nine titles,'' Jones said, adding that wants to
spend more time with his family and play a little more golf and
tennis.
   ``It's good for me, it's good for the family, it's good for
Jimmy,'' said Jones, who said he will become a Celtics vice
president and director of player personnel.

   The mother of Len Bias, the basketball
star who died of a cocaine overdose, told high school students it
takes courage for young people to take a stand against drugs, but
it's worth it.
   In moving appearances at three area high schools Monday, Lonise
Bias told students they must learn not to cave in to peer pressure
when it comes to drugs.
   ``Anyone can go along with the crowd. Who could stand to go
alone?'' she said. ``It takes courage and character. ... You must
stand up for what's right.''
   Ms. Bias told students they needed to put their problems in
proper perspective, and called suicide ``a permanent solution to a
temporary problem.''
   Her son, a University of Maryland basketball star, died in 1986
shortly after being named the Boston Celtics' first-round draft
pick.

<HEAD>Fuel Distribution May Have Been Behind Engine Failures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inspection has found no mechanical problems
with the United Airlines jumbo jet that landed in Japan on one
engine after three of its engines lost power during a flight over
the Pacific, the airline says.
   United spokesmen refused to speculate on what caused the
incident, although they say the Boeing 747 has been found to be
airworthy and was being flown today without passengers from Japan
to San Francisco.
   That appeared to lend credence to a theory that the engine
problems may have stemmed from a pilot error in shifting fuel among
the jet's four fuel tanks.
   Industry and government sources, asking not to be identified by
name, said Tuesday that the plane landed with three of its fuel
tanks empty and not feeding three of the huge jet's engines,
causing them to stop operating.
   During a flight, fuel routinely is transferred among the four
tanks to maintain the aircraft's balance. According to these
sources, more than 20,000 pounds of fuel was left in a fourth tank
feeding the engine that continued to operate.
   The jetliner with 258 passengers and crewmembers aboard landed
safely at the Narita airport in Japan with only the one engine
providing power. The pilot had reported losing the first engine at
39,000 feet about 1 hour and 15 minutes from the airport, a second
engine 30 minutes later and a third engine just before landing.
   ``The airplane has been thoroughly inspected,'' said United
spokesman Robert Doughty in Chicago. ``We have not found a
mechanical problem. ... The airplane is airworthy enough to ferry
it back to San Franicsco.''
   Doughty refused to speculate what caused the engine problem, but
said the plane had 23,500 pounds of fuel left when it landed in
Japan on Monday, 7,500 pounds more than the Federal Aviation
Administration requires and 4,500 pounds more than the airline
requires. But he said he did not know the distribution of the fuel
among the jumbo jet's four tanks.
   The Boeing 747 has a maximum fuel capacity of 320,000 pounds.
   Other aviation and government sources said Tuesday that the fuel
was in the tank that powered the engine that continued to operate,
although it has yet to be determined whether the improper
distribution of the fuel was caused by mechanical problem or flight
crew error.
   ``Each of the four engines is independent and has its own fuel
lines drawing from the tanks in the wing. ... You can interchange
fuel from tank to tank,'' said David Jimenez, a spokesman for the
Boeing Co.
   Such fuel transfers in the older Boeing 747-100 series aircraft
are often performed manually, according to another Boeing official,
Elizabeth Reese, although she said she did not know the procedure
used on the United aircraft involved in Monday's incident.
   Industry and government sources, speaking on the condition that
they not be identified, said that a mechanical problem such as a
fuel line or filter clog or malfunctioning valve might have kept
the crew from transferring the fuel.
   Another possibility is that the flight crew shifted too much
fuel into the fourth tank and was unable to transfer it back to the
other tanks, said one aviation source.
   According to the Boeing officials, the aircraft has a variety of
gauges to tell the flight crew how much fuel has been burned, how
much fuel remains and the fuel flow rates for each tank.
   The incident is being investigated by Japanese authorities, but
U.S. air safety investigators also are interested in the case.
Drucella Anderson, a spokeswoman for the National Transportation
Safety Board, said staffers plan to talk to pilots of the plane
when they return to the United States.

   Higher speed limits on rural interstate
highways are having no discernible effect on traffic fatalities,
probably due to stricter enforcement, Transportation Secretary Jim
Burnley says.
   ``A 55 mph limit that is not enforced can be more of a problem
than a 65 mph limit that is enforced,'' Burnley said Tuesday after
a speech to the Society of Automotive Engineers.
   A law enacted last year over President Reagan's veto allows
states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph on rural stretches of
interstate highways, 10 mph faster than the national 55 mph speed
limit enacted in 1974 as an energy conservation measure.
   Forty states have adopted the higher speed limit.
   Burnley declined to provide specific figures to support his
conclusion, saying they will be provided to Congress in a report
being prepared by the Transportation Department.
   ``We're just not finding any distinction'' between fatalities on
the 65 mph rural interstate highways and those where the speed
limit remained at 55 mph, Burnley said.
   The fatality statistics ``are all over the board,'' with deaths
rising in some states and falling in others on 65 mph stretches of
highway, said Ron DeFore, a Transportation Department spokesman.
   The only official statistic on the issue has been provided by
Diane Steed, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, in congressional testimony. She said that in the
months after the federal law took effect, the agency found
increases between 18 percent and 23 percent on rural interstates in
states that raised the limit.
   DeFore, however, said it is difficult to assess the effect of
the higher speed limit because of possible variations in other
safety factors, such as enforcement.
   In his speech, Burnley said Americans ``are becoming more safety
conscious,'' citing a 14 percent decline in the number of drunken
drivers involved in fatal auto accidents between 1982 and 1986.
   But the National Safety Council told Congress it believes the
higher speed limit is causing more deaths.
   ``We have a very strong and clear indication from across the
nation that average speeds have increased and more people are dying
and sustaining more severe injuries on these roads,'' said Judith
Stone, the council's federal affairs director, in testimony before
the House surface transportation subcommittee.
   She said she expects statistics to show 500 additional highway
deaths annually as a result of the higher speed limit.

<HEAD>Field Trials Among Wildlife Planned For New Rabies Vaccine,
Company Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wild raccoons on a remote Atlantic coastal
island will become subjects in a test of a genetically-engineered
rabies vaccine if the federal government approves a plan proposed
by a Philadelphia biomedical institute.
   The Wistar Institute announced a proposal Tuesday to test the
vaccine this fall on an island that will be selected off the coast
of either Virginia or South Carolina. The experiment, said Wistar
officials, is part of an international plan to eradicate rabies, a
disease that has plagued humans and animals since ancient times.
   Charles Rupprecht, an assistant professor at Wistar, said the
vaccine, in a liquid form, would be placed into baits designed to
attract wild raccoons. The baits then would be distributed on the
selected island.
   Later, he said, captured raccoons would be examined to determine
if they have eaten the bait and become immune to rabies.
   William H. Wunner, a Wistar professor, said the baits would
consist of a sponge filled with the vaccine and then sealed with a
wax. The baits would be coated with a scent as an attractant.
   He said laboratory tests have shown that when raccoons bite into
the baits they absorb the vaccine through the lining of their
mouths.
   Rupprecht said the process has been shown to be effective in
tests on thousands of animals of 15 different species in the
laboratory.
   The test would be the first U.S. use in the wild of a virus made
with recombinant DNA technology. But the same vaccine now is being
used in field tests on foxes in Belgium and will start soon in
France. Other types of rabies vaccines have been used in field
tests in West Germany and in Canada.
   Warren Cheston, associated director of Wistar, said the
engineered vaccine was made by removing one of five genes from the
rabies virus and splicing it into the genetic pattern of the
vaccinia virus, which is the virus used to make smallpox vaccines
for human innoculations.
   Cheston said that because the technology uses a harmless gene
from the rabies virus, the resulting vaccine cannot cause rabies.
But, when put into an animal's immune system, the vaccine will
cause the animal to develop antibodies to the rabies virus, thus
making the animal immune to the disease.
   Wistar has applied to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for
approval to conduct the tests. Wistar Institute, located in
Philadelphia, is an independent, non-profit biomedical research
laboratory.
   Repprecht said the islands under consideration for the test are
Parramore Island, Va., and North, Cedar or Murphy Islands on the
coast of South Carolina. These islands are uninhabited by humans,
but do have a population of raccoons. The South Carolina islands
are part of a wildlife refuge. He said he hopes that the test can
get under way this fall.
   Rabies is a viral infection that can infect any warm-blooded
animal. It attacks the central nervous system and always is fatal
unless a vaccine is administered shortly after exposure.
   A survey by the World Health Organization shows that more than
20,000 humans die annually from rabies and that more than a half
million receive post-exposure injections. About 30,000 people in
the United States receive the rabies vaccine annually. The Centers
for Disease Control reported rabies in more than 4,000 animals in
the U.S. last year, but no human cases developed.
   Current rabies vaccines must be administered by injection, but
Cheston said it is hoped that eventually a genetically-engineered
vaccine that can be taken orally will be made, tested and cleared
for human use. The oral rabies vaccine now being tested can be used
only on animals, he said.

   The Reagan administration says the threat of
Soviet germ weapons and not U.S. public fears about exotic diseases
should tip the decision on whether to build a new test laboratory
for biological weapons.
   The United States has formally renounced possession of any
biological weapons or their use but the administration says it
still needs a ``defensive research'' program to develop and test
protection for American troops.
   ``We certainly have the responsibility to the soldier to protect
him and her against those who would use biological weapons,''
Thomas J. Welch, deputy assistant secretary of defense, told three
House subcommittees.
   Lynn Hansen, assistant director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said the Soviets have ``an active research
program'' in sciences that could be used for building germ weapons.
   The Soviets have ``continued to maintain an offensive biological
warfare program,'' Hansen warned.
   The Army wants to build a $5.4 million biological test
laboratory at Utah's Dugway Proving Ground. The plan has been
temporarily shelved because of strong local opposition, but Welch
said the request will be made again next year.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, who represents the area, said the Army
plans have been ``setting off alarm bells throughout the scientific
community, both internationally and in Utah, as to the public
safety and wisdom of building the Dugway facility.''
   The Army wants the lab to be to ``bio-safety level four (B-4),''
the highest standard of protection. However, all the planned
experiments could be done in a B-3 lab, said Welch, who explained
the higher safety level would be an additional public protection.
   Owens noted the lab would have the capability ``to convert these
lethal pathogens into aerosol form'' and that potential was the
chief cause of public fears.
   The United States officially closed down its biological weapons
program, which was headquartered at Fort Detrick, Md., in 1969 and
announced that future research would be limited to ``defensive''
purposes. The United States is also a party to a 1972 treaty
banning biological weapons, but the pact lacks enforcement or
verification provisions.
   Welch, Hansen and other officials said repeatedly Tuesday that
the Army's research program was only defensive and the United
States would not use germ weapons and wouldn't violate the 1972
pact.
   Welch said: ``It would be impossible for us to use biological
weapons because we don't have them. ... We would never use
biological weapons against anybody.''
   But Owens said, ``the line between defensive and offensive
research would be so hopelessly blurred by the construction of a
level-four aerosol facility that the Dugway lab could easily
perceived by other nations as a provocative violation'' of the
treaty.
   Other legislators also appeared skeptical. Rep. Dante Fascell,
D-Fla., said ``the line between offensive and defensive biological
agents seems fuzzy at best.''
   Under questioning, Army Col. Walter Busby, who oversees the
testing program, said there are ``no plans to use genetically
engineered material'' at Dugway.
   Some of the biological agents tested at Dugway are shipped
through regular mails, officials said.
   Jeremy Rifkin, a chief critic of the new lab, said an
environmental impact statement on the lab released by the Army in
February dismisses a number of potential problems, including fire,
terrorism, sabotage or explosion.
   He criticized the statement as ``shoddily prepared, grossly
inadequate.''
   Rifkin is president of the private Foundation on Economic
Trends, which has sued to block construction of the Army lab.
   The witnesses testified at a joint hearing of the House Foreign
Affairs arms control subcommittee, the Interior subcommittee on
energy and the environment, and the Armed Services subcommittee on
military installations and facilities.

   A gun-toting burglar dressed in black has been
terrorizing residents of a suburban neighborhood, often snacking in
front of his victims, according to police, who call him ``the
Hungry Ninja Bandit.''
   ``He's not doing it for the money,'' Metro Dade Detective Tommy
Robson said. ``He's getting kicks like this.''
   The bandit first struck on Easter Sunday by robbing a home near
Miami Shores. Before he left, he had cole slaw and a glass of tea.
He struck again four days later and two houses away. This time he
ate half a banana before leaving.
   His latest hit was Monday night at the home of Lourdes Orango,
police said. He surprised her in her backyard and marched her
through the back door at gunpoint. Her two children, 11 and 6, were
inside.
   ``While he was there, he called one of his buddies and bragged
about what he was doing,'' Robson said. ``He was laughing about
it.''
   He turned down an offer of a video recorder, but took $60 from
Ms. Orango and two orange sodas, police said.

   A new policy of the National Association of
Securities Dealers is making it easier for investors to find out if
their stockbrokers have ever been in trouble.
   State securities regulators are applauding the move, but say
brokers ought to be required to disclose any black marks on their
record even if the customer doesn't ask.
   NASD said Tuesday it will provide information to anyone who
requests it in writing from the organization's records on its 6,600
member firms and on 460,000 brokers _ virtually every retail broker
in the country.
   Previously, NASD, which oversees the over-the-counter stock
market, has revealed only the current employer of a broker and any
major disciplinary actions brought by the association itself, said
NASD spokesman Enno Hobbing.
   Now, the association, at no charge, will supply information on
all infractions, including brokers' criminal convictions and
disciplinary actions taken by federal and state agencies and by
other stock exchanges, he said.
   NASD will also list a broker's previous employers so ``you can
determine if this guy has been a job hopper,'' Hobbing said.
   He said expanded records will be supplied only in response to
written requests, while the limited information previously provided
will continue to be given over the telephone.
   The North American Securities Administrators Association, which
represents state securities regulators, has been pushing to shift
the onus of triggering disclosure from customers to brokers.
   It is suggesting that brokers be required to give new customers
a brochure outlining their disciplinary history as well as the
commissions they charge and other information.
   The new NASD policy ``certainly represents a vast improvment
over what was previously available,'' said James C. Meyer, NASAA
president and Tennessee's top securities regulator.
   However, he said it was only ``an important first step,''
adding, ``it's really a little unrealistic'' to expect most
customers to take the initiative in investigating their broker's
record.
   Meyer said that many investors who called a hotline set up after
the October stock market crash complained that their brokers had
placed them in unsuitable investments or had engaged in
unauthorized trading. A requirement that brokers disclose past
violations of that nature may have prevented additional
transgressions.
   Wall Street executives have labeled NASAA's proposal ``red
letter disclosure,'' after Hester Prynne, the adulteress in ``The
Scarlet Letter'' who was required in Puritan New England to wear a
red letter ``A.''
   They argue that if brokers had to reveal their disciplinary
history, customers would shun brokers guilty of any offense.

<HEAD>Supertanker Rescues Man Drifting Out To Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE MAY COURT HOUSE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who hoped to float from
Florida to the Bahamas drifted more than 600 miles during his 20
days in a raft, buoyed by his thoughts of hot cereal and strawberry
ice cream while waiting for rescuers.
   Kenneth Maffei, who was rescued Monday, said he survived on rain
for drinking water and tiny shrimp, crab and fish from seaweed he
plucked from the sea.
   ``I have a great desire to learn about cultures on the islands,
and I like to travel in unusual ways,'' said Maffei, who was
rescued by a supertanker off Cape Hatteras, N.C., suffering from
second-degree burns and having lost more than 30 pounds.
   ``I'll be staying on land for a while,'' Maffei said Tuesday
from his hospital bed. ``I won't be heading for any islands.''
   Maffei, 28, of Santa Cruz, Calif., climbed into a tiny
inflatable raft at sunset on April 12 and set out from Fort
Lauderdale. The closest island was Great Isaac Island, about 60
miles away.
   ``I thought I could zig-zag back and forth to get there,'' he
said. ``I felt very strongly that it could be done.''
   Maffei said he studied maps and wind and current patterns at a
library before leaving.
   His equipment included oars and oarlocks and another tiny Army
surplus raft that carried food, water and clothes.
   But Maffei, an odd-job laborer, had taken only a few informal
sailing lessons in California and the tiny raft was too small for
his 6-foot-3, 180-pound frame. He had no motor, no radio
communications, no signal flares, no water desalination unit and no
compass.
   But he did have a strong personal will.
   ``Whenever I thought that this could be it, I would say, `Stop,
you can't think that way,''' Maffei said.
   ``I felt I would make it,'' he said, licking his blistered lips
so he could continue talking.
   Maffei said he caught high winds, heavy rains and swells that
dwarfed and repeatedly overturned his craft. His supply raft
deflated on the second day of his voyage and many of his supplies
sank. He was burned by the sun and saltwater and suffered abrasions
from the raft.
   The rains provided him with drinking water.
   ``I held out my raincoat to catch the water, and I'd scoop it
up,'' he said.
   For food, he caught tiny shrimp and crab and fish from seaweed.
Once he had a hole in the raft, which he quickly patched.
   Maffei said he lost track of time and overcame his fears with
two all-consuming visions.
   ``Strawberry ice cream with Fig Newtons, and Cream of Wheat with
cream,'' he said.
   On Sunday, 650 miles from Fort Lauderdale and 20 days out, he
saw one of the many tankers that had passed him by, and waved the
T-shirt he kept handy. Just like the other tankers, this one kept
going.
   ``About 20 minutes later, I looked back, and they had turned,''
he said. ``I said to myself, `There are no traffic signals out
here, tankers don't just turn. They're coming back.'''
   Korean crew members aboard the 800-foot Bahamian oil tanker Rich
Duchess climbed down a ladder to fetch Maffei, who was too weak to
stand.
   Maffei was in stable condition at Burdette Tomlin Memorial
Hospital after the Coast Guard on Monday used a helicopter to bring
him ashore.
   ``If we had known about this ahead of time, it would have been
classified as an unsafe voyage and would have been stopped,'' Coast
Guard Petty Officer James McHugh said Tuesday from the Cape May
Station.
   ``Sometimes, going through life, you take risks,'' Maffei said.
``You've got to take chances, otherwise you can't reach your
dreams.''

<HEAD>Legislation Would Ban Any U.S. Investment in S. Africa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislation to end all U.S. investment in
white-dominated South Africa and impose a near-total embargo on
exports and imports is heading for a partisan battle on the House
floor.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee gave its approval to the
disinvestment bill on Tuesday, voting 27-14. Action by the full
House is expected to be scheduled soon.
   The Democratic-controlled committee acted after voting down
repeated attempts by Republicans to dilute the measure's impact.
   The panel also approved by voice vote separate legislation
urging and authorizing President Reagan to impose economic
sanctions against the government of Ethiopia for alleged widespread
and serious human rights violations, including the diversion of
international starvation relief to the Ethiopian armed forces.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the panel's African
affairs subcommittee, said ending U.S. investment in South Africa
and imposing a two-way embargo on most trade will not cause South
Africa's white minority government to end its apartheid policies of
racial separation.
   ``Sanctions will not of themselves bring down apartheid,'' Wolpe
said.
   But he said they will raise the cost to the white minority
regime of maintaining South Africa as ``one vast slave plantation''
in which whites profit from the exploitation of blacks.
   ``This bill is the only non-violent means at our disposal, the
least costly means of averting a terrible tragedy in South
Africa,'' Wolpe said.
   Opponents of the legislation said it will hurt the black South
Africans it is designed to help. They predicted the loss of
thousands of jobs not only for blacks in South Africa but also for
Americans whose companies are hurt by the impact of the sanctions.
   ``This is not a policy, this is scorched earth,'' said Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., contending the bill will cost 2 million jobs for
South African blacks by the year 2000.
   Supporters of sanctions acknowleged that some American jobs
might well be lost but said that is of secondary importance in the
battle against apartheid.
   ``It may well be necessary in the pursuit of vital American
interests for us to be prepared to pay a certain price ourselves
here at home,'' said Rep. Steven Solarz, D-N.Y., adding that the
bill has been endorsed by major U.S. labor organizations including
the AFL-CIO.
   Speaking against an amendment to enable the president to waive
the sanctions law if it is hurting the U.S. economy, Solarz said
such a loophole would tell black South Africans, ``We are only
prepared to help you to the extent that it doesn't hurt us.''
   The bill would replace a sanctions law enacted over President
Reagan's veto in 1986. Burton contended that the 1986 law has
failed to put a dent in apartheid.
   ``I sympathize with the desperation,'' he said of the new
legislation. ``But acts of desperation generally hurt innocent
bystanders, and this one does it in spades.''
   The 1986 law barred new U.S. investment in South Africa and
established several specific trade sanctions. But it has permitted
U.S. companies to stay in South Africa if they so choose.
   The new bill would forbid any American citizen from holding any
investment in South Africa, a requirement that would force the
closing or sale of all U.S.-owned companies in the country.
   It would would bar all imports from South Africa except for
certain strategic minerals.
   It would prohibit all exports to South Africa except for
publications, articles intended to relieve human suffering, U.S.
economic assistance, and private assistance intended to promote
human rights, health, welfare, religious and educational activities.
   An amendment adopted during the committee debate also provided
an exemption for food, a step supporters said would make the
legislation more attractive to House members representing farm
regions.
   Prospects for the legislation are considered good in the House,
where majority Democrats see the sanctions issue as a political
plus for them in this election year. However, its prospects in the
Senate are less clear, in part because the legislation lacks
support of moderate Republicans who were the key to passing the
more limited sanctions bill two years ago.
   The sanctions would go into effect six months after the bill was
enacted into law.
   The legislation also:
   _Prohibits U.S. involvement in the South African petroleum
industry.
   _Bars all U.S. nuclear assistance to South Africa.
   _Directs the president to pursue international agreements aimed
at dismantling apartheid.
   _Requires the president to impose penalties on foreign nationals
seeking to take significant commercial advantage of the U.S.
sanctions.
   _Adds to the existing conditions for lifting sanctions a
requirement that South Africa implement United Nations resolutions
for the independence of the territory of South West Africa known as
Namibia.
   _Authorizes $40 million for economic assistance for
disadvantaged South Africans.

<TEXT>
   A weeklong round of negotiations over
increasing U.S. beef and orange sales in Japan ended in failure
Tuesday night with the United States saying it would seek to have
Japan's import quotas declared illegal under international trading
rules.
   Japanese Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato and U.S. trade
representative Clayton Yeutter broke off their talks after meetings
that began last Wednesday.
   It was the second collapse in the negotiations since late March,
when a four-year agreement on Japanese beef and citrus import
quotas expired.
   ``Regrettably the final Japanese proposal offered only a modest
increase in access'' to the Japanese market, Yeutter said later in
a press statement.
   He said the United States would again ask GATT, the General
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, at its Wednesday meeting in Geneva
to set up a panel to hear U.S. complaints ``about Japan's
obstructive beef and citrus import practices.''
   The Japanese government blocked a similar U.S. move at GATT's
April meeting in Geneva, and the two countries then went back to
the negotiations that ended in failure Tuesday night.
   Sato, a member of Prime Minister Mamoru Takeshita's Cabinet,
rejoined the five-day talks Tuesday night as Japan's chief
negotiator in Yeutter's headquarters near the White House.
   Sato, who has been in Washington for a week, missed most of the
negotiations earlier Tuesday.
   The United States has been demanding removal of the Japanese
import quotas on beef, oranges and orange juice that it accepted in
a 1984 accord that expired last month.
   Japanese beef and citrus producers, who are influential in
Takeshita's governing Liberal-Democratic Party, have argued that
their livelihood would be threatened by increased imports.
   In his statement Yeutter branded the Japanese quotas as
``incompatible with GATT rules.'' He called on the Japanese
government to ``live up to its international obligations and
agree'' to a GATT review of the U.S. complaint instead of again
blocking it.
   ``It is essential that the Japanese government join the United
States and other major trading partners in pursuing and promoting
open global trade -- in agriculture as well as industrial goods,''
Yeutter said.
   That responsibility is not met, he said, by the use of
``GATT-inconsistent quotas'' or other barriers.
   Japan offered some concessions on beef but none of the U.S.
concern about citrus fruit ``was addressed to our satisfaction''
said Yeutter.
   The U.S. target in the prolonged negotiations was ``elimination
of the Japanese beef and citrus quotas by a date certain, along
with a transparent and comprehensive package which would assure
U.S. beef and citrus producers full access to Japan's market,'' he
said.
   In addition, Yeutter continued, the United States wanted an
immediate end to what he called ``the GATT-illegal'' requirement
that imported orange juice be blended with Japanese domestic juice,
and substantial cuts in citrus tariffs.
   ``The Japanese were willing to make concessions in some areas,''
Yeutter said, but in exchange for lifting beef import quotas ``they
wanted to substitute other measures that would sustain a high level
of import protection.'' This was understood to mean a proposal for
surcharges on imports.
   ``In addition, none of our citrus concerns was addressed to our
satisfaction. Under the Japanese proposal, U.S. exporters and
Japanese consumers would continue to bear the cost and burden of
Japan's insistence on constraining agricultural imports,'' Yeutter
said.
   Sato will return to Japan Wednesday, aides said.
   The minister told reporters he regretted very much the failure
to reach an agreement.
   The Japanese side ``was always pursuing realistic and practical
solutions to this problem, and we hope the U.S. will in the future
be more practical,'' he said.
   No plans for further talks were announced and Sato said this
depends on the content and outcome of U.S. proposals to the GATT
council.
   He would not say, however, if Japan will again seek to block
formation of a GATT panel on the beef and orange dispute. ``We have
to examine Japan's attitude on the GATT,'' he said. The United
States did not reject outright the Japanese proposal for important
surcharges instead of quotas, Sato said, and this was not the main
obstacle to an agreement.

<HEAD>First Lady Won't Give up Interest in Astrology Despite Uproar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Disclosures that President Reagan and his wife
consult astrologers have opened them to taunts from Congress and
criticism from scientists, but the first lady isn't about to drop
her longtime interest in stargazing, an aide says.
   ``She doesn't think that there's anything wrong with it. It
doesn't control policy and it doesn't control their lives,'' Elaine
Crispen, the first lady's press secretary, said Tuesday.
   White House officials were clearly discomfited by the revelation
_ at one moment offering smiles and shrugs for reactions, at others
stern denials that serious policy matters have been left to
soothsayers.
   For the Reagans, it was the latest bit of gossip about their
private lives to emerge from a recent spate of kiss-and-tell books.
Former chief of staff Donald Regan, forced from his job last year
after clashing repeatedly with the first lady over the president's
schedule, has reportedly written that Mrs. Reagan consulted
astrologers to help arrange the president's activities.
   The president's reaction to the uproar was quick.
   ``No policy or decision in my mind has ever been influenced by
astrology,'' the president said Tuesday.
   Reagan did not deny consulting astrologers, who make forecasts
based on the belief that the heavenly bodies form patterns that can
reveal a person's character or future.
   Asked if astrology played a part in shaping his schedule, Reagan
quipped, ``You know I'm still looking for the fellas that tell me
every day what I'm going to be doing.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, after acknowledging the
first couple's interest in astrology, said he believes his own
horoscope ``when it says I am destined to meet a beautiful woman
and fall madly in love and get rich.''
   ``It's all so silly,'' Mrs. Crispen said of the barrage of
queries that inundated her desk. ``Don't you read your horoscope?''
   In response to reporters' queries, Fitzwater acknowledged Mrs.
Reagan has had an interest in astrology ``for some time,'' and that
it was heightened by the March 30, 1981, assassination attempt
against her husband.
   ``She was very concerned for her husband's welfare, and
astrology has been a part of her concern in terms of his
activities,'' he said.
   Both he and Mrs. Crispen said the first lady had dealt with a
friend involved in astrology who ``was helpful to her'' after the
attempt on the president's life, but neither would reveal the
friend's name.
   The spokesman said that as far as he knew, Reagan's interest in
astrology is limited to reading his horoscope. However, Fitzwater
noted the president has mentioned ``lucky numbers'' in speeches and
jokingly has referred to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln residing in
the White House family quarters.
   Mrs. Crispen said the first lady explained that her interest in
astrology was due to the shock of the assassination attempt. ``I
don't think anyone realized how frightened I was _ I came close to
losing him,'' she quoted Mrs. Reagan as saying.
   Mrs. Cripsen said the first lady ``has talked to this person
about his (Reagan's) safety and travel, but I don't know of any
particular incident or example of schedule change made because of
this.''
   She contended astrology was ``only an interest'' for the first
lady and not a major factor in the Reagans' lives.
   ``They both feel it's unfortunate and a distraction and hardly
relevant to the business of government,'' Fitzwater said. However,
Mrs. Crispen said Mrs. Reagan has ``not lost her humor'' now that
her secret had been revealed.
   ``She's laughed about it,'' Mrs. Crispen said. ``She's not
upset, because she's not got anything to hide, because there's
nothing wrong with it.''
   Mrs. Crispen added that she believed Mrs. Reagan will continue
``to talk to persons who have given her relief for the past few
years. ... She's the worrier ... and it's one thing she could use
to help her squelch that worry.''
   Fitzwater said he expected the nation's astrologers to make
extraordinary claims about their influence on the Reagans, and one
_ Joyce Jillson of Los Angeles _ immediately spoke up. She claimed
she had spent a lot of time at the White House and had played a
role earlier in the selection of George Bush as vice president.
   The White House said the Reagans did not know her. And Bush's
office said, ``We're not aware of anyone hiring this woman.''
   One group of scientists said it was dismayed that the president
and his wife have an interest in what they termed ``medieval
superstition.''
   The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the
Paranormal said dozens of tests in recent years have found
``little, if any, evidence for astrological claims. Horoscopes have
been shown under the most rigorous scientific analysis to fail
completely in predicting future events.
   ``The consultation by political leaders of astrologers has all
but disappeared from the modern scene,'' the group added.
   On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, was asked
what he thought about the Reagans using astrologists. He replied
with a grin: ``It's all right with me. I'm glad he consults
somebody.
   ``It's a full moon out there. Now that's what brings the crazies
out,'' Wright added.
   Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, poked fun at the Reagan from the
floor of the House.
   ``What can we expect from a president who schedules his press
conferences and speeches based on the signs of the Zodiac?'' he
asked.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Reagans Relying on `Superstition'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of world-famous scientists intent on
debunking the claims of astrologers says it is dismayed that
President and Mrs. Reagan use ``superstition'' and ``mystical
fortune telling'' to make decisions.
   The practice, said the Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, harks back to ancient
times when monarchs and emperors resorted to the musings of fortune
tellers for advice.
   ``We are concerned by the apparent return to medieval
superstitition,'' the statement said. ``Dozens of tests in recent
years by scientists can find little, if any, evidence for
astrological claims. Horoscopes have been shown under the most
rigorous scientific analysis to fail completely in predicting
future events.''
   The statement was released after reports on a forthcoming book
by former White House chief of staff Donald Regan, who says Nancy
Reagan regularly consults astrologers in shaping her advice to the
president. Reagan, the book says, also regularly reads his
horoscope. The White House later confirmed the Reagans' interest in
astrology but said it did not influence any policy decisions.
   ``If the United States is to continue its leadership in
scientific research, it is vital that the public have a clear
understanding of the difference between science and pseudoscience,
and that decisions be based on the real world without resorting to
mystical fortune telling and other primitive forms of
prognostication,'' the scientists' group said.
   Paul Kurtz, chairman of the committee, said he released the
statement to counter publicity about astrology following disclosure
of the Reagans' interest.
   ``We ask the White House to confirm to what extent astrologers
have been advisers of presidents,'' Kurtz said in the statement.
``The public has the right to know who these astrologers are and
what recommendations they have made. We ask that their claims and
alleged authorities be subjected to scientific scrutiny.''
   The scientists' committee critically analyzes assertions by
astrologers and by persons claiming unusual powers or perceptions.
Members include Nobel laureate F.H.C. Crick, two-time Nobel
laureate Murray Gell-Mann, noted psychologist B. F. Skinner, and
authors Issac Asimov and Carl Sagan.
   Andrew Fraknoi, an astronomy professor at San Francisco State
University and a member of the committee, said astrology has been
put through vigorous scientific analysis dozens of times and has
never been found to have validity.
   Fraknoi said that in one test two scientists examined more than
3,000 predictions by astrologers and found that they were correct
less than 10 percent of the time.
   ``If the predictions are wrong 90 percent of the time, that's
not the type of guidance we need from the federal government,'' he
said.
   Astrologers, said Fraknoi, regularly use the positions of the
Uranus and Neptune in making predictions, even though those two
planets were not even discovered when the concept of astrology was
established in ancient times.
   Fraknoi said astrologers claim they make predictions based on
the position of planets against a background of star
constellations, using methods developed by ancient observers.
   Yet, he said, the Earth's position has shifted so that
constellations no longer are in the same relative viewing positions.
   ``In effect, all of the constellations have moved,'' said
Fraknoi. ``This puts the signs of the Zodiac off by one whole
sign.''
   The astrology concept that a person's future is shaped through
some unexplained mechanism by the position of the stars and planets
at the moment of birth also has been attacked scientifically, he
said.
   He said a researcher checked groups of men who re-enlisted in
the Marine Corps. Based on astrology, he said, such a group would
be motivated by the same or similar Zodiacal signs. Yet, said
Fraknoi, ``there was no trend whatsoever.'' The signs were randomly
distributed.
   Another astrology concept is that people are more likely to find
happiness with partners who have ``compatible signs.'' The signs,
according to astrology, are based on the time and month of birth.
   Fraknoi said a researcher checked 3,500 marriage certificates
and found that people are no more likely to pair up with those of
``compatible signs'' than they were with those of any other sign.
   Some astrologers, said Fraknoi, have suggested that the
gravitational and tidal effects of distant planets, such as Mars,
at the moment of birth can affect a person's future.
   Calculations by scientists, said Fraknoi, show that the
obstetrican who delivers a baby has a six times greater
gravitational influence on a child than the planet Mars. The tidal
effect of the obstetrican is greater by a factor of 2 trillion, he
said.
   ``Is this really something on which we want to base our national
destiny?'' Fraknoi asked.
   Kurtz, in his statement, said the committee of scientists was
concerned about damage that belief in astrology may cause.
   ``Scientists have been warning for years that the uncritical
prominence given to astrology may have a deleterious effect on the
public,'' he said. ``Recent opinion polls have shown that up to 52
percent of teenagers accept the validity of astrology. The
intrusion of astrology into the highest levels of national security
thinking now is a cause for further concern.''

<HEAD>Reagan Says Soviet Union Has Made Some Progress In Religious
Rights</HEAD>

   President Reagan says he sees ``encouraging
signs'' that religious oppression has abated somewhat in the Soviet
Union.
   In a speech Tuesday devoid of the harsh criticism of recent
weeks, the president said Mikhail S. Gorbachev has admitted the
Soviet Union made mistakes dealing with religious believers in
decades past and they would be ``rectified.''
   ``What we hope for ultimately is a willingness to see continued
change, in the spirit of glasnost, when it comes to matters of
religion,'' Reagan told a meeting on religious rights at the White
House.
   Glasnost is the Russian term for the Soviet leader's policy of
bringing openess to Soviet society.
   Reagan was scheduled to address the issue of human rights again
today in the Soviet Union during a speech in Chicago to the
National Strategy Forum, a non-partisan organization that sponsors
educational programs on national security and foreign policy issues.
   The address is another in a series of scene-setters for the
upcoming May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow.
   In Tuesday's speech, Reagan said some dissidents have been
allowed to emigrate from the Soviet Union, some churches have been
allowed to open and organize and the printing of 100,000 Bibles
will be permitted.
   ``These are encouraging signs and we welcome them,'' Reagan said.
   But, Reagan added, many churches have been denied recognition,
religious instruction outside the home is still illegal and the new
Bibles will scarcely serve a nation of 280 million.
   ``So while every positive step taken by the Soviets is welcomed
_ we realize that this is just a beginning,'' Reagan said. ``I
promise you that the witness of faith you brought here today will
not be confined to these four walls or forgotten when this meeting
is ended.
   ``I will carry it in my heart when I travel to the Soviet Union
at the end of this month and I will say that the most fitting way
to mark the millenium of Christianity in Kiev ... would be granting
the rights of all the peoples and all the creeds of the Soviet
Union to worship their god in their own way.''
   While noting the 1,000th anniversary of Christianity in the
Soviet Union, Reagan also said: ``The rights of Soviet Jews have
taken up much of our official time and this is very close to my
heart. Our hope is for doors to open completely to emigration and
to full freedom for all faiths.''
   After the conference, Reagan told a Ukrainian Catholic leader he
would visit an Orthodox monastery in Moscow despite the church
leader's request Reagan cancel the trip in protest of religious
persecution.
   ``He said he already made plans and he has to go,'' Myroslav
Cardinal Lubachivsky told reporters.
   The monastery on the outskirts of Moscow, the central building
of which is more than 700 years old, is being restored with
government financial help.
   The cardinal said he made the request because Ukrainian
Catholics continue to suffer persecution.
   ``Today, we hear so much about glasnost and perestroika,'' he
said. ``But, Mr. Gorbachev's reforms have yet to touch the
Ukrainian Catholic Church. Our priests are punished or fined for
celebrating the liturgy in private homes, and the faithful live in
constant fear of imprisonment. Such violations of basic human
rights simply must not exist.''

   The mother of ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos died Wednesday after appealing to President
Corazon Aquino to allow her son to return from exile in Hawaii as
her dying wish.
   Dr. Sergio Brillantes, director of Veterans Memorial Medical
Center, said 95-year-old Josefa Edralin-Marcos suffered cardiac
arrest at noon (midnight Tuesday) and was pronounced dead 20
minutes later.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos had been hospitalized since Sunday suffering
from pneumonia, diabetes and kidney failure. She lapsed into a coma
late Tuesday, Brillantes said.
   She died as Mrs. Aquino convened her Cabinet's crisis committee
to consider a request by Mrs. Edralin-Marcos to allow her son to
return to see her one last time. The request was made in a letter
delivered Tuesday to the presidential palace.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos stayed behind in February 1986 when a
military-civilian uprising drove her son into exile after 20 years
in power and lifted Mrs. Aquino to the presidency. Mrs. Aquino
since has refused to allow Marcos to come back.
   The former president's supporters have been linked to several
attempts to topple the Aquino government. On Tuesday, the military
announced that troops had seized 30 rifles and 300 sticks of
dynamite during a raid Monday on a suburban machine shop owned by a
Marcos supporter.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa had said it was up
to civilian authorities to decide whether to allow Marcos to
return. But he indicated the military command was wary of such a
request.
   ``We will have to assess ... whether conditions in the past are
still the same,'' he told reporters on Tuesday. ``We still have
certainly a serious threat situation in the country coming from
(communist rebels), and we don't want additional problems.''
   Before Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' death, Justice Secretary Sedfrey
Ordonez told reporters today the decision on allowing Marcos to
return would have to be political and not based solely on legal
considerations.
   Brillantes said Mrs. Edralin-Marcos underwent dialysis Tuesday
for her failing kidneys and was running a high fever. He said she
was comatose, but she showed stable blood pressure and was
``breathing easier.''
   In her letter, Mrs. Edralin-Marcos said she was near the end of
her life. ``My dying wish, the one thing that will put a smile upon
my lips when I leave this world, is to see my Ferdinand by my
bedside as I say goodbye to all of you,'' said the letter, a copy
of which was released by the presidential staff. ``Pray grant me
this wish and this privilege as one mother to another.''
   The letter, apparently drafted by family members, included the
thumb print of Marcos' mother.
   In a separate letter, the former president's brother and sister,
Dr. Pacifico Marcos and Mrs. Fortuna Marcos-Barba, asked Mrs.
Aquino to ``grant our mother's final wish.'' They were at her
bedside when she died.
   Marcos supporters held a candlelight vigil and prayed for Mrs.
Edralin-Marcos' recovery. Dozens of Marcos supporters jammed an
adjacent hospital room to watch her through a small window.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos came from a wealthy northern Luzon family of
Filipino and Chinese extraction. Marcos' father, Mariano, was a
politician and lawyer who died in 1944 during the Japanese
occupation.
   Marcos was not allowed to return for the funeral of his sister,
Elizabeth Marcos-Keon, who died in December 1986.

<HEAD>Chevrolet G-20 Van Shows Great Head-Injury Potential, NHTSA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A driver is in greater danger of brain injury
in the crash of a Chevrolet G-20 van than in any other vehicle
tested by the government this year.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday
a 35 mph crash test of the G-20 resulted in a head-injury criterion
of 3665. The criterion is an index measuring the potential for
brain injury.
   The General Motors Corp. van was crashed head-on into a fixed
barrier, and the criterion was calculated from recordings made by
an instrument-equipped dummy wearing a safety belt.
   The Chevrolet Astro Van test produced a driver's head-injury
criterion of 1603; the Ford F-150 pickup, 1074; the Nissan Van XE,
949; and the Chevrolet C-1500 pickup, 892.
   NHTSA earlier this year said the Volkswagen Vanagon produced a
head-injury criteron of 1320 on the driver side.
   The agency also released results showing the Nissan Pulsar NX
produced a head-injury criterion of 1134, higher than that of any
other 1988 subcompact car tested so far.
   The agency earlier tested three other 1988 subcompacts. The
Volkswagen Fox produced a head-injury criterion of 1114; the Toyota
Tercel, 1005; and the Toyota Corolla FX, 593.
   The tests were conducted at 5 mph faster than the 30 mph
required by law. The higher speed produces a crash that is
one-third more severe than at the lower speed, NHTSA said.
   At 30 mph, 1000 is the highest head-injury criterion permitted.
   Only one vehicle of a given type is tested, and further testing
could produce different results, NHTSA said.
   Compact cars tested earlier this year showed the Peugeot 505 GLS
with a head-injury criterion of 1701; the Nissan Maxima SE, 907;
and the Pontiac Le Mans Aerocoupe, 819.
   In the large and midsize range, the Mercury Sable produced a
head-injury criterion of 712, and the Ford Taurus, 707.

   As thousands take to the woods of the
upper Midwest in their annual hunt for morel mushrooms, a company
is on its way to stocking grocery store shelves year-round with the
elusive delicacy.
   Morel hunting has become a tradition in the Midwest from April
to June, with many communities sponsoring morel festivals _
complete with mushroom queens _ in honor of the fleeting fungus.
   The fascination with the morel lies not only in its unique
flavor, which devotees say is as different from the common button
mushroom as its appearance, but in the hunt as well.
   ``Someone I spoke to once called it morel fishing rather than
morel hunting,'' said Gloria Anderson, executive director of the
Chamber of Commerce of Boyne City, which this weekend is host of
the community's 28th-annual morel hunt, Michigan's oldest.
   One of the most common spots to find the morel is under a dying
elm tree, but it also can be found in apple orchards, ``and almost
everyone says not to walk past a mound of leaves because there's
probably a morel or two underneath,'' Anderson said.
   The novice simply must keep an eye out for the unique features
of the morel, especially its pitted cap resembling a sponge.
   Morel hunting can be hazardous because of the false morel, which
is often more plentiful and conspicuous than true morels.When
cooked, the false morel, with a wrinkled cap that looks more like a
brain than a sponge, can release a potentially deadly toxin.
   ``Most of the trouble comes in when people start
experimenting,'' says Nancy Weber, a University of Michigan
mycologist.
   Guidebooks or searching an experienced morel hunter could make
the job safer and easier, she advises.
   A Lansing-based company also hopes to make it easier for morel
lovers by enabling them to satisfy their cravings at gourmet shops
rather than in the hinterland.
   Neogen, an agricultural biotech company, has found the secret to
cultivating the morel indoors.
   It claimed a patent in 1986 for morel cultivation, and can grow
the mushroom indoors 365 days a year by providing the environment
that triggers its sex cycle, company Vice President Brinton Miller
said.
   Plans for commercialization of the domesticated morel are under
way, and Miller predicts morels will be on shelves _ probably only
in gourmet shops _ in the United States and in Switzerland next
year. He said licensing agreements for morel production are being
negotiated with companies in the Far East and Europe.
   ``There will be production capabilities to make morels available
to anyone who wants them,'' Miller said. ``We'd love to make the
morel a favorite at Christmas. Nobody even thinks about having
morels now at Christmas.''
   Because of the mushroom's short season and the laborious search
involed, morels now sell for as much as $15 to $30 per pound here,
and an ounce can cost nearly that much in some New York City
gourmet shops. Even with indoor cultivation, Miller predicts
wholesale prices with remain between $12 and $20 per pound.
   Despite the increased availability, Miller said he believes
morel hunts will continue.
   ``There are zillions of people who go out and fish for trout,
when you can get them year-round at trout farms,'' Miller said.
``This is the same thing.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Jackson Under Polite Pressure To Tone Down
Attacks</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis isn't exactly asking Jesse
Jackson to quit the race for the Democratic presidential nomination
in the wake of repetitive landslides in Ohio and Indiana. But he's
obviously had enough taunts to last for the rest of the nominating
season.
   It's pretty tame stuff, especially compared with Jackson's 1984
campaign rhetoric, but Democratic leaders already are urging
Dukakis' sole remaining rival to tone down his rhetoric in the five
weeks left in the primary season _ in hopes of maximizing the
chance of defeating Vice President George Bush in November.
   But whether Dukakis or anyone else can cause Jackson to back off
is an open question. All they really can do without risking offense
to Jackson's following is to ask politely, and that doesn't exactly
make Dukakis sound like the strong, effective leader he wants the
country to think he is.
   ``I don't mind disagreements on issues,'' he said Tuesday night
as he celebrated his Midwestern victories while losing the District
of Columbia. ``I just hope we can both continue to campaign with
the respect we've had for each other in the past year.''
   For a man who has elevated caution to an art form, that amounts
to a blunt statement that he's had enough of observations like this
Jackson critique of Dukakis' style: ``The kitchen is clean and
cool. Ain't nothing cooking.''
   That is mild compared with Jackson's 1984 campaign, when he
complained about party rules and waged a mini-platform fight at the
party convention that gave Walter F. Mondale his nomination, and
Dukakis and his aides must realize that.
   Nonetheless, it's obviously beginning to nettle Dukakis. And it
probably delights Vice President George Bush and the men who are
planning his general election campaign as the designated Republican
successor to President Reagan.
   Bush has taken a few shots of his own at Dukakis in recent days.
Although aides say his candidacy will be based on the traditional
virtues of peace and prosperity, the vice president has already
shown he's prepared to meet Dukakis' likely lines of attack head on.
   Asked about Attorney General Edwin Meese and his legal
difficulties, Bush said he could ``go into a guilt-by-association
mode'' that involves Massachusetts politics or Dukakis' campaign
staff.
   Asked about Dukakis' criticisms of the administration's handing
of Panama, Bush replied, ``I can't wait for Mr. Dukakis to discuss
the Noriega matter ... One of the beautiful things about being a
new candidate without a heck of a lot of experience in foreign
affairs is you can make dramatic statements without necessarily
having the proof.''
   All this is coming at Dukakis at the same time that Jackson has
sharpened his rhetoric in the days following last week's
Pennsylvania primary defeat.
   Party leaders are already hinting to Jackson that with Tuesday
night's landslides, it may be time to give Dukakis some breathing
room.
   ``I would hope he wouldn't say anything that could be used
against Mike in the general election,'' Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton
said after Tuesday's primaries.
   ``He has at every turn in the road said it's imperative for a
Democrat to be elected,'' said Clinton, who added that Dukakis had
asked governors to withhold their endorsements until he could prove
himself in the primaries.
   Most Democratic officials aren't interested in any additional
debate as they seek to recapture the White House and end eight
years of Republican rule. After Gary Hart's two entrances and exits
from the campaign, not to mention Joseph Biden's political
immolation and a long winter of turbulent primary campaigning,
they've had all the excitement they want.
   ``It may be boring but I love it,'' said Democratic National
Committee Vice Chair Lynn Cutler as she surveyed a race that now
seems all but tucked away for Dukakis.
   Judy Carnahan, the Oregon Democratic Party chair, said, ``Where
I am personally disappointed is that for so long Jackson did so
well as a coalition builder and bringing people together and then
within the last week or so seems to have a reverse type of position
and has started attacking Dukakis.
   ``I find that very disappointing. What he's managing to do is
diminish his own stature.''
   Under the ordinary rules of politics, Jackson would be long gone
from the campaign, joining Bruce Babbitt, Gary Hart and the rest of
the also-rans on the sidelines after going six weeks without a
primary victory.
   But the normal rules of politics don't apply to Jackson, and for
good reason.
   He alone of Dukakis' past and present rivals has a demonstrable
following that numbers in the millions and can make or break a
Democratic nominee in the race to succeed Reagan.

<HEAD>Democrats Move to Junk Trade Bill's Oil Export Curbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats seeking to head off a presidential
veto of the trade bill or gain enough votes for an override are
wooing Alaska's two senators with a promise to consider more
lenient export rules for that state's oil.
   The move came Tuesday with House introduction of a resolution
authorizing ``technical corrections'' in the trade bill, which
cleared the Senate 63-36 last week. The margin was three votes shy
of what would be needed to override a veto.
   The ``corrections'' would be made in two provisions opposed by
Alaskan oil interests.
   One of the provisions would approve export of 50,000 barrels a
day of Alaskan crude oil to Canada, but would require the oil to be
transported first to a West Coast port in American vessels. The
feature is a favorite of politically influential maritime unions
and lawmakers from states whose ports could benefit.
   The other provision would limit exports from new refineries in
Alaska to 70,000 barrels and day and half of total production.
   The House is expected later this week to take up the resolution
authorizing changes, with senators likely to act next week when
they return from a recess.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, described the resolution as a
last-ditch effort to dissuade President Reagan from his threatened
veto.
   ``We're trying to meet him halfway if we can,'' Wright said.
   But Republicans immediately scoffed that the real reason was to
pick up the two votes from Alaska's senators for an override
attempt.
   Reagan's opposition to the trade bill stems in large part to a
provision to require all but the smallest companies to provide
their employees with 60-day notice of plant closings and
large-scale layoffs. Democrats have been threatening to make that
an issue in fall campaigns.
   More recently the president has reportedly objected to the
Alaska oil provisions. Wright said that was one reason the
Democrats are attempting to remove them and replace them with
funding for a study that would not have any direct impact on
exports.
   ``We're trying in every way to appeal to his better nature,''
Wright said.
   But just before Wright's plan went through the Rules Committee,
Rep. James Quillen, R-Tenn., described it as ``a ploy to change
some votes in the Senate in order to override a possible
presidential veto.''
   House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., took the floor
and accused Wright of trying to ``win at all costs.''
   ``I am told there is a proposed new rule in the works that will
allow the majority to delete the Alaskan oil provisions in a
last-ditch attempt to manipulate a veto override in the Senate,''
Michel said. ``Is there nothing left of the integrity of our rules
and procedures?''
   Despite the maneuvering, one of the Alaska senators, Ted
Stevens, has said he will not necessarily back the trade bill even
if the export curbs are dropped.

<TEXT>
   This innovative Yankee town, which once
considered building a dome over itself to keep out the harsh
Vermont winter, is trying to tax neighboring Burlington for its
noisy use of Winooski's airspace.
   The western Vermont town of about 6,300 people sits at the end
of Burlington International Airport's runway, and its downtown is
just off the airport's main approach.
   Residents say the noise from helicopters, Vermont National Guard
fighters and jets flying in and out of Vermont's largest city can
be unbearable.
   ``They go right over our building,'' Alice Levesque said
recently. ``It's really an awful thing. They wouldn't do that to a
herd of cows.''
   Winooski officials, saying the planes were invading their
airspace, decided to tax Burlington. Burlington balked.
   Winooski, contending that Burlington hadn't paid the taxes, then
filed suit in Chittenden County Superior Court to collect on a bill
of $90,000, plus interest.
   ``By flying that low, they have essentially confiscated the land
that is below that air,'' said Dominique Casavant, a physics
professor and former Winooski selectman. The airport noise
depresses land values, Casavant said.
   ``Yes, it is unusual ... (but) this is not the first time
Winooski has set precedent,'' Casavant said.
   In 1979, a dome to cover the town was proposed to save energy
and ward off winter. The proposal was the subject of an
international symposium and federal money was requested to study
it, but the project never got out of the planning stages.
   Officials argue that they aren't taxing the planes, but the
space they use when they land and take off.
   ``Property taxes are not novel,'' said Winooski City Manager
Brendan Keleher. ``Property taxes are our business.''
   Burlington has dismissed the airspace tax, although Bernard
Sanders, the city's outspoken Socialist mayor, applauded Winooski
for its imagination.
   ``As somebody who is interested in alternatives to the property
tax, I have to congratulate our friends in the city of Winooksi,''
Sanders said. ``It's an interesting concept, but not terribly
practical. If Winooski could do it, so could Toledo. We would be
evolved to a toll booth in the sky.''
   Landowners have sued over airspace rights in the past, but
experts said they cannot recall a case where one city sued another
to collect taxes for airspace.
   Walter Hellerstein, a University of Georgia law professor and
tax expert, said he had not seen the suit but called the idea
behind it ``bizarre.''
   ``It seems to me, it would be as if the state of Iowa were
trying to tax the city of San Francisco,'' Hellerstein said,
explaining that a plane might fly over the Midwestern state on its
way to the West Coast. ``I've never heard of anything like this.''
   But Peter Teachout, a professor at Vermont Law School in South
Royalton, said the lawsuit is not so far-fetched, even if it
presents some practical problems.
   Teachout said the city faces the difficulty of placing a
monetary value on the airspace. Tax values are normally established
by properties' market values.
   ``How do you figure out what that airspace is worth?'' he asked.
``Nobody is going to pay for it.''
   The lawsuit also has to draw a boundary on the airspace in
question and has to show that Winooski's situation is different
from that of most other communities, where planes overhead fly at
greater altitudes, Teachout said.
   ``That would be the toughest problem _ convincing a court it
isn't going to be opening up the floodgates (to future suits).''

   Two teen-agers were in custody Tuesday for
allegedly shooting and killing a tax assessor as he walked home
from work, while police searched for the killers of two other
people shot in unrelated incidents.
   A 15-year-old suspected gang member and a 17-year-old boy were
arrested Monday, minutes after they allegedly fired on the man from
a speeding car, police said.
   Two more teens were arrested Tuesday in another shooting, in
which two 15-year-olds were wounded.
   In Pomona, a motorist escaped gunfire by driving his car down
railroad tracks until it got stuck, then fleeing with a passenger
as a freight train smashed into the vehicle.
   No one was hurt in the Monday morning chase, which police said
began as Michael Ortega, 23, and Juan Eugene Lopez, 20, were
driving near Cherrieville Park, a frequent site of street gang
violence.
   Their path was blocked by two autos that stopped in front of
them, said Officer Douglas Buettner. A third car stopped behind
them.
   Ortega and Lopez heard a gunshot, apparently fired from the
park, and drove onto the tracks, Buettner said. Several other shots
were fired at them by the other cars' occupants, who chased them
down the tracks on foot before returning to their cars.
   The two men continued driving until their car stuck where the
tracks merged with another set. They were trying to free the
vehicle when the train approached, forcing them to abandon the car,
the officer reported.
   Police said gang members also were believed involved in the
fatal drive-by shooting Monday night of Clemente Gallegos, 18.
Officer Daniel Ruelas said Gallegos was confronted by several
suspected gang members as he stood on the sidewalk.
   In a third shooting, a city waste inspector was killed Monday
near Dodger Stadium. Awni Rayyis, 58, was killed as he was standing
in front of the city's General Services Standards Laboratory.
   Rayyis provided a description of the killer's vehicle before he
died at County-USC Medical Center.
   In yet another shooting, in suburban Sylmar, about 25 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles, police arrested two teen-agers
following a drive-by shooting Tuesday afternoon that wounded two
ninth-grade boys near a junior high school.
   The victims were both 15 years old, said Lt. Fred Nixon, a
police spokesman, and the two youths who were being held for
investigation of attempted murder were 16 and 13 years old.
   It appears the gunmen were seeking out their victims, Nixon
said, adding, ``We have witness accounts that gang slogans were
yelled.''
   Henry Hunter, a 35-year-old Los Angeles County assessor clerk
was shot as he walked home about 5 p.m. Monday and died a short
time later at California Medical Center, authorities said.
   A police helicopter happened to be in the area and pinpointed
the direction of the speeding getaway vehicle, allowing officers in
patrol cars to stop the car and arrest the youths, Detective
Richard Hoffman said.
   The suspects were not identified because of their ages. The
15-year-old acknowledged gang membership, but the 17-year-old had
not claimed or denied any gang affiliation, the detective said.
   ``Everyday at the same time (Hunter) walked down the street, on
his way home with his briefcase and a newspaper,'' Hoffman said.
   ``This could have been anybody in metropolitan L.A.,'' Hoffman
said. ``This fellow was just walking down the street minding his
own business and these young fellows just drive by and shoot him.
... It was just a random thing. The poor guy was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.''
   Community leaders also asked street gang members to observe a
weeklong truce in honor of Mother's Day and Cinco de Mayo, the May
5 Mexican holiday.
   ``I have a message for gang members: Your mothers don't want to
lose you,'' said Steve Valdivia, executive director of Community
Youth Gang Services.

<HEAD>36 Million New Housing Units to be Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country will need to build or renovate 36
million new housing units over the next 15 years to address the
problems faced by Americans living in substandard and overcrowded
conditions, a study reported today.
   The study, prepared by the Urban Institute, said that over 6
percent of housing units in urban areas and 17 percent of units in
rural areas don't meet minimum standards set by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development.
   The study was financed by the National Association of Realtors.
The report said 7.7 million households are living in substandard
units and another 3.2 million are in overcrowded conditions.
   Under the HUD definition, a home is classified as substandard if
it does not have electricity, lacks adequate plumbing or lacks
sewage disposal.
   ``We are reminded daily of the homeless on our streets and
shelters. Less visible, but no better off, are those who live in
inadequate housing or who pay the majority of their incomes just to
stay off these streets,'' Nestor Weigand, president of the Realtors
association, said in presenting the study.
   The study estimated that it would cost $41 billion over the next
15 years to build or upgrade the 36 million units it estimated
would be needed to eliminate substandard housing in the United
States.
   The study also estimated it would take an additional $56 billion
in subsidy payments to insure that households were not paying more
than 30 percent of their income for housing.
   The study said this would break down to an increase of $6.5
billion annually over and above current government subsidy efforts.
   The study did not address the likelihood of getting such
additional funds through Congress at a time of budget constraints
imposed by the high federal deficits. The Reagan administration has
generally opposed any new housing initiatives and scaled back many
of the programs in existence when it came into office in 1981.
   The Realtors association study is the latest of several recent
reports which have looked into the country's housing needs. In
March, the National Housing Task Force issued a report recommending
a 12-year program with a goal of providing livable housing for all
Americans.
   The private task force recommended the program begin with an
initial appropriation of $3 billion to be used as seed money to
stimulate state and local efforts to develop and renovate
low-income housing.

<HEAD>House Adds More Arms Control Resolutions To Spending Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House says the United States ought to keep
at least 20 missile-firing submarines and NATO's non-nuclear forces
should be improved.
   Both proposals were approved Tuesday on voice votes as
non-binding amendments to the Pentagon budget bill now on the floor
of the Democratic-controlled chamber.
   The amendments affect a pair of U.S.-Soviet arms control efforts
_ the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks aimed at cutting each side's
long-range arsenals by 50 percent, and the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces pact eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles.
   Both superpowers have long-range arsenals of submarine-launched
missiles, bombers, and land-based missiles, with the submarines
considered to the least vulnerable to attack. The START treaty
would require major changes and restructuring of those stockpiles.
   More than half the U.S. strategic nuclear firepower is now
contained on 36 missile-firing submarines, which include 28 older
Poseidon-class subs and eight Ohio-class subs. Seven more Tridents
are under constructions and a 16th is part of the bill on the House
floor.
   While the future composition of the U.S. arsenal is
undetermined, it should include at least 20 subs, said the
amendment by Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.
   Solarz said the proposal is designed to ``insure that our
strategic nuclear submarine force is not jeopardized by the START
talks ... we must insure that we have the maximum number of these
submarines possible within the overall framework of the triad.''
   Also approved on a voice vote was an amendment by Rep. Jack
Buechner, R-Mo., urging President Reagan to upgrade conventional
forces in the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Reagan is already urging NATO to improve its non-nuclear forces,
which will assume greater importance in deterring a Warsaw Pact
attack when the American-built medium-range nuclear missiles are
removed.
   As it plowed through the bill, the House also approved, by close
margins, a pair of measures that give federal contractors more
leeway in setting pay scales.
   The first decision, by a 213-195 vote, approved an overhaul of
the Davis-Bacon Act. That is a 1931 law which directs that
employees covered by contracts on federal jobs worth more than
$2,000 be paid prevailing local wage rates, a figure set by the
Labor Department. The rates are usually those paid union employees.
   The proposal passed Tuesday raises the threshold figure from
$2,000 to $50,000.
   Moments later, the House voted 210-204 to reject an amendment
that would have raised the Davis-Bacon threshold even higher, to
$250,000.
   The law was passed during the Great Depression to assuage fears
that construction companies would hire cheap labor. Critics say the
measure has been overtaken by events and should be changed, but
defenders, including organized labor, call it a linchpin of
workers' protection.
   The votes generally split along party lines, with Democrats
backing the $50,000 threshold and Republicans supporting the
$250,000 threshold.
   In other votes Tuesday, the House:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Approved, on a voice vote, an amendment banning deployment of
any Coast Guard vessels to the Persian Gulf. The Pentagon has
already announced that the plan was scuttled in the face of stiff
congressional opposition and backers of the amendment had planned
to drop it as unnecessary. But a procedural snarl made it easier to
simply approve the amendment than to bypass it.
   _Gave voice vote approval to a ban on spending for the Bigeye
bomb, the problem-plagued chemical weapon. The bill provides no new
money for the bomb, which has run into a series of technical
problems.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Cleveland's
Republican Mayor, George Voinovich, predict that their showdown in
November in the U.S. Senate race will be one of the fiercest and
most expensive in state history.
   ``You mark my words, the most focused-on race in the United
States is going to be Metzenbaum-Voinovich, Voinovich said Tuesday
after Metzenbaum's primary victory.
   ``This will be a barn-burner. If Dukakis and Bush don't get them
out, Voinovich and Metzenbaum will,'' the mayor said.
   Metzenbaum agreed there was a tough battle ahead.
   ``There isn't a (political) hit list in America that doesn't
have me at the top of it. I must be doing something right in the
Senate if so many people want to beat me,'' he told reporters in
Cleveland.
   Metzenbaum, seeking a third term at age 70, easily survived a
primary challenge from Ralph Applegate, 56, who runs a small
lawn-care business in Columbus and did no active campaigning. With
96 percent of the vote counted, Metzenbaum had 1,043,624 votes, or
84 percent, to Applegate's 206,184, or 16 percent.
   Voinovich, 51, was unopposed for the GOP nomination.
   In the presidential primaries, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis easily outpolled Jesse Jackson and claimed most of the 159
Democratic delegates at stake. On the Republican side, George Bush
had no active opposition for 88 delegates.
   With 98 percent of the vote counted, Dukakis had 853,902 votes,
or 63 percent, compared with 373,497 votes, or 28 percent, for
Jackson. Six other counties split the rest of the vote.
   In the race for the state's 159 delegates, Dukakis was leading
for 115, while Jackson was ahead for 41.
   In the 5th Congressional District, Ohio Senate President Paul
Gillmor appeared to have won a razor-thin victory over the son of
the retiring incumbent, U.S. Rep. Delbert Latta, and a third
candidate. Final, unofficial returns showed Gillmor with 28,666
votes to 28,608 for Robert Latta. Rex Damschroder ran a distant
third.
   In the 20th District, Democratic Rep. Mary Rose Oakar easily
defeated former Cleveland Mayor Dennis Kucinich. With 99 percent of
the vote counted, Ms. Oakar had 64,143 votes, or 77 percent, to
19,454, or 23 percent, for Kucinich.
   Ms. Oakar said she was overwhelmed by the margin of victory.
Kucinich was in a joking mood.
   ``I hate to lose when it's close, but this one wasn't close, so
it's not that bad,'' he said. ``The (Cleveland) Indians had a bad
year last year. They came back.''
   In Cincinnati, voters narrowly approved a proposal to increase
the city's 2 percent earnings tax to 2.1 percent to raise money for
repairs of deteriorating streets and bridges. The Hamilton County
Board of Elections said the issue won 50.24 percent to 49.74
percent.
   Voinovich, a popular mayor for 8{ years, has claimed credit for
pulling Cleveland out of the default on bank loans that occurred
during Kucinich's stormy tenure.
   Voinovich has struggled to overcome what he concedes is
Metzenbaum's advantage in name recognition, and already has spent
more than $1 million, much of it on media ads.
   The Metzenbaum campaign has spent more than $800,000 since Jan.
1, and has a campaign warchest of more than $3 million for the fall
election.

<HEAD>Study Says Some Genetic Engineering Can Occur Without High Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small field tests of genetically engineered
organisms don't pose much risk to the environment, according to a
congressional study released today.
   ``Although there are enough uncertainties that introductions
should be approached with caution, a large body of reassuring data,
derived chiefly from agriculture, supports the conclusion that with
appropriate regulatory oversight, the field tests planned or
probable in the near future are not likely to result in serious
ecological problems,'' concluded the review by the Office of
Technology Assessment.
   The study said its conclusions applied to developments likely in
the next five years, mostly in agriculture and mostly to organisms
produced using the so-called ``recombinant'' techniques for
inserting genes of one species into the DNA _ the genetic material
_ of another.
   So far, there have been about two dozen field tests of one kind
or another in 12 states and four foreign countries, the study said.
These include plants engineered to resist pests, pesticides or
diseases; bacteria to confer on plants resistance to frost; and new
animal vaccines.
   Researchers are planning engineered microbes that can
concentrate metallic ores and digest toxic wastes.
   ``It is important to note that modifying organisms for specific
human ends is not new,'' the study said. ``Selective breeders of
plants and animals have been transferring genes for millennia,
often creating forms through centuries of selection that differ
from their original stocks more than the forms produced by
recombinant DNA methods.''
   In agriculture, a new crop strain or rotation probably could
ease or control damage, if any, from experiments gone awry, the
report said.
   ``In those rare circumstances of a negative impact on a natural
community, the consequence seems most likely to be a transitory
disturbance of plant or animal community structure,'' the study
said.
   The worst possibilities appear to be ``to disrupt a fundamental
ecosystem process,'' it said.
   The existence in ecosystems of many species performing the same
functions, and the resilience of ecosystems, ``are persuasive
arguments against the likelihood of such consequences,'' it said.
   Regulatory agencies soon should have enough experience to ``sort
planned introductions into broad categories for which low, medium
or high levels of review are appropriate,'' OTA said.
   ``Counter examples can be provided from existing experience to
negate almost any proposed category from review,'' but experience
is piling up so fast that the agencies might be able to ease
requirements in some cases even to the point of exemptions from
review, the report said.

<HEAD>US Has Record Trade Deficit With Communist Governments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States had a record trade deficit
last year with countries ruled by communist governments, the U.S.
International Trade Commission reports.
   Overall trade was also a record, with total exchanges in both
directions increasing to $13.8 billion from $11.7 billion in 1986.
But the United States bought $2.5 billion worth of goods more than
it sold, compared with 1.6 billion the previous year.
   The report, made available this week, details only the second
time since 1965 that the United States has had a deficit in trade
with these countries.
   The deficit would have been greater except for the U.S.
government subsidies on the sale of wheat, a major export to
communist nations. The Soviet Union, China, Poland and Bulgaria _
along with U.S. agricultural interests _ all benefited from these
subsidies.
   The Soviets agreed to buy 4 million metric tons, or about 144
million bushels, for delivery before Sept. 30, their first
purchases since October 1985. By the end of the year, they had
agreed to buy another 4.8 million tons, or about 174 million
bushels, for the following crop year. U.S. exports of wheat to the
Soviets were worth $389 million in 1987.
   U.S. subsidies on these sales varied from $19 to $40 a ton. They
were given to meet competition from other countries, largely in
western Europe, which also subsidized their exports.
   The commission, an independent U.S. government agency, said that
although the Soviets had a good overall grain crop last year, wheat
output declined by nearly 15 percent and much of what they produced
was not quality wheat.
   China bought 4 million tons. Sales of U.S. wheat to China were
worth $139 million in 1987.
   The growth of U.S. imports from communist governments was almost
entirely the result of increased buying from China. Over a third of
the U.S. puchases from China were clothes and other textiles for a
total value of $2.5 billion, up from $2.1 billion the year before.

<HEAD>Moving To Limit Establishment Of More Napa Wineries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time, there are high-level
moves in Napa Valley toward limiting establishment of new wineries
in the nation's top wine-producing region.
   The Napa County Board of Supervisors and the Napa Valley
Vintners Association believe the time may have come to put the
brakes on winery development in the valley north of San Francisco.
   Twenty years ago, the valley had 33 wineries; by 1978 the number
more than doubled, to 74. Today there are about 200 in the valley,
which is only 30 miles long by four miles wide.
   During those years, a Napa wine beat out the best wines of
France in a Paris blind tasting, establishing Napa wines as world
class.
   Since then, buyers from a dozen countries have been purchasing
Napa wineries, and uncounted vineyards up and down the state. Prime
Napa producing vineyard land sells for up to $42,000 an acre.
   ``We must preserve this place,'' said Robert A. Dwyer, executive
director of the vintners association, representing the most
successful U.S. wine producers. ``What's at stake is the quality of
life here.''
   With the growing success of Napa wines, land prices rose, but
that didn't stop buyers. Sapporo brewers of Japan recently paid
more than $35,000 an acre to Abbott Vineyards for producing land in
the prized Carneros area.
   Another section of producing vineyards went to Domaine Mumm of
France for $42,000 an acre. Bare land _ it takes four years for a
new vine to produce mature grapes _ goes for $20,000-$22,000 an
acre. Still, it's a seller's market.
   The mark of Napa Valley is magic. Cabernet sauvignon grapes from
the valley can get a 25 percent higher tonnage price than grapes
grown elsewhere and which might even be of higher quality.
   In mid-March, the vintners' association voted to submit a
proposal to the county Planning Commission barring further winery
construction in Napa County's designated agricultural watershed
districts _ 85 percent of the county.
   The association also wants a winery production zone to
``grandfather'' all the existing wineries in the county. The issue
is to go before the commission in mid-June.
   Dwyer, who spoke of a valley whose traditions go back to 1838,
said the theory is ``to give legitimacy to the wineries that are
here. Anybody who wanted to rezone agricultural preserve land ...
would have to jump through some pretty restrictive hoops.''
   The action came on a note of alarm. The vintners, some of whose
vineyards were planted 125 years ago, had noticed that the Planning
Commission over 18 months had received applications for use permits
for 40 prospective wineries.
   Within two weeks a record 27 applications were received for new
wineries.
   ``We usually get only two, maybe three, applications a month,''
planning director Jim Hickey said.
   ``I think we're reaching the limit, and they (supervisors) want
to examine the density issue,'' he said. ``That has never come up
before. The board wants the department to look into the question,
how many wineries (should be) in a given geographical area. What
would be the criteria?''

<HEAD>Bush Sets Off On Another Campaign Swing Even Though Nomination
Locked Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush was heading West
today after celebrating his lock on the Republican presidential
nomination as a ``first step, a tremendously important step.''
   Bush backers threw an ``Over The Top'' party for him Tuesday
night at a Washington hotel a few blocks from the White House. The
vice president actually secured the 1,139 delegates needed for the
nomination a week earlier, in the Pennsylvania primary.
   Bush was making a three-day campaign trip through California,
Montana and Idaho. Aides said the trip was important to Bush's
effort to position himself for the fall campaign, and to keep his
workers energized.
   At Tuesday night's celebration, which came as Bush rolled up a
trio of primary wins in Ohio, Pennsylvania and the District of
Columbia, the vice president rejoiced in his success, but told
campaign aides and volunteers: ``Now we've got a long way to go.''
   A son, George Bush Jr., had more direct advice: ``Sometimes a
son can say things a father can't. We want you to go out there and
kick some Mike Dukakis, and kick him hard.''
   The reference to the Democratic front-runner by the younger Bush
recalled Bush's off-color remarks to New Jersey longshoremen in
1984 following his debate with Democratic vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Bush Jr. told the rally: ``Our dad needs a real job.''
   Bush himself said his mathematical lock on the nomination last
week ``wrapped this thing up sooner than I think any of us thought
might take place.''
   ``It all boiled down to working together,'' he said. ``And yet I
don't feel any finality to what has happened now at all.''
   The vice president said his lock on the nomination was ``a first
step, a tremendously important step'' but he cautioned against
complacency.
   Still, Bush declared to rousing cheers, ``the party is united.''
   ``Let Mike Dukakis go around here talking about pink slips,
despair, pessimism in the United Stats,'' he said. ``I'll be the
guy out there talking about hope and opportunity and challenge.''
   Republican Party Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf told the gathering:
``Tonight we officially celebrate the fact that George Bush will be
our nominee following the convention in New Orleans.''
   Bush planned campaign stops in Sacramento and Los Angeles today.
On Thursday, he was to visit a high school in East Los Angeles and
attend a GOP barbecue near Boise, Idaho.
   On Friday, he campaigns in Montana and Nebraska.
   ``I think that the importance of the West is evident,'' said
campaign spokesman Peter Teeley. ``California ...is extraordinarily
important to the November outcome. As a result, we have to get out
there and begin to build a base of support.''
   Bush planned three separate trips to California and other
Western states between now and the June 7 California primary.
   ``We can't ignore the West,'' Teeley said. ``We've got
organizations in place and people on the ground that have been
working for us. You've got to keep those troops energized.''
   Bush campaigned on Tuesday in West Virginia.

<HEAD>Setttlers Say Anti-Guerrilla Operation Gives Only Temporary Relief</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KIBBUTZ KFAR SZOLD, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish settlers in Israel's
embattled northern border cheered the army's incursion into
southern Lebanon but said the operation would provide only
temporary relief from Arab guerrilla attacks.
   ``If the Lebanon war didn't do the job, this operation certainly
won't,'' said Moni Levy, 34, secretary of this communal farm about
two miles south of the border. Levy was referring to the 1982
Israeli invasion of Lebanon that led to a three-year occupation.
   Israeli troops on Monday night launched their largest operation
in Lebanon in two years, moving north of Israel's self-designated
``security zone'' to search for Arab guerrillas.
   The incursion followed a week in which Palestinian guerrillas
twice penetrated Israel's northern border, illing two Israeli
soldiers. Five guerrillas also were killed.
   Since then, residents say, life in northern border settlements
has become more tense.
   ``Fewer people leave their homes at night. They jump at every
little sound,'' said Amos Or, secretary of Kibbutz Dafna, another
communal farm about one mile from the border.
   Or said his children had taken to playing ``soldiers and
guerrillas'' after last week's raids.
   ``They put rags on their heads and pretended they were
guerrillas on a hostage-taking mission,'' he said.
   When the alert was sounded last week indicating a possible
guerrilla infiltration, residents of the communal farms went into a
practiced routine they have come to know all too well over the
years.
   Women locked themselves into their small, one-story homes with
the children for a nerve-wracking vigil until the guerrillas were
caught.
   The men grabbed weapons they keep in their homes and headed for
fences or watchtowers to guard their settlement.
   Kibbutzniks, as residents are called, have learned important
lessons from past guerrilla attacks.
   They remember vividly the night of Nov. 25, 1987 when a lone
Palestinian guerrilla landed a hang glider inside the border, made
his way to an army post and killed six soldiers before being shot
to death.
   ``During that night, we learned how hard it was for the women in
the houses to stay alone without knowing what was going on,'' Levy
said. Since then, he said, the kibbutz has set up a hot line
staffed by volunteers and a social worker who people can call when
a real alert is on.
   Levy described elaborate exercises held jointly with the army
every few months, in which a hostage-taking operation is staged at
Kfar Szold.
   ``Every few months the army takes a house, shoots a little bit
in the air, then takes a few hostages here,'' Levy said.
   He said each kibbutz in the region had prepared for the worst by
training a team of Arabic-speaking residents to negotiate with
guerrillas, in case a hostage situation developed before the army
arrived.
   In other exercises, kibbutzniks practice storming a guerrilla
outpost in an area outside the settlement, Levy said.
   Similar training exercises have become a part of life in
Metulla, a border town of 1,500 overlooking the hills of southern
Lebanon.
   ``Everybody under 65 years of age has a job,'' said Bialik
Belski, owner of the town's Arazim hotel. He said tasks range from
transporting the elderly into shelters to standing guard at the
edge of town.
   Yossi Goldberg, head of Metulla's city council, commended the
army's defense of the northern settlements. But he complained the
government had not fulfilled its obligations to the town, where
``50 percent of our problems are security-related.''
   Goldberg said Metulla badly needs a medical clinic, because the
nearest hospital is an hour's drive away, in the northern town of
Zefat. He said Metulla had been promised more psychologists to help
residents deal with fears of attack, but none had been provided.
   ``The government has made a lot of promises it hasn't kept,''
Goldberg said. ``We expect the government to take care of its
citizens.''
   When the army launched its search operation Monday night,
residents in Kibbutz Kfar Szold were relieved.
   ``It can only help if they clean up the place once in a while,''
Levy said. ``I hope it will do something.''
   Along with sighs of relief came skepticism that the operation
would have any long-term impact.
   ``There will be a deterrent effect for some time, but then ...
the guerrilla activity will just increase again,'' Or said.
   ``There is no alternative to going in after the guerrillas,''
Belski said. ``But they will come back. Every minister in the
government knows that.''

   More beer and fewer pork chops are what the
future holds for the average Chinese, the Department of Agriculture
predicts.
   ``During the 1980s, China's beer production increased more than
sevenfold and is expected to have reached 5 billion liters in
1987,'' says David Schoonover, the agricultural counselor at the
U.S. embassy in Beijing.
   ``The goal for the current five-year plan likely will be
fulfilled in 1988, two years early.''
   That figure still allows only a modest gallon or so a year for
the average Chinese, because the country's population is now well
over 1 billion. A liter is slightly larger than a quart.
   That gallon average compares with more than 38 gallons a year
for the average West German and 24 gallons for each man, woman and
child in the United States, according to the latest figures
available from the U.S. Beer Institute.
   When it comes to pork _ the main source of meat for the Chinese
_ the prospect is for a shortage, Schoonover finds.
   His brief report is quoted in the May edition of the
department's ``Foreign Agriculture.''
   It says supplies of pork in China are already short, but gives
no figures on consumption. Over 90 percent of Chinese pigs live
with only one to three other pigs on small family farms, he
calculates. He says it is now being proposed that production be
turned over more to larger units that can take advantage of
economies of scale.
   In economies run by Communist governments, the small plots
permitted to private farmers are generally much more productive
than larger state farms.
   From the U.S. farmers' viewpoint, what pigs and beer have in
common is that both are products of grain, a major U.S. export.
   ``The new policy of concentrating pig production on large state
farms, cooperatives and in `specialized households' is likely to
encourage greater imports of feed grains,'' Schoonover wrote.
   ``Currently, the diets of 90 percent of China's hogs are
comprised mostly of slop,'' he wrote.
   He reports that China's home-grown barley is not up to the
standard required by brewers. He says in 1986, China imported
200,000 to 300,000 metric tons of malting barley, with Canada the
main source of supply.
   He also implies that China may need to import hops, the other
main ingredient of beer. He says the country grows enough hops fr
its own needs in most years and even exports some, depending on the
weather, but adds it does not have the equipment to prepare and
store the crop in surplus years.

<HEAD>GOP Candidate's Wife Decries His `Party Animal' Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican gubernatorial candidate John
Raese's wife says she's tired of seeing her millionaire husband
portrayed as a hot-headed ``party animal'' and calls him a ``man's
man.''
   Liz Raese says her husband is sometimes an impulsive figure who
can be aloof but he gets hot under the collar when he's called
immature.
   ``Sure, John loves fast cars and fast boats. When he gets
stressed out, that's his release,'' Mrs. Raese said in an interview
published in Tuesday's Charleston Daily Mail.
   ``In fact, we have our best love affairs in the middle of the
ocean. There is solitude out there. You're alone.
   ``The press makes an issue about his cigarette boat and portrays
him as a party animal,'' Mrs. Raese said. ``We've always had boats.
The cigarette boat is used as much for fishing as racing. We're
like a lot of people _ we like to fish.''
   Raese is challenging Gov. Arch Moore for the GOP gubernatorial
nomination in next Tuesday's primary. Two years ago, he bucked
Moore and won the state GOP chairmanship, which he resigned earlier
this year in a party dispute, and their relationship remains bitter.
   ``They give John two minutes to speak at most of those Lincoln
Day events, then Governor Moore talks for 20 minutes,'' Mrs. Raese
said. ``He calls John immature and I sit there and watch John's
face get flushed. His temper builds and I keep whispering, `Relax,
honey, don't let him get to you.'''
   The 38-year-old Morgantown millionaire owns steel, coal,
limestone and media companies. But his wife said he is awkward, shy
and searching for a secure family life that eluded him while
growing up.
   ``I have seen him grow tremendously in the 10 years we have been
married,'' said Mrs. Raese, 31. ``I like to mother him. I'll come
up behind him and put my arms around him and squeeze tightly. He
says he doesn't want to be mothered and then his face gets flushed.
   ``He's a man's man. There is no women's lib in our house. I lean
on him. He's the man of our house,'' she said.
   Mrs. Raese said her husband is running for governor because he
wants to ``give something back'' to West Virginia.
   ``I say to him, `Why do you want this job? Our life was so good
before, so easy.' And he says, `Liz, how many suits can we buy? How
many planes can we fly? How many parties can we attend? There must
be something more to life than this.'''

   Here are President and Nancy Reagan's
horoscopes for today, as printed in the syndicated Sydney Omarr
column appearing in The Washington Post. The president's birthday
is Feb. 6, 1911, and the first lady's is July 6, 1923.
   
   AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Despite obstacles, you turn in
outstanding performance. Focus on independence, creativity, special
appeal. Restrictions are lifted, enabling you to make new start in
``different'' direction.
   
   CANCER (June 21-July 22): Diversify, communicate with one who
talked about entertainment and travel. You'll be able to learn
about a ``secret source'' of income. Mystery is solved and you
benefit from the solution. Sagittarian is in picture.

<HEAD>Exit Polls Indicate Relatively Free Rein for Dukakis on Veep</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Primaries Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic voters in Ohio and Indiana gave Gov.
Michael Dukakis good news on two fronts: broad support as their
presidential nominee and a relatively free rein to pick a vice
presidential running mate.
   Overall, ``The signs don't look bad for November'' for Dukakis
if he wins the presidential nomination, said ABC News poll analyst
Doug Muzzio.
   ``He does well in the horse race against Bush,'' Muzzio said.
``He brings the Reagan Democrats back home. And while he's not
winning the black vote, he shows the ability to get it in the
general election.''
   If there was a downside to Dukakis' landslides in Tuesday's
primaries, it was that a plurality of his Ohio voters had
reservations about the Massachusetts governor, and sizable shares
of voters were unfamiliar with his ideology.
   Dukakis had limited success drawing black voters from Jesse
Jackson, who has enjoyed massive black support. Dukakis won 12
percent of the black vote in Indiana, but only 4 percent in Ohio,
CBS News-New York Times polls said.
   Nonetheless, about 60 percent of Jackson's supporters said they
would vote for Dukakis if he were the nominee against George Bush,
ABC's exit poll said. A third said they would not vote, but the
turnout of black Democrats in past elections indicates otherwise,
Muzzio said.
   One issue for the Democrats is whether Jackson's voters would
accept a ticket that did not include him at least as the vice
presidential nominee, and the ABC poll indicated many would, Muzzio
said.
   While 80 percent of Jackson's voters said they wanted him to be
the vice presidential nominee if Dukakis wins, majorities _ 57
percent in Ohio and 63 percent in Indiana _ said the ultimate
choice should be up to the winner.
   Even greater shares of the Dukakis voters, more than 80 percent,
said the nomination winner should pick his own running mate rather
than being bound to choose the second-place finisher. The finding
jibed with high unfavorable ratings of Jackson among Dukakis
supporters.
   When ABC asked voters if they favored Jackson, Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. or someone else to run for vice president with Dukakis, only
about 15 percent of the Democrats in both states chose Jackson.
Just over 30 percent took Gore and pluralities, about 40 percent,
said someone else.
   In the CBS-Times poll, about 60 percent of Dukakis supporters
said Jackson should not be offered the vice presidential
nomination, and only as many said they would vote for Dukakis in
the fall if Jackson ran with him.
   Without a running mate specified, 77 percent of the Democrats
said they would vote for Dukakis over Bush in November, with 10
percent for Bush and 9 percent saying they wouldn't vote, the
CBS-Times polls said.
   Among the Dukakis backers Tuesday were sizable numbers of
Democrats who voted for President Reagan in 1984, the ABC polls
said. Seventeen percent of the Democrats in Indiana and 16 percent
in Ohio said they backed Reagan in 1984; two-thirds of them in Ohio
and 81 percent in Indiana said they would support Dukakis over Bush
in November.
   ``It indicates they're coming home, in one sense,'' said Muzzio.
``Not only does Dukakis win landslide wins in Ohio and Indiana, but
in the numbers he can see some not bad news for November.''
   One less positive sign for Dukakis was in the strength of his
support in Ohio, where a plurality of his voters, 45 percent, said
in the CBS-Times poll that they backed him with reservations, to 41
percent who supported him strongly. In Indiana, however, 51 percent
of Dukakis' support was strong.
   Also, while 45 percent of Democrats in Ohio and 53 percent in
Indiana said Dukakis was ``just about right'' ideologically as
opposed to too liberal or too conservative, considerable numbers _
34 percent in Ohio and 28 percent in Indiana _ said they didn't
know.
   ``Dukakis is still somewhat of an unknown ideologically,'' said
Muzzio. ``A lot of people still don't have a handle on him, this
late in the primary season.''
   The polls had margins of sampling error of 3 points.

<HEAD>Dukakis Won't Claim Nomination, But Says He's Now Tough To Beat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis edged a bit closer to laying claim
to the Democratic presidential nomination with a pair of landslide
primary victories in Ohio and Indiana.
   Asked Tuesday night whether he thought Democratic rival Jesse
Jackson could take the lead away from him now, Dukakis said: ``It's
going to be difficult.''
   Even so, the Massachusetts governor vowed to campaign
aggressively in the remaining primary states. He said he hoped to
lock up enough delegates to win the nomination, and to broaden his
exposure for a likely fall campaign against Vice President George
Bush.
   ``I want people to get to know me more and more and the way to
do that is to go out and campaign hard,'' said Dukakis.
   Dukakis was spending a day at the Statehouse today and attending
a fund-raiser in New Jersey and a Democratic Party dinner in New
York City tonight.
   Asked if his primary wins on Tuesday night and in recent weeks
were a trend that Jackson should take note of, he said: ``I hope
so.'' Jackson scored a victory in Tuesday's District of Columbia
primary, however.
   ``I feel great about today and the results today,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis, who has come under increasing criticism from Jackson
lately, refused to say whether he thought Jackson should tone town
the rhetoric.
   ``He's going to have to make that judgment,'' Dukakis said.
``I'm going to try to keep this as positive as I can.''
   Dukakis was campaigning Thursday in West Virginia and Nebraska.
Both states hold primaries next Tuesday.
   The governor was in a jovial mood following his two primary
victories, joking about the White House admission that Nancy Reagan
sometimes seeks the advice of an astrologist before setting the
president's schedule.
   ``I hope that the nation's decisions beginning in January 1989
will be based on something other than horoscopes,'' he said.
   Later, he referred to Reagan's pending endorsement of Bush as
the ``astrological endorsement.''

<TEXT>
   Thomas Magnum rescued a girlfriend, got his
personal life in order, rejoined the Navy, confronted Higgins over
the identity of Robin Masters, attended a wedding and gave CBS a
much-needed ratings boost. All in two hours.
   The episode of ``Magnum P.I.'' broadcast Sunday brought the
8-year-old, Hawaiian-based detective show starring Tom Selleck to
an end.
   The show was first in last week's A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings. It
gave CBS its first weekly uncontested claim on first place for the
season, after a tie with NBC for the week ended April 10.
   Its 32.0 rating was the 14th highest-rated made-for-TV movie
ever.
   By comparison, the first chapter of the ABC miniseries ``The
Richest Man in the World: The Story of Aristotle Onassis'' came in
37th for the week that ended Sunday and the NBC movie ``Mad Max:
Beyond Thunderdome'' finished 57th.
   It was an especially sweet victory for CBS, which ended the
season in last place for its first time in its history. The network
was in last place the previous week.
   Last week's second-highest rated show, NBC's ``Cheers,'' was
more than eight points behind, with 23.6. A rating point measures
the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million TV homes.
   An original episode of ``Murder, She Wrote'' came in fifth and
helped CBS win the week.
   ``It goes to show what a couple of hit shows can do for you,''
said Arnold Becker, a CBS vice president. ``They can put you back
on top.''
   The movie special allowed Magnum to get his personal life in
order, find the daughter he thought had been killed and quit his
job as head of security for millionaire author Robin Masters to
return to the Navy as a commander.
   Magnum also confronted Jonathan Higgins, played by John
Hillerman, over his suspicion that Higgins was really Robin
Masters. Higgins at first admitted that he was Masters. But as the
show ended he smirked at fooling Magnum and confessed he had been
lying.
   CBS was first for the week with a rating of 13.9; NBC had 13.4
and ABC 12.1.
   In the May sweeps, CBS took an early lead. The Arbitrons, from
April 27 to May 1, CBS 14.9, NBC 13.7, ABC 10.1. The Nielsens, from
April 28-May 1, CBS 15.8, NBC 13.8, ABC 9.0. The sweeps are periods
in which the audiences of local television stations are measured to
set their advertising rates.
   According to Nielsen, last week's top 10 shows were: CBS Sunday
Movie ``Magnum, P.I.'' NBC's ``Cheers,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show,''
NBC's ``A Different World,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' NBC's
``Golden Girls,'' ABC's ``Just the 10 of Us,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,''
ABC movie ``Little Girl Lost,'' and ABC ``Growing Pains'' special.
   The ``Growing Pains'' special was the opening for the new spring
series ``Just the 10 of Us.'' ``Little Girl Lost'' was ABC's
highest-rated movie of the year.
   Three shows on the Fox Broadcasting Co. network got better
ratings than some of the network shows. ``America's Most Wanted''
came in ahead of ``Houston Knights.'' Fox's ``Married With
Children'' and ``21 Jump Street'' came in ahead of ``Max Headroom.''
   ABC was first among the evening news shows, moving ahead of CBS,
while NBC stayed in third place. The ratings: ABC 10.4, CBS 9.6,
NBC 8.6.

<HEAD>Jackson Scores Overwhelming Win In District Of Columbia Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson scored his first primary victory
in six weeks in the District of Columbia, telling cheering
supporters: ``We're making America better every day.''
   Jackson brushed aside primary losses Tuesday night in Indiana
and Ohio, telling backers he would keep his campaign going until
the end of the primary season.
   ``All the way to California and New Jersey!'' he said at a
victory party at a Washington hotel. ``We keep on winning.''
   In final, unofficial returns in the district, Jackson had 67,812
votes, or 80.2 percent, compared with 14,969, or 17.7 percent, for
Massachussetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Paul Simon, who has suspended his campaign, collected 750 votes,
or 0.9 percent.
   Early returns showed Jackson winning in all but one of the
city's eight wards, the predominantly white Ward 3, where Dukakis
had a sizable lead. The city is 67 percent black.
   As a result of Tuesday's voting, Jackson netted 13 delegates, to
three for Dukakis.
   Among the Republicans, Vice President George Bush, who already
has a numerical lock on the GOP nomination, got 5,620 votes or 88.8
percent, followed by Sen. Bob Dole with 445 votes, 7 percent; and
Pat Robertson with 262 votes, 4.1 percent.
   Dole has dropped out of the race, and Robertson technically
remains a candidate although he has only 31 delegate.
   Jackson hadn't won a primary since March 20 in Puerto Rico.
   He had been expected to win by a landslide in Washington, but
the voter turnout was disappointingly low. Elections officials said
91,949 voters went to the polls, about 40 percent of those eligible
to participate in the primary.
   In the 1984 primary, 112,412 people voted.
   Four years ago, Jackson won all but three of the delegates on
the primary ballot. The only other primary he won was Louisiana.
This year Jackson has won primary elections in Georgia, Alabama,

   A train hit a bus at a crossing near
Colombo today, and police said at least 35 people on the bus were
injured.
   Five of the victims were reported in critical condition, said
police inspector Slavian Mitchell.
   He said the driver of the state-owned bus ignored a red light
and warning bell and tried to beat the train at an unprotected
railway crossing at Narahenpita, four miles outside Colombo.
   ``The driver saw the approaching train and thought he could make
it but did not,'' Mitchell said. Most of the victims were
schoolchildren and office workers, he said. No one on the train was

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illegal aliens who left the country
briefly without permission from immigration officials may be
eligible for an extension of today's amnesty deadline, a federal
judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton on Tuesday declared
invalid a rule that made aliens ineligible for legalization if they
left the United States since November 1986.
   Karlton scheduled a Thursday hearing on a motion to force the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to extend the amnesty
deadline through the end of November 1988 for those affected.
   Aliens who were discouraged from applying because of the rule
would then have an opportunity to gain citizenship, said Ralph
Abascal, an attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance.
   Abascal said late Tuesday that 50,000 to 100,000 illegal aliens
could be affected by Karlton's order, which found the INS had
failed to carry out the intended meaning of the Immigration Reform
and Control Act.
   Thomas Laughlin, chief of the INS' Legalization Office in
Sacramento, said he had not seen the ruling.
   ``I'm not sure how it will affect us or who will be eligible,''
he said.
   The Immigration Reform Act granted amnesty to illegal aliens who
have lived in the United States continuously since Jan. 1, 1982.
The deadline to apply is midnight tonight.
   A Nov. 30 deadline has been set for undocumented farm workers
who have picked perishable crops for at least 90 days in recent
years.
   Karlton's ruling was prompted by a lawsuit by Catholic Social
Services, the rural legal assistance organization and other
immigrant-rights groups. The suit challenged the INS interpretation
of what Congress meant by the phrase ``brief, casual and innocent''
departures.
   That phrase was used to describe those brief trips out of the
United States by illegal aliens that would not break the continuous
residency requirement spelled out in the law.
   INS regulations interpreted ``brief, casual and innocent'' trips
as a departure of not more than 30 days for legitimate emergency or
humanitarian purposes. No trips could be made without INS
permission, it said.
   Abascal said many illegal aliens had gotten terse messages such
as, ```Your father is dying,' and they run across the border.''
   Upon returning, they are afraid they have lost their eligibility
for amnesty and fail to apply, he said. Still others were told
flatly that they didn't qualify for amnesty.
   In a separate order issued earlier in the class action lawsuit,
Karlton said it ``is this court's view that the statute requires a
case-by-case determination of whether an absence is `brief, casual
and innocent.'''
   Karlton said Tuesday his order applies to all obviously eligible
people who departed and re-entered the United States since Nov. 6,
1986 _ the date the immigration reform legislation took effect.
   In his 24-page ruling, Karlton concluded that Congress did not
intend the ``brief, casual and innocent'' absence exceptions to
apply only to absences authorized by the INS, the agency's
interpretation.
   Other sections of the reform act, Karlton said, ``reflect
congressional recognition that the legalization program might fail
because of the illegal alien's natural fear'' of the INS.

<HEAD>Carson Says `Tonight Show' Will End Reruns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Johnny Carson said he will write his
own material for ``The Tonight Show'' and end its reruns next week
because he saw no chance for a quick end to the 2-month-old
scriptwriters strike.
   Carson said he will write his opening monologue and
introductions when the show resumes on videotape next Wednesday. No
striking writers will be used, he said.
   Cheryl Rhoden, a spokeswoman for the striking Writers Guild of
America, said Carson is not a union member and writing his own
material would not be a strike violation.
   ``The Tonight Show'' went into reruns when the guild struck the
motion picture and television industry on March 7.
   ``We have been negotiating in good faith with the Writers Guild
of America for the past 10 weeks and it appears we have exhausted
every possibility of reeaching an agreement even though countless
attempts were made,'' Carson said.
   ``There are numerous `Tonight Show' staff members, many have
been with us for over 20 years, who are in danger of losing their
jobs if this strike goes on much longer,'' Carson said. ``I can't
let that happen. I also can't turn my back on the `Tonight Show'
audience, who've remained loyal these past 25 years. It's time to
go back to work.''
   Ms. Rhoden said Carson's company had met with the guild six
times since March 23, with the last formal session on April 28.
   Carson Tonight Inc., Carson's production company, has been
rebuffed in efforts to either get a waiver from the guild or reach
an independent agreement that would permit his writers to resume
work.
   ``Carson Tonight Inc. was informed one week ago by WGA
negotiators that no independent contracts would be ratified until
at least 10 percent of the 9,000-plus membership had been offered
employment by independent production companies,'' said Carson's
attorney, Ed Hookstratten.
   The attorney said that information came after Carson ``had
agreed to almost 100 percent of the union's contract conditions.''
   The guild has approved only two independent contracts so far,
with the ``New Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and Ivan Reitman
Productions, makers of the movie ``Ghostbusters.''
   The main issues in the strike are payment for foreign broadcasts
and reruns and the writers' degree of creative control they have
over their work. There have been no formal negotiations since
mediated talks broke off March 10.

<HEAD>Banks To Reopen Next Week For Limited Withdrawals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks that closed two months ago
following the imposition of U.S. economic sanctions will open on
Monday, but there will be limits on the amount of money customers
can withdraw.
   The announcement was made Tuesday by the president of the
Banking Association, Edgardo Lasso. The association represents 93
of the 117 banks operating in Panama, most of them foreign.
   Political instability brought on by the attempts of Washington
and local opposition leaders to oust Panama's strongman, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, has crippled the nation's once-bustling
economy.
   ``We are trying to reactivate the economy,'' Lasso said in a
television interview. But, to prevent a run on accounts, withdrawal
amounts will be restricted as specified by the government's Banking
Commission, he said.
   Also Tuesday, the Roman Catholic Church said it was withdrawing
as mediator in the conflict over Noriega until the civilian
government stops criticizing it publicly. Noriega, head of the
15,000-member Defense Forces, is the power behind the civilian
government in Panama.
   Conditions for reopening the banks limit withdrawals to 25
percent of checking account balances as of March 3, the day the
government closed the banks. A maximum of $10,000 may be withdrawn.
   Withdrawals of up to $50 may be made from savings accounts one
month after banks reopen, while payment of interest is restricted
and subject to cash availability in each bank.
   The Banking Commission has promoted a gradual reopening of the
banks.
   On April 18, it let them begin accepting deposits. But because
of limits on withdrawals, about 75 percent of the checks deposited
bounced, analysts and business people said.
   A week later, about a dozen additional services were resumed,
including handling letters of credit; collecting outstanding loans;
transferring funds within Panama, and making foreign exchange
transfers.
   But business people said the operations were largely on paper
and did little to help resolve their problems of liquidity and
credit.
   Both the March 3 closing and the reopening applied to the 67
banks holding licenses to conduct both local and international
banking business. Others also closed their doors because of the
impact of the crisis.
   Some banks had closed even earlier, after Noriega ousted
President Eric Arturo Delvalle Feb. 26 following the president's
attempt to fire the general.
   A statement from the Catholic church on Tuesday accused the
government of attacking it and Archbishop Marcos Gregorio McGrath.
   ``Since the attacks have proliferated in government news media,
we assume the government rejects the mediation of the church,'' it
said.
   The church had offered to negotiate a way for Noriega to step
down, but the opposition demanded his departure as a condition for
talks.
   The government refused and the church suspended the effort a
week after accepting the role at the end of March.
   The church has held the government responsible for the crisis,
but also blamed the ``economic domination of foreign powers and ...
the corruption in the public and private sectors.''
   Noriega is under federal indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges, which he denies.
   After the indictments were issued in February, the Reagan
administration imposed economic sanctions in an effort to pressure
the general to leave.
   Washington froze Panamanian assets in the United States and told
U.S. citizens and companies to stop making payments to the
Panamanian government, except for bills relating to utilities and
services such as garbage collection.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle, who is in hiding,
as Panama's chief executive.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci,
anticipating Congress will pass legislation making it easier to
close unneeded military bases, has set up established a bipartisan
commission to select likely facilities.
   He named Former Sen. Abe Ribicoff, D-Conn., and former Rep. Jack
Edwards, R-Ala., as co-chairman of the commission.
   ``Some have suggested that this may be an exercise in
futility,'' Carlucci wrote on Tuesday in a memo to the service
secretaries and Joint Chiefs of Staff, referring to past efforts to
close military bases.
   ``To the contrary, I am convinced that the commission's efforts
can be fruitful in developing a process and criteria for closing or
realigning bases and proposing candidates by the end of the year.''
   Congress has prevented the Pentagon from closing unneeded
military bases for more than a decade, with individual members
always stepping in to protect facilities in their district.
   Under a plan proposed by Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, however,
Congress would approve shutdowns before the doomed bases are
actually named.

   A U.S. official is urging Soviet Jews wishing

   Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights

the situation changes.
   Schifter told the National Conference on Soviet Jewry he
believed a huge percentage of the Soviet Union's two million Jews
would emigrate if given the chance. He said most have not applied,
however, believing they would be subject to discrimination in
employment and other opportunities during the long _ often unending
_ period while waiting for approval.
   But, he said, ``A good many of them also are not fully aware
today of what the possibilities are: that you can indeed fill out
the forms, get them filed and there's a chance within six weeks or

<HEAD>Subcommittee Charges Illegal Sale Of Korean-Made M-16 Rifles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional panel is charging a South
Korean company with selling American-designed M-16 rifles to at
least one foreign nation in violation of a 17-year-old agreement
between the United States and South Korea.
   The 1971 pact allowed M-16s to be manufactured in South Korea,
but prohibited sales to third countries without U.S. approval. It
also set a production cap.
   The plant was built by Colt Industries Firearms Division of
Hartford, Conn., the maker of the Army rifle, and run by the South
Korean government. But the South Korean Defense Ministry
transferred the operation and ownership to a private company,
Daewoo Precision Industries, in 1982.
   Following the transfer, Colt began reporting to U.S. officials
suspicions that the Korean company was exceeding the production
cap, according to Warren Nelson, a House Armed Services Committee
aide.
   Later, U.S. government investigators uncovered ``solid''
evidence of unauthorized sales to one country and ``hints'' of
sales to other nations, Nelson said. The names of the countries are
classified, he said.

<HEAD>First Lawsuit Filed On Aloha Airlines Mishap</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An injured passenger and his wife filed the
first lawsuit in connection with last week's accident in which an
Aloha Airlines 737 jetliner ripped open at 24,000 feet, killing one
person and injuring 61.
   Tuesday's state Circuit Court lawsuit by James A. Toyooka
alleges that negligence by Boeing Aircraft Co. and Aloha Airlines
caused Thursday's accident involving a 19-year-old Boeing 737.
   Toyooka of Honolulu was struck by aircraft parts and debris as a
result of the rapid depressurization of the airplane and the high
speeds of the air flow when a 20-foot section of fuselage popped
off, said the lawsuit, which does not specify the amount of damages
sought.
   ``He also experienced prolonged oxygen deprivation, extreme cold
and high winds thereby causing him severe and painful injuries to
his face, head and other portions of his body as well as shock,
great pain of body and mind and permanent injury,'' the lawsuit
says.
   His wife, Gail H. Toyooka, although not a passenger on Flight
243, suffered mental anguish and emotional distress, according to
the lawsuit.
   Aloha issued a statement saying it regreted the legal action,
but held no animosity against Toyooka.
   The was no answer early today at Boeing headquarters in Seattle.
   The lawfirm of Cronin, Fried, Sekiya, Kekina & Fairbanks,
representing the Toyookas, issued a statement saying the
``complaint speaks for itself.''
   ``The attorneys feel that no constructive purpose is served by
further discussion of the lawsuit itself,'' the statement said.
   Also Tuesday, three surviving flight attendants issued a
statement thanking the passengers as ``the unsung heros of our
flight.''
   ``A lot of attention has been focused on our efforts, and the
valiant efforts of the pilots, but we would also like to thank the
passengers who helped keep us on the aircraft,'' said the statement
by Jane Sato-Tomita, Amy Jones-Brown and Michelle Honda.
   A flight attendant, Clarabelle ``C.B.'' Lansing, was swept out
of the aircraft to her death.
   The three flight attendants also expressed hope for a speedy
recovery for the seven pasengers still in the hospital.
   ``We have not talked to the press, and will not be doing so in
the near future,'' they said.

   Some modern-day Pony Express riders will get
a chance to live out a legend Saturday when they make a dash for a
doughnut.
   More than 60 riders will celebrate Scotts Bluff County's
centennial by retracing the Pony Express route of the 1860s from
McGrew to Henry.
   The 43-mile ride will include a doughnut derby as each rider
gets a chance to spear a pastry ring with a finger.
   Legend has it that a young woman sweet on one of the dashing
riders discovered that a doughnut could catch a rushing rider's
finger _ and his fancy, said Virgnia Cassells of Scottsbluff, who
organized the doughnut dash.
   ``This rider was quite a ladies' man,'' Ms. Cassells said. ``All
the ladies were really interested in him and tried to give him
cookies and cakes. But he couldn't get those.''
   A Scottsbluff bakery has come up with a special doughnut for
Saturday's dash.
   ``No glaze, no frosting, no jelly,'' Ms. Cassells said. ``It
probably won't taste as good, but they can catch it better and it
won't be as messy.''

   Oscar-winning actress Cher has sued The
National Enquirer for $15 million, saying a report that she
chastised comedian Eddie Murphy at last month's Academy Awards was
``a complete falsehood.''
   According to Tuesday's U.S. District Court lawsuit, the Enquirer
reported last month that Cher, who received the best actress award
at the April 11 Academy Awards, told Murphy he had put a damper on
the evening by accusing the academy of discriminating against
blacks.
   The lawsuit said the account was a ``complete falsehood'' and
``a wholly fictionalized account.''
   A man who answered the telephone at the Enquirer's offices in
Lantana, Fla., late Tuesday said no one from the tabloid would be
available to comment on the suit until working hours.
   The complaint charged that Don Monte, in a ``TV-Behind the
Scenes'' column, reported that Cher told Murphy the awards ceremony
was not the place to air grievances.
   The remarks were said to have been made after Murphy and Academy
President Robert Wise argued backstage, with Wise allegedly telling
Murphy he would not be invited to participate in any future Academy
Awards programs.
   However, Cher's lawsuit says the actress did not see Murphy
backstage. The comedian had presented the best picture award during
the Oscar ceremonies.

   A presidential race between Republican George

   Of the 1,100 registered Nebraska voters interviewed in the Omaha

percent favored Dukakis and 18 percent were undecided.
   Among the Democratic presidential candidates who will be on
Tuesday's Nebraska primary ballot, Dukakis led Jesse Jackson more

   Dukakis was favored by 54 percent of the Democrats, 15 percent
supported Jackson, 20 percent were undecided and other Democrats
split the rest of the vote.
   The telephone poll, conducted last week by SRI Research Center

   People who have unsafe sex with
AIDS-infected lovers may be more likely to get the deadly disease
after drinking a few beers or moderate amounts of other alcoholic
beverages, a study suggests.
   ``Alcohol does affect the immune system. Alcohol makes you more
vulnerable to AIDS infection,'' said Dr. Omar Bagasra, who
presented the study Tuesday at the annual meeting of the Federation
of American Societies for Experimental Biology.
   ``I'm not saying not to drink or not to have sex, only to have
safe sex if you're going to have sex. Make sure to use condoms,''
said Bagasra, a microbiologist-immunologist at the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
   Bagasra said the study also suggests moderate drinking may speed
the development of full-fledged AIDS in people who have been
infected but show no symptoms of the disease.
   Previous research suggests that because alcohol reduces
inhibitions, drinking makes people more likely to engage in unsafe
sexual activity that can spread the AIDS virus, such as anal
intercourse without condoms, Bagasra said.
   He said his study indicates moderate alcohol consumption also
may reduce the body's biological resistance to infection by the
virus once it gets in the bloodstream.
   Bagasra and Philadelphia researchers Dr. Andrea Kajdacsy-Balla
of Hahnemann University and Dr. Harold Lischner of Temple
University based their findings on an experiment using blood from
six healthy heterosexual volunteers. The disease-fighting white
blood cells were grown with the AIDS virus in laboratory glassware.
   The blood cells were tested after the volunteers spent one month
without drinking alcohol, then 13 to 17 hours after each drank an
average of four beers or the equivalent in other drinks.
   The virus grew 25 to 250 times faster in the white blood cells
after the volunteers drank, and each cell contained more viruses.
   Three to seven hours after the volunteers had no alcohol left in
their bodies, their cells still produced smaller amounts of
interleukin-2 and soluble immune response suppressor factor, two
substances necessary for proper functioning of the disease-fighting
immune system.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the immune system
by destroying certain white blood cells and other cells.
   ``It's a very interesting study and deserves being followed up
with (larger) clinical and epidemiological studies,'' said Dr. John
Leedom, head of infectious diseases at the University of Southern
California and AIDS service director at Los Angeles County-USC
Medical Center.
   Leedom cautioned that the drinkers' blood cells were exposed to
higher doses of the AIDS virus in laboratory glassware than they
would be inside the body. But he said alcoholics are more prone to
infections such as pneumonia and meningitis than other people. And
several studies have linked certain cancers to moderate drinking.
   Other scientists have suggested that drugs and alcohol may be
``co-factors'' required for AIDS infection to occur, and it will be
interesting to see if Bagasra's study can be repeated in other
laboratories, said Janet Nicholson, chief of clinical immunology at
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
   Bagasra said he plans to repeat the study in July with up to 200
volunteers.
   ``People are infected by this virus for years before they get
sick. Something tips the balance,'' Leedom said. ``People who drink
even moderate amounts of alcohol might make their (blood cells)
more susceptible not only to virus particles that come in from
outside during sexual episodes, but they might be rendering them
more susceptible to infection from a neighboring cell that's
already infected.''

   A revised United Methodist hymnal includes
portrayals of God as a feminine figure and casts mankind out in
favor of people, but leaves a few old favorites unchanged.
   The nation's second-largest Protestant denomination on Tuesday
also adopted a new, conservative summary of doctrine that
underscores the primacy of Scripture.
   Delegates to the 9.6 million member denomination's governing
conference overwhelmingly adopted the new hymnal that generally
shifts to inclusive language for humans, such as using ``All'' for
``men'' and ``people'' for ``mankind.''
   But members decided to retain masculine pronouns for God in the
book's psalms, denying the request of several delegates to use
gender-neutral nouns such as ``God's'' rather than ``His.''
   The new hymnbook was extensively updated with nearly half its
625 songs fresh for Methodists _ new compositions, ethnic folk
hymns, spirituals and gospel songs, or imports from other
denominations.
   But old favorites and classics of their 18th century,
hymn-writing founder, John Wesley, still occupy a prominent place,
with ``O For a Thousand Tongues to Sing'' by his brother, Charles,
leading off the hymn section.
   Work on the book, replacing the old hymnal of 1966, had
continued for four years. Delegates approved the new hymnal by 893
to 69.
   ``An exciting and historical moment,'' said the Rev. C. Rex
Bevins of Lincoln, Neb., after applause by the 3,000 people.
   The legislative body, whose 11-day meeeting ends Friday, meets
every four years to set the church's course for the next
quadrennium.
   Delegates overwhelmingly supported the new doctrinal summary,
which replaces a 1972 version. It was described as reflecting a
general swing to conservatism, attempting to stabilize beliefs
against counter influences.
   ``Pluralism,'' or divergency, a hallmark of the previous, more
flexible statement of doctrine, has been stricken from the new
document.
   ``It gives us a clearer definition of who we are,'' said the
Rev. Thomas A. Langford, a Duke University theologian. ``It puts
into sharper relief the marrow of our convictions.''
   The Rev. James Heidinger of Wilmore, Ky., executive secretary of
an evangelical caucus, Good News, praised the document as providing
a firmer doctrinal foundation, replacing a past ``smorgasbord of
belief.''
   ``The church has suffered 16 years of doctrinal confusion and
uncertainty due to theological pluralism, suggesting we might
believe just about anything,'' he said. ``That kind of expression
doesn't attract members.''
   However, he said the document leaves ``room for diversity''
around the ``central core of faith.''
   Some theologians initially had been sharply critical of the new
document, saying it overly elevates Scripture above reason,
experience and tradition and tends to curb theological exploration.
   However, several additions were made to ``clarify our
thinking,'' examine ``the nature and purposes of God'' and ``human
freedom and responsibility.''
   ``The heart of our task,'' the document asserts, ``is to reclaim
and renew the distinctive United Methodist doctrinal heritage,
which rightly belongs to our common heritage as Christians.''
   Methodists generally are not fundamentalists who consider the
Bible literally factual in all matters. However, the new document
makes Scripture the primary authority.
   Tied to it in a subordinate role are the three other strands of
the Methodist quadrilateral _ reason, tradition and experience.
Theology also is portrayed as subordinate to doctrine, but
contributing to it.

<HEAD>Historian: Churchill Tried Astrology To Make U.S. Join War</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Reagan-Astrology, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winston Churchill's official biographer says the
prime minister used an astrologer in a political ploy to get the
United States to enter World War II by predicting Nazi Germany
would lose the war.
   Oxford University historian Martin Gilbert said the plan in
mid-1941, when Britain was desperate to end American neutrality,
didn't work.
   ``Churchill never used an astrologer personally but he once used
one politically,'' Gilbert said Tuesday. The historian has just
finished the eighth and final volume of Churchill's biography.
   In the summer of 1941, Gilbert said, ``a convention of
astrologers in the United States dominated by pro-German groups had
predicted the victory of Hitler in the war, which was clearly a
good reason for America staying out of it.''
   ``Learning of this, Churchill at once dispatched to the States
the astrologer Louis De Wohl who proved from the same constellation
of stars and moons and whatever else astrologers use that Hitler
would, in fact, lose,'' he said.
   Gilbert said this brought ``much discomfort to those who claimed
otherwise'' but didn't bring the United States into the war. That
happened after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.
   The White House acknowledged Tuesday that Nancy Reagan consults
astrological forecasts to help plan President Reagan's activities.
The disclosure came after former chief of staff Donald T. Regan
reportedly wrote in his forthcoming book that Mrs. Reagan consulted
astrologers to determine the timing of presidential speeches and
announcements.

   The government said strikes plaguing
Poland threaten to derail reforms it initiated to breathe life into
a weak economy, claiming that it it grants the demanded pay raises,
all Poles stand to lose.
   ``We have waited very long for this chance and it is important
that it not be wasted,'' government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a
news conference Tuesday, echoing a theme repeated constantly in the
Communist regime's official media.
   Since April 25, there have been at least four major strikes and
several minor work stoppages.
   Workers in virtually every sector want pay increases of up to 60
percent to counter price increases of 42 percent in the first
quarter of this year that came about from cuts in government
subsidies. The more radical strikers want the Solidarity
independent trade union movement's legality restored.
   Since World War II, workers have demanded higher pay in response
to higher prices and the government has usually given in _ but
sometimes only after violent strikes.
   This time authorities have met increasing labor unrest with
declarations that the old way of labor unrest never really worked
and that in any case there is no more money.
   Poland's poverty is clearly visible. Horses instead of tractors
pull plows, office buildings stand half-finished for years,
ordinary items such as toilet paper are in chronic short supply and
the average annual income is about $1,080.
   Most hard currency Poland earns goes to service a foreign debt
of $39 billion, the largest in the Soviet bloc. Poland borrowed
heavily from the West during a 1970s boom, providing relative
prosperity, but much of the money went for consumption and
ill-conceived investments.
   Good times ended with sharp price increases in 1980, the
subsequent labor upheaval in which Solidarity was born, and the
martial law crackdown of December 1981 that brought four years of
Western economic sanctions. All contributed to a general economic
decline.
   Hoping to spur public involvement, the government held a
referendum last year seeking support for its reform plan. It won
most of the votes, but not the binding majority Polish law requires
to pass such a plan.
   The reforms, begun Jan. 1, were intended to improve the economy
by introducing competition and encouraging more private enterprise.
Subsidies on staples were slashed and prices rose to reflect true
cost.
   Officials say strikes threaten to kill the plan. Urban said
Tuesday ``the government is determined to protect its program of
reforms,'' but the labor trouble ``may put it off or derail it.''
   He said the reforms end the government's role as the final
source of cash. The government will not make up the difference
between what enterprises can afford to pay and what they must pay
for labor peace, Urban added.
   Industry Minister Jerzy Bilip said on television Monday: ``In
terms of the whole country, for surely the whole country would not
remain impartial, some 600 billion zlotys ($1.5 billion) would be
demanded in pay raises.''
   Despite tough official words, however, managers have found ways
to grant raises. Workers at the strikebound Nowa Huta steel mill
were told to expect $50 a month more.
   Strikes by bus drivers in Bydgoszcz and factory workers in
Stalowa Wola also were settled with promises of pay raises of at
least 50 percent.
   Solidarity has endorsed the general direction of reforms, but
complains about how the changes have been put into effect. It also
said true reform requires independent trade unions that can
negotiate with authorities.
   Solidarity was outlawed under martial law and attempts by union
activists to have it legally registered in plants across the
country have failed in court challenges.

   Pope John Paul II met with a group of Polish
pilgrims that included two Solidarity leaders and said the laws of
God dictate that Poles be allowed to govern themselves and decide
their own fate.
   The meeting Tuesday was the pontiff's second in three days with
pilgrims from his homeland in which he addressed the strife there.
   About 500 Poles attended a Mass the pope said in a chapel of St.
Peter's Basilica on Tuesday.
   The Italian news agency AGI said that among those at the Mass
were Solidarity leaders Kornel Morawiecki and Andrzej Kolodziej,
who were released from a Warsaw prison last week for medical
treatment in Rome.
   Thousands of Poles have gone on strike in the past week in
Poland's worst labor unrest since the 1981 martial law crackdown on
Solidarity, the first independent labor federation in the Soviet
bloc. Solidarity has been outlawed since.
   In a homily carried by Vatican radio, the pope said he prayed
that ``the problem of sovereignty, that is, independence, of our
country, be rooted most profoundly in another problem, the problem
of the sovereignty of society and of the people of Poland today.
   ``One can speak of sovereignty, of independence of a nation only
when, in the context of this nation, there is a people sovereign
and independent who can, by rule and fact, decide their common
life,'' John Paul said.
   ``Times, historic conditions, situations can change, but these
principles always keep their identity: they are simply the laws of
God, laws written in the human heart, in the nature of man.
   Vatican radio on Monday carried other remarks by the pope about
his homeland. In a meeting Sunday with Polish pilgrims he urged
progress in Polish labor relations.

<TEXT>
   Ousted Gov. Evan Mecham says he won't
relinquish the $92,000 governor's protocol fund despite a lawsuit
the state threatened to file if he didn't do so by late this
afternoon.
   State Attorney General Bob Corbin demanded the money, in a
strongly worded letter released Tuesday.
   Asked in an interview if the money would be turned over, Mecham
said: ``Nope. Why should it be? It isn't his (Corbin's). It isn't
the state's.''
   Mecham said the money was still ``safely in the bank'' and that
he planned to handle it properly, although he would not give
details.
   ``He (Corbin) would have tried to confiscate it long ago if he
thought he could,'' Mecham said.
   Corbin, in a letter to former top Mecham aides Jim Colter and
Edith Richardson, asked them to surrender the money by 5 p.m.
today. If they don't, he said, ``I will direct the commencement of
all appropriate actions against each and both of you.''
   Gubernatorial spokesman Vada Manager said Gov. Rose Mofford
planned to ask Corbin to file a lawsuit if the money is not
returned. ``State funds rightfully ought to revert to the state,''
Manager said.
   Mecham was convicted in his Senate impeachment trial April 4 of
misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to
his auto dealership. During the trial, Mecham aides testified that
the protocol fund _ created with receipts from the January 1987
inaugural ball _ totaled $92,000 and was being kept in a Valley
National Bank account.
   Mecham also was convicted by the Senate of trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat. The former governor faces
a May 19 criminal trial on charges of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan.
   During the Senate trial, Mecham's defense contended the protocol
fund was not state money and that it was loaned to Mecham Pontiac
in an effort to get a higher rate of interest for the protocol fund.
   However, Corbin said Tuesday the Senate conviction showed that
the senators believed the protocol fund was state money belonging
to the governor's office.
   Mrs. Richardson and Colter are the official signatories to the
protocol bank account.
   Corbin's letter to them said, ``At the request of Governor Rose
Mofford and inasmuch as the monies in the account belong to the
Office of the Governor of the State of Arizona, I am writing this
letter to demand that you and each of you forthwith surrender and
turn over said monies to the Office of the Governor of the State of
Arizona.''
   Mecham would not say if he considered the money to be his
personal fund.
   ``We'll just handle it properly,'' he said. ``That's all I want
to say.''

   Interior Minister Tomas Borge said the
government and the rebels began peace talks because both sides had
suffered heavy losses. But he said the Sandinistas will resume
fighting if the peace talks fail.
   ``We'll mobilize the entire nation,'' Borge said during a
wide-ranging interview Tuesday night that also touched upon
long-standing rumors of differences between him and President
Daniel Ortega.
   Borge, one of nine commandants in the directorate of the
governing Sandinista National Liberation Front, is regarded as one
of the most hawkish members of Ortega's Cabinet.
   Since the March 23 signing of a vaguely worded temporary truce,
talks aimed at achieving a lasting peace have foundered. The latest
round of direct negotiations between the leftist Sandinista
government and the U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, took
place in Managua.
   Borge said Nicaragua was drawn to the negotiating table because
it ``has paid a high cost in blood'' in the war, which has crippled
its economy since it began in November 1981. ``But if the Contras
were not badly beaten militarily, or held land, they would never
negotiate with us,'' he said.
   The Sandinistas once refused to hold direct talks with the
Contras or allow them to come to Nicargua. Borge acknowledged the
back-pedaling, but emphasized: ``We will never discuss political
power'' with the Contras.
   ``We understand the negotiations with the Contras are indirect
(talks) with the United States,'' he added.
   The Sandinistas maintained for years that any talks to end the
war should be with the United States because it financed the
Contras.
   Borge dismissed rumors that the directorate was split between
his followers and those of President Ortega.
   ``The worst enemies of revolutions are the revolutionaries ...
who fight among themselves,'' Borge said. ``We all discuss and
discuss until we're in agreement. There are certain contradictions.
That's natural and helps contribute and move things forward.''
   The handling of an ongoing strike has been regarded as an
example of differences between Borge and the president. While
Ortega's brother, Gen. Humberto Ortega, met with Contra leaders in
the capital last week, Interior Ministry troops detained dozens of
people outside a union hall where more than 30 people were on a
hunger strike.
   Borge defended the action Tuesday night as a way to restore
public order.
   Two union leaders and three women strike sympathizers were
shoved into police vehicles on Tuesday after speaking with
reporters a block from the hall. About 40 people have been taken
into custody since last week.
   ``Our police are absolutely anti-repression. They never are
abusive, or use torture or murder,'' Borge said.
   Construction workers and car mechanics went on a hunger strike
April 25 in support of a wildcat walkout that began Feb. 25 to
demand higher wages.
   Borge said the Sandinistas would give up power if they lost in
elections, but said that would be the end of the Nicaraguan
revolution.
   ``And this is impossible, nothing can kill the revolution,'' he
added.
   The Marxist-led Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 uprising
that ended the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza. The Sandinistas
promised a better life, social programs and equality to the more
than 3 million Nicaraguans. The government now says many of its
projects were lost in the war.
   ``We've paid a high price to defend our national sovereignty and
dignity,'' Borge said, noting that projects to improve education
and health fell short of projections and that there were food
shortages. He blamed the problems in part on the war and ``the
errors we committed.''
   Asked if the government was Marxist-Leninist, Borge said the
teachings of those two thinkers was ``a universal science and
anyone who doesn't study it is either mentally retarded or
ignorant.'' He said Marxist-Leninist theory ``was an important
guide in our decisions.''
   Borge praised the Sandinista relationship with the Soviet Union,
which provides most of Nicaragua's aid. He said the Soviet Union
``helps us and respects us and we appreciate it.''

   A jury deliberating the nation's first
death-by-product-tampering case is trying to decide if a woman
killed her husband and a stranger with poisoned painkillers to
escape an unhappy marriage and collect insurance.
   The U.S. District Court jury today was to begin its second day
of deliberations in the trial of Stella Nickell, 44, of Auburn.
   Mrs. Nickell is charged with two counts of causing death by
tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce and three
counts of tampering. If convicted, she could face life in prison.
   She was accused in the June 1986 death of her 52-year-old
husband, Bruce, and of Sue Katherine Snow, 40, also of Auburn, who
died two weeks later. Both victims swallowed cyanide-laced
Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules.
   The deaths touched off a nationwide tampering scare and prompted
Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers to recall its capsuled
non-prescription medicines.
   Prosecutors portrayed Mrs. Nickell as an unhappy wife beset by
financial problems who poisoned her husband to collect $176,000
from his life insurance policies. They contended Ms. Snow as an
innocent stranger.
   The prosecution said Mrs. Nickell put tampered painkillers on
shelves of local stores to make her husband's death appear random
and to lead doctors, who had concluded Nickell died of emphysema,
to the true cause of his death.
   Mrs. Nickell's attorney has defended her as the victim of a
daughter who lied when she said her mother had asked how much
cocaine would cause an overdose and where to hire a hit man to end
the marriage.
   Only Mrs. Nickell had the motive, opportunity and ability to
commit the crimes, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida told the
jury in closing arguments Monday.
   Defense lawyer Thomas Hillier countered that the government's
case was built on the testimony of one unreliable witness, Mrs.
Nickell's daughter, Cindy Hamilton.
   ``Without Cindy Hamilton's testimony, the government case
collapses like a house of cards,'' Hillier said. ``Where's one
person other than Cindy Hamilton willing to stand up and say: `It's
Stella Nickell!'
   ``Cindy Hamilton is not telling the truth,'' he told jurors
during his closing argument.
   Court documents indicate the major break in the tampering case
came when Ms. Hamilton came forward with her account in December
1986, a year before her mother was arrested.
   Jurors were told last week of a $300$060 award offered by
pharmaceutical companies to anyone who provided information leading
to the arrest of the tamperer or tamperers.
   Ms. Maida said in closing arguments that Mrs. Nickell's plan
failed because she was careless in mixing the poisonous capsules,
greedy for insurance benefits and owned two of the five tainted
bottles of painkillers found.
   Mrs. Nickell stood to receive $71,000 if her husband, a state
employee, died of emphysema, as pathologists first concluded, but
she could have gotten $176,000 if the death was ruled accidental,
the prosecutor said.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Chastises Mayor But Recommends No Charges in MOVE Siege</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special grand jury blasted Mayor W. Wilson
Goode and his top aides for ``morally reprehensible behavior'' in
the 1985 MOVE bombing that killed 11 people and destroyed 61 homes,
but didn't recommend indictments.
   The panel, which released its findings Tuesday, called the
failed eviction effort May 13, 1985, ``this city's greatest
tragedy.'' It ended in a fiery siege with the police bombing of a
barricaded west Philadelphia row house occupied by members of the
radical group MOVE.
   Criticism of the 279-page grand jury report was swift.
   A special commission Goode formed after the confrontation found
the mayor ``grossly negligent.'' Members of that commission, which
released its findings in March 1986, were outraged at the findings
of the county grand jury.
   ``I'm totally speechless,'' said commission member Julia M.
Chinn. ``We know 11 people died on May 13. How can they say no one
should be penalized for it? ... To me, I don't see this as
justice.''
   District Attorney Ronald Castille said the panel spent nearly
two years and $250,000 in its investigation and voted 16-4 against
filing charges.
   The father of a then-13-year-old boy, one of the two survivors
from the MOVE compound, said he was confused and dismayed by the
report.
   ``What the grand jury came up with made no sense,'' said Andino
Ward, father of Michael Moses Ward, who was known as Birdie Africa.
``There has to be some responsibility. ... Justice is blind, but in
Philadelphia it appears to be very ignorant.''
   The grand jury rejected the boy's contention that police gunfire
had kept some people from fleeing the MOVE house while it burned.
Those killed were inside the house.
   The jury said it considered but discarded charges of conspiracy,
murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, reckless
endangerment, arson, causing or risking a catastrophe, failure to
prevent a castastrope, criminal mischief and perjury.
   Goode said after the grand jury released its report that he had
learned much from the tragedy.
   ``We are a stronger government, a stronger city,'' Goode said,
noting the event was the most fully investigated in Philadelphia
history. ``I am committed to make sure that such tragic events
never occur again.''
   Goode declined to discuss details of the report or the events of
the siege.
   ``It has been my belief all along that I had not done anything
that is criminal and I am satisfied that the district attorney
concluded the same thing,'' Goode said.
   The grand jury contested Goode's statements that he ordered
officials at the scene to put out the fire shortly before 6 p.m.,
saying evidence showed that his call came no earlier than 6:25 p.m.
   ``While the conduct of city officials in handling MOVE is
entirely unacceptable, it is not the proper subject of criminal
prosecutions,'' the report concluded.
   ``This city's greatest tragedy ... is an epic of governmental
incompetence. It details an operation marked by political cowardice
in its inception, inexperience in its planning, and ineptitude in
its execution.
   ``We do not exonerate the men responsible for this disaster.
Rather than a vindication of those officials, this report should
stand as a permanent record of their morally reprehensible behavior
(and) the terrible cost of their misjudgments.''
   A federal grand jury is investigating whether the civil rights
of the 11 victims, five of them children, were violated by the
bombing and fire that followed. Its report is expected by the
summer.

   This time, Lech Walesa arrived at the
strikebound Lenin shipyard in a chauffeured car and was greeted as
an elder statesman with cheers and chants of ``Solidarity'' and
``Lech, Lech.''
   Eight years ago, as a little known labor agitator, he had to
vault the shipyard fence to take charge of a workers' revolt that
eventually led to the founding of the Solidarity labor federation
and brought down a government.
   ``I am not your leader. I'm tired,'' Walesa, 44, told the
striking shipyard workers on Tuesday. ``You need a new Walesa, many
more new Walesas.''
   Much has changed since Solidarity was recognized by the
government in accords signed in this Baltic port that ended the
1980 strike wave.
   Walesa has put on some weight, he won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize
and Solidarity was banned after a December 1981 martial law
crackdown.
   But his trademark moustache remains and he still works as an
electrician at the shipyard.
   Since 1980, Walesa has taken on bodyguards and a driver as part
of his entourage. Fame has complicated his life, making it busier
and making him the subject of an occasional death threat.
   When he attends a union meeting or travels to see visiting
foreign dignitaries, he more likely will be driven than drive
himself.
   Old people, women and children pressed to shake Walesa's hand as
he stepped out of the car and walked up to the shipyard gate, which
was decorated with Solidarity banners, pictures of Pope John Paul
II, yellow flowers and a sign proclaiming ``Occupation Strike.''
   The strikers shouted his name and patted him on the back as he
approached a makeshift podium to deliver a speech.
   Policemen patrolled nearby, but did not intervene.
   Walesa told the strikers that he wasn't their leader.
   ``I've done what I had to do,'' Walesa told them. ``But I don't
want a past. I only want bread, calm and peace for us all. I want
to help Poland enter a road of reforms.''
   The strikers wore Solidarity badges and armbands on their blue
overalls. Many also wore yellow hardhats as they sipped tea and
smoked in the balmy sunshine.
   Dozens of strikers crowded the rooftops of nearby buildings to
listen to the speech. Outside the plant, people pressed together to
catch a glimpse while others climbed on the iron shipyard gate.
   They joined in occasional ``Solidarity'' chants and chatted with
the strikers, some of whom guarded the entrances to the shipyard
and checked the plastic identity cards of yard workers going in or
out.
   Over a loudspeaker, an announcer read names of workers whose
relatives had come to the gate to bring them food and cigarettes.
   Cheers arose when workers and sympathizers delivered loaves of
bread, cans of sardines and jars of honey and jam in large canvas
bags and wheeelbarrows.
   Just outside the gate, a red-and-white Polish flag with the
Solidarity logo was placed near the three tall, concrete crosses
joined by three anchors. The monument honors scores of Baltic Coast
workers, including at least 27 in Gdansk, killed during the harsh
goverment response to riots against price increases introduced just
before Christmas 1970.
   The monument was dedicated Dec. 16, 1980, fulfilling a pledge
made by Walesa during the early days of the 1980 Solidarity strike.

   The Wedtech Corp. turned to a former deputy
director of the CIA and an Israeli general in attempts to sell arms
overseas, according to testimony in the racketeering trial of Rep.
Mario Biaggi.
   The testimony Tuesday came as part of the defense's attempt to
show that the scandal-plagued South Bronx defense contracting firm
did not need Biaggi's help in obtaining work because it already had
high-level connections in the Reagan administration and elsewhere.
   The Bronx Democrat, his son and five others are on trial in
federal court on charges of turning Wedtech into a racketeering
enterprise that paid public officials millions of dollars to obtain
government contracts.
   Former Wedtech vice president Larry Shorten said the company
approached former CIA official Max Hugel in 1985 for help in
selling a tug barge to Yugoslavia.
   Hugel would have received a commission if the sale went through
but Shorten did not specify the outcome.
   Shorten said the company paid Maj. Gen. Avigdor Ben-Gal of
Israel between $3,000 and $4,000 a month for two years to serve as
a consultant. The company did not get any contracts with Israel
through the general, who retired from the Israeli army in 1982.

<HEAD>Doctors Perform Follow-Up Operation On Separated Siamese Twin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors today performed
follow-up surgery on a 17-month-old girl who had just been
separated from her Siamese twin sister in an intricate 7{-hour
procedure, hospital officials said.
   Mpho and Mphonyana Mathibela, who had been joined at the head,
were separated Tuesday by a 40-person medical team at Baragwanath,
the main hospital in Soweto township outside Johannesburg.
   Mphonyana, the smaller and weaker of the two, began bleeding
from the incision in her head early today and required additional
surgery, the hospital said. Following the operation, she was
returned to the intensive care unit.
   Both girls were in critical but stable condition, the hospital
said.
   ``I always knew they would be all right,'' said Sophie
Mathibela, mother of the girls. ``I feel so happy.''
   In September, doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore
separated West German Siamese twins joined at the head. The two
boys, Benjamin and Patrick Binder, survived and were released in
March, but they reportedly are suffering some physical and mental
problems.
   The Johns Hopkins doctors advised the Baragwanath doctors before
Tuesday's operation and called to offer congratulations following
the successful surgery.
   Dr. Robert Lipschitz, head of the operating team, said before
the operation that the chances for success were not good. He
performed two operations on the girls last October in preparation
for Tuesday's procedure.
   The girls shared a major blood vessel in their heads, which
doctors partially clamped in the earlier operations in the hope
that lesser blood vessels would take over the functions of the
shared vein.
   Ms. Mathibela, an unmarried, 33-year-old domestic worker who
earns about $60 a month, gave birth to the twins Dec. 7, 1986.
   She said initially that she was so horrified that she refused to
see the girls for three days. ``Once persuaded to see them, I
immediately accepted and loved my little gifts from God,'' Ms.
Mathibela said.
   The girls had a combined weight of 33 pounds before the
operation.
   Mpho appears to be developing normally and recently began to
speak, while Mphonyana is slightly smaller and does not appear to
be as advanced, hospital officials said.
   Ms. Mathibela was asked to make a five-dollar contribution to
the costs of the operations, estimated at $700,000. The costs are
being covered by the hospital and the University of the
Witwatersrand medical school.
   The Sowetan, a daily newspaper that covers the black township,
has set up a trust fund for the twins that has raised $26,000.

   Plans to require random drug testing of
government employees are meeting strong opposition from a group of
Justice Department attorneys, who plan a legal challenge to the new
program.
   The drug testing would be required for government employees
ranging from White House chief of staff Howard Baker down to
secretaries and butlers under plans unveiled Tuesday by 42 federal
agencies.
   Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services
forwarded employee drug-testing plans from the agencies to
Congress, technically clearing the way for the agencies to begin
testing the workers they have designated.
   Stephen Sachs, a private Washington attorney, said he has met
with a number of Justice Department lawyers who feel the program is
``much more expansive'' than had been anticipated.
   ``Our contention is that they cannot do mandatory, random
drug-testing without some probable cause or some kind of
individualized suspicion,'' he said.
   He said Justice Department officials have said in the past there
is no drug problem at the department.
   As a practical matter, many of the various testing plans already
have been blocked by court suits. Other federal employee
organizations have said they also will sue once their agencies'
attempts to implement testing.
   At the White House, the plan would affect 370 employees,
including Baker, secretaries, butlers, ushers, chefs, maids,
receptionists and tradesmen in the presidential residence.
   Ray Kogut, director of personnel for the Office of
Administration, said about 1,200 of the 1,600 people working in 13
separate agencies under the executive office of the president will
be affected.
   President Reagan and Vice President George Bush will not be
required to submit to random testing. However, they have
voluntarily given specimens in the past, Kogut said.
   Kogut said the 100 percent coverage figure also applies to the
National Security Council staff, the office of the vice president,
the Council of Economic Advisors and its staff, the Office of
Policy Development, office of the U.S. Trade Representative and
Office of Science and Technology Policy.
   The Defense Department said HHS had certified drug-testing plans
that could ultimately cover about 20 percent of its civilian work
force _ or more than 200,000 federal workers. The Army already has
begun testing some of its civilian employees.
   The mandatory, random drug testing at the Justice Department
covers some 4,700 employees in the attorney general's office, U.S.
attorneys' offices nationwide and in the six divisions of the
department: criminal, civil, antitrust, tax, lands and civil rights.
   About 7 percent of the 4,700 would be tested annually under the
Justice Department plan, which will go into effect in several
months.
   In addition, there are 9,300 other Justice Department employees
who could be tested if there was reasonable suspicion to suspect
they were using drugs. Applicants for those posts also would face
drug tests.
   Separate drug testing programs already are under way or are
about to begin for certain employees at four Justice Department
agencies: the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and
Naturalization Service and the Bureau of Prisons.
   The HHS guidelines _ regarding clinical urine collection
procedures and testing laboratory accuracy _ were first issued more
than a year ago and formally published in final form in the Federal
Register last month.
   The HHS's own internal plan calls for testing for marijuana and
cocaine. It says 8,661 of the agency's approximately 130,000
employees are liable for testing and that it envisions testing 10
percent of the 8,661 in any given year.

   The dollar edged up in light European trading
early today. Gold bullion fell.
   The dollar fluctuated within a tight range in the first hours of
trading, and market participants said they did not expect much
movement throughout the session.
   A trader at a West German bank said the latest, generally
favorable, U.S. economic reports were supporting the dollar. The
recent upward trend in U.S. interest rates also helped, an Italian
trader said.
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6820 West German marks, up from 1.6770
   _1.4005 Swiss francs, up from 1.3945
   _5.7120 French francs, up from 5.6935

   _1,251.50 Italian lire, up from 1,247.50
   _1.2370 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2294
   The British pound fell to $1.8651 from $1.8715.
   Tokyo markets were closed for a second day for Japanese
holidays. The dollar was quoted at 125.00 yen in London, up from
124.83 yen late Tuesday.
   London's major bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $441.95 a troy ounce, down from $445.50 late Tuesday.
A trader said selling from the Middle East was helping to depress
prices.
   Gold was bid at $441.90 in Zurich, down from $446.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $444.71, down
from $446.57.
   Silver bullion traded in London at $6.31 a troy ounce, down from
$6.39.

<HEAD>Tiny Device Could Help Heart Attack Victims Survive, Doctors Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A pencil-shaped pump implanted for the first time
to save a heart transplant recipient's life will become a common
emergency treatment for heart attack victims, a Texas Heart
Institute surgeon predicts.
   The temporary device, smaller than a penny, is known as the
Nimbus HEMOPUMP. It will be tested for 18 months and requires the
approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, officials say.
   ``I must say it's the most remarkable thing I've seen or
experienced,'' Dr. O.H. Frazier, director of the institute's Cullen
Cardiovascular Surgical Research Laboratories, said Tuesday. ``A
device this small to take over the function of the human heart is
really incredible.''
   In its first human application, the device was inserted April 26
into the heart of a 62-year-old Colorado man. The patient, whose
name was undisclosed, underwent a heart transplant earlier but was
suffering from rejection and faced certain death, Frazier said.
   ``He's in the game,'' Frazier said. ``He was out of the game
Monday a week ago, totally out, and the only reason he's in it is
because of the device. I say that with absolute certainty.''
   The pump is inserted through the femoral artery in the leg and
is passed with a tube until it gets to the left ventricle, the
heart's main pumping chamber. The tube stays in and is hooked to
the outside power source.
   There, spinning at 25,000 revolutions per minute, it can provide
100 percent of the blood flow to the body and enable the heart
muscle to rest and heal.
   ``The main thing is all other devices require the chest to be
open ... major surgery,'' Frazier said. ``This is placed in a
simple incision.''
   Unlike an intra-aortic balloon pump now used to treat heart
patients, the HEMOPUMP does not require a beating heart to function
effectively, doctors said.
   The device has been in testing for two years and the FDA is
allowing testing at Texas Heart Institute for four patients. A
second patient given the pump last week died, although Frazier said
that patient suffered from complications unrelated to the pump.
   ``We think this is a major important adjunct to treatment of
patients otherwise dying of heart failure,'' Frazier said, adding
that he was skeptical of its success when he first saw it two years
ago.
   But he predicted that once testing is completed and the FDA
authorizes its use, it will be a common operation for emergency
rooms receiving heart attack victims.
   ``For heart failure, this is going to be the treatment of
choice,'' Frazier said. ``It's easily introduced and can be used in
any hospital that performs open-heart surgery. I think it has
far-reaching implications in the treatment of these patients with
acute heart failure.''
   Besides the Texas Heart Institute, officials said Mercy Hospital
in Des Moines, Iowa, and Humana Hospital in Louisville, Ky., have
FDA permission to test the pump in humans.

<HEAD>Green Line Mortar Duel, Christian Militia On Alert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian and Moslem militiamen today
exchanged mortar fire across Beirut's dividing Green Line. No
casualties were reported.
   The two-hour battle in downtown Beirut came amid reports of
growing tension between a Christian militia and the Lebanese army.
   There was no word on what caused the battle, the fourth between
civil war antagonists in Beirut in two weeks. The clashes have
strained a 14-month-old truce in the war that began in 1975.
   The fighting coincided with a state of alert proclaimed by the
6,000-strong Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, in east
Beirut and the Christian heartland north of the capital.
   Christian militiamen set up checkpoints and roadblocks all over
the Christian sector of Beirut and along the main coastal highway
running north from the city, witnesses reported.
   Fighters in battle fatigues and carrying automatic weapons
searched cars and frisked occupants, said the witnesses, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The militia gave no explanation for the alert. But the
Christian-owned Ad-Diyar daily said it stemmed from tension between
the militia and the Lebanese army, which is controlled by Christian
officers.
   The newspaper said the militia was putting on a muscle-flexing
show to demonstrate it controls the Christian enclave, not the army.
   The commander of the 37,000-man army, Gen. Michel Aoun, has been
quoted by several Beirut newspapers recently as saying the military
could finish off the militia any time it wanted.
   Newspapers said his remarks were part of a campaign by the
Maronite Catholic commander to become the next president of Lebanon
after President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expires in September.
Aoun, who has not denied the statements, has not offically
proclaimed his candidacy.

<HEAD>Soviet Media Paint Somber Picture Of Polish Strikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet media painted a somber picture of the
industrial strikes now under way in Poland, saying the labor unrest
is a menace to economic reforms being pursued by the Warsaw
government.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda today accused ``anti-Polish
centers'' in the West and an ``internal opposition'' in the
Moscow-aligned country of trying to exploit the discontent for
their own ends.
   Pravda said the airwaves were filled with broadcasts from
Western radio stations urging the Poles ``to enlarge the scale of
the protest'' and to increase their demands.
   The Tass news agency said the strikes in Gdansk, Wroclaw and
other areas of the country are harmful to Poland's economy. But it
also quote a Polish government spokesman as saying the strikes did
not threaten the government and it gave a veiled reminder that the
regime in place enjoys Soviet backing.
   ``The strikes that are held now and that are sought to be
organized do not threaten the socialist state as it has durable
internal and external foundations,`` spokesman Jerzy Urban was
quoted as saying in Warsaw on Tuesday.
   ``But strikes threaten the economic reform,'' Urban continued.
``They can put off or undermine it. And the reform is our national
opportunity to overcome the difficulties of life and economic
stagnation.''
   An estimated 7,000 workers were on strike at the Lenin shipyard
in Gdansk and work stoppages also had spread to at least two other
industrial facilities.
   Workers are demanding higher wages to offset government-imposed
price increases on food and consumer goods. Government officials
say the price increases were needed to balance goods with the money
supply.
   ``The heightening of tension, endless demands and the staging of
strikes can only hamper the processes of democratization and
reforms,'' Tass quoted Urban as saying.
   Tass said Urban claimed the latest round of strikes is
dissimilar to the labor crisis which began in Poland in the early
80s. Bad leadership was partially responsible for that crisis, he
said.
   ``Now the strikes have broken out at the very start of the
process of transition to radical reforms, in a situation when there
is no need to stop work in order to speak out loud and be heard,''
Urban said. ``The strikes are groundless and harmful both from the
political and economic viewpoints.''
   Pravda, apparently referring to martial law, said Solidarity had
``played on feelings of Poles'' and ``what came of this is known to
everyone.''
   Solidarity was the first independent union in the Soviet bloc,
but was outlawed after martial law was declared in December 1981.
   Tass reported that Poland's Minister of Industry Erzy Bilip has
rejected demands for wage increases, saying the pay increases would
``contradict the second stage of reform.''

   The mother of Ferdinand Marcos died
today but President Corazon Aquino said the exiled president will
not be allowed to return for the funeral because he remains a
threat to national security.
   In Hawaii, Marcos issued a statement saying he was shocked at
the death of his 95-year-old mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos. Marcos
spokesman Gemmo Trinidad told reporters that Marcos said he will
keep trying to return to the Philippines ``but won't violate any
laws to go back.''
   Marcos said in his statement that he would ``exhaust all
possibilities that may be available to us to return to our
motherland, to help save her from the threatened communist takeover
or a possible civil war.''
   Before Mrs. Edralin-Marcos died, Vice President Salvador Laurel
said Marcos should be allowed to come home. Laurel cited Mrs.
Aquino's previous claims that Marcos followers no longer posed a
threat to her government.
   Dr. Sergio Brillantes, director of Veterans Memorial Medical
Center, said Mrs. Edralin-Marcos suffered cardiac arrest at noon
(midnight Tuesday EDT) and was pronounced dead 20 minutes later.
   In a nationally televised address, Mrs. Aquino expressed
condolences to the Marcos family, but added:
   ``After careful assessment in consultation with the leadership
of both chambers of Congress and the Cabinet committee, I regret
that considerations of national welfare, which are above the
individual interest, forbid us from allowing the former president
to return.''
   Mrs. Aquino said respect for parents was an important value in
Filipino society. But she added: ``There are other values involving
national stability and the common good of our people, whose primacy
I am duty-bound to uphold.''
   Marcos was not allowed to return for the funeral of his sister,
Elizabeth Marcos-Keon, who died in December 1986.
   Rafael Recto, Marcos' lawyer in the Philippines, said the
decision went against Philippine and Christian ethics.
   ``We have a government of neo-barbarians,'' Recto said. ``They
act like they've never had mothers.''
   Hundreds of Marcos supporters gathered outside the hospital
where Mrs. Edralin-Marcos died. Many of them wept, while others
shouted anti-Aquino slogans and called for a revolution.
   In Ilocos Norte, home province of the Marcos family, flags were
lowered to half staff and masses were said.
   Before Mrs. Edralin-Marcos died today, Mrs. Aquino met with
Cabinet members to consider a request Mrs. Edralin-Marcos made
Tuesday to allow her son to return for a final visit. The meeting
ended after receiving news of her death. The request was made in a
letter delivered to the presidential palace.
   ``It was a very difficult but very serious decision,'' said
National Security adviser Emmanuel Soriano, who attended the
meeting. ``We might summarize it in terms of what is best for the
common good at this time, what is best for national stability at
this time.''
   Sen. Leticia Ramos-Shahani, a distant cousin of Marcos and
sister of Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, said Marcos was ``still a
political force to be reckoned with.''
   Six senators, including opposition leader Sen. Juan Ponce
Enrile, issued a joint statement supporting Marcos' return on
humanitarian grounds.
   Marcos supporters have been linked to several coup attempts.
Mrs. Aquino told air force cadets on Monday that the threat from
Marcos supporters had been neutralized. But police said today that
they seized more than 40 rifles, 300 sticks of dynamite and
hundreds of rounds of ammunition during two raids this week on
buildings owned by Marcos supporters.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos stayed behind in 1986 when a
military-civilian uprising drove her son into exile after 20 years
in power and lifted Mrs. Aquino to the presidency. Mrs. Aquino
since has refused to allow Marcos to return.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos was hospitalized Sunday with pneumonia,
diabetes and kidney failure. She lapsed into a coma late Tuesday,
Brillantes said.
   In her letter to Mrs. Aquino, Mrs. Edralin-Marcos said:
   ``My dying wish, the one thing that will put a smile upon my
lips when I leave this world, is to see my Ferdinand by my bedside
as I say goodbye to all of you. Pray grant me this wish and this
privilege as one mother to another.''
   The letter, which was released by the palace, was apparently
drafted by family members and included the thumb print of Marcos'
mother.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos came from a wealthy northern Luzon family of
Filipino and Chinese extraction. She was born Feb. 14, 1893 in the
northern town of Sarrat, which was also Marcos' birthplace.
   She earned a master's degree in English literature from the
University of the Philippines and taught school for 42 years.
   Marcos' father, Mariano, was a politician and lawyer who died in
1944 during the Japanese occupation.

   Yook Wan-sik, head of the Olympic Security Coordination and
Control Headquarters, said North Korea would be condemned and
isolated by the entire world if it tried to disrupt the Games that
open in Seoul on Sept. 17.
   ``There will be no provocation from North Korea,'' he told a
news conference.
   The optimistic assessment contrasted with past warnings by top
South Korean government and security officials that the communist
north might use terrorism to disrupt the Olympics.
   International condemnation of North Korea for past terrorist
attacks and the participation of the Soviet Union, China and other
communist nations in the Games would restrain the north, Yook said.
   ``I'm confident North Korea will never try to cause any problems
during the Games,'' he said.
   But the former army general said no chances would be taken and a
huge security force would guard the Olympics. South Korean military
and security forces will mount the biggest security operation ever
seen in Olympic history, Yook said. ``I'm sure the Olympics will be
staged perfectly,'' he said.
   North Korea, which has been demanding to co-host the Olympics,
was widely blamed for the Nov. 29 bombing of a South Korean
jetliner en route to Seoul from Baghdad that killed all 115 people
aboard. The two Koreas are bitter rivals and have clashed
frequently since the Korean War ended in 1953.
   Yook said he had no firm indications international terrorists
have targeted the Olympics, adding that he was confident the
extraordinary security measures would defeat any terrorist threat.
   South Korean authorities are working with intelligence agencies
around the world to keep track of about 6,000 international
terrorists who might pose a threat to the Olympics, he said.

   A United Airlines jumbo jet that landed at Tokyo's
airport with just one of its four engines working took off today
for San Francisco with no passengers aboard, an airline spokesman
said.
   Robert Leu said a team of United Airlines engineers sent from
the United States inspected the Boeing 747 thoroughly and ``found
no defects in the aircraft and deemed the aircraft airworthy.''
   The jetliner will be taken to the company's maintenance
operation center in San Francisco, where it will be examined by the
National Transportation Safety Board, he said.
   Aviation sources in Washington said that the tanks supplying
fuel to the three dead engines were found to be dry when the plane
landed safely on Monday at New Tokyo International Airport.
   But Leu said the aircraft's six tanks are all interconnected and
the fuel supply system had plenty of fuel remaining on arrival at
the airport, better known as Narita.
   ``Each tank can supply fuel to each engine,'' he said. ``And the
aircraft had 23,500 pounds of fuel upon arrival at Narita. This
craft had considerably more than our own requirements,'' he said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration requires 16,000 pounds of
fuel remaining on arrival, while United requires 19,000 pounds, Leu
said.
   The jetliner, en route to Tokyo from Los Angeles, was flying at
39,000 feet with 258 people aboard one hour and 15 minutes from its
destination when the first engine lost power, United announced
Tuesday.
   Half an hour later, a second engine shut down and shortly before
landing, a third engine lost power.
   A Boeing 747 has a maximum fuel capacity of 320,000 pounds and
burns about 23,500 pounds of fuel per hour while cruising with all
four engines operating, according to the manufacturer.
   According to a report in the Yomiuri Shimbun, a Tokyo newspaper,
the gauge that indicates how much fuel is feeding into the engines
showed there was almost no fuel going into engines one and four and
that the No. 3 engine was also malfunctioning.
   Leu declined to comment on the cause of the engine failure,
saying it was still under investigation.

   A pipe bomb blew out the door of an art museum that
has been criticized in the Cuban community over the handling of
works by artists considered pro-Castro, but there were no injuries,
police said.
   ``It's a barbaric act to bomb a cultural center like the Cuban
museum,'' museum vice president Ramon Cernuda said, adding that the
bombing Tuesday was an attempt to intimidate directors of the Cuban
Museum of Arts and Culture.
   ``This is what happens when demagoguery reigns in this city,''
he said.
   Police said they were unsure whether the pipe bomb was connected
to the controversy, but the bombing occurred about an hour after
directors met to discuss a controversial exhibit planned for later
this month.
   ``We have only that a pipe bomb was thrown through one of the
Cuban museum windows by somebody on foot or in a car,'' said police
spokesman Armando Villorin said. Damage was limited to the glass
door and a section of plaster wall inside the museum.
   The museum flap began when Cernuda included works by artists
considered sympathetic to the Cuban government in an April 22
auction.
   Cernuda was the target of numerous threatening phone calls and
was asked by other museum officials to resign but he refused.

<HEAD>France Expels Syrian Who Helped In Hostage Negotiations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Syrian businessman who has undertaken several
mediation missions for the release of French hostages in Lebanon
was expelled from France, Arab diplomatic and French government
sources said.
   They said Interior Minister Charles Pasqua used a special
administrative procedure that does not require judicial approval to
expel Omran Adham, who is said to be close to President Hafez Assad
of Syria.
   In an interview today with Radio Monte Carlo, Pasqua neither
confirmed nor denied the expulsion, but said:
   ``We cannot accept anyone of foreign nationality in our
territory who, by his actions, hampers the efforts of the French
government and risks causing harm to those who are being held
hostage.''
   Pasqua said Adham had not served as an ``intermediary for the
French government since March 1986'' in negotiations aimed at
freeing French hostages.
   Adham left France on Tuesday by plane for another European
capital after the expulsion order was signed by Pasqua, the sources
said.
   He has a Syrian diplomatic passport but is not on the official
diplomatic list issued by the Foreign Ministry. Adham has lived in
Paris for 11 years and his wife and four children are French.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Pasqua,
who is close to Premier Jacques Chirac, was annoyed by Adham's
statements to the media about an imminent release of French
hostages just before the first round of presidential elections on
April 24.
   A close aide to Pasqua, Jean Charles Marchiani, made several
trips to the Middle East in the weeks before athe voting to try to
obtain the release of the hostages, who are being held by the
pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad.
   The French hostages are two diplomats, Marcel Fontaine, 45, and
Marcel Carton, 62, and journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44. Islamic
Jihad has claimed it killed a fourth French hostage, but his body
has not been found.
   French press reports said release of the hostages before the
April 24 voting was imminent. They said Pasqua's efforts to free
them were designed to boost Chirac's chances in the presidential
campaign.
   Chirac did not do as well as expected in the first round of
voting and now faces President Francois Mitterrand in a runoff
ballot Sunday.
   Both Chirac and Mitterrand have said they have worked together
closely to free the hostages.
   Adham's last known trip to Beirut occurred April 2.
   The French hostages are among 22 foreigners, including nine
Americans, missing in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press, was abducted March 16,
1985 and is the longest held.

<TEXT>
   Pennsylvania lottery officials are reviewing
security measures in the wake of an insider scam that almost
allowed two men to get away with a $15.2 million jackpot.
   Lottery officials revealed Tuesday that a ticket turned in last
week for the jackpot was bogus and an employee at the company that
runs the lottery computer had been charged, along with a man who
claimed the prize.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey ordered a suspension of the contract
extension for Control Data Corp. ``until the commonwealth is
totally satisfied that all reasonable safeguards against fraud have
been built into the security system.''
   One of the two men charged in the case, Henry Arthur Rich,
worked for Control Data as a troubleshooter for the lottery's
mainframe computer.
   State Attorney General LeRoy S. Zimmerman alleged Rich used a
Control Data computer to identify unclaimed jackpots and to print a
copy of the winning ticket from the July 15 Super 7 drawing.
   Also charged was Mark S. Herbst, who claimed the prize last
Thursday.
   Both men were arraigned on charges of theft by unlawful taking,
theft by deception, criminal conspiracy and forgery, and were held
in the Dauphin County Prison in lieu of $50,000 bail.
   Rich also was charged with unlawful use of a computer and
tampering with public information.
   If convicted, Herbst could be jailed for up to 31 years and
fined $70,000, Zimmerman said. Rich could face 40 years in prison
and $90,000 in fines.
   Zimmerman said officials have no evidence of anyone else
participating in the scam or of any other bogus tickets in
Pennsylvania or Delaware, where Rich also had access to the lottery
computer.
   James Scroggins, the lottery's executive director, said the scam
was discovered last Thursday, shortly after Herbst received the
first $469,989 installment of the prize.
   When Herbst claimed the jackpot, he said he had been using the
ticket as a bookmark and checked the numbers after seeing a
newspaper story about the unclaimed prize.
   But the bogus ticket was printed on a blank from a Scranton
outlet, while a computer check showed the actual winner was sold in
Bucks County. The holder of the ticket bought in Bucks County has
never come forward.
   A spokesman at Control Data said Tuesday the firm had been told
by the state Revenue Department not to comment, although Revenue
officials said no such order had been given.
   A previous insider incident occured in the April 24, 1980,
drawing of Pennsylvania's Daily Number. The drawing was fixed by
altering pingpong balls used to pick the winning digits.
   The so-called 6-6-6 case, named after the winning numbers, also
resulted in tighter security for the televised drawings as well as
the convictions of six participants.

   Ousted Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
said he would continue to seek permission to return to his homeland
for his mother's funeral despite the government's refusal.
   Marcos' 95-year-old mother died today in Manila after making a
deathbed request that Marcos be allowed to return so that she could
see him before she died.
   However, Philippines President Corazon Aquino said her
predecessor remained unwelcome in the country as a threat to the
nation's stability.
   Marcos, in a statement, posed his return in political, as well
as personal, terms, saying he wanted to help save the country from
possible civil war or the threat of a communist takeover.
   Marcos and his wife, 20 members of his staff and about 30
supporters gathered this morning to celebrate a Mass in memory of
his mother at the Marcos estate overlooking downtown.
   ``I am completely shocked by the sudden demise of my beloved
mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos,'' Marcos said in the statement read
by his spokesman, Gemmo Trinidad, to reporters outside the walled
estate.
   ``I am sure that our Lord will take my dear mother into his
kingdom to live the eternal life of heaven. This is indeed a very
tragic personal matter for the entire Marcos family,'' Marcos said.
   ``I will exhaust all possibilities that may still be available
to us to return to our motherland, to help save her from the
threatened communist takeover or a possible civil war,'' he said.
   Trinidad said that when Marcos was informed that he would not be
allowed back in the Philippines for mother's funeral, Marcos said
he would continue to negotiate ``but won't violate any laws to go
back.''
   Trinidad said there has been no contact with the Aquino
government and the only word about Mrs. Aquino's decision came from
news reports.
   Asked about how Marcos and his wife, Imelda, were taking the
death, Trinidad said, ``Both of them are calm but sad.''

<TEXT>
   The rules for covering presidential elections
have changed and Jesse Jackson has won a place in historyr,
according members of a panel of journalists at a 75th anniversary
dinner for the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
   The panel members were Benjamin Bradlee, executive editor of The
Washington Post, Patrick Buchanan, co-host of Cable News Network's
program ``Crossfire,'' Max Frankel, executive editor of The New
York Times, and Judy Woodruff, an anchor on the MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour.
   ``The press now has the power to destroy,'' said Buchanan,
referring to the failure of Gary Hart's candidacy for the
Democratic nomination following revelations he spent a weekend with
a Miami model.
   The panelists noted that the infidelities of President Kennedy
and the polio of President Franklin D. Roosevelt were largely
ignored in coverage of their presidential races.
   Frankel said there has been a maturing of reporting and
analysis, but added that journalists ``have not been cured of the
urge to predict and handicap'' the races.
   Television has made progress, Ms. Woodruff said, but is still
too dependent on ``snappy eight-second sound bites'' and is too
preoccupied with polls.
   Bradlee said the 1988 campaign has become the longest ever and
the length was hindering coverage. However, the character issues
have changed the rules of journalism, he said, and the other
panelists agreed with him.
   ``Jesse Jackson changed the political arena for better and
forever,'' he said. He called Jackson ``the candidate of the
left,'' which he said was still vital and alive in the country.
   ``Jackson went beyond winning a victory or winning the
nomination. He won a place in history,'' said Frankel.
   The panel was moderated by Albert Hunt, Washington bureau chief
of The Wall Street Journal. Almost 300 people attended the dinner
and panel discussion in the Rotunda of Low Memorial Library.

<TEXT>
   Fifteen utilities and cities in Washington and
Oregon have agreed to pay $39.4 million to settle securities fraud
claims against them stemming from a bond default on two abandoned
nuclear power plants.
   The agreements announced Tuesday bring to about $243 million the
total settlements reached so far in the giant legal action begun in
1982 after the Washington Public Power Supply System walked away
from the plants and defaulted on $2.25 billion in bonds.
   Money from the bonds was used to start construction of the
plants, WPPSS Nos. 4 and 5.
   The 15 parties settling Tuesday with plaintiff bondholders
included 10 in the Oregon Public Entities group, which held 8
percent of the plants, and a group of five Washington agencies,
with 1.8 percent interest in the plants.
   The Oregon group agreed to pay $32 million, while the five in
Washington agreed to pay $7.4 million.
   Also this week, 24 utilities called the Small Utilities Group
agreed to settle for $25.8 million. They hold a 6.5 percent
interest in the plants.
   The settlements are subject to approval by U.S. District Judge
William Browning, who has presided over the lawsuit. It is
scheduled to go to trial Sept. 7 in Tucson, Ariz.
   The case, dubbed Multi-District Level 551, resulted from the
biggest default in the history of the municipal bond market.
   Eighty-eight utilities agreed to build the two WPPSS plants
during the 1970s, but the plants were abandoned after cost overruns
and an assessment that the power from the plants would not be
needed.
   The plants were among five the supply system attempted to build
a decade ago. One is operating and two others have been partially
completed but mothballed, with prospects uncertain they will ever
be finished.
   Bonds that went to pay for the other three plants are being paid
off by the Bonneville Power Administration, a federal power
marketing agency, through an agreement with the supply system.
Plants Nos. 4 and 5 did not come under the Bonneville umbrella.
   Negotiations continue in efforts to settle the rest of the suit.

   Federal ethics officials want to know why
Attorney General Edwin Meese III solicited 30,000 lawyers and
businessmen to pay more than $3,000 apiece to a profit-making
organization to attend a conference.
   The Office of Government Ethics on Tuesday launched an
investigation into Meese's April 26 letter, said Frank Q. Nebeker,
the head of the ethics office.
   Meese's letter _ written on his official stationery and
emblazoned with the Justice Department seal _ was sent to 30,000
people whose names were ``provided by everyone from the American
Bar Association, the advisory committees on both sides, to the
American Chamber of Commerce in Japan,'' said Norm Swanson,
chairman of the Citizen Ambassador Program, the profit-making group
that is a cosponsor of the meeting along with a Japanese federation.
   A presidential order on ethics forbids federal officials from
engaging in conduct that might present the appearance of
favoritism, conflict of interest or loss of objectivity in
governmental decision making. The appearance of such a problem is
enough to trigger an investigation. It also is a crime to use the
Justice Department seal for non-authorized purposes.
   Meanwhile, sources said Tuesday that Meese reversed a Justice
Department position on the breakup of American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. at a time when he owned $14,000 in regional Bell
stock. And the Los Angeles Times reported today that a Senate
subcommittee will report that Meese violated government policy when
he tried to help the Wedtech Corp.
   Meese will be heading a U.S. delegation to the Aug. 29-Sept. 1
legal and economic conference in Japan called ``The U.S.-Japan
Bilateral Session: A New Era in Legal and Economic Relations.''
   Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland said the department
was unaware that a profit-making organization was involved, but he
contended Meese's involvement might still be justified.
   The U.S. sponsor for the meeting is the Citizen Ambassador
Program of People to People International. The Kansas City,
Mo.,-based People to People International is a non-profit
organization set up originally in the State Department by
then-President Dwight Eisenhower, Swanson said.
   The Citizen Ambassador Program, however, is a profit-making
organization that works exclusively to set up international
exchanges for People to People, Swanson said Tuesday night in a
telephone interview from his home in Spokane, Wash.
   ``Yes, the Citizen Ambassador Program is for-profit, which is
how Eisenhower established the program with the intention of making
it self-supporting,'' Swanson said.
   The cost for participants is listed as $3,240, Swanson said. He
said the amount includes transportation and lodging and an $800
registration fee set by the Japanese organizing committee.
   Swanson acknowledged his company is paying $100 to People to
People International for each person who signs up for the
conference, but he denied that it was a payoff.
   ``Ever since the beginning of the People to People organization,
the relationship has been that the delegates on any project pay a
fee to People to People International to become members,'' Swanson
said. His company collects the fee from participants and pays it to
People to People and the new members ``hopefully become involved in
chapter projects, pen-pal projects, sister city projects and
others.''
   Swanson said he could not say how much profit his company might
earn.
   ``I wish I knew,'' he said. ``It's not large. It depends on the
participation in the conference.''
   Eastland said the Justice Department became involved when
``People to People International came to us and represented
themselves as a non-profit, tax-exempt organization.''
   ``To the extent that they're linked to some group that is
profit-making, that was not known by those making decisions on the
attorney general's participation,'' he said.
   ``It could be argued that the department could engage in a joint
venture so long as it was in the department's interest, and
obviously we have an interest in international legal questions.''
   Meese sent out a similar letter and hosted a U.S. delegation to
a similar conference sponsored by People to People International in
China last summer, Eastland said.
   Justice Department legal and ethics authorities reviewed both
cases to make sure the attorney general's participation was
permissible, he said.
   The department covers Meese's expenses for the trips. This year,
he will be making an official visit at the same time to Japanese
Minister of Justice Yukio Hayashida.
   However, expenses for Meese's wife, Ursula, for last year's trip
were paid by People to People International ``in return for the
frankly exhausting role that she fulfilled in being head of the
women's contingent for the conference,'' Swanson said.
   Eastland said that was permissible under department regulations.
   Swanson said the cost for the China meeting, including
transportation, was about $2,500.
   The two-page letter from Meese says, in part, ``Although
attended and assisted by senior officials of the governments of
both Japan and the United States, the conference is fittingly a
non-governmental one administered on behalf of the Japanese by
Japan's Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) and on the
American side by the Citizen Ambassador Program of the People to
People International organization.''
   ``I invite and encourage your participation. Sincerely Edwin
Meese III, Attorney General.''
   In connection with the AT&T breakup, administration sources told
The Associated Press on Tuesday that Meese was urged by his friend
E. Robert Wallach to get involved, then obtained a White House
waiver letting him make a decision and approved a reversal of the
department's previous position, urging a federal judge to lift
restrictions barring the regional Bell companies from entering
various new types of business.
   Meese, whose telephone stock holdings and meetings with regional
Bell executives have been under criminal investigation, received
Wallach's advice in a memo in mid-December 1986, the sources said.
   Meese's attorney, James Rocap, said Tuesday that he had ``no
knowledge that Mr. Meese ever saw or read the memo,'' and that
Meese's decision to seek a waiver ``was based solely on the advice
of the attorney general's staff.''
   Wallach is under indictment in the Wedtech scandal, in which
Meese remains under criminal investigation.
   The Los Angeles Times reported today that the Senate
Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government
management will report that Meese, as counsel to President Reagan
in 1981, violated a White House ban on intervening in government
contracts on behalf of friends when he tried to help Wedtech.
   Meese's lawyer, Nathan Lewin, disputed the subcommittee's
findings, saying Meese's actions ``did not give the appearance of
impropriety'' and ``did not fall within the scope of the White
House regulation.''

   Michael Dukakis, harvesting another pair of landslide primary
victories, sounded ever more confident of his claim to the
Democratic presidential nomination while rival Jesse Jackson vowed
today he's in the race ``all the way'' despite setbacks in Ohio and
Indiana.
   Republican George Bush looked ahead to the fall and cautioned
his supporters, ``We've got a long way to go.''
   Jackson scored an expected victory Tuesday in the District of
Columbia, but found himself slipping an additional 120 delegates
behind Dukakis, who won handily in Ohio and Indiana.
   His latest victories moved Dukakis to fewer than 600 delegates
from the 2,081 he needs to clinch the nomination. He also moved
more than 600 ahead of his only rival.
   But Jackson gave no sign he was ready to end what he called a
struggle ``for the direction of our party and the soul of our
nation.''
   ``We're within striking distance,'' Jackson said on CBS's ``This
Morning'' program. ``It's not over really till it's over. What's
next is West Virginia and Nebraska, Oregon, New Mexico, California,
New Jersey.''
   Asked if he is in the race for the long run, Jackson replied,
``All the way.''
   Jackson was seeking support today among House Democrats and then
holding strategy sessions with aides before flying off to Nebraska,
which holds its primary Tuesday, as does West Virginia.
   Meanwhile, former Democratic candidate Bruce Babbitt said he
would accept the No. 2 spot on the presidential ticket, but would
advise front-runner Dukakis to select a southerner.
   ``Bruce Babbitt is from southern Arizona, that's not enough,''
Babbitt said on the CBS show. ``It's got to be somebody from the
South ... Sam Nunn or Chuck Robb.''
   But Nunn, the Georgia senator frequently mentioned as a vice
presidential candidate, said today he has ``not very much
interest'' in taking the post.
   ``On a scale of one to 10, 10 being the most interest, my
interest is about level one, so I have not very much interest,''
Nunn said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   The senator said he would discuss the possibility with Dukakis
when the candidate wants to talk.
   ``I've never desired that job, so we'll just have to roll up our
pants when we get to the creek, and we're not to the creek yet,''
he said.
   Democratic Party leaders tempered their euphoria over the latest
signal that their nomination marathon was over with concern that
Jackson's recent attacks on Dukakis could provide campaign
ammunition for the Republicans in the fall.
   ``I would hope he wouldn't say anything that could be used
against Mike in the general election,'' said Gov. Bill Clinton of
Arkansas, who predicted Dukakis would win the Democratic nomination
on the first ballot at the party's convention in July.
   Judy Carnahan, chairman of the Oregon Democratic Party, said
Jackso's recent attacks were ``very disappointing. What he's
managing to do is diminish his own stature.''
   That view was by no means unanimous.
   Lynn Cutler, vice chair of the Democratic National Committee,
said she wasn't concerned about Jackson's rhetoric.
   ``I don't (believe) any of it is stuff we're going to see coming
back at us out of George Bush's mouth,'' she said. ``He's trying to
draw distinctions and I don't blame him for that. I don't think
there is anything there that is problematic.''
   Questioned today about the Democratic leaders' concerns, Jackson
said, ``Well, in this stage, I'm trying to help my chances and
that's the first issue because both of us are running for the
nomination.''
   ``I'm not pushing Dukakis. I'm pulling Dukakis and pulling Bush
into facing issues that will make a difference in this country,''
he said on the CBS program. ``I challenge judgment, distinction and
differences, but not integrity.''
   When Dukakis was asked if he thought Jackson should tone down
his attacks, the Massachusetts governor replied, ``He's got to make
that judgment. I'm going to try to keep this as positive as I can.''
   In recent days, Jackson has repeatedly pressed Dukakis to
provide more details of his plans for improving education and day
care and reducing the federal budget deficit.
   No prominent Democrats were ready to call on Jackson to end his
campaign and Dukakis appeared content to see the contest play out
through the final Democratic primaries on June 7.
   Clinton said there were ``a number of governors who were willing
to endorse him (Dukakis) before this time,'' but were discouraged
by Dukakis.
   ``He just didn't want to be perceived as trying to stop
Jackson,'' said Clinton. ``He wanted to win the votes in the
primaries ahead.''
   Riding high after a streak of primary victories that included
Connecticut, Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Ohio,
Dukakis said Tuesday night he thought it was ``going to be
difficult'' for Jackson to deny him the nomination.
   Bush celebrated his lock on the nomination at a hotel within
walking distance of the White House and urged his supporters not to
let up.
   ``I don't feel any finality to what has happened now at all,''
he told a cheering crowd. ``We've passed the first step, a
tremendously important step. ... But now we've got a long way to
go.''
   The vice president's son, George Bush Jr., urged the partisan
crowd: ``We want you to go out and kick some Mike Dukakis, and kick
him hard.''
   Bush went over the top in his quest for a GOP convention
majority last week in Pennsylvania and at his Washington rally he
offered this preview of the fall campaign:
   ``Let Mike Dukakis go around here talking about pink slips,
despair, pessimism in the United States. I'll be the guy out there
talking about hope and opportunity and challenge.''
   There were 254 delegates at stake in the three primaries.
   The latest Associated Press tally gave Dukakis 1,486 and Jackson
927.
   In Ohio, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Dukakis had
860,896 or 63 percent, to 378,315 or 28 percent for Jackson.
   In Indiana, with 98 percent of the precincts reporting, Dukakis
had 436,955 or 70 percent to Jackson's 138,496 or 22 percent.
   In the District of Columbia, final unofficial returns showed
Jackson had 67,812 votes, or 80 percent, while Michael Dukakis had
14,969, or 17 percent. Jackson captured 13 of the district's 16
Democratic convention delegates. Dukakis won 3.
   On the Republican side, Bush had 648,478 or 81 percent of the
Republican vote in Ohio with 99 percent of the precincts reporting;
341,332 or 83 percent in Indiana with 98 percent of the precincts
reporting; and 5,620 for 89 percent in final unofficial returns in
the District of Columbia, where he resides.

<HEAD>Balloon Over Antarctic Confirms Gold's Supernova Origins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say a balloon flight over
Antarctica has given them confirmation that supernovas are the only
origin of gold and other heavier-than-iron elements such as copper
and lead.
   ``The (1987) supernova explosion itself was one of the most
significant events in 20th century astrophysics, and now it's
giving us an opportunity to answer old questions on the origin of
matter in the universe,'' said Carl Rester, director of APEX, the
recently established Laboratory for Astrophysics and Planetary
Exploration at the University of Florida.
   Elements lighter than iron are formed under normal conditions
within stars, but scientists have long theorized it would take the
shock waves and extremely high temperatures of a supernova
explosion to form most elements heavier than iron.
   Supernova explosions are rare and cause a star to suddenly
become 10 million to 100 million times brighter.
   When astronomers spotted supernova 1987a last February, Rester
saw a unique opportunity and quickly mobilized several agencies to
investigate.
   On Jan. 8, researchers at the University of Florida and the NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center launched a balloon, carrying an
instrument called GRAD, for gamma ray advanced detector, from near
McMurdo Station in Antarctica.
   For three days it floated 22 miles above the earth, suspended
from a helium balloon the size of a football field. From that
vantage point, it had a clear view of supernova 1987a unobstructed
by the Earth's atmosphere.
   The balloon-suspended instrument detected gamma rays from the
radioactive decay of cobalt-56 to iron-56, proving that cobalt,
which is heavier than iron, was formed in the supernova.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration researchers had
detected radiation from cobalt-56 late last year, but Rester says
the GRAD project provided much more detail.
   Color-shift readings also indicate the supernova did not explode
symmetrically as an expanding sphere. Rather, it exploded with
lobes and fingers protruding in several directions, with
significant mixing of its core and mantle.
   Rester said a UCLA scientist is examining the data to try to
further reconstruct the explosion, which occurred 170,000 years
ago, though the light reached the earth only last year.

   Iraqi warplanes bombed an Iranian oil
refinery and a petrochemical complex today and Iran claimed its
anti-aircraft gunners shot down three of the attacking jets.
   The Iraqi raids were the first major attacks on Iranian cities
since the two Persian Gulf war foes halted the latest round of
their so-called ``war of the cities'' April 21. They pounded each
other's cities with more than 300 missiles Feb. 29-April 21.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a
military communique as saying one formation of fighter-bombers
attacked and set fire to the refinery in the southwestern city of
Shiraz. The refinery, one of five in Iran, has a capacity of 48,000
barrels a day.
   Other warplanes hit a petrochemical plant in the area, the Iraqi
report said.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Cyprus, said several people were killed in the raids on Shiraz.
   Two French-built Mirage F-1s were downed in the second raid,
IRNA said.
   The agency reported that one pilot bailed out and was captured.
There was no word on the fate of the other pilot.
   Tehran Radio said a third Iraqi jet was shot down, but did not
say where or give any other details.
   IRNA said an industrial plant in the oil-producing Gachsaran
region, 100 miles west of Shiraz, also was bombed in another Iraqi
raid.
   There was no mention of that raid in the Iraqi communique, which
declared that Iraq would inflict ``further painful blows on the
Iranian regime'' until it complies with the U.N. Security Council
cease-fire resolution passed last July 20.
   Iraq has said it will abide by the resolution if Iran does.
Tehran has said it will not comply until Iraq is branded the
aggressor.
   The Iraqi air force attacks Iran's refineries and other oil
installations to throttle the Iranian economy and force and end to
the 7{-year-old war.
   Oil industry sources have reported that Iran's refining capacity
has been cut by about one-third in recent weeks because of the
bombing. This has forced Iran to import unprecedented amounts of
refined products such as kerosene and jet fuel, the sources said.
They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Iran has reported Iraqi warplanes repeatedly have flown over its
western cities in the last few days. IRNA said the intruding jets
were driven off by anti-aircraft fire.
   Both countries have claimed their border towns have come under
artillery fire recently.
   Both have reported continued artillery battles and skirmishes
along the 730-mile frontline in the past two weeks. But there has
been no major ground action since April 18, when Iraq recaptured
the southern Faw peninsula. Iran seized control of the peninsula in
February 1986.
   Iran has reported sending tens of thousands of men to the front
in a renewed mobilization following naval clashes with the United
States in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. Navy said it sank or disabled
six Iranian vessels in the April 18 fighting.

   It was an auction that publicity-savvy Andy
Warhol would have loved, with enthusiastic buyers shelling out more
than $25 million for the late pop artist's possessions, from
plastic watches to paintings.
   By the time the final gavel fell Tuesday on Sotheby's 10-day
Warhol sale, an estimated 60,000 people had passed through the
auction house's galleries to view his private collection.
   ``We're thrilled,'' said Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's
North America. ``I think that from start to finish, it was one of
the great sales in Sotheby's history.''
   The sale brought in $25.3 million, well above Sotheby's official
pre-auction estimates of $9 million to $13 million but close to
predictions by independent experts.
   ``Our feeling when we figured the estimates was that we wouldn't
add any `Warhol factor,''' said Ms. Brooks. ``I think what we're
seeing today is an indication not only of the `Warhol factor' but
of a very strong art market.''
   But a strong art market does not explain some of the sales, such
as the $2,640 paid for three commercially manufactured, plastic
watches bearing the likenesses of cartoon characters Fred
Flintstone, Judy Jetson and Gumby.
   ``You cannot connect that with the normal art market,'' said
Jeffrey Deitch, a vice president for the Citibank Private Banking
Group who buys art for the bank's clients. ``Warhol had lots of
enthusiastic admirers, and people want something that he chose. It
means something to people.''
   For whatever reason, buyers were willing to pay dearly for just
about anything owned by Warhol, the artist who elevated the
ordinary, like Campbell's soup cans, to art. Warhol died in
February 1987.
   Sales figures included $23,000 for a pair of cookie jars;
$55,000 for a set of Salvador Dali ear clips; and $605,000 for a
Roy Lichtenstein painting, ``Sailboats.''
   Proceeds from the auction go to the Andy Warhol Foundation for
the Visual Arts, which was established by the artist to support
cultural institutions.
   The highest-priced item at the sale was an untitled 1967
painting by Cy Twombley that fetched $990,000, a record for a work
by that artist. It was one of many records set during the sale.
   The enthusiastic bidding, though, was a turn-off to some
professional art dealers.
   ``It's a joke to attempt to buy here,'' complained Geert von der
Veen of Toronto. ``I don't think there are many dealers who could
touch those prices _ or want to. You'd look crazy.''
   Still, he would not say private collectors who claimed their
piece of the Warhol legacy had made a mistake.
   ``Certainly in the past 30 years that I've been in the business,
it really hasn't mattered if someone overpaid _ even grossly
overpaid'' for a work of art, van der Veen said. ``Time proved them
right eventually.''

<HEAD>`Speed-The-Plow,' A New Play By David Mamet, Opens On Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds four grafs at end, further reviews; No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   ``Speed-The-Plow'' has more on its mind than
Madonna.
   In fact, the Broadway debut of one of rock's biggest stars is
not the reason to see playwright David Mamet's brash, biting and
lewdly funny look at the film industry.
   In ``Speed-The-Plow,'' Mamet examines the art of the movie deal,
which is not to be confused with the art of making a good movie.
The play, in three short acts, skewers Hollywood producers with the
same savage humor that Mamet used to dissect Chicago real estate
salesmen in his Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Glengarry Glen Ross.''
   ``Speed-The-Plow,'' which opened Tuesday at Broadway's Royale
Theater, is a small, narrowly focused evening, but it's absolutely
on target, ambushing the egomaniacs who decide what reaches the
silver screen.
   Mamet has created two wonderful, would-be Hollywood magnates,
the kind of guys who wear expensive, baggy Italian suits _ no ties
_ and talk exclusively in movie industry lingo, dropping such lines
as ``greenlighting a project'' or doing ``a courtesy read'' of a
new book for the head of the studio. They have no ready cash and no
apparent class.
   These two producers are also good friends, and Mamet has some
telling comments about what success does to relationships _ both
male and female. Bobby (Joe Mantegna) is the new head of production
at a major studio and Charlie (Ron Silver) has just wangled the
services of a major star for a prison film. They need each other.
   All systems are go on the prison flick until a temporary
secretary, played by Madonna, suggests a film based on a novel
about the historical effects of nuclear radiation. It's that book
the studio chief wanted Bobby to read. And she's ready to be cut in
on the deal.
   Mantegna and Silver are superb. Mantegna is all oily charm. He's
ready to shake hands and stab backs at the same time. Silver
matches Mantegna's obnoxiousness and has a third-act temper tantrum
that will probably bring him a Tony nomination.
   The play has received an extraordinary amount of attention
because of Madonna, but she is a minor and not very successful part
of ``Speed-The-Plow.'' Her acting is tentative, devoid of any
personality. She has none of the oomph needed to hold her own with
the more flamboyant Mantegna and Silver.
   Director Gregory Mosher, long associated with Mamet's plays,
gives the play a hard-edged, staccato style. The actors machine-gun
their lines to each other.
   The setting, designed by Michael Merritt, is odd. Long, flowing
curtains frame Bobby's new office, a collection of furniture
covered with dropcloths.
   ``Speed-The-Plow'' wins this season's award for most obscure
title. It's a variation on a line in ``The Conspiracy of Charles,
Duke of Byron'' by Elizabethan playwright George Chapman. The
expression means ``do your work well'' or at least ``get on with
it.'' Mamet and two members of his cast have followed that advice.
   In other reviews:
   Frank Rich of The New York Times called the play ``riveting
theater'' and ``a worthwhile, funny evening.'' Mamet, Rich writes,
has ``developed into a more inventive storyteller than most people
working in the movies.''
   He also praised the ``intelligent, scrupulously disciplined
comic acting'' of Madonna, whom he said ``needs only more
confidence to relax a bit and fully command her speaking voice.''
   But Howard Kissel, drama critic for the Daily News, says
Madonna's performance falls short. ``Being vacant on the stage
requires more effort than it does in real life,'' he writes.
   ``Elegantly designed, impeccably directed, `Speed-the-Plow' is
Mamet's clearest, wittiest play,'' he concluded. ``I bet it would
be even funnier with an actress.'
   Clive Barnes' New York Post review said the play ``is crammed
with wonderful, dazzling, brilliant lines'' and it calls the cast
of three ``two-thirds perfect and one-third hopeful.''
   ``Madonna tries hard in a Judy Holliday role, but sounds more as
if she were auditioning than acting, and the audition is scarcely
for the big time,'' said Barnes.
   ``Madonna is OK, sort of, but Mamet's `Speed-the-Plow'...with
the irresistible Joe Mantegna and a riveting breakthrough
performance by Ron Silver, is a vicious, scabrous, hilarious,
mean-spirited joy of a play,'' Linda Winer said in Newsday.
   Madonna's performance was ``a gutsy try,'' but in a scene that
she must carry the play comes ``to a screeching stop while we wait
for her to finish and for the professional actors to regain
control,'' said Winer.

   Leftist guerrillas said they kidnapped a
French diplomat, two West German honorary consuls and two Swiss
trade officials. Honorary consuls of France and Panama escaped
kidnap attempts.
   In Bonn, a spokesman for the West German Foreign Ministry
confirmed today that honorary consuls Sigfried Markert and Helmut
Luecker were kidnapped Tuesday and said the government was working
with Colombian officials to win their release.
   Local police said four armed guerrillas kidnapped Markert, 59,
from his metals company in Bucaramanga, 200 miles from Bogota, as
employees watched.
   Callers claiming to represent the Maoist National Liberation
Army later told radio stations the abduction was a ``political
act.'' They said Markert would be freed in three days with a
message for the Colombian government.
   Luecker, West Germany's honorary consul in Medellin, also
disappeared Tuesday. Radio stations received calls claiming the
same rebel group had kidnapped him.
   Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, is 250 miles from the
capital.
   Callers identifying themselves as National Liberation Army
members told Bogota radio stations they had seized Jean Christophe
Rampal, a public information officer at the French Embassy, who
disappeared last weekend.
   In Paris, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said today
French officials in Bogota were ``without news'' of Rampal since
Friday, but could not confirm he had been kidnapped.
   The French spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, did
confirm that Annette Exiga, a French consular agent in Cali,
escaped a kidnap attempt Tuesday thanks to intervention by police.
   Col. Oscar Eduardo Pelez, the police commander in Cali, 190
miles west of Bogota, said one policeman was killed and another
wounded when they stopped the guerrillas, who escaped in a small
car that was later found nearby, he said. It was not known what
group the guerrillas were from.
   Two Swiss officials, Wilfred Lerner and Richard Aufdeeregger,
were captured Tuesday by pro-Castro People's Liberation Army
commandos who attacked the office of the Colombia-Swiss Chamber of
Commerce in Bogota and overpowered 10 workers, police said.
   In Cartagena, 400 miles north of Bogota on the Caribbean coast,
three members of the National Liberation Army entered the
Panamanian consulate, apparently to kidnap Honorary Consul Luisa
Victoria de Porras, police said.
   She escaped and sought help, they said.
   Local police said the three tried to flee on a motorcycle, but
were apprehended.
   In the first two months of this year, Colombia's leftist rebels
kidnapped 14 mayors, attacked a dozen towns, killed 31 soldiers, 28
police and 80 civilians, blew up oil pipelines and electricity
towers and attacked oil company drilling camps.
   When the guerrillas freed the mayors it told them to do more for
poor people in their districts.
   There are five main leftist guerrilla groups in Colombia.

<HEAD>Students Boycott High School in Protest Over Library Books</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students here boycotted school for a day and it
was their parents' idea _ they're protesting a lack of library
books and sports equipment.
   ``We are breaking our necks trying to get the kids to school,''
said principal Richard P. Schnettler. ``Having adults tell them not
to go to school, this has an effect on them.''
   The Juarez School Council organized the demonstration to demand
more money for library books _ especially those for computer
science and those in the Spanish language _ and physical education
equipment.
   About 1,500 of the 1,763 students at the predominately Hispanic
Benito Juarez High School stayed away from classes Tuesday.
   A group of some 200 parents who organized the boycott stood
outside the school to turn away all students except seniors, who
need to fulfill class requirements for graduation.
   After spending a couple of hours at the school, the group
marched two miles to Board of Education headquarters and met with
Deputy Superintendent Joseph Lee, who told them of the lack of
funds.
   ``They're getting their fair share,'' said board spokesman Bob
Saigh. ``In fact, they might be getting more than their fair
share.''
   Protest organizers later met with Schnettler, but failed to
resolve anything, the principal said.
   ``The library is first-class,'' he said. ``None of us is denying
the need for more books.''
   At a meeting of 350 parents and school officials Monday night,
Alfredo Garcia, the leader of the parent's group, said the boycott
was necessary as ``a show of power.''
   After the meeting, Garcia encouraged students to return to
classes today, but to prepare for the possibility of another
boycott next week.

<TEXT>
   Actor-director Robert Redford is leaving
for the Soviet Union on Saturday for a 10-day trip to discuss two
of his favorite subjects, films and the environment.
   Redford was invited last December by Elem Klimov, president of
the Soviet Filmmakers Union. Seven of his films will be shown in
Leningrad, Moscow and Tbilisi.
   While in Moscow, the actor will co-host discussions on global
environment with the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colo., and the
Natural Resources Defense Council, N.Y.
   The two-day meeting was initiated by the Institute for Resource
Management, an organization created by Redford in 1981 that
attempts to find resolutions to environmental conflicts and
controversies.
   Soviet and American scientists and environmental-policy experts
will discuss cooperation on the global warming some scientists
believe is taking place due to ozone depletion in the upper
atmosphere and the buildup of carbon dioxide.
   ``I am honored to be invited at a critical crossroads in the
relationship between our countries,'' said Redford.
   Another workshop in Moscow will focus on Redford's Sundance
Institute for Film and Television in Utah, and on plans for an
exchange between young American and Soviet filmmakers.
   His films to be shown are ``All the President's Men,'' ``The
Sting,'' ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' ``The Natural,''
``Jeremiah Johnson,'' ``The Electric Horseman'' and his latest
directorial effort ``The Milagro Beanfield War.''
   The tour is supported by the U.S. Information Agency's
U.S.-Soviet Exchange Initiative and the American Embassy in Moscow.

   Communist authorities agreed to let
Catholic intellectuals mediate in two major strikes, a Solidarity
activist said today after Lech Walesa warned of ``a bloody
revolution'' if workers don't get a say in reform.
   At the huge Lenin shipyard where Solidarity was born in 1980,
workers in the third day of an occupation strike backed down from a
demand that the outlawed independent labor federation be legalized
nationwide.
   Walesa, a Solidarity founder, said strike leaders decided to
limit the demand to Solidarity's shipyard branch because they felt
they had a greater chance of success.
   ``There will be many different strikes around the country, even
if they crush the shipyard, we will do it,'' Walesa told strikers
after returning to the shipyard today. ``The only reason the entire
country is not on strike is that it is too early.''
   Poland's Roman Catholic bishops declared in a statement today
that Polish society ``has the right to seek to be in charge of its
own fate.'' The statement urged authorities to find common
solutions for Poland by meeting with representative groups.
   It was the first official statement by the church on Poland's
worst wave of labor unrest since 1981.
   In Warsaw, Solidarity activist Henryk Wujec said authorities had
agreed to permit a mediation role for five independent
intellectuals linked with the Catholic Church, which claims 94
percent of Poles as followers.
   He said the five had split into two groups, one leaving for the
Lenin steelworks in the Krakow suburb of Nowa Huta, the other for
the 12,000-worker shipyard in this Baltic port.
   The five included Andrzej Stelmachowski, chairman of the Warsaw
Catholic Intellectuals Club. His wife said he left today at the
request of church authorities for the Nowa Huta steelworks, now in
the ninth day of a strike.
   At church headquarters in Warsaw, a secretary said a meeting was
in progress and no one could comment, but there would be an
announcement later.
   The mood was subdued in Gdansk this morning. There was no heavy
police presence as had been the case Tuesday night.
   About 3,000 workers spent the night in the yard and during the
day their numbers rose to 7,000, said strike committee chairman
Alojzy Szablewski.
   Like the shipyard workers, the 15,000 striking steelworkers in
Nowa Huta are demanding higher wages, an independent union,
reinstatement of fired union activists and release of political
prisoners.
   Chief government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a Warsaw news
conference Tuesday that legalizing Solidarity ``is not a question
that can be an object of negotiations ... It is not negotiable.''
Communist authorities crushed the movement with martial law in
December 1981.
   At the shipyard Tuesday, Walesa told strikers, ``If we don't
achieve a real reform this time, then we will have a bloody
revolution.''
   However, the 44-year-old electrician also said Zdzislaw
Sadowski, the deputy prime minister and architect of the
government's reform program, ``is trying to do something. Let him
talk to us and we can do it together.''
   The government raised prices 42 percent this year as part of an
attempt to overhaul the ailing economy.
   The strikes began April 25 with an 11-hour stoppage by transit
workers in the northwestern city of Bydgoszcz. The strikers won a
60 percent raise.
   The next day, a strike began at Nowa Huta _ the country's
largest steel plant. Workers at the defense-oriented foundry in the
southeastern city of Stalowa Wola won promises of higher pay in a
two-day strike that ended Saturday.
   Walesa today denied a report, which originated with local
Solidarity activist Joanna Wojciechowicz, that 5,000 Gdansk
ship-repair and port workers were idle Tuesday in sympathy with the
Lenin shipyard strike.
   On Tuesday, police in Warsaw dispersed protesters who marched in
support of the strikers while in Krakow, Poznan and Gdansk,
university students staged sympathy strikes, opposition spokesmen
in the four cities said.
   Government and opposition spokesmen confirmed a brief work
stoppage Tuesday at a railroad car plant in Wroclaw, and opposition
spokesmen said about 1,000 miners occupied the Rudna copper mine in
western Poland for eight hours.
   Police have rounded up about a dozen opposition figures and
apparently cut off the telephones of others. Sources said others
went into hiding.
   Walesa told reporters that Bogdan Lis of Gdansk and eight other
regional Solidarity leaders were arrested.
   Urban called the detentions ``preventive.''
   He also reiterated the government position that bowing to
strikers' demands for pay raises of up to 60 percent would upset
economic reform and said strike leaders are ``professional
politicians'' working for Western powers.
   Walesa, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, led the August 1980
strike in Gdansk that toppled a government and co-signed the
accords that made Solidarity the only free labor movement ever
officially recognized in the Soviet bloc.
   The current labor trouble is the worst in Poland since the
crackdown on Solidarity, led by the country's current leader, Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski.

   The Soviet Union conducted a nuclear weapons test
this morning on the steppes of Soviet Central Asia to upgrade its
military technology, the official Tass news agency said.
   It said the 20 kiloton to 150 kiloton underground blast at the
Semipalatinsk test range in Kazakhstan occurred at 5 a.m. Moscow
time, but did not give the exact power of the blast.
   Twenty kilotons, equivalent to the power of 20,000 tons of TNT,
was the force of the U.S. atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan
in 1945.
   This was the fifth Soviet nuclear weapons test this year.
   The Soviets have proposed a moratorium on all such tests, but
U.S. officials have objected because that they disagree with Soviet
proposals on how to enforce the ban.
   A group of Soviet scientists visited Nevada last week to study
ways of verifying U.S.-Soviet compliance with a possible test ban.
In January, American scientists visited the Semipalatinsk range for
the same purpose.

   An electric iron that may have been tipped

   William Loren Ledbetter was pronounced dead at the scene shortly
after firefighters responded to the call, Assistant Fire Marshal
Bill Presley said Tuesday.
   The iron, which was in the infant's room, apparently had been
left on for about three hours, Presley said.
   Ruby Ledbetter told firefighters she was awakened by smoke, but
was overcome as she tried to enter her son's room, Presley said.
   He said fire officials are trying to determine whether a pet cat

<HEAD>Families Reach $58 Million Settlement in Fatal Amtrak Crash</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Retransmits a0563 to add dropped word `million' to summary

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families of the 16 people killed in Amtrak's
deadliest passenger train crash will share a $58 million settlement
reached with Conrail, but relatives said they could never be
compensated for the loss of loved ones.
   ``No it's not fair, but maybe it's as fair as things get. I'd
just as soon see them bankrupt. The fact is, what you want is your
kid back. After that, nothing is fair,'' said Ann Finkbeiner, whose
17-year-old son, Thomas C. Colley, was killed in the collision Jan.
4, 1987, at Chase.
   More than 175 people were injured when three linked Conrail
engines skidded through a stop signal into the path of a
660-passenger Amtrak train traveling about 120 mph.
   The tentative settlement of the families' lawsuits, announced
Tuesday, is subject to the approval of Consolidated Rail Corp.'s
board of directors and various courts.
   The (Baltimore) Sun in today's editions quoted an unidentified
attorney as saying some families will get more than $1 million
based on factors that jurors would have considered had the cases
gone to trial.
   ``Some of the victims had no economic dependents, some were wage
earners with families. Some were trapped for 11 hours and some were
killed instantly,'' the lawyer said.
   But Roger Horn, whose daughter Ceres, 16, died in the collision,
said, ``It could be $580 million and there still would be no
satisfaction in it. Would I rather have my daughter back at the
dinner table at night? Of course.''
   Horn said the image of ``lawyers with sharp pencils coming up
with some horrible measurement of the worth of a life makes me just
want to throw up every time I think about it.''
   Horn said he hoped attention on the settlement would not
distract from the continued effort for improved rail safety.
   ``I know there will be public interest in this settlement, and
that's not bad or inappropriate. But what is really important is
not the lawsuit, but reform legislation in Washington. And here we
are, 16 months after the accident and we don't have a single line
of reform legislation passed yet,'' Horn said.
   He and other relatives of those killed have pushed
unsuccessfully for legislation to require rail, bus and airline
workers in critical positions to be randomly tested for drugs.
Post-accident tests showed traces of marijuana in the blood and
urine of the Conrail engineer and the brakeman.
   Conrail agreed to settle the cases without conceding liability
or the amount of damages incurred. The $58 million is in addition
to $7.5 million Conrail agreed to place in an escrow account as a
part of a proposed settlement of a class-action suit brought by
those injured in the collision.
   A separate lawsuit is pending in which Conrail is seeking to
force Amtrak to cover all amounts paid by Conrail for passenger
injuries and deaths arising from the accident.
   Former Conrail engineer Ricky L. Gates, who missed a track
signal and drove three linked Conrail locomotives through the track
switch, was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty
to manslaughter.
   Gates still faces federal charges for conspiracy, obstruction of
an agency investigation, and lying to investigators from the
National Transportation Safety Board about drug use.

   Democratic primary voters nominated Sen. Howard Metzenbaum for a
third term in Ohio and picked Indiana Secretary of State Evan Bayh
and North Carolina Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan as candidates for governor
in states where Republicans now have the job.
   Metzenbaum, 70, swamped a political newcomer in Tuesday's
balloting and will face Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, the
uncontested GOP nominee who promised ``a barn-burner'' of a fight.
The two have already raised more than $7 million between them.
   ``You mark my words,'' Voinovich, 51, told supporters. ``The
most focused-on race in the United States is going to be
Metzenbaum-Voinovich.''
   Metzenbaum said he was eager to run on his record as one of the
most liberal members of Congress. And in a reference to his
opponent and GOP presidential standard-bearer George Bush, he
added, ``As I've said before: when the votes are counted in
November, I'm confident that 1988 will be a very disappointing year
for Republican candidates named George.''
   Final, unofficial returns showed Metzenbaum had 1,067,138 votes
or 83 percent, and his lone opponent, Ralph Applegate, who runs a
Columbus lawn-care business, had 213,120 votes or 17 percent.
   Also in Ohio, former Cleveland Mayor Dennis Kucinich, who
preceded Voinovich in office and was blamed for much of the city's
fiscal crisis, failed in his latest comeback bid. He lost to Rep.
Mary Rose Oakar by a 3-1 margin in a Democratic congressional
primary.
   Bayh, son of former Sen. Birch Bayh and owner of one of
Indiana's most respected political names, swamped his only rival
and will face Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz, who had no primary
opposition.
   With 93 percent of precincts reporting, Bayh had 450,110 votes
or 83 percent and former Kokomo Mayor Stephen J. Daily had 61,531
votes or 11 percent. Senate Minority Leader Frank L. O'Bannon, who
had 31,580 votes or 6 percent, was put on the ballot by the Bayh
campaign in case Bayh had been disqualified because of a residency
challenge.
   With Gov. Robert Orr barred by state law from seeking a third
term, Democrats see a golden opportunity to end 20 years of GOP
rule, and Bayh said as he claimed victory that his campaign would
be ``as important as any in the history of Indiana.''
   A poll published Sunday by the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette showed
Bayh with a 45 percent to 32 percent lead over Mutz. The phone poll
of 1,017 registered voters from April 23-28 had an error margin of
3.1 percentage points.
   Mutz wasted no time in renewing his claim that Bayh, at 32 and
after less than two years in statewide office, is too young and
inexperienced to be governor.
   ``This is a comparison of abilities to lead a very large
institution, that being the state of Indiana,'' said Mutz, who has
spent 20 years in state government.
   Introducing his family at a victory gathering, Mutz, 52, looked
at his son, Mark, and said: ``Like another young attorney who's
been practicing law in Indiana for less than two years, he's not
ready to be governor.''
   Indiana also has a Senate race this year, but neither Republican
Sen. Richard G. Lugar nor Democratic attorney Jack Wickes was
opposed for his party's nomination.
   In North Carolina, Jordan easily turned back four opponents for
a chance to face Gov. Jim Martin, who had no primary challengers in
his bid for a second term. Martin is only the state's second
Republican governor this century.
   With 97 percent of the vote in, Jordan had 395,904 votes or 80
percent. Next came Billy Martin, a service-station employee not
related to the governor, with 59,103 votes or 12 percent; then
Carroll W. Crawford of Mount Ulla, a former Ku Klux Klansman, with
21,692 votes or 4 percent; James T. LLoyd of Salisbury with 10,158
votes or 2 percent, and Bruce Friedman, an anti-nuclear activist
from Sylva, with 9,332 votes or 2 percent.
   Jordan said his battle against the governor would be ``a classic
race'' and claimed he was steadily narrowing Martin's lead. The
Greensboro News & Record reported that a recent survey showed
Jordan trailing Martin 47 percent to 39 percent with 14 percent
undecided. The phone poll April 23-26 of 834 voters had an error
margin of 3.5 percentage points.
   Merle Black, political science professor at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said Jordan's challenge was ``to
present a positive agenda that will excite Democrats and
independents to vote for him.
   ``But he's also running as an underdog and he's got to give
people reasons why Jim Martin shouldn't be re-elected,'' Black said.

   Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan has won the
right to challenge his Republican boss, Gov. Jim Martin, easily
defeating four opponents in a primary election.
   ``It's the highest honor and the best opportunity the North
Carolina people have ever given me,'' Jordan said Tuesday in an
interview outside his hotel room after winning.
   Jordan said his general election battle against Martin would be
``a classic race'' and said he was steadily narrowing the
incumbent's lead.
   Jordan had 391,482 votes, or 80 percent, with 96 percent of
unofficial returns in. His closest opponent, Billy Martin, a
service-station employee not related to governor, received 58,150
votes, or 12 percent.
   As lieutenant governor, Jordan, 55, put forward policy
initiatives on economic development and dropout prevention,
including a controversial plan to withhold driver's licenses from
minors who quit school.
   He attacked Martin, 52, as a governor who had done little of
substance while taking credit for Democrats' accomplishments.
   Martin, who had no opposition for the GOP nomination, hopes to
become the first Republican governor in North Carolina to serve
consecutive terms. He was only the state's second GOP governor this
century.
   Martin, a former six-term congressman and Davidson College
chemistry professor, pointed to glowing economic statistics during
his term and questioned Jordan's leadership skills.
   Early in the campaign, newspaper polls showed Martin with leads
ranging from 14 to 30 percentage points. But the Greensboro News &
Record reported last week that a survey it commissioned showed
Jordan trailing by only 47 percent to 39 percent with 14 percent
undecided. The phone poll April 23-26 of 834 voters had an error
margin of 3.5 percentage points.
   Other Democratic candidates running Tuesday were Bruce Friedman,
an anti-nuclear activist from Sylva; Carroll W. Crawford of Mount
Ulla, a former Ku Klux Klansman; and James T. Lloyd of Salisbury.

<HEAD>Prince Charles Objects To New Building Near His Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swayed by a complaint from Prince Charles, city
authorities said today they have withheld permission to build a
nine-story apartment house overlooking the Kensington Palace
residence of the heir to the British throne.
   The planning committee for the London boroughs of Kensington and
Chelsea said it deferred its decision after receiving a letter
``from a very eminent neighbor'' just before a Tuesday night
meeting.
   Regalian Property Ltd. wants to put up a building with 45
apartments worth between $4.6 million and $11.2 million each on
two-thirds of an acre near the palace.
   The letter to the council, written on Buckingham Palace
stationery, was signed by David Wright, the prince's deputy private
secretary, said a borough spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The building seems to us to be an overdevelopment of the
site,'' the spokesman quoted the letter as saying.
   He said the committee would reconsider the application only
after the architect revised the plans.
   Charles' intervention came as no surprise. The prince has
outspokenly criticized modern architects, whom he has accused of
ruining London's skyline and ignoring the opinions of ordinary
people.
   Committee chairman Simon Orr-Ewing said the panel might have
withheld permission regardless of the prince's opinion, because the
new building was ``too tall'' and the architecture ``insensitive.''
   But the letter from the palace ``added some sway _ I certainly
can't deny that,'' he added.

<HEAD>Defense Secretary Says Congressional Opposition Scuttled Coast
Guard Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
acknowledged today the Reagan administration scuttled plans to send
Coast Guard ships to the Persian Gulf because of strong
congressional opposition.
   ``There were considerable objections on the part of the
(Capitol) Hill when we consulted the Hill and we decided it would
be best not to go ahead at this time,'' Carlucci said on CBS's
``This Morning'' program.
   The Pentagon had been considering taking up to six Coast Guard
boats off anti-drug patrols and sending them to the gulf. But the
idea was sharply criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said earlier this week that the plan ``was a non-starter
from the beginning and I'm glad Carlucci could understand that.
That idea was going nowhere.''
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said the decision came after Carlucci
listened ``carefully to those of us in Congress, including myself,
and the leadership who suggested that this would not be the right
time to take Coast Guard vessels from the United States.''
   The administration is using its naval fleet to protect 11
Kuwaiti-owned but U.S.-flagged tankers. The Navy announced this
week that it will respond to pleas for help from any neutral
merchant ships which are attacked in the war-torn gulf.
   Carlucci said the Coast Guard ships have an advantage over Navy
warships because ``they're shallow-draft ships and therefore less
vulnerable to mines and we looked at it from a military point of
view.''
   Two U.S. ships have struck mines in the gulf in the last year.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Proposing Seven-Day Cooling-Off Period to
Voters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After an appeal by Miami's mayor, the
state House Criminal Justice Committee has approved a measure that
would let voters decide whether to impose a seven-day waiting
period for all handgun purchases.
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez said the cooling-off period was needed
to help prevent a repeat of shootings like three in the Miami area
aimed at law enforcement officers, one of whom was killed.
   ``I've been on national TV the last few days constantly
answering questons on Miami being Dodge City,'' said Suarez. ``Our
circumstances right now in Miami are not good.''
   If the measure approved by the committee Tuesday is passed by
the full House and Senate, voters will decide in November whether
to add the waiting period to the Florida Constitution.
   Rep. Ron Silver, the measure's sponsor, said he proposed the
waiting period in part to counteract the damage to the state's
image from a 1987 law making it easier for people to carry
concealed weapons.
   ``As a result of the legislation we passed, ... we have
nationally achieved not the reputation I would like,'' said Silver.
``We have achieved bad press.''
   Silver said that if his legislation fails, he would back a

<HEAD>More Getting Refunds Despite New Law, Murky Forms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More Americans received federal tax refunds
this year than last despite a thorough revision of the tax law and
a confusing withholding form, the Internal Revenue Service said
today.
   Through April 29, the latest figures available, the IRS had
certified 55.5 million refunds, compared with 55.4 million at the
same time last year. Refunds were claimed on 79.5 percent of the
returns that had been processed, up from 79.1 percent a year ago.
   ``Apparently withholding was more in line with tax liability
than we had been expecting,'' said IRS spokesman Johnell Hunter.
   Tax experts had anticipated that fewer people might qualify for
refunds this year because the new tax law required all employees to
file new W-4 withholding forms with their employers in 1987.
   The first version of the new form was designed to match tax
liability with withholding. But it was so confusing that the IRS
eventually developed an alternative, W-4A, that was simpler but
less accurate.
   Another forecast _ that fewer people would itemize deductions
under the new law _ was closer to target. Through April 15,
slightly fewer than half the 49 million couples and individuals who
filed the long form, 1040, itemized deductions, compared with 60
percent last year.
   Through Friday, the IRS had received 98.6 million returns, a 2
percent increase over 96.7 million in the same period in 1987.
Before the year is out, the agency anticipates 107.6 million total
filings, compared with 104 million last year.
   Some other statistics from this year's filing season:
   _Almost 4.8 million people have asked so far for automatic
four-month extensions beyond the April 15 filing deadline. At this
time last year, the IRS had counted about 4.4 million. For reasons
the IRS cannot explain, the number of extensions fluctuated
significantly among the 10 regional centers. At Philadelphia,
extensions were 28 percent below last year's mark while at
Cincinnati they were up 47 percent.
   _The average refund this year has been $850, compared with just
under $849 last year.
   _The IRS has processed 69.9 million returns so far this year,
down 0.2 percent from 70 million in 1987.
   _Only slightly more couples and individuals hired professionals
to fill out their returns this year, despite confusion about the
new law. Through April 15, 45.6 percent of the returns were
professionally prepared, compared with 44.9 percent at the same
time last year.

<HEAD>Bayh Wins Nomination For Governor; Dukakis Takes Primary</HEAD>

   Secretary of State Evan Bayh overcame
questions about his youth and inexperience, trouncing his opponent
for Indiana's Democratic nomination for governor.
   In the presidential primaries, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis and Vice President George Bush rolled to easy victories.
   Bayh, the 32-year-old son of former Sen. Birch E. Bayh, piled up
nearly an 8-1 victory margin over former Kokomo Stephen J. Daily,
who had tried to draw attention to Bayh's lack of experience.
   ``He's shown in very dramatic and powerful fashion that the
voters _ at least the Democratic voters _ don't think that's an
issue,'' said Daily, 40.
   With 81 percent of precincts reporting, Bayh had 382,390 votes,
or 83 percent, to 51,146, or 11 percent for Daily. Bayh was beating
Daily in each of Indiana's 92 counties, including Howard County,
Daily's home.
   Bayh will face Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz, 52, who was unopposed for
the Republican nomination. Current GOP Gov. Robert D. Orr, who at
71 is the nation's oldest governor, was barred from seeking a third
straight term.
   Bayh, if elected, would be the state's youngest chief executive
this century. Only Jonathan Jennings, first governor of Indiana
after it became a state in 1816, and James B. Ray, the fourth, were
younger.
   A poll published Sunday by the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette showed
Bayh with a 45 percent to 32 percent advantage over Mutz in a
preview of the fall race. The telephone poll of 1,017 registered
voters from April 23-28 had an error margin of 3.1 percentage
points.
   In the presidential primary, with 80 percent of the vote
counted, Dukakis had 350,074 votes, or 70 percent, to Jesse
Jackson's 110,507 or 22 percent, with the remainder divided among
candidates who have dropped out of the race.
   In the Republican race, with 80 percent of the precincts
reporting, Bush, who has clinched the GOP nomination, had 292,072
votes, or 84 percent. The remainder went to Kansas Sen. Bob Dole
and former television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   The state will send 79 delegates to the Democratic convention
and 51 to the Republican meeting.
   Bayh, in claiming victory, said, ``This campaign begins tonight
and it will be as important as any in the history of Indiana.''
   He challenged Mutz to a series of debates.
   Mutz said he liked the idea of debating his opponent, saying it
would compare ``abilities to lead a very large institution, that
being the state of Indiana.''
   Mutz, a 20-year veteran of government service, has tried to make
an issue of Bayh's youth and his relative lack of experience after
only two years in statewide office.
   Introducing his son, Mark, at a victory gathering, Mutz said,
``Like another young attorney who's been practicing law in Indiana
for less than two years, he's not ready to be governor.''
   Senate Minority Leader Frank L. O'Bannon, whose name was placed
on the Democratic ballot by Bayh's campaign in case Bayh lost a
challenge to his eligibiity, ran a distant third. The state Supreme
Court said last week that Bayh met the state's five-year residency
requirement, despite a sojourn in Washington.
   Two-term Republican Sen. Richard G. Lugar and Democrat Jack
Wickes, an Indianapolis attorney, were unopposed for Senate
nominations.

   Pro football's Mark Gastineau and athletic
actress Brigitte Nielsen are expecting a baby, Gastineau says.
   The New York Jets' defensive lineman, checking into his team's
preseason minicamp Tuesday, said that he and Sylvester Stallone's
ex-wife, whom he has been dating since January, are both delighted.
   But he wouldn't divulge the due date, telling reporters, ``You
can just say ... that she's pregnant.
   He said the couple would marry as soon as his divorce from his
estranged wife, Lisa, becomes final.
   ``This is the first time I've ever been in love,'' the
31-year-old Gastineau said. He reported his fiance is also
``happier than she has ever been about anything.''
   Gastineau was once the beefy star of the Jets' ``sack
exchange,'' but his performance has slumped the last two seasons.
He and Nielsen met while working out at a San Diego health club
during Super Bowl week.
   Nielsen, a statuesque blond who has appeared in such adventure
films as ``Red Sonia,'' was in Rome on Tuesday to start work on a
new movie, ``Domino.''

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Presser Too Ill To Prepare Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teamsters President Jackie Presser's recurring
health problems have made him incapable of preparing his defense
against federal racketeering and embezzlement charges, according to
a letter filed in federal court.
   The letter, hand-delivered by Presser's lawyer, John R. Climaco,
to U.S. District Judge George W. White, sharply contradicts a
medical report by an endocrinologist hired by the government and
appears to be a prelude to a request to delay the trial, set to
open July 12.
   The doctor hired by federal prosecutors, Dr. John J. Canary,
said on Feb. 26 that Presser could work four hours a day.
   ``He (Presser) has been advised by his treating physicians and a
renowned endocrinologist that Dr. John Canary's findings border on
the preposterous,'' Climaco wrote. ``He is not currently capable of
assisting in his defense.''
   Climaco's letter Tuesday was his first public comment after
published reports that Presser had health problems that required
two recent hospital visits. Presser's medical history includes
open-heart surgery in 1985 and the removal of a malignant lung
tumor in January 1987.
   The letter and a motion filed in federal court Tuesday repeated
Climaco's demands for documents showing the ``symbiotic
relationship'' among Presser, co-defendant Anthony Hughes and the
FBI.
   ``It's time to remove the cloak of secrecy the government has
used to hide the facts of this case from the defendants and this
court,'' the motion states.
   The motion says the government's file is essential to show a
jury ``the importance, length and value of the informant
relationship which existed between cooperating citizens Presser,
Hughes and the FBI.''
   Federal prosecutors asked White on Monday to order Presser's
lawyers to provide them with Presser's latest medical records.
   Presser, Hughes and Harold Friedman are accused of participating
in a payroll-padding scheme at Cleveland Teamsters Local 507.

<TEXT>
   The former secretary to the executor of
Liberace's estate says she took copies of documents from his files
because she thought he was stealing from the estate and wanted to
expose him.
   Helaine Golding, in testimony Tuesday, admitted she told
acquaintances she was so angry with attorney Joel Strote that she
threatened to sell her story on Liberace to the National Enquirer.
   ``I said everyone should know what this man's done,'' she said.
``I said I will go to the Enquirer so everyone knows.''
   Five Liberace associates have filed a civil lawsuit seeking to
have Strote removed as executor and trustee, claiming Liberace was
too ill to know what he was doing when he signed documents Jan. 22,
1987.
   Ms. Golding claimed Strote billed the estate of the famous
pianist for time he actually spent with other clients, from
professional wrestlers to disc jockeys.
   She also alleged he got Liberace to sign blank documents in the
final weeks before his death from AIDS on Feb. 4, 1987. She said
Strote warned her ``Be careful of these, we can't get another
signature. Don't screw up.''
   Strote drew up Liberace's will and had it signed 13 days before
the entertainer's death. The new will made Strote executor of the
estate and head of two Liberace trusts.
   Ms. Golding said she went to work for Strote Jan. 5, 1987 and
handled most of the correspondence involving Liberace. She said she
sent copies of all correspondence to the entertainer until
mid-January when Strote told her to quit doing so, saying Liberace
could no longer read and understand the material being sent him.
   She said Strote was visibly upset when he returned from a visit
to Liberace's Malibu, Calif. condominium Jan. 15, 1987, the day he
met with the entertainer to draft a new will.
   ``Mr. Strote said `He looks awful. It's all over,''' Ms. Golding
testified.
   Ms. Golding said Strote presented her with copies of quitclaim
deeds that were blank except for Liberace's signature, and told her
to type in legal descriptions of Liberace real estate.
   ``I remember seeing how shaky it was,'' she said. ``It wasn't
the usual flourish.''

   ``I thought my rainbow had come in,'' George
Wells said.
   There were signs of trouble, though. For one thing, the rainbow
ended in a can of paint, not a pot of gold.
   Wells and Anthony Verdile, both New York State Bridge Authority
workers, were on the catwalk of a bridge over the Hudson River
making a routine check Tuesday when Verdile spotted the can about
30 feet below the road.
   He went climbed down and opened the can to find scads of $20
bills. He climbed back up and found a slight hitch.
   ``As soon as you looked at them you could tell they were
counterfeit because all had the same serial numbers,'' said Verdile.
   Except for that detail, the counterfeit bills were ``pretty well
done,'' said Sgt. Dennis Cody of the State Police after the $39,900
was inspected and counted.
   ``I guess I'll just keep playing Lotto,'' Verdile said.

<HEAD>Fugitive Who Used Dead Man's Identity for 12 Years Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has been found out and
arrested 12 years after he skipped out on drug charges and began
living the life of a well-respected, law-abiding citizen under a
dead man's name.
   The new life he had built for himself was shattered Tuesday,
police said, when Florida law agents arrested the man who called
himself Danny Lee Wallen.
   Agents said Wallen, general manager of a seafood restaurant, was
really Paul Henry Haulk, who jumped bail on Hillsborough County
heroin charges in 1976.
   Miste Wallen, the arrested man's wife, was astounded when she
learned her husband and the father of their two preschool boys
really was named Haulk and that he had been arrested.
   ``We've been married for six years. I knew him for three years
before that'' in her hometown of Destin, she said. Mrs. Wallen said
she never had heard the name Haulk. ``He's a wonderful man,'' she
said.
   At an initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Paul Game Jr. on
Tuesday, Haulk said he had been an addict but was clean under his
assumed name of Wallen.
   Haulk is charged with the federal crime of giving phony Social
Security numbers to get a driver's license and bank loans. Each
count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
   Ruling he was a risk to flee prosecution, Game ordered Haulk
held without bail until a hearing Friday.
   According to court records, Haulk's first arrest came on a
charge of selling LSD in 1969 when he was 19. A series of drug
arrests followed.
   Twice in 1976, on May 13 and 26, Haulk was arrested in Tampa and
charged with heroin possession, according to court records. He was
released on $5,000 bail, but failed to show up and an arrest
warrant was issued.
   Haulk, who assumed the name of Wallen after that man had been
buried for more than a year, recently came to the attention of
Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents while they were
looking for a another fugitive.
   Agent Tom Beach found that the description on Wallen's driver's
license didn't match the man who was carrying it. In tracing
telephone calls, he found that one woman ``Wallen'' frequently
called in Tampa was Haulk's mother.
   Confronted at work Tuesday, Haulk ``did not deny who he was,''
Beach said.

<TEXT>
   The famed Cape Hatteras lighthouse in North
Carolina could be moved about 500 feet inland to save it from an
eroding seashore, a committee of experts decided in a National
Research Council report.
   The report said that errosion has placed the 208-foot-tall
landmark, which has flashed its warning to mariners for more than
100 years, in danger of being damaged or destroyed by a severe
hurricane.
   Errosion has whittled the beach to within 160 feet of the tower,
according to the report, which was made available this week.
   Moving the lighthouse would be a more practical way of saving it
than trying to protect the site from erosion by the sea, the study
said. Other methods of protecting the lighthouse, such as building
a seawall around it, also were examined.
   The landmark structure is the tallest brick lighthouse in the
United States and weighs about 2,800 tons. The lighthouse was built
in 1870 on a point of the North Carolina barrier islands to warn
sailors of the Diamond Shoals area just outside the islands.
   The National Park Service asked for the study. The National
Research Council is the operating agency of the National Academies
of Sciences and Engineering. The study does not comment on the
advisability of saving the lighthouse, but addresses only the
technical ways of doing so.

   A free steak while chatting with a
Penthouse Pet is just one of the factors that led truckers
nationwide to tab the SOS Auto-Truck Stop one of the best truck
stops in the country.
   ``We listen to the truck drivers,'' said Jack Neal, marketing
officer for SOS Oil Co., which owns the truck stop. ``That's simple
and basic, but it's often ignored by retailers.''
   The truck stop was picked as one of the nationi's top 50 in a
recent survey of drivers by Chevron Oil Co. Chevron got about
15,000 responses from a mail survey and by leaving questionaires at
truck stops, giving those who responded a token gift. Truck stops
were not ranked numerically.
   The SOS promotion last year, which allowed drivers with
commercial licenses to dine on free steaks while talking to
Penthouse Pet Susan Napoli, drew more than 4,000 drivers a day.
   Other reasons cited for the stop's popularity are good home
cooking, abundant parking space and clean bathrooms _ three musts
for truckers.
   ``Their food is reasonable. We pigged out at lunch for four
bucks apiece,'' said Anne Johnson as she rested in a vinyl booth
with her driving partner and husband B.J. Johnson. ``You can't find
that in any of the other truck stops.''
   The 24-hour truck stop, is easy to miss. The only sign visible
to west-bound truckers on Interstate 20 is a Phillips 66 sign with
``FOOD'' underneath.
   ``This is their home away from home,'' Neal said. ``They're
looking for a clean, secure environment, and we try to offer them
what they're looking for.''
   The truck stop also boasts a well-stocked convenience store
where customers can pick up a fishing rod, a watch, underwear or
souvenir Elvis plates.
   Next door is self-service gasoline and a repair shop also open
24 hours.
   Trucker Harold Kelley visits SOS four times a week at times in
his Peterbilt on hauls from Tennessee to Texas.
   Kelley, 55, stopped Tuesday for the ice cream and coffee lunch
special.
   ``They've got hospitality here,'' Kelley said. ``I get good
service when I come here, and I never have gotten bad food.''

<HEAD>Attorney General To Withdraw From Financial-Disclosure
Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state attorney general says that to
avoid the appearance of a conflict he will turn over his
investigation of Gov. Rose Mofford's financial disclosures to a
county attorney's office.
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham criticized Attorney General Bob Corbin
for the Tuesday decision, saying Corbin should have the ``guts'' to
do his duty. Corbin's office is currently prosecuting Mecham for
campaign reporting violations.
   Corbin said Tuesday he decided to withdraw from the
investigation of whether Mrs. Mofford had violated financial
disclosure statutes because he is next in line to become governor.
   ``If I were to bring charges, I would be accused of doing it to
become governor,'' he said. But he said the investigation would be
called ``a whitewash'' if it cleared Mofford.
   Mrs. Mofford succeeded Mecham because she was secretary of
state; her successor as secretary of state cannot become governor
because he was appointed, not elected.
   ``There is no legal conflict,'' Corbin said, ``but there is an
appearance. I decided it would be better if we had somebody else
take a look at it.''
   Mrs. Mofford has acknowledged that she erred in not reporting a
series of loans, land holdings or other deals on her
financial-disclosure statements dating back to 1978. She filed
amended reports last week and made public 150 pages of legal
documents.
   Her news aide, Vada Manager, said Mrs. Mofford feels she will be
exonerated and has no problem with an independent counsel
conducting the investigation.
   Corbin said Tuesday night that he had asked Pima County Attorney
Stephen Neely to conduct the probe. Corbin said Neely would have
the option of bringing in another county attorney if necessary to
assist in the investigation.
   In the past, Corbin has called on Neely, or other county
attorneys, to handle cases when the attorney general's office has
had a conflict.
   Mecham, who is being prosecuted by Corbin for failing to
disclose a $350,000 campaign loan, was critical of the attorney
general for withdrawing from the Mofford probe.
   ``Tell him to have the guts to stand up and do his duty,'' said
Mecham, whose criminal trial begins May 19. ``Don't take a powder.
Don't run out of it. Conflict of interest? When did conflict of
interest have anything to do with him? Don't hide behind a conflict
of interest.''
   Corbin had a conflict of interest when he investigated Mecham,
but ``that didn't dissuade him,'' the former governor said.

   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., was listed
in satisfactory condition today, one day after surgeons corrected
an aneurysm on an artery which supplies blood to the right side of
his brain, a Walter Reed Army Medical Center spokesman said.
   ``Senator Biden spent a restful night and is in good spirits.
His condition is satisfactory,'' said spokesman Peter Esker.
   The 4{-hour operation, called clipping, was similar to the one
performed Feb. 12 on Biden's left side. Under the procedure, a
surgeon using a microscope pinches the aneurysm with a small clip,
bringing the walls of the artery together. The clip remains in the
patient.
   Esker said there are no signs of any other aneurysms, adding the
second was much smaller than the first.
   ``The senator is awake and alert, oriented, moving all
extremities well and is conversing with his family. He is expected
to be hospitalized about 10 days and then would go home to
recuperate,'' Esker said.
   Biden, 45, is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and was
a Democratic presidential candidate for a few months last year.

<HEAD>Army Simulates Germ Warfare in Open Air Tests at Utah Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUGWAY PROVING GROUND, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has conducted 173
open-air trials of organisms that simulate hazardous germ warfare
agents over the last decade at this base in western Utah's desert,
a spokeswoman said.
   Information provided to Congress by Dugway scientists shows that
since 1978, the Army conducted eight major experiments involving
biological agents at the base. Those experiments required 173
releases of organisms into the air.
   The purpose of the experiments is defensive, according to the
Army. They allow the military to test such items as germ warfare
detectors and alarm systems designed to alert troops they are under
germ-warfare attack; to test whether certain chemicals might
protect against an attack; and to see how well tank-protection
systems work.
   Dugway spokeswoman Kathleen Whitaker said that in 1977, the Army
released information about open-air testing up to that time. Those
documents listed at least 84 tests at Dugway, some using simulants
for hazardous germs and some using actual biological agents that
were banned in 1969.
   A simulant is an organism that is similar to hazardous germs,
exhibiting some of the same characteristics, but is not considered
harmful itself by Army scientists. It can be either naturally
occurring or a manmade strain.
   According to the Deseret News, however, some scientists believe
that certain of the simulants are more dangerous than the Army
thought.
   Four trials in 1978 used the simulant Serratia marcescens. The
test was to determine whether substances used to neutralize
chemical weapons could do the same against biological weapons.
   The Army has said that organism is harmless, but has since
discontinued its use. In 1979, Victor Yu, a specialist in
infectious diseases, published an article saying the organism can
cause meningitis, wound infection and arthritis.
   One hundred sixty-six of the remaining 169 tests since 19877
used the Niger variant of Bacillus subtillus, which the Army also
says is safe.
   However, Rutger University professor Leonard A. Cole, in his
book ``Clouds of Secrecy,'' said doctors fear Bacillus subtillus
may cause infections and invade the bloodstream in debilitating
diseases. He said some scientists have also suggested that the
organism can easily serve as a carrier for other dangerous viruses.
   Whitaker, the Army spokeswoman, said the Niger strain is
harmless, although other strains are not.
   The last such open-air test, according to the Army, was
conducted in September 1986.

   A federal appeals court today delayed the
midnight deadline of the illegal alien amnesty program _ at least
in New York state _ pending appeal by state officials.
   The length of the delay and whether it affected undocumented
aliens outside New York were not clear immediately.
   Two judges on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan
told lawyers for both sides to work out an order detailing the
limits of the stay.
   Circuit Judge James L. Oakes said that if the parties could not
work out an agreement by 3 p.m., the court would issue a stay
pending a hearing of the appeal.

<TEXT>
   Iran said today it arrested a Saudi
Arabian spy in Tehran after he entered the country illegally
carrying $4.5 million.
   Saudi Arabia severed relations with Iran last week. The expelled
Iranian diplomats arrived home today and accused the Saudis of
beating them and of taking documents from their offices _ claims
denied by Saudi Arabia.
   There was no immediate Saudi comment on the Iranian report that
a spy had been arrested.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said security officials ``arrested an agent of the Riyadh
regime who had entered the country illegally with 300 million rials
($4.5 million).''
   It quoted an unidentified Information Ministry official as
saying the man, whose name was not disclosed, was planning to
``spread Wahhabi faith and the American brand of Islam.''
   The Saudi ruling family and most other Saudis are Wahhabis, a
conservative Sunni Moslem sect. Saudi Arabia, like the other
Persian Gulf Arab states, is run by Sunnis, while Iran's Islamic
government and most Iranians are Shiite Moslems.
   IRNA did not say when the man was arrested. However, it charged
intelligence reports had confirmed links between Wahhabi groups
inside Iran and Saudi Arabia and U.S. agents.
   It said the man arrested ``will be dealt with as a spy.''
Convicted spies may be sentenced to death under Islamic law.
   IRNA quoted Iranian charge d'affaires Mohammed Hussein Tarani as
saying Saudi security forces raided Iran's embassy in Riyadh and
the Iranian consulate in Jiddah on Tuesday and beat Iranian
staffers.
   The agency reported Tarani said the Saudis took many important
documents and forced the Iranians from their homes. He made the
accusations upon arriving at Tehran airport today, IRNA said.
   Tuesday was the deadline set by Saudi Arabia for Iranian
diplomatic personnel to leave the kingdom.
   Diplomatic sources in Riyadh said the Iranian embassy and
consulate were vacant by dusk Tuesday, with only a few Saudi
policemen patrolling outside each building. They said they believed
the Iranian personnel had left peacefully and there had been no
violence.
   The official Saudi Press Agency today quoted an unidentified
government official as calling the Iranian accusations ``completely
false and totally baseless.
   ``All personnel of the Iranian consulate and embassy, taking
along all their equipment, left in a calm, peaceful manner without
any harm befalling them,'' the official was quoted as saying.
   The official noted the Saudis did not retaliate in August when
an Iranian mob attacked the Saudi Embassy in Tehran following riots
in the holy city of Mecca, ransacking the building and killing a
Saudi diplomat.
   More than 400 pilgrims, most of them Iranians, were killed in
the July 31 riots, which followed Iranian political demonstrations
during the annual pilgrimage. The riots were the main reason cited
by Saudi Arabia for breaking diplomatic ties with Tehran.
   Iran has called for the overthrow of the Saudi rulers and
demanded they be stripped of control of Moslem shrines at Mecca and
Medina. Iran also accuses the Saudis of backing Iraq in the Persian
Gulf war.

   One astrologer insists President Reagan
schedules his news conferences during the full moon. Her stars may
tell her that, but the record here on Earth shows otherwise.
   Joyce Jillson, a California astrologer who claims to have dealt
with the Reagans, said Tuesday the president has used astrology to
schedule major events.
   ``Look at when he holds his news conferences. They're usually
during a full moon. He chooses those times to do it,'' she said.
   But a check of the last five presidential news conferences,
going back to August 1986, found that only one, last Oct. 22, was
scheduled during a full moon.
   The other four dates were Aug. 12 and Nov. 19, 1986, March 19,
1987, and Feb. 24, 1988.
   A White House spokesman says the Reagans do not know Ms. Jillson.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court in Port Elizabeth
ruled today that the city's segregated beaches must be open to
people of all races.
   The Supreme Court said a 1966 city council resolution
proclaiming the beaches segregated was invalid.
   Upon hearing of the ruling, some blacks immediately went to
previously ``whites only'' beaches to celebrate.
   City councilor Graham Richards and a member of Parliament, Mia
Loonat, made the application to have the beaches opened to all
races.
   The measure was opposed by Constitutional Development Minister
Chris Heunis and the administrator of Cape Province, Gene Louw.
   Richards called the decision ``a small victory for those of us
fighting what sometimes seems to be a losing battle against the
continuous inroads made by the government against basic human
rights.''
   Most beaches in the larger coastal cities of Durban and Cape
Town are open to all races. However, many beaches in smaller
communities remain segregated.

   Space shuttle astronauts and launch
pad workers conducted an escape drill from a mock launch pad fire
and explosion today in a rehearsal designed to help improve safety
following the Challenger tragedy.
   Several personnel received make-believe injuries in the disaster
exercise, and 11, including two astronauts, were evacuated by
helicopter to two hospitals that conducted their own emergency
rehearsals.
   The other five astronauts and some pad workers were treated for
minor ``injuries'' at the scene, NASA said.
   The astronauts, all rookies who have not flown in space, rode
elevators to the 195-foot level of launch pad 39B as if they were
to board a shuttle on launch day.
   Although there was no shuttle on the pad, they simulated entry
into a spacecraft cabin. Following a report of smoke somewhere on
the launch pad, test director Frank Merlino called a ``major
emergency'' and ordered an evacuation.
   With water spraying the area as it would in a real emergency,
the astronauts and the seven members of the spacecraft closeout
crew donned oxygen masks and made their way to seven slidewire
baskets at the cabin level of the pad.
   Seven fire-rescue workers rushed to the pad from a station a
mile away. As they fought a mock fire at the 175-foot level an
``hydraulic explosion'' occurred and test observers declared five
of the firefighters ``injured.''
   They and the other simulated injured personnel were ferried by
helicopter to hospitals. Seven went to Florida Hospital near
Orlando and four to Jess Parrish Memorial Hospital in Titusville.
   All those on the pad made their way to the baskets, each of
which holds three people, but did not ride them down 1,200-foot
cables to the ground.
   Some officials believe the swift 50 mph ride and abrupt halt in
netting at the bottom would be risky and should be attempted only
in an actual emergency.
   Instead, the baskets were sent down with ballast and the
astronauts and others took an elevator to ground level and
re-entered the baskets. Those not ``injured'' made their way to a
concrete bunker near the launch pad.
   NASA has said it plans to test the baskets with human passengers
sometime before the next space shuttle flight. That flight has been
postponed until late August or early September, NASA administrator
James C. Fletcher said today.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the Challenger and its
seven crew members were lost in an explosion 73 seconds after
launch on Jan. 28, 1986.
   A faulty booster rocket joint that allowed flames to escape
caused the Challenger tragedy, and the biggest delay in launching
the next shuttle has been in assembling the two rocket boosters
that power it into orbit.
   Officials said the drill today would allow the astronauts to
test new crew escape equipment intended to give them a better
chance to survive a launch oad problem.
   Among the most important features of the upgraded system is the
addition of more fire detection equipment and a backup electrical
relay line that would flash a warning to launch directors if a pad
emergency occurred.
   Fire-inhibiting metal plating also has been added to the
platform that connects the launch tower to the shuttle cabin. Two
slidewire baskets have been added and all have been wrapped in fire
resistant material.
   Astronauts participating today were Frank Culbertson, Ken
Cameron, Carl Meade, David Low, Kathryn Thorton, Pierre Thuot and
Jerome Apt.
   Another emergency drill is scheduled Friday to rehearse a rescue
of crew members from a shuttle that has ``crash-landed'' in a swamp
near the shuttle landing runway here.

   Jesse Jackson said today he believes he still
can capture the Democratic presidential nomination despite
resounding losses to Michael Dukakis in Ohio and Indiana. Jackson
won the race for the District of Columbia's much smaller delegate
package.
   Jackson told reporters he was concerned about fairness in the
allocation of delegates who will choose the nominee, but did not
say specifically how he might challenge the process.
   ``I can only appeal very openly for fairness,'' he said at a
Washington news conference.
   ``We're within striking distance,'' Jackson said earlier on
CBS-TV. ``It's not over really till it's over. What's next is West
Virginia and Nebraska, Oregon, New Mexico, California, New Jersey.
... We look forward to these remaining contests and we are not only
setting the pace for the campaign but setting the agenda as well.''
   Jackson met early today with about 50 or 60 members of the House
Democratic Caucus. The caucus chairman, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, characterized it as a ``very warm and successful
meeting,'' and said ``everyone admires the grace and tone'' with
which Jackson has conducted his campaign.
   At his news conference, Jackson said Dukakis leads him by only 8
percentage points in the popular vote. He said that margin should
be reflected in the voting by super delegates _ those delegates
selected by virtue of holding important party positions or public
office.
   ``The super delegates will do America a super favor by not
interfering in the process. ... I simply want fairness,'' he said.
   Although the super delegate process was set up to enable those
delegates to commit to the candidate of their choosing, Jackson
said they should follow the popular vote, and he suggested they
should not take a bandwagon approach to the nomination before the
primary season is over.
   ``If super delegates wait until after June 8 they are in a
better position as judges to help bring balance'' rather than using
party machinery to parcel out delegates before the primaries end,
Jackson said.
   Jackson said on CBS that he has gained victories despite ``the
party machinery, the pundits and the press.''
   ``The party machinery is saying, in fact, go for Dukakis. The
pundits are saying go for Dukakis. In some sense, the super
delegates are moving in that direction and so against the party,
the pundits, the press. We press on against those odds,'' he said.
``We're not about to turn back.''
   Jackson slid further behind Dukakis in the overall delegate
count, losing in Ohio and Indiana by margins of greater than
2-to-1. In total delegates, Jackson trails Dukakis by more than 500.
   In the District of Columbia, which he also swept in his 1984
presidential race, Jackson picked up 80 percent of the vote to 18
percent for Dukakis.
   Jackson scheduled a strategy pow-wow this afternoon with top
advisers. Aides said the discussion would likely focus on mapping
out the campaign through the remainder of the primaries and on what
the Jackson forces will do at the convention.
   June 7 marks the end of the primary season, with votes in New
Jersey and California.
   Jackson's schedule for the rest of the month includes heavy
concentration on California, which offers the biggest delegate
prize in the nation, with a few days spent in New Jersey and Oregon
and brief forays to the small states remaining on the primary
calendar.
   Today, Jackson met with 13 Democratic members of Congress who
are part of a ``Go West '88'' group that is trying to focus the
presidential contest on Western issues.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., an organizer of the group, said Jackson
discussed issues of concern to them, including trade, drugs,
immigration and energy.
   ``He made it clear trade expansion was something very important
on his agenda,'' said Wyden, who told reporters the sessiom was ``a
very positive kind of discussion.'' The group also hopes to meet
with Dukakis, he said.
   Despite a series of losses to Dukakis, Jackson showed no signs
of giving up his campaign and vowed to continue pressing the issues
he has fought for _ reversal of President Reagan's economic
policies and a war on drugs.
   He said his campaign did not start with the kickoff of the
primary season in Iowa, and will not end with the Democratic
convention this summer in Atlanta.
   ``It began in the back of a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and now
it's three steps from the White House. We're on our way,'' he said,
as he recalled the civil rights battles a generation ago.

   Two government opponents have been
banished to northern Zaire, sources said today.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Tshisekedi Es Mulumba and Birindwa Birwashira were sent into exile
in Isiro after Tshisekedi distributed political tracts calling for
a boycott of legislative elections held April 10.
   The two are believed to be the only members of the Union for
Democracy and Social Progress who have continued to demand that
opposition parties be permitted in Zaire.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko's Popular Movement of the Revolution
is the country's only legal political party. All other parties were
outlawed in 1965.
   The Union for Democracy and Social Progress, the country's
largest opposition group, operates clandestinely. More than 200
supporters of group were imprisoned after an unauthorized meeting
in February, the sources said.
   Tshisekedi was arrested in February and was put on trial by a
state security court for attempting to hold an unauthorized
meeting, the sources said. The trial reportedly was suspended after
a medical certificate was presented saying the defendant suffered
from ``chronic delirium.''

   A couple who heard what they thought was a

listen for sounds in their baby's room alerted police who later
arrested three men.
   Lt. Carl Smith said police came to the couple's home Friday
night after the parents heard a man's voice setting up a drug deal.
Later the same night, police arrested the men and seized 80 grams
of cocaine.
   The suspects were arrested after they gave their address and
telephone number while ordering a pizza over a cordless telephone,
which transmits radio signals to a base station. The signals can be
intercepted by other electronic equipment on the same frequency,
such as the baby monitor.
   Smith said the conversation heard on the baby monitor may be
used as evidence against the three, Smith said.
   The three suspects, charged with cocaine possession, were
arraigned Saturday. Conviction on the charges carries a maximum
penalty of 20 years in jail.

   An aide to presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson said today he apparently made a mistake in saying that
Jackson made about $46,000 in consulting wages from entertainer
Bill Cosby last year.
   ``Obviously what I said wasn't quite right ... There obviously
needs to be some clarification. At this point I don't have the
clarification,'' said Frank Watkins, a long-time associate of
Jackson and political director of Jackson's Democratic campaign.
   Watkins said he spoke to Cosby and his wife after their
spokesman disputed Watkins' explanation on Tuesday of Jackson's
income tax returns.
   ``They just said they needed to talk to Jackson,'' about the
matter, Watkins said, adding he was trying to get the matter
cleared up, but had not been able to talk to the accountant who
prepared the taxes.
   Jackson on Tuesday released four years worth of federal income
tax returns. When asked about the Cosby consulting fee, he said he
would provide an accounting to reporters at a later time.
   Jackson and his wife had income of nearly $210,000 in 1987 and
paid about one-fourth of that in federal taxes, they reported in
their federal tax returns.
   The bulk of the income last year, $159,000, came from
Personalities International Inc., a corporation headed by
Jacqueline Jackson that provides management for clients and handles
most of Jackson's earnings from speaking fees and publications.
   Jackson is on contract to the corporation but is not a
shareholder, director or officer, according to his presidential
campaign. He reported the money in the category of wages and
salaries.
   Jackson also reported $46,535 in fees for business services, but
where that money came from quickly became a source of controversy.
Watkins said most of that was in consulting fees from Cosby. ``I
don't know the nature of the work,'' Watkins said on Tuesday.
   But David Brokaw, a Los Angeles public relations agent who works
for Cosby, quoted Cosby as saying, ``That's way off the mark.''
   Brokaw added, ``He did not provide Reverand Jackson with most of
the $46,535 for business services.''
   Asked how much Cosby did pay Jackson, Brokaw said, ``Mr. Cosby
says that's none of your business ... or check with IRS.''
   Cosby is a Jackson supporter and has made a television ad for
the campaign, as well as doing benefit performances.
   Jackson promised reporters Tuesday night he would provide more
details on his finances at a briefing later. His Democratic
presidential campaign released copies of his tax returns for 1984
through 1987.
   Together with dividends, interest and other income, the couple's
1987 joint total income was $209,358, before adjustments. They
reported $3,474 in interest and dividend income. Their tax for the
year was $53,019.
   Jackson, who is a minister, and his wife reported paying $2,145
in unspecified cash contributions during 1987.
   Like many American families, Jackson and his wife took advantage
of the working couple deduction until last year, when that
deduction was lost.
   For 1987, the returns did not distinguish between income
received by Jackson and by his wife, who is president and a
director of Personalities International Inc. Watkins said she also
was paid for speaking engagements.
   On their 1986 returns, $55,000 was reported as income received
by Mrs. Jackson.
   The Jacksons' income rose quickly after 1984, the year of his
first presidential campaign. They reported income that year of
$59,453, including more than $6,000 in interest income. Their
federal taxes that year were $12,103, according to the documents.
   A year later, 1985, their income jumped to $187,839. They paid
$55,809 in federal tax, taking advantage of income averaging.
   In 1986, they reported $186,043 in income, including $13,633 in
dividends from Inner City Broadcasting Co., which Jackson holds
stock in. The Jacksons paid $53,103 in taxes that year.
   The company, headed by New York businessman Percy Sutton, owns
the Apollo Theater in New York and radio stations, and is expanding
into cable television.
   Jackson reported no dividends last year from Inner City
Broadcasting Co. Watkins said Jackson continues to own the stock.

<HEAD>Metal Detectors May Be Used to Spot Weapons in City Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increasing numbers of deadly weapons have been
seized at city public schools this year and the Board of Education
is considering setting up metal detectors to search students, an
official said.
   Bruce Irushalmi, director of the board's Office of School
Safety, said Tuesday he had been asked by Chancellor Richard Green
to study the feasibility of metal detectors.
   Irushalmi said 1,400 incidents involving weapons were reported
in the last school year _ a figure he expects will rise by 10
percent by the end of this school year in June. The weapons include
guns, a crossbow and martial arts weapons.
   He told a hearing of the City Council Education Committee the
detectors would act as a deterrent.
   ``Putting in a metal detector alters the image of the school,''
he said. But, he added, ``so do weapons.''
   Irushalmi and Ed Muir, head of the United Federation of
Teachers' safety committee, linked the rise in the number of
students carrying weapons to an increase in drug trafficking among
them.
   The metal detectors would first be installed on a pilot basis at
a few high schools, Irushalmi said.
   Committee Chairman Herbert Berman has introduced a bill that
would require metal detectors in all of the city's nearly 1,000
public schools. Irushalmi said that would cost $4 million.

   Farmers may be planting almost as many acres
for the 1988 crop harvests as they did last year, says an
Agriculture Department analyst.
   And that is having some effect on the amount of land farmers are
putting into the long-term Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP,
says Ed Allen of the department's Economic Research Service.
   Based on surveys taken in March, farmers indicated they would
reduce 1988 plantings of major crops by only 871,000 acres, he said
in the current issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   ``This is in marked contrast to 1987, when area planted to the
same crops fell 24.1 million acres, and to 1986, when the decline
was 14.2 million,'' he said.
   For example, the March survey showed corn plantings this year
may be around 66.9 million acres, up by almost 2 percent from 1987.
But last year's corn plantings, at 65.7 million acres, plummeted 14
percent from 76.7 million acres in 1986.
   The total wheat acreage planted for the 1988 harvest was
estimated at 65.1 million acres, down about 1.1 percent from last
year. The 1987 wheat crop was planted on 65.8 million acres, a drop
of more than 8 percent from 72.1 million acres in 1986.
   ``Higher prices, lower acreage reduction requirements for cotton
and rice programs, reduced paid land diversion payments, and
possibly lower program participation rates are partially offsetting
the continued entry of area into the long-term Conservation Reserve
Program,'' Allen said.
   Commodity prices received in March were up 10 percent, overall,
from a year earlier, including: feed grains, 22 percent; cotton, 21
percent; oilseeds, mainly soybeans, 19 percent; and food grains, 13
percent.
   ``However, crop prices are not high by historical standards, and
corn is still below the national average (price support) loan
rate,'' he said. ``Over the same period, the index of prices paid,
interest, taxes and farm wage rates increased only 4.4 percent.''
   According to USDA projections, corn prices may average around
$1.75 per bushel in the 1987-88 marketing year, up from $1.50 in
1986-87. The 1988-crop corn price support loan nationally is $1.77
per bushel.
   Six sign ups for the long-term CRP have been held since the
program got under way in 1986, the most recent earlier this year
when farmers offered bids to take 4.5 million acres of highly
erodible crop land from production.
   Although no decision on how much land will be accepted from the
4.5 million acres offered in the latest bids, around 23 million
acres were enrolled in the CRP in earlier rounds.
   The 1985 farm law set a goal of 40 million to 45 million acres
of land in the CRP by 1990. Under the program, farmers agree to
keep the land out of crop production for 10 years and get financial
help to plant protective grass or trees, plus annual rental
payments from the government.
   Allen said the latest signup ``did not attract heavy bidding''
by farmers who wanted to enroll their land, which makes the 1990
goal of the program more difficult.
   But Carol Fesco of the American Farmland Trust, a private,
non-profit Washington-based conservation organization, said she did
not think the slowdown in CRP offerings means much as far as the
goal is concerned.
   ``We still think that that is very possible and that we won't
have a problem of reaching the 45 million-acre goal,'' she said
Tuesday. ``We're going to continue working towards that. We haven't
lost faith in the CRP to date, and neither have any of the other
conservation or environmental groups that I'm aware of.''

   A report by the Agriculture Department says
federal farm policy shouldn't be counted on as the keystone of
economic development in the countryside.
   Instead, the development of rural America's small towns and
farms should rest on diversification and the energies of local
people, the report said Tuesday.
   Roland R. Vautour, undersecretary for small community and rural
development, said cooperative federal efforts now under way are
helping rural communities regain economic stability.
   Vautour said rural communities suffered from inflation in the
late 1970s, global economic recession and farmland value losses in
the early 1980s and from a rise in foreign agricultural production.
   ``In the past, rural economic development has been dependent on
farm policy and income,'' he said. ``We now recognize that the
future growth and stability of the rural economy is dependent on
diversification at the local level, both in farm production and in
the other business segments of community and state economies.''
   The 19-page report itself added: ``The current federal
initiative (on rural development) stresses the need for rural
America to look within for development possibilities. America's
small and rural communities need to realize there are simply not
enough branch plants of major manufacturers to go around. Rural
America must draw upon its own strengths and use them to promote
development.''
   Field hearings are being planned so that Vautour can ``listen to
the needs and concerns of the local officials, residents, students,
teachers, business people and senior citizens,'' the report said.
   The report outlined rural economic development programs
available at USDA and at other federal agencies.

   The United States, with the approval of Japan,
has asked an international trade panel to settle a dispute over
Japanese restrictions on imports of beef and oranges, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said today.
   Japan, which had blocked a similar move last month, agreed to
the formation of a panel under GATT, the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, Yeutter told a news conference.
   ``We expect that case to move forward expeditiously in both beef
and citrus,'' Yeutter said.
   A weeklong round of negotiations over increasing U.S. beef and
citrus exports to Japan ended in failure Tuesday night as Japanese
Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato and Yeutter broke off their talks.
   It was the second collapse in the negotiations since late March,
when a four-year agreement on Japanese beef and citrus import
quotas expired.
   Yeutter, who referred to ``Japan's obstructive beef and citrus
import practices,'' said he did not know how quickly the GATT panel
would move on the issue but had indicated to Japan that the United
States expected the panel to move expeditiously.
   ``We will not tolerate stalling of the GATT process by the
government of Japan,'' he said. ``We assurredly will not permit
this case to spill into the next administration. We're going to
resolve this dispute one way or another during this (the Reagan)
administration.''

<HEAD>South Africa Reported Considering Training Mozambican Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa is considering
training and equipping Mozambican troops to defend the Cahora Bassa
hydroelectric project that serves both countries, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   The pro-government Citizen cited an unidentified spokesman for
South Africa's Department of Foreign Affairs as saying the plans
were under consideration and ``no decision has yet been taken.''
   If South Africa agrees to train Mozambican troops to protect the
Cahora Bassa project, it would mark a significant improvement in
relations between the two countries.
   The Cahora Bassa project is capable of providing cheap
electricity to both countries. However, guerrillas of the
Mozambique National Resistance regularly sabotage power pylons.
   Mozambique accuses South Africa of supporting the rebels in
violation of a 1984 mutual non-agression pact. South Africa denies
the charge and accuses Mozambique of allowing its territory to be
used by guerrillas of the African National Congress, who are
attempting to overthrow the South African government.
   The New York Times reported Tuesday that South Africa was
considering providing training and non-lethal aid to three
Mozambican battalions at an estimated cost of $14 million.
   However, Roland Darroll, a spokesman for the South African
Department of Foreign Affairs, said Wednesday that his country had
no plans to train Mozambican troops.
   He said that South Africa was considering some non-lethal
military aid such as vehicles, radios and uniforms, but that no
decision had been made.
   Mozambique has not officially commented on whether it is
interested in receiving South African military assistance. One
official said privately that Mozambique would not accept training
from South African forces.
   ``They (the South Africans) are always trying to occupy our
country one way or another,'' the Mozambican official said.
   Delegations from South Africa, Mozambique and Portugal are
scheduled to meet in Lisbon later this month for discussions on the
Cahora Bassa project. Portugal has been a major backer of the
project in Mozambique, its former colony.
   Mozambique's cooperation minister, Jacinto Veloso, met with
South African President P.W. Botha last week, and there has been
widespread speculation that Botha will soon meet with President
Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique.

   Health officials Wednesday reported a
68 percent increase in AIDS cases in Belgium in the past year and
announced a new information campaign to combat the deadly disease.
   Belgian Secretary of Health Wivina Demeester said 138 cases of
AIDS were reported among Belgians at the end of March, up 68
percent from a year ago.
   Demeester announced that the new information campaign will start
next month.
   She also said that at the end of March, 3,166 people were
reported to be carriers of the AIDS virus in Belgium, up 11 percent
in three months.
   More than 25 percent of the carriers were heterosexuals,
Demeester said.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by a
virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer.

<TEXT>
   Iraqi warplanes bombed an Iranian oil
refinery and petrochemical plant Wednesday in an escalation of
attacks on Iran's economic mainstay. Iran said three jets were shot
down.
   The Iraqi raids were the first major attacks on Iranian cities
since April 21, when the Persian Gulf war foes began a tacit
cease-fire in their ``war of the cities'' after a deadly seven-week
missile duel.
   Iraq attacked after Baghdad accused the Iranians of shelling the
northeastern Iraqi town of Darbandikhan early Wednesday in ``a
premeditated attempt to spark off the war of the cities again.''
   Iran's War Information Headquarters denied the charge and said
the Iraqis were seeking to ``pave the way for more Iraqi attacks on
Iranian residential areas.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said a
squadron of fighter-bombers pounded the refinery in the
southwestern city of Shiraz, setting it ablaze and leaving it
shrouded in black smoke.
   The refinery, one of five in Iran, has a capacity of 48,000
barrels a day.
   Other warplanes hit a ``highly important'' petrochemical plant
in the area, the agency reported.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Nicosia, said several workers were killed in the Iraqi raids.
   IRNA said Iranian anti-aircraft fire downed two French-built
Mirage F-1s in the second raid. It said one pilot bailed out and
was captured, but there was no word on the fate of the other pilot.
   Tehran Radio said a third Iraqi jet was shot down but did not
say where or give any other details.
   IRNA said an industrial plant in the oil-producing Gachsaran
region, 100 miles west of Shiraz, was also bombed. The Iraqi
communique made no mention of a raid on Gachsaran or of any losses
of life or aircraft.
   Iraq's powerful air force has been pounding Iran's refineries
and other oil installations for months, seeking to throttle its
economy and force it to the negotiating table to end the
7{-year-old war.
   Oil industry sources have reported that the bombing has slashed
Iran's refining capacity by around one-third in recent weeks,
forcing Iran to import unprecedented amounts of refined products
such as kerosene and jet fuel.
   Iran and Iraq pounded each other's capitals and major cities
with more than 300 missiles between Feb. 29 and April 21. Hundreds
of civilians on both sides were killed.

   Southern China's Guangdong province is planning
to organize tours to the United States, but at first it will accept
mainly older tourists who are likely to return home, a newspaper
said Wednesday.
   The U.S. tours could start by the end of the year, the People's

   It said the first tour will include elderly people with
relatives in the United States. Later, the tours will be opened to
a wider range of tourists.
   China ordinarily issues passports only to people going overseas
on official business or for study programs, but thousands of young
Chinese who have gone abroad to study have either delayed their
return home or decided not to come back.
   The province will send a fact-finding delegation to the United
States to plan itineraries, the report said.

<HEAD>NASA Eyeing Aug. 25 For First Post-Challenger Launch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has set Aug. 25 as its internal target date for the
first post-Challenger launch and administrator James C. Fletcher
says the flight might not start until early September.
   ``Our expected plan is to fly in August,'' Fletcher told the
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics on Tuesday.
``Whether it slops over into early September I think is not
important. We will fly this summer.''
   NASA had announced an August launch without a specific date, but
internally the agency was working toward an Aug. 4 liftoff. That
was pushed further along, to Aug. 13, by delays in assembling the
booster rockets for the flight.
   Reporters pressed Fletcher on the date after his speech to the
AIAA and he said officials were ``looking'' at Aug. 25 and into
early September.
   ``We can expect to see Americans back in space,'' he told the
industry meeting. ``The space shuttle's return to flight this year
will signal the resurgence of the American space program and the
beginning of a new era of discovery and commercial opportunity in
space.''
   The United States has not had a manned flight since Jan. 28,
1986, when the Challenger blew up during liftoff, claiming the
lives of its seven crew members. Because one of the boosters was at
fault, NASA had the rocket completely redesigned and changed the
way it is put together.
   The redesign took time and first-flight launch targets slipped
from the summer of 1987 to February 1988 and then June 2, 1988.
Late last year a component of the booster broke apart during a
firing test and the August timeframe was announced.
   The complexities of the ``stacking'' _ putting the four
fuel-filled segments of the booster together _ have been
responsible for much of the latest delay.
   Fletcher told reporters that an official launch date probably
won't be announced until after the next booster test, scheduled for
June 9.
   Richard Truly, NASA's associate administrator for space flight,
told another group of AIAA members that planning still was for an
August launch.
   Fletcher has insisted that the launch date would not be affected
by the Aug. 15-18 Republican Natational Convention in New Orleans.
   Leonard Nicholson, manager of shuttle operations at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, said last week that if Discovery's launch
slips past Aug. 31, the third flight _ another Discovery liftoff on
Jan. 19, 1989 _ would have to be put off indefinitely. The same
situation would apply if flight 27, scheduled for Oct. 27, is
delayed past Nov. 17.

   April 28
   The Sun, Westerly R.I., on presidential hopeful Albert Gore's
withdrawal:
   An interesting aspect of Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s remarks on
quitting the (Democratic presidential) nomination race was his
recital of a litany of former rivals.
   Saying they ``taught me a great deal,'' he praised four of them
by name _ and the two still running, as well.
   From Gary Hart, he said, he ``learned that ideas matter,'' from
Joseph Biden ``the importance of grace under pressure,'' from
Richard Gephardt ``that passion in the service of policy is
powerful indeed,'' from Bruce Babbitt the virtue of caring ``less
about what people thought than about being true to his principles.''
   Gov. Michael Dukakis taught him that ``competence is charisma in
the eyes of Americans hungry for leadership,'' and lastly Gore said
Jesse Jackson showed that ``we are a richer party and a better
nation when we break down barriers and fight for justice.''
   It was a handsome way to bow out after a hard decision.

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on the sinking of an Iranian gun boat by
U.S. planes with the personal approval of President Reagan:
   Is there such as thing as too much civilian control of the
military?
   That is a question that needs to be asked in the wake of the
Navy's recent engagement in the Persian Gulf. ...
   On one level, this is a remarkable display of the capabilities
of the U.S. military's worldwide communication systems. On another
level, it shows that civilian control of the military is clear-cut
and strong.
   But on reflection, this incident raises the disturbing specter
that American lives could be lost in combat because the White House
starts issuing tactical battle orders on the basis of a political
judgment about an on-going battle.
   The president has the duty to set the national strategy, and
civilian control of the military is an absolute.
   But no president has the wisdom and intelligence resources to
start second-guessing low-level field commanders engaged in combat.
To do so is to court disaster.

   The St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch on Star Wars:
   Neither President Reagan nor the Pentagon can dismiss out of
hand the critical analysis of the Star Wars system done by the
congressional Office of Technology Assessment.
   The OTA, a non-partisan scientific group, said in a report yet
to be released formally, that the Strategic Defense Initiative
would suffer a ``catastrophic failure'' the first time _ and the
only time _ it would be needed.
   In short, Soviet nuclear missiles would get through United
States defenses.
   The reason for the failure, according to OTA, is that software
necessary to give computers the detailed instructions needed to
destroy thousands of missiles heading toward targets in the United
States cannot be produced in the foreseeable future.
   Congress should take the report seriously and demand answers to
the questions raised by OTA.
   And there seems good reason for a scaling back in the commitment
to a Star Wars system. There should be enough left in the SDI
funding to ensure that basic research can be conducted, but that it
can be accomplished with far less than $4 billion a year.

   The accord is the result of hard bargaining on both sides over a

   It is the spirit of the pact with Canada that should be captured

   The Tri-City Herald, Kennewick, Wash., on Attorney General Meese:
   Edwin Meese, who has done for the U.S. attorney general's office
what Spiro Agnew did for the vice presidency, can't tell a conflict
of interest from a wheelbarrow.
   His latest difficulty arises from his approval of a $50 million
real estate deal between the Justice Department and a property
owner. The Justice Department had intended to leave the building,
owned in part by Howard M. Bender.
   Meese's wife, Ursula, got a $40,000 a year job with the Multiple
Sclerosis Society, and the money for her salary came from the
tax-exempt Bender Foundation, Howard M. Bender, vice president.
   Immediately thereafter the lease was signed.
   Nothing wrong here, Meese says.
   Meese is finding it difficult to attract replacements to the
Justice Department for resignations he has faced since the reports
of the cascade of conflicts. ...
   Meanwhile, the cause of it all hangs on to his post, seemingly
insensitive to the hurt he is doing the president and the Justice
Department as he was to giving at least the appearance of mixing
public service with private gain.

   Nashville (Tenn.) Banner on Social Security's ``notch baby''
provision:
   Until recently, it appeared that there was no middle ground on
the ``notch baby'' provision of the Social Security law.
   For years, people ... born during the 1917-1921 ``notch'' have
had it impressed on them that they were discriminated against by
the law that changed the formula of benefits for people who were
born after 1916. ...
   A report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) released in late
March gives a much clearer picture of the whole issue. ...
   Michelle M. Murphy of Congressional Quarterly ... reported that
although notch babies get smaller monthly benefits than people who
were born just before them, the GAO found that in most cases they
get more _ and never less _ than similar retirees who are younger.
...
   Several proposals are pending in Congress aimed at correcting
the ``notch'' problem through legislation, but they have one thing
in common. They are tremendously expensive. ...
   It is significant that neither Sen. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.,
longtime advocate for the elderly, nor the American Association of
Retired Persons has pressed for the notch legislation.
   We should heed the suggestion of AARP Chairman Kermit Phelps
that ``it is time to focus attention on more substantive issues
facing older Americans, such as long-term care and reduction of the
federal budget deficit.''

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on Joe Clark's call for vigilante
justice:
   Following a speech ... before the American Newspaper Publishers
Association in Honolulu, Joe Clark, the principal of Paterson,
N.J.'s Eastside High School told an impromptu news conference that
ghetto dwellers who feel besieged by crime should bypass the cops
and the courts and take matters into their own hands.
   Specifically, he advised, ``I think a few lynchings are in
order.''
   On some occasions the lynch mob will be right. The kid they'll
seize really will be a mugger, a dealer, or worse.
   But sometime, the mob will be wrong. ... But will anyone care
that some ghetto kid had been wronged?
   Clark is dangerous not only because he urges people to violence,
but because he teaches that the answer to crime is still more
lawlessness and misdirected anger.
   This man is a demagogue, as his call for ``a few lynchings''
demonstrates.

   Lubbock (Texas) Avalanche-Journal on the war in the Persian Gulf:
   The broadened role of the United States forces in the Persian
Gulf signals a further change in policy in the volatile region
which sends a message to those who thought Washington was ready to
back away from further confrontation with Iran.
   In announcing that the U.S. Navy would now come to the rescue of
so-called neutral shipping under attack in the gulf, the Reagan
Administration has warned both foe and ally that American policy of
maintaining freedom of the seas is not something which can be
compromised.
   Our only regret and reservation about the U.S. role is that more
of our allies aren't more actively involved.
   Although Britain and France have moved to bolster their naval
forces in the area, the whole project should have been a
well-coordinated operation in which the Free World acted in concert.
   For the most part, this government and that of British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher have demonstrated the willingness to
defend freedom wherever it may be threatened.
   It is far better to stop that threat far from one's shores than
have it eventually rear its head on one's doorstep.

   Los Angeles Daily News on the Noriega ouster effort:
   The wonderboys from the State and Justice departments had been
acting if they were bullies on someone else's block: They kept
drawing imaginary lines, and Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega
kept crossing them.
   But finally, as the White House made it known it is willing to
give Noriega an exit that is both face-saving and asset-retaining,
the out-of-towners have shown they've learned you don't go setting
foreign policy by mouthing off empty threats. ...
   _First, the Justice Department indicted Noriega for drug
trafficking. That counterproductive move made it more difficult for
Noriega to retire to countries with which the United States has an
extradition treaty. ...
   _When threats of imprisonment didn't work with the dictator, the
United States switched to using economic sactions as a means of
driving Noriega out. All that did was incur the wrath of the
Panamanian people. ...
   Wouldn't it make more sense to negotiate Noriega out of the drug
trade than hunt him down in the sort of bloody vigilantism that so
resembles American adventurism of an earlier era?

   Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight may be able to come up with
great game strategies. But his effort at making analogies leaves us
wondering if the locker room smell of sweatsocks is beginning to
take its toll.
   On (an) NBC television special dealing with stress,
correspondent Connie Chung asked Knight how he handled stress. ``I
think if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it,'' he said.
   Handle it, maybe. But enjoy it?
   We had hoped the age-old idea of putting rape and enjoyable in
the same sentence was beginning to disappear, but obviously, that's
not the case.
   What's especially disappointing is to hear such comparisons made
by Knight, given his position as an educator and coach.
   Crimes of violence against women, such as rape, are constantly
on the rise. The last thing we need now is some off-the-cuff
basketball coach telling the nation's television viewers just to
relax and enjoy it.

   The Journal Times, Racine, Wis., on dial-a-porn:
   It appears the infamous 900-prefix telephone information
services aren't the problem state authorities claim they are.
   According to Wisconsin Bell, less than 1 percent of its
southeastern Wisconsin customers have taken advantage of the free
blocking service. ...
   The service would limit access to 900-prefix telephone numbers
which offer various services, primarily information, for a fee.
   Complaints have been registered with utilities and government
officials about abuse of two of those services.
   Specifically targeted are the so-called ``dial-a-porn'' services
offering pornographic telephone conversations, and the teen
``party-line'' services which put teen-agers throughout the country
in touch with each other. ...
   Wisconsin Bell got permission to offer a free service which
would block access to those services in an effort to answer
complaints. ...
   Wisconsin Bell officials report, however, that of 716,500
customers, only 2,908 have asked for the blocking service.
   One factor may be that the service not only blocks access to
dial-a-porn and teen party lines, but to all other 900-prefix
services as well.
   But we suspect the real explanation is that relatively few
Wisconsin Bell customers use 900-prefix services at all, and of
that number fewer still have problems with it.

   Brigitte Nielsen, a former wife of Sylvester
Stallone, is expecting a baby, and she and the father, pro
football's Mark Gastineau, are thrilled.
   But he's not telling when they'll become parents.
   ``You can just say ... that she's pregnant,'' said the New York
Jets' defensive lineman, checking into his team's preseason
minicamp Tuesday.
   The couple, who began dating in January, will marry as soon as
Gastineau's divorce from his wife, Lisa, becomes final, he said.
   ``This is the first time I've ever been in love,'' Gastineau,
31, said. He says his fiance is ``happier than she has ever been
about anything.''
   Gastineau and Nielsen met at a San Diego health club during
Super Bowl week. Nielsen, a statuesque blond who has appeared in
such adventure films as ``Red Sonia,'' was in Rome on Tuesday to
work on a new movie, ``Domino.''

   Cher says she didn't even see Eddie Murphy
backstage after the Academy Awards program, let alone give him a
tongue-lashing. And she is suing The National Enquirer for $15
million for reporting that she did.
   According to the U.S. District Court suit filed Tuesday, the
Enquirer reported that Cher, who received the best actress Oscar at
the April 11 ceremonies, told Murphy he had put a damper on the
evening by accusing the academy of discriminating against blacks.
   The lawsuit said the account was a ``complete falsehood.''
   The complaint charged that Don Monte, in a ``TV-Behind the
Scenes'' column, reported that Cher told Murphy the awards ceremony
was not the place to air grievances.
   The remarks were said to have been made after Murphy and Academy
President Robert Wise argued backstage, with Wise allegedly telling
Murphy he would not be invited to participate in any future Academy
Awards programs.
   Cher's lawsuit says the actress did not see Murphy backstage.
Murphy had presented the best picture award.

   Republican gubernatorial candidate John
Raese loves fast cars and boats, but he's no ``party animal,'' says
his wife.
   ``The press makes an issue about his cigarette boat and portrays
him as a party animal,'' Liz Raese said in an interview published
in Tuesday's Charleston Daily Mail.
   ``We've always had boats. The cigarette boat is used as much for
fishing as racing. We're like a lot of people _ we like to fish,''
she said.
   Raese is challenging Gov. Arch Moore for the GOP gubernatorial
nomination in Tuesday's primary. Two years ago, he won the state
GOP chairmanship, which he resigned earlier this year in a party
dispute, and their relationship remains bitter.
   ``They give John two minutes to speak at most of those Lincoln
Day events, then Governor Moore talks for 20 minutes,'' Mrs. Raese
said. ``He calls John immature and I sit there and watch John's
face get flushed. His temper builds and I keep whispering, `Relax,
honey, don't let him get to you.'''
   The 38-year-old Morgantown millionaire owns steel, coal,
limestone and media companies. But his wife said he is awkward and
shy.
   ``I have seen him grow tremendously in the 10 years we have been
married,'' said Mrs. Raese, 31. ``I like to mother him. I'll come
up behind him and put my arms around him and squeeze tightly. He
says he doesn't want to be mothered and then his face gets flushed.
   ``He's a man's man. There is no women's lib in our house. I lean
on him,'' she said.
   Mrs. Raese said her husband wants to ``give something back'' to
West Virginia.
   ``I say to him, `Why do you want this job? Our life was so good
before, so easy.' And he says, `Liz, how many suits can we buy? How
many planes can we fly? How many parties can we attend? There must
be something more to life than this.'''

   A woman who was a passenger on an Aloha
Airlines jet shortly before a section of its fuselage tore away
over Hawaii said she saw the wall of the plane undulate during
takeoff.
   ``As the plane was going up into the air I was resting my arm on
the armrest and my arm started to slip towards the wall, so I took
it away and I saw that the wall was moving in and out, like swaying
in and out,'' Julie Kovach said Tuesday.
   Mrs. Kovach and her husband, Richard, had been honeymooning in
Hawaii and flew from the island of Kauai to Honolulu on Thursday.
   She said she didn't realize the significance until after she
heard that part of the jet's fuselage had blown away on a later
flight Thursday. A flight attendant was killed and 61 of 89
passengers were injured.
   ``At the time my wife Julie was sitting near the window, I was
sitting in the seat next to her and I had my head back and my eyes
closed relaxing, so I didn't even notice this was happening,''
Richard Kovach said in an interview with television station WFSB-TV.
   The couple said they learned about the accident after they
returned to Connecticut on Friday, but didn't realize they had been
on the same plane until they saw a picture and recognized the name
``Queen Liliuokalani'' on the airliner's nose.
   They said they had been sitting four rows up from the wing in a
section that later ripped away. Mrs. Kovach said she called Aloha
Airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration in Washington to
tell them of her observation.
   Federal safety officials have ordered the oldest models of
Boeing 737 jetliners with more than 55,000 landings, like the Aloha
airplane, not to fly higher than 23,000 feet while the accident is
under investigation.
   Above 24,000 feet the difference between higher cabin pressure
and lower atmospheric pressure could be sufficient to cause a
hazard in aircraft where there could be a structural weakness, FAA
officials have said.

<HEAD>Court: State Can Cut Prisoners' Hair</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State prison administrators can cut an
inmate's hair, even if he objects for religious reasons, because
prison security outweighs an inmate's individual rights, a federal
appeals court says.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
unanimously rejected the argument of inmate Mark Lee Pollock, from
Lucas County, that prison officials violated his constitutional
right to exercise his religion when they cut his long hair.
   Gail Finkbeiner, lawyer for Pollock, said Tuesday she had not
seen the ruling and declined to comment or to say whether Pollock
will appeal.
   Pollock's suit argued that his rights were violated because he
adheres to the religion of the Lakota American Indians, who believe
that hair is sacred and should not be cut.
   Pollock, 31, is serving a 17- to 45-year sentence for
convictions of burglary, escape and bad-check offenses. He has been
an inmate since October 1981 at the state's maximum-security
Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. His legal battle
with officials over haircuts has been ongoing since he got into the
prison system.
   Prison officials said they have the right to cut prisoners' hair
for a variety of security and identification reasons. They said
prisoners could hide contraband, including keys and pills, in long
hair, could cut it off after escaping to more easily avoid
detection and could provoke homosexual attacks from other inmates
attracted by the appearance of long hair.
   Prison officials also said long hair could hinder prison
employees in identifying inmates, which could hamper roll calls,
mail calls, issuing visitor passes and finding prisoners who break
rules. Longer hair could also clog prison sink and shower drains
and be more conducive to carrying lice and creating other
sanitation problems, state officials contended.
   U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin ruled in favor of the state, and
Pollock appealed. The appeals court panel upheld Rubin's decision
on Monday.
   Raymond Studer, an assistant Ohio attorney general representing
the state, said the appeals court's ruling indicated that the
courts are starting to defer to concerns of prison administrators
faced with complex security problems in crowded penitentiaries.

   The Federal Aviation Administration today
widened its inspections of Boeing 737 jetliners for possible
cracking and corrosion in response to an accident last week in
which a large section of one of the jets tore free during flight.
   The FAA directive requires operators of older Boeing 737s _
those with more than 30,000 flights _ to be visually inspected and
to undergo sophisticated electronic inspections if cracks are found.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said the agency's action stems
from a belief that ``an abundance of caution'' is needed in light
of the recent accident involving Aloha Airlines.
   Last Thursday a 20-foot section of an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737
stretching from just behind the cockpit to near the wing tore loose
as the jet was cruising at 24,000 feet. One flight attendant was
swept from the plane and to her death and 61 people were injured,
although the plane landed safely.
   The new inspection order covers 291 older Boeing 737s _ the
first ones made in the late 1960s and early 1970s _ in which a
``cold bonding'' process was used to splice together sections of
the plane's outer metal skin.
   McArtor said he could not immediately say how many planes
covered by the order were in operation in the United States.
   Last week the FAA ordered many of the older Boeing 737s to fly
no higher than 23,000 feet and said that those with 55,000 landings
should be visually inspected for corrosion or cracking.
   The order today expands the visual inspections to planes with at
least 30,000 landings and requires those with 50,000 landings to
undergo so-called ``eddy current'' inspections using high-frequency
electronic devices.
   McArtor said that despite the increased focus on the older
Boeing 737s the aircraft ``are just as safe as newer models and if
they were not they wouldn't be allowed to fly.''
   He said while the cause of the Aloha accident has yet to be
determined ``it is time for an abundance of caution. And it is out
of an abundance of caution that we take today's action.''
   McArtor said that he does not think the inspection requirements
will disrupt air travel. Under the emergency FAA directive, visual
inspections must be conducted within 250 landings.
   The airlines must report to the FAA within 48 hours on the
result of the inspections.
   The Boeing 737 is widely used for short-haul flights and more
than 1,100 of the 737-200 series, such as the one involved in the
Aloha accident, have been built.
   McArtor could not say which airlines fly the older 737s but said
the planes are scattered across the industry.

<HEAD>Tass Makes Fun of Reagan over Astrology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tass poked somewhat ponderous fun Wednesday at
President Reagan's reported faith in astrology, wondering in a
dispatch what the stars are telling the leader of the West.
   ``It is difficult to say what the May night sky, studded with
stars, predicted to the president, but it hardly predicted that he
would have to speak about the role of astrology in the politics of
the USA,'' the official news agency said.
   Recent reports in the United States that Reagan and his wife
Nancy consult astrologers inspired taunts from Congress and
criticism from scientists.
   Some reports said Donald T. Regan, former White House chief of
staff, plans to say in a book that Mrs. Reagan turned to
astrologers in shaping the president's schedule.
   On Tuesday, Reagan denied having been swayed by the stars in
making policy decisions, but Tass characterized his comments as
evasive.
   ``When he appeared on Tuesday in one of the halls of the White
House, reporters practically showered him with questions,'' the
agency said. ``They wondered to what extent astrologers and
fortune-tellers influenced him when he had to make political
decisions.
   ``He was quick to answer, but he tried to escape from direct
answers to further questions. All this has not clarified the
questions raised, and now more Americans are asking themselves: May
it be true that the president determines the country's political
course with the help of the stars?''

   Federal regulatory agencies soon should be
able to ease up on reviews of applications to field-test
genetically engineered organisms because the tests pose little
risk, a research arm of Congress said Wednesday.
   The agencies are piling up experience so rapidly that ``it
should be possible now, or become possible in the near future, to
sort planned introductions into broad categories for which low,
medium or high levels of review are appropriate,'' the Office of
Technology Assessment said in a report.
   So far, there have been about two dozen field tests of one kind
or another in 12 states and four foreign countries, the study said.
   ``With adequate review, none of the small-scale field tests
proposed or probable within the next several years (is) likely to
result in an environmental problem that would be widespread or
difficult to control,'' it said.
   In agriculture, a new crop strain or rotation probably could
ease or control damage _ if any _ from experiments gone awry, the
report said.
   A worst-case outcome, the authors wrote, would appear to be ``to
disrupt a fundamental ecosystem process, for example, the cycling
of a mineral or a nutrient, or the flow of energy in an ecosystem.
Such disruptions are not, however, among the credible consequences
of any introduction that seems likely within the next several
years.''
   Such disruptions could be ``difficult to control and
far-reaching in their effects,'' and are conceivable as the result
of releasing a new microbe with enhanced ability to degrade toxic
waste or cellulose, the report said.
   Many species perform the same functions in an ecosystem, and
this redundancy, coupled with the resilience of ecosystems, ``are
persuasive arguments against the likelihood of such consequences.''
   Crop plants and domestic livestock appear to pose the least risk
from genetic engineering techniques, the report said in suggesting
points regulators might consider in deciding where to loosen
scrutiny.
   Examples of such criteria include whether the new organism is
changed in its structural or regulatory genes. Regulatory genes
deserve more attention, the report said, because they govern how
much product a cell makes through its structural genes and this
could enhance survivability or vulnerability in the environment.
   Another example might be the deletion of genes, which the report
said probably don't need as much review as the insertion of genes.
Deletions are far more common in nature than insertions.
   ``Although the characteristics of engineered organisms make
certain kinds less likely than others to cause problems, it is not
now possible to describe any broad categories thay could be
completely exempted from review,'' the report cautioned.
   ``Counterexamples can be provided from existing experience to
negate almost any proposed category for exemption from review.''
   The new ``recombinant'' techniques of genetic engineering that
make possible the insertion of a gene from one species into the
DNA, the genetic material, of another have prompted research aimed
at making, among other things:
   _Plants that can resist pests, pesticides, or diseases; use
fertilizers better or perhaps do without them.
   _Bacteria that can confer frost resistance on plants.
   _New animal vaccines.
   _Animals with greater meat or milk production.
   _Microbes that can digest toxic waste better than existing
strains or even concentrate metallic ores.
   ``It is important to note that modifying organisms for specific
human ends is not new,'' the technology assessment office said.
   ``Selective breeders of plants and animals have been
transferring genes for millenia, often creating forms through
centuries of selection that differ from their original stocks more
than the forms produced by recombinant DNA methods.''

   A prominent Utah lawyer said to be Attorney
General Edwin Meese's latest choice to become his chief deputy is
undergoing a background check, the White House confirmed today.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, briefing reporters on Air Force One
as President Reagan flew to Chicago to deliver a speech, would not
say if the attorney, Harold G. Christensen of Salt Lake City, is
the only candidate for the job.
   ``We are reviewing a number of candidates, doing background
checks, but can't confirm anyone'' as being the only candidate for
a specific job, Fitzwater said, noting, ``There are several
candidates for positions at Justice.''
   Fitzwater was questioned about a report in The Washington Post
that Christensen, 62, was the third person picked to fill the
vacancy.
   The Post, quoting unidentified administration sources, said
Meese sent the Christensen recommendation to the White House on
Monday, but was waiting until the background check is completed
before making an announcement.
   Christensen could not be reached for comment, but Republican
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said in Salt Lake City that he had
proposed Christensen's name to Meese.
   ``It still has to go through a process ... I think he has an
excellent chance of getting it,'' Hatch said. ``I know Ed Meese is
very high on him.''
   The job became vacant after the protest resignation March 29 of
Arnold Burns.
   Burns and Assistant Attorney General William F. Weld resigned in
the wake of continuing investigations of Meese by independent
counsel James C. McKay. The officials said the investigations
hampered the attorney general's ability to lead the department.
   Meese's efforts to fill the vacancies have been stymied. His
first choice, former federal judge Arlin Adams, rejected the offer,
saying he had too big a legal case load. St. Louis lawyer John C.
Shepherd withdrew his name from consideration 15 days after his
selection was announced in the wake of publicity surrounding a
controversial case involving his law firm and his membership in
clubs that excluded women or blacks.
   Christensen is a senior partner in the Salt Lake City law firm
of Snow, Christensen & Martineau. Sources told the Post he has
strong backing from Utah's Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch. Hatch's
administrative assistant, Dee Benson, had been a partner in the
firm.
   Christensen was president of the Utah State Bar in 1975-76 but
has never held a government job and told the Post he was not
heavily involved in politics.
   ``My life has been pretty much devoted to the profession,'' he
said, adding that he has ``always been interested in civic things,
but had never run for office.''
   Christensen is a widower and the father of three grown children
who has spent much of his life in Utah. He was born there, attended
the state university and went to the University of Michigan Law
School.
   Asked whether he belonged to any private clubs, Christensen
said, ``I do not belong to any clubs that exclude people.''

<HEAD>How Do You Get AIDS from Sex?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The AIDS virus can be spread by sexual intercourse whether you
are male or female, heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual.
   This happens because a person infected with the AIDS virus may
have the virus in semen or vaginal fluids. The virus can enter the
body through the vagina, penis, rectum or mouth.
   Anal intercourse, with or without a condom, is risky. The rectum
is easily injured during anal intercourse.
   Remember, AIDS is sexually transmitted, and the AIDS virus is
not the only infection that is passed through intimate sexual
contact.
   Other sexual transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea, syphilis,
herpes and chlamydia, can also be contracted through oral, anal and
vaginal intercourse. If you are infected with one of these diseases
and engage in risky behavior you are at greater risk of getting
AIDS.

<HEAD>You Won't Get AIDS From Insects _ Or A Kiss</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   No matter what you may have heard, the AIDS virus is hard to get
and is easily avoided.
   You won't just ``catch'' AIDS like a cold or flu because the
virus is a different type. The AIDS virus is transmitted through
sexual intercourse, the sharing of drug needles, or to babies of
infected mothers before or during birth.
   You won't get the AIDS virus through everyday contact with the
people around you in school, in the workplace, at parties, child
care centers, or stores. You won't get it by swimming in a pool,
even if someone in the pool is infected with the AIDS virus.
Students attending school with someone infected with the AIDS virus
are not in danger from casual contact.
   You won't get AIDS from a mosquito bite. The AIDS virus is not
transmitted through a mosquito's salivary glands like other
diseases such as malaria or yellow fever. You won't get it from bed
bugs, lice, flies or other insects, either.
   You won't get AIDS from saliva, sweat, tears, urine or a bowel
movement.
   You won't get AIDS from a kiss.
   You won't get AIDS from clothes, a telephone, or from a toilet
seat. It can't be passed by using a glass or eating utensils that
someone else has used. You won't get the virus by being on a bus,
train or crowded elevator with a person who is infected with the
virus, or who has AIDS.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>What Behavior Puts You At Risk?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   You are at risk of being infected with the AIDS virus if you
have sex with someone who is infected, or if you share drug needles
and syringes with someone who is infected.
   Since you can't be sure who is infected, your chances of coming
into contact with the virus increase with the number of sex
partners you have. Any exchange of infected blood, semen or vaginal
fluids can spread the virus and place you at great risk.
   The following behaviors are risky when performed with an
infected person. You can't tell by looking if a person is infected.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Risky Behavior</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Sharing drug needles and syringes.
   Anal sex, with or without a condom.
   Vaginal or oral sex with someone who shoots drugs or engages in
anal sex.
   Sex with someone you don't know well (a pickup or prostitute) or
with someone you know has several sex partners.
   Unprotected sex (without a condom) with an infected person.

<HEAD>What About Dating?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dating and getting to know other people is a normal part of
life. Dating doesn't mean the same thing as having sex. Sexual
intercourse as a part of dating can be risky. One of the risks is
AIDS.
   How can you tell if someone you're dating or would like to date
has been exposed to the AIDS virus? The bad news is, you can't. But
the good news is, as long as sexual activity and sharing drug
needles are avoided, it doesn't matter.
   You are going to have to be careful about the person you become
sexually involved with, making your own decision based on your own
best judgment. That can be difficult.
   Has this person had any sexually transmitted diseases? How many
people have they been to bed with? Have they experimented with
drugs? All these are sensitive, but important, questions. But you
have a personal responsibility to ask.
   Think of it this way. If you know someone well enough to have
sex, then you should be able to talk about AIDS. If someone is
unwilling to talk, you shouldn't have sex.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Do Married People Get AIDS?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Married people who are uninfected, faithful and don't shoot
drugs are not at risk. But if they engage in risky behavior, they
can become infected with the AIDS virus and infect their partners.
If you feel your spouse may be putting you at risk, talk to him or
her. It's your life.

   Thousands of illegal aliens hoping to take advantage of their
last chance for U.S. citizenship camped outside immigration offices
around the country early today as the yearlong amnesty program
approached its midnight deadline.
   All 107 offices of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service will remain open until midnight to handle applicatons from
those seeking legal residency status.
   ``I expect to be here forever, for the rest of my life,'' said a
weary Stanley Davis, chief legalization officer for the INS office
in Tucson, Ariz.
   In Houston, vendors sold tacos and sandwiches to those in line
Tuesday. In Albuquerque, N.M., immigration officials hired a
Mexican band to entertain the 400 people queued up.
   ``I think we burned out two photocopiers in the past two days,''
said Patrice Parilli, director of the legalization program at
Catholic Charities in San Francisco, where more than 25,000 aliens
from 200 countries have applied for amnesty in the past year.
   As of Monday, 1.37 million amnesty applications had been filed
nationwide, and 470,000 people were seeking legal status under a
separate program for seasonal agricultural workers, the INS said.
The deadline for that program is Nov. 30.
   Applicants who file by the deadline also may request up to 60
days for submitting other documents necessary to prove they have
lived in the United States continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982.
   In New York state, the midnight deadline was extended for some
aliens until at least May 16 because of initial confusion about the
program's application to parents of U.S.-born children on welfare.
They were first ruled ineligible, then eligible for amnesty.
   Today's order by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals applies
only in New York state, and INS spokesman Greg Leo said it would
affect only a few hundred families. He urged all eligible aliens
not to wait, but to apply by midnight anyway.
   In Santa Ana, Calif., 2,000 people applied for amnesty on Monday
and nearly as many applied on Tuesday, said legalization officer
George Newland.
   ``I think many of these people deep down inside thought there
would be an extension, so they waited until the last minute,''
Newland said.
   By Monday, 1.33 million people had applied for some form of
amnesty in the INS western region, said Joyce Leonard, the region's
acting assistant director of immigration reform. The region is
comprised of California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam.
   Thousands of amnesty applications piled up in the Los Angeles
office, the region's busiest, as people camped outside.
   More than 13,000 illegal aliens have applied for amnesty in
Oklahoma, said A.J. Irwin, the INS chief legalization officer in
Oklahoma City. About 1,000 people have applied in the last week,
and about 50 were waiting outside the doors when the office opened
Tuesday.
   ``We just can't handle it,'' Irwin said. ``We were doing an
average of 20 people a day, and now we're doing about 200 a day.''
   ``I asked them (the aliens), `Why did you wait, why did you
wait,' and a lot are saying they were afraid to come in,'' he said.
``Now after a year, they're seeing that it's not a trick.''
   Jose Luis Navarro, 40, was among the skeptics.
   ``I thought I would go to the immigration office to apply and
they would be there waiting to catch us,'' Navarro said.
   ``I didn't have sufficient papers, and I wasn't certain about
the program like I am now,'' said Carlos Ortiz, 37, who came to the
United States from Chihuahua, Mexico. ``And I didn't have the
money.''
   In Hialeah, Fla., Marcos Castellon, 40, said he had been afraid
to apply.
   ``I was afraid they would deport me,'' Castellon said. ``But now
everyone believes in the law, and they accept it in good faith.''
   In Phoenix, Ariz., chief legalization officer Eugene Botts said
he found a block-long line upon opening Tuesday, and 900 people
were processed during the day.
   ``We had another rough one today,'' Botts said, with waits of
about four hours for applicants, ``which before this week was
unheard of.''
   In Houston, the legalization office stayed open during the final
24 hours of the application period. On Tuesday, 5,000 people tried
to apply, said Richard S. Rios, the center's director.
   INS officials rented three portable toilets to accommodate
people camping outside the legalization center, and vendors sold
refreshments.
   ``Some of the applicants are free-enterprising, selling tacos,
Cokes, salad, sandwiches,'' Rios said, joking that the INS approves
of the entrepreneurs ``as long as they are reporting that income.''
   In Florida, officials expected the total number of amnesty
applications to reach 125,000 by tonight, said INS regional
director Perry Rivkind.
   ``I think there may be a last-minute push,'' he said. ``But
we'll take everyone _ even if we have to wake 'em up in line.''
   About 23,000 people have applied for amnesty in New Jersey, with
25 percent coming in the last month, said James M. Gray, director
of the immigration office in Camden.
   ``It's been a very successful program but I am disappointed in
this particular area that there are an awful lot of aliens who have
not taken advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime chance,'' Gray said.
   ``There are no more chances,'' Gray said. ``An awful lot of
people are missing the boat.''

   China's best-known dissident took issue with the
government's modernization plans during a meeting Wednesday with
university students and said economic reform without democracy is
impossible.
   ``The concept of modernization is independent of nation or local
people,'' Fang Lizhi told the students at Beijing University.
``This is a common concept all over the world. You should not be
able to say `Chinese modernization.' The aim, the target, at least,
is the same everywhere.''
   Chinese leaders use the slogan ``modernization with Chinese
characteristics'' to describe China's policy of economic reform
under party direction.
   Fang, 52, an internationally respected astrophysicist, is an
outspoken critic of the government and was kicked out of the
Communist Party last year. He was accused of inciting pro-democracy
student demonstrations in December 1986 and January 1987.
   His meeting with several hundred students during an observance
of the university's 90th anniversary was believed to be the first
time since his dismissal that Fang was allowed to speak about
politics in public.
   ``We need more democracy in China,'' Fang said after the meeting.
   Developing a modern economy without democracy is impossible, he
said, offering Albania as an example of a nation where ``there is
no democracy and also no economy.''
   He said students hadn't abandoned their hopes for democracy.
   ``The students still are concerned about the situation of
democracy in China now,'' he said. ``After the student movement, of
course, they kept quiet, but in their minds they want quicker
(steps toward democracy).''
   Of the students' thinking, he said: ``No change. Still no
change.'' He said of his own: ``I never change my opinion'' on
China's politics or economy.
   After the student protests, Fang was removed as vice president
of the Science and Technology University in Hefei, Anhui province,
and was transferred to the Beijing Observatory, where he continues
research and writing.
   The official press has featured him in several articles recently
in an attempt to show government leniency in allowing Fang to
continue his academic pursuits. He was allowed to attend a
conference in Italy last June.
   On Monday, the Beijing Review published a lengthy feature saying
the past year, during which Fang published five books, was his most
productive.
   Fang said Wednesday he would admit to error in his thinking only
if the government could prove him wrong.
   His repeated requests to visit the United States have been
refused. Fang said he has received invitations from several
American universities, including Harvard.
   He brushed aside questions about possible trouble for speaking
with the students. ``I'm not concerned. Many times, I speak like
this,'' he said.
   Asked whether he had trouble after an interview with the New
York Times in February, Fang said: ``Not too much.''
   In the animated 90-minute discussion, students voiced views
ranging from support of China's attempts at democracy to harsh
criticism.
   Some said later that the meeting was spontaneous, not organized
by the student government or other official groups. Fang said he
had been invited to a small-group discussion by physics department
students.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today extended the
midnight deadline for the government's illegal alien amnesty
program in New York state, giving many aliens with U.S.-born
children on welfare another two weeks to register.
   The state has been seeking a 60-day extension and the court's
order will apply until another hearing the week of May 16, said
Chris Braithwaite, a spokesman for the state attorney general's
office.
   The amnesty program allows illegal aliens who have lived in the
United States since Jan. 1, 1982, to apply for legal status and
U.S. citizenship.
   The deadline runs out at midnight tonight, but New York state
asked for the extension because there was initial confusion about
the program's application to parents of U.S.-born children on
welfare.
   The order by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals applies only
to the illegal alien program in New York state. It was not
immediately determined whether it would apply to all aliens or only
those with U.S.-born children.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service urged those eligible
for legalization to apply by midnight tonight ``as it is not clear
what the impact of this order may be.''
   The court told lawyers for the state and the INS to work out
specifics of the order, including which illegal aliens would be
affected, Braithwaite said.
   If the sides could not agree on an order this afternoon the
court said it would issue its own order, he said.
   Greg Leo, an INS spokesman in Washington, said he understood
that any order ``will only apply to a limited class of people ...
who may be ineligible for amnesty because their children have
received AFDC benefits.''
   The action may only affect several hundred people in New York,
Leo said.
   The issue arose because aliens who are likely to need public
assistance, such as welfare, are among those who cannot be accepted
in the amnesty program.
   The state asked whether poor illegal aliens with U.S.-born
children who receive welfare in the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program can qualify for amnesty. Technically the children
are the welfare recipients, because they are U.S. citizens.
   Braithwaite said there are ``a lot'' of such families, but he
had no count.
   The INS initially said the parents of such children would not be
eligible, then said they would be eligible, Braithwaite said.
   Because of the confusion, the state sued the INS for a 60-day
extension of the deadline and a $100,000 advertising campaign
explaining the policy.
   Leo cautioned that illegal aliens not involved in the litigation
should apply by tonight's midnight deadline.
   ``INS strongly urges anyone eligible for amnesty to apply by
midnight tonight as this is the deadline for virtually all
potential applicants,'' he said. ``It would be tragic for people
who are eligible for this program not to come forward by midnight
on the basis of misinformation.''

   Not so very long ago, condoms (rubbers or prophylactics) were
things we didn't talk about very much.
   Now, they're discussed on the evening news and on the front page
of your newspaper, and displayed out in the open in your local drug
store, grocery and convenience store.
   For those who are sexually active and not limiting their sexual
activity to one partner, condoms have been shown to help prevent
the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. That is why the use of
condoms is recommended to help reduce the spread of AIDS.
   Condoms are the best preventive measure against AIDS besides not
having sex and practicing safe behavior.
   But condoms are far from being foolproof. You have to use them
properly. And you have to use them every time you have sex, from
start to finish. If you use a condom, you should remember these
guidelines:
   (1) Use condoms made of latex rubber. Latex serves as a barrier
to the virus. ``Lambskin'' or ``natural membrane'' condoms are not
as good because of the pores in the material. Look for the word
``latex'' on the package.
   (2) A condom with a spermicide may provide additional
protection. Spermicides have been shown in laboratory tests to kill
the virus. Use the spermicide in the tip and outside the condom.
   (3) Condom use is safer with a lubricant. Check the list of
ingredients on the back of the lubricant package to make sure the
lubricant is water-based. Do not use petroleum-based jelly, cold
cream, baby oil or cooking shortening. These can weaken the condom
and cause it to break.

<HEAD>What Does Someone With AIDS Look Like?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   It is very important that everyone understands that a person can
be infected with the AIDS virus without showing any symptoms at all.
   It is possible to be infected for years, feel fine, look fine
and have no way of knowing you are infected unless you have a test
for the AIDS virus.
   During this period, however, people infected with the AIDS virus
can pass the virus to sexual partners, to people with whom drug
needles are shared, and to children before or during birth. That is
one of the most disturbing things about AIDS.
   Once symptoms do appear, they are similar to the symptoms of
some other diseases. As the disease progresses, they become more
serious. That is because the AIDS virus keeps your body's natural
defenses from operating correctly.
   If you are concerned whether you might be infected, consider
your own behavior and its effects on others. If you feel you need
to be tested for the AIDS virus, talk to a doctor or an AIDS
counselor for more information. (See below.)

<HEAD>Is There A Cure For AIDS?
   There is presently no cure for AIDS.
   Medicines such as AZT have prolonged the lives of some people
with AIDS. There is hope that additional treatments will be found.
   There is also no vaccine to prevent uninfected people from
getting the infection. Researchers believe it may take years for an
effective, safe vaccine to be found.
   The most effective way to prevent AIDS is avoiding exposure to
the virus, which you can control by your own behavior.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Should you Get An AIDS Test?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   You have probably heard about the ``AIDS Test.'' the test
doesn't actually tell you if you have AIDS. It shows if you have
been infected with the virus. It looks for changes in blood that
occur after you have been infected.
   The Public Health Service recommends you be confidentially
counseled and tested if you have had any sexually transmitted
disease or shared needles; if you are a man who has had sex with
another man; or if you have had sex with a prostitute, male or
female. You should be tested if you have had sex with anyone who
has done any of these things.
   If you are a woman who has been engaging in risky behavior and
you plan to have a baby or are not using birth control, you should
be tested.
   Your doctor may advise you to be counseled and tested if you are
a hemophiliac, or have received a blood transfusion between 1978
and 1985.
   If you test positive, and find you have been infected with the
AIDS virus, you must take steps to protect your partner.
   People who have always practiced safe behavior do not need to be
tested.
   There's been a great deal in the press about problems with the
test. It is very reliable if it is done by a good laboratory and
the results are checked by a physician or counselor.
   If you have engaged in risky behavior, speak frankly to a doctor
who understands the AIDS problem, or to an AIDS counselor.
   For more nformation, call your local public health agency.
They're listed in the government section of your phone book. Or,
call your local AIDS hotline. If you can't find the number, call
1-800-342-AIDS.

   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin in an
interview published Wednesday called for an Arab-Israeli peace
settlement entailing a jointly run Jordanian-Palestinian state in
60 percent of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   He said his Labor Party, which shares power with the right-wing
Likud Bloc in a coalition, insisted that ``Jerusalem must be united
under Israeli sovereignty and remain its capital.''
   The Jordanian-Palestinian state had to be ``under one
sovereignty, one government, one flag and one capital _ Amman,''
Rabin told Jane's Defense Weekly. He didn't say whether the
sovereignty should be Jordanian or Palestinian.
   Amman is the capital of Jordan.
   Rabin ruled out Israeli withdrawal to its pre-1967 Mideast war
borders, saying changes must be made ``to be included under
Israel's sovereignty.''
   Also, he said, Israel insisted on a ``defense line'' along the
Jordan Valley, which would effectively leave the rest of the West
Bank sandwiched between the Israeli army and the territory of
pre-1967 Israel.
   Rabin said this meant 60 percent of the West Bank and Gaza would
be part of the Jordanian-Palestinian state.
   ``To maintain Israel as a Jewish state and a democracy ... means
not allowing a situation to develop where a considerable part of
its citizens will be non-Jewish,'' he said.
   ``We cannot have 35-40 percent of the population Palestinians
who entertain civil rights. On the other hand, we cannot have a
state in which there are no equal rights to every citizen,'' Rabin
said.
   In combating the 5-month-old wave of Palestinian unrest in the
West Bank and Gaza, he said, ``The political guideline is not to
allow violence to gain the upper hand. ... It will achieve
nothing.''
   He declined to deny or confirm reports that Israel and China
have jointly developed missiles, saying Israeli policy was to
withhold comment on arms deals.
   ``I will not give you a clearcut answer, but by saying so, I am
not confirming anything about the relations between Israel and the
People's Republic of China,'' Rabin said.
   He expressed concern about the appearance of ground-to-ground
missiles and chemical weapons in the Mideast arena.
   Rabin warned of a ``very, very severe'' response if the Arabs
used chemical weapons against Israel.

   Syndicated stargazers say it was an open
secret that President and Nancy Reagan consult their horoscopes,
with their interest in astrology dating to the years when Reagan
was governor of California.
   The White House confirmed Tuesday that Nancy Reagan follows
astrology and consults it for some of the president's activities,
but the president said no policy or decision he's made has been
influenced by the stars.
   ``I refer to it as the world's worst-kept secret that President
Reagan relies on astrology. There's nothing new about it,'' said
astrologer Sydney Omarr of Santa Monica, whose syndicated daily
horoscope is distributed to more than 300 newspapers, including The
Washington Post.
   Omarr said he has never consulted with Reagan, but received
congratulations via a phone call from former White House spokesman
Larry Speakes when Omarr noted his 25 years with the Los Angeles
Times syndicate.
   ``Franklin Roosevelt relied on astrology. Theodore Roosevelt
did. George Washington's diary said he kept track of the position
of the stars,'' Omarr said.
   The confirmation of the Reagans' interest followed reports that
Donald T. Regan, the former White House chief of staff, plans to
reveal in a book that Mrs. Reagan turned to astrologers in shaping
the president's schedule.
   ``It's an input that they receive. I don't like to use the word
rely,'' said Joyce Jillson, an astrologer from the San Fernando
Valley whose daily horoscope is distributed to more than 100
newspapers nationwide by Tribune Media Services.
   Interviewed on CBS' ``This Morning'' show today, Ms. Jillson
said she was not surprised at the sudden controversy over the
Reagans' interest in astrology.
   ``This has been sort of in the offing for the last two weeks. .
.. I have been hearing rumblings about this through various
channels,'' she said.
   ``I think they handled it beautifully. And frankly I think
Donald Regan, who is a Sagitarrius, tried to use this to get much
more attention than it really got.''
   The question of Reagan and astrology surfaced more than 20 years
ago, when he chose to be sworn in as governor for his first term
shortly after midnight on Jan. 5, 1967.
   Outgoing Gov. Pat Brown said Reagan picked the time because he
relied on astrology. Reagan's aides denied that, and said the
unusual time was picked because of constitutional questions
regarding transfer of power.
   Ms. Jillson said the Reagans regularly consulted astrologers
throughout the Reagan presidency and gubernatorial tenure in
California.
   Lyn Nofziger, a former White House political aide and longtime
associate of the Reagans, dismissed the sudden interest in Mrs.
Reagan's stargazing.
   ``I have never once heard her allude to astrology or to the
stars or to the moon or to the sign of the ram,'' he said.
   He said the president liked to read his horoscope and ``laughed
about it and kidded about it, but I have never seen him take the
stuff seriously.''
   Ms. Jillson said she was at the White House after Reagan's
assassination attempt in March 1981, and helped the GOP choose
George Bush as vice president.
   ``There was talk that I did charts for all eight (vice
presidential) candidates. I don't deny that. I determined the only
winnable choice was George Bush.''
   Asked if she advised the Reagans, Ms. Jillson said, ``I never
discuss my clients.''
   She said Reagan has used astrology to pick his inauguration and
other big events. ``Look at when he holds his news conferences.
They're usually during a full moon. He chooses those times to do
it.''
   However, White House deputy press secretary B.J. Cooper said the
Reagans did not know Ms. Jillson. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater, traveling with Reagn on Air Force One to Chicago, said
today that Miss Jillson was ``crazy for trying to fabricate a White
House relationship that doesn't exist.''
   Mrs. Reagan's interest in the stars was renewed after her
husband survived the assassination attempt, Fitzwater said. Ms.
Jillson said Reagan's charts indicated danger for that time, and he
should have been more cautious.
   She added astrology was used in planning last December's summit
between the president and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but
things didn't go smoothly with Mrs. Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev
because the Soviet leader's wife's birthdate is not known in the
West.
   ``The problem with Nancy and Raisa would never have happened if
we had her birthdate,'' she said.
   The Washington Post said one of the astrologers that Mrs. Reagan
consulted was Carroll Righter of Los Angeles, who was mentioned in
Reagan's 1965 autobiography, ``Where's The Rest Of Me?'' Righter
died Saturday at age 88.

<HEAD>The Problem Of Drugs And AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Today, in some cities, the sharing of drug needles and syringes
by those who shoot drugs is the fastest growing way that the virus
is being spread.
   No one should shoot drugs. It can result in addiction, poor
health, family disruption, emotional disturbances and death. Many
drug users are addicted and need to enter a drug treatment program
as quickly as possible.
   In the meantime, these people must avoid AIDS by not sharing any
of the equipment used to prepare and inject illegal drugs.
   Sharing drug needles, even once, is an extremely easy way to be
infected with the AIDS virus. Blood from an infected person can be
trapped in the needle or syringe, and then injected directly into
the bloodstream of the next person who uses the needle.
   Other kinds of drugs, including alcohol, can also cause
problems. Under their influence, your judgment becomes impaired.
You could be exposed to the AIDS virus while doing things you
wouldn't otherwise do.
   Teen-agers are at an age when trying different things is
especially inviting. They must understand how serious the drug
problem is and how to avoid it.
   Drugs are also one of the main ways in which prostitutes become
infected. They may share needles themselves or have sex with people
who do. They then can pass the AIDS virus to others.
   For information about drug abuse treatment programs, contact
your physician, local public health agency or community AIDS or
drug assistance group.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AIDS And Babies</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   An infected woman can give the AIDS virus to her baby before it
is born, or during birth. If a woman is infected, her child has
about one chance in two of being born with the virus.
   If you are considering having a baby, and think you might have
been at risk of being infected with the AIDS virus, even if it was
years ago, you should receive counseling and be tested before you
get pregnant.
   You must have a long talk with the person with whom you're
planning to have a child. Even if you have known this person for a
long time, there's no way to be sure he or she hasn't been infected
in the past, possibly without realizing it. That person needs to
think hard and decide if an AIDS test might be a good idea. So
should you.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Talking With Kids About AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Children hear about AIDS, just as we all do. But they don't
understand it, so they become frightened. They are worried they or
their friends might get sick and die.
   Children need to be told they can't get AIDS from everyday
contact in the classroom, cafeteria or bathrooms. They don't have
to worry about getting AIDS even if one of their school-mates is
infected.
   Basic health education should be started as early as possible,
in keeping with parental and community standards. Local schools
have the responsibility to see that their students know the facts
about AIDS. It is very important that middle school students _
those entering their teens _ learn to protect themselves from the
AIDS virus.
   Children must also be taught values and responsibility, as well
as skills to help them resist peer pressure that might lead to
risky behavior. These skills can be reinforced by religious and
community groups. However, final responsibility rests with the
parents. As a parent, you should read and discuss this brochure
with your children.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Helping A Person With AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   If you are one of the growing number of people who know someone
who is infected, you need to have a special understanding of the
problem.
   No one will require more support and more love than your friend
with AIDS. Feel free to offer what you can, without fear of
becoming infected.
   Don't worry about getting AIDS from everyday contact with a
person with AIDS. You need to take precautions such as wearing
rubber gloves only when blood is present.
   If you don't know anyone with AIDS, but you'd still like to
offer a helping hand, become a volunteer. You can be sure your help
will be appreciated by a person with AIDS.
   This might mean dropping by the supermarket to pick up
groceries, sitting with the person a while, or just being there to
talk. You may even want to enroll in a support group for
caregivers. These are available around the country. If you are
interested, contact any local AIDS-related organization.
   Above all, keep an upbeat attitude. It will help you and
everyone face the disease more comfortably.

   Mob boss Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno was
convicted today of a racketeering conspiracy to rig bids in the
construction industry, but was acquitted along with two
co-defendants of tampering with Teamsters Union national elections.
   Salerno, 77, who is serving a 100-year prison term for his
conviction as a member of the U.S. Mafia's ruling ``commission,''
was found guilty of 28 counts and acquitted on five. Eight
co-defendants were convicted of racketeering and racketeering
conspiracy, both of which carry maximum 20-year prison terms.
   The federal court jury, which reached its verdict on the ninth
day of deliberations capping a trial that began April 6, 1987,
acquitted Salerno, reputed Cleveland mobster John ``Peanuts''
Tronolone and Cleveland businessman Milton ``Maishe'' Rockman, an
alleged mob associate, of fraud in the elections of Teamster
presidents Roy L. Williams and Jackie Presser.
   The jury also found that neither Salerno nor Tronolone were
involved in killing John ``Johnny Keyes'' Simone in 1980 for
allegedly participating in the murder of reputed Philadelphia mob
boss Angelo Bruno.
   Prosecutors said Salerno and several co-defendants rigged bids
on numerous construction projects including more than $30 million
in concrete work for the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on
Manhattan's West Side.
   Salerno attorney John Jacobs attacked the federal case, saying
prosecutors used ``scare tactics'' and ``Mafia hysteria'' to
influence the jury.
   Tronolone and Rockman were acquitted of all charges against
them, including racketeering, conspiracy and wire fraud.
   Salerno, convicted of racketeering in 1986 as head of the
Genovese crime family, and the other eight defendants were
convicted in the bid-rigging conspiracy.
   It took nearly an hour for the 40-page verdict to be announced.
   Prosecutors presented more than 100 witnesses and over 400 taped
conversations as evidence. Williams, the former Teamsters president
imprisoned on bribery and fraud convictions, testified via a
videotaped deposition that he was controlled by mobsters in Kansas
City, Mo.
   He also said Presser told him of having Mafia ties; Presser,
awaiting trial in an unrelated case in Cleveland, has denied any
wrongdoing.

   The Sandinista government said today
it ordered a privately owned radio station off the air for a day
and temporarily barred two others from broadcasting news programs
because of their reports on a workers' hunger strike.
   An official of the Interior Ministry, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the ministry on Tuesday night ordered Radio
Corporacion to immediately suspend service for 24 hours. The
ministry had earlier said the suspension would last eight days.
   The official said Radio Catolica, which is operated by the Roman
Catholic Church, and Radio Mundial were prohibited from
broadcasting their regular news programs for eight days. They can
appeal the order.
   Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front, said the radio stations were accused of
``spreading false information'' about a workers' hunger strike and
with violating laws preserving public order.
   Radio Catolica was shut down in January 1986 after it failed to
broadcast President Daniel Ortega's end-of-the-year message. It was
allowed to resume operations last fall under provisions of a
regional peace plan signed in August by Ortega and the presidents
of four other Central American countries.
   More than 30 construction workers and car mechanics are in the
ninth day of their hunger strike to demand higher pay.
   Jose Castillo Osejo, director of Radio Corporacion, reportedly
was punched in the mouth by Interior Minister Tomas Borge last week
because the station broadcast what Borge said was incorrect
information about the fast. Barricada reported the altercation.
   Police have taken at least 40 people into custody during the
past week in connection with the hunger strike. The fasting workers
are staying at the headquarters of the General Workers Federation,
a coalition of socialist anti-government unions.
   About 1,500 construction workers and auto mechanics walked off
the job in late February, demanding higher pay and better working
conditions.
   The wildcat strikes are an embarrassment to the leftist
government. Such strikes were illegal for almost six years under a
state of emergency that was lifted in January, again as part of the
regional peace plan.
   Rebels known as Contras have been fighting the Sandinista
government since November 1981. The regional peace plan is aimed at
ending the Contra insurgency and at halting rebellions in Guatemala
and El Salvador.

<HEAD>Number of Itemizers Dropped 15 Percent, IRS Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Johnell correct in 3rd graf, bgng ``About 31''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scaling back of some favorite deductions
under the new tax law reduced the number of itemizing taxpayers by
15 percent this year, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday.
   And despite the major changes and a confusing W-4 withholding
form, the number of taxpayers receiving refunds this year is up
slightly over 1987, the tax agency reported.
   About 31 million _ 51 percent _ of the 60.9 million long tax
forms received through April 22 itemized deductions, said IRS
spokeswoman Johnell Hunter. At the same time last year, 36.4
million _ 60 percent _ of 60.3 million long forms included itemized
deductions.
   The drop comes as no surprise. Reducing the number of itemizers
was a major goal of the 1986 tax overhaul; in fact, the reduction
was the largest element of simplification in the big package.
   In addition to cutting tax rates and boosting the personal
exemption, the new law _ which was reflected for the first time on
returns filed this year _ eliminated the deduction for state and
local sales taxes and limited writeoffs for consumer interest,
medical expenses and such miscellaneous expenses as union dues.
   The combination of a higher standard deduction and a smaller
total of itemized deductions made it beneficial for those 5.4
million taxpayers to stop itemizing. By the time the IRS counts all
the returns filed this year, the number switching to the standard
deduction will be even higher.
   The number of taxpayers receiving refunds is up 0.3 percent, to
55.5 million. That means about 79.5 percent of filers are getting
refunds.
   ``Apparently withholding was more in line with tax liability
than we had been expecting,'' Mrs. Hunter said.
   Other statistics released by the IRS on Wednesday also indicate
that taxpayers may not have had as much trouble understanding the
new law and revised tax forms as some experts had predicted.
   For example:
   _Fewer taxpayers asked the IRS to fill out their returns, about
625,000 this year compared with 770,000 last year.
   _Although the number who hired professionals to prepare their
returns rose to 44.5 million (47 percent) from 42.7 million (45
percent), the increase was less than forecast.
   _Through April 29, the IRS had received 4.76 million requests
for four-month extensions of the April 15 filing deadline. Although
this was more than the 4.37 million at the same time last year,
again the growth was less than anticipated.
   For reasons that the IRS cannot explain, changes in the number
of taxpayers seeking extensions varied sharply from region to
region.
   For example, the Philadelphia service center, which processes
returns from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and the District of
Columbia, reported requests for extensions were almost 29 percent
below last year. Cincinnati, which serves Kentucky, Michigan, West
Virginia and Ohio, showed a 47 percent drop in extensions.
   Through Friday, the IRS had received 98.6 million returns, a 2
percent increase over the 96.7 million filed in the same period in
1987. Before the year is out, the agency anticipates 107.6 million
total filings, compared with 104 million last year.
   Some other statistics from this year's filing season:

   _The number of taxpayers claiming deductions for Individual
Retirement Accounts dropped dramatically. Last year, when all wage
earners were eligible to make deductible contributions to an IRA,
14.6 million did so. This year, with deductible IRAs denied
middle-and upper-income workers covered by company pensions, 5.7
million deducted their full contribution and 1 million claimed a
partial deduction.
   _The average refund this year is $850, up less than $2 from last
year.
   _Through April 29, the IRS had processed 69.9 million returns,
down 0.2 percent from 70 million in 1987.
   _11.8 million returns were prepared on home computers before
being mailed. Some 600,000 others were prepared by professionals
and filed via computer.
   _Despite a lingering rumor that doing so makes it easier to be
fingered for an audit, the number of taxpayers who used the
official peel-off, stick-on label rose this year. About 52.6
million peeled off and stuck on, compared with 52.2 million last
year.

   The owner of a nursing home where six
people died in a Christmas Eve fire has been charged with setting
the blaze, police said.
   Bobby Ray Howell, 49, was arrested Tuesday shortly after a
Lawrence County grand jury indicted him on six counts of murder and
one count of aggravated arson.
   ``This is silly,'' Howell told Lawrence County Sheriff Tom
Pyrdum.
   Howell and his wife, Wanda, owned the J.D. Residential Home for
the Aged, which was destroyed in a fire Dec. 24, 1986.
   ``The way I feel, it's like something has been lifted off my
chest,'' said Diana Parker, who with her husband, Jim, was an
administrator at the home. Mrs. Parker has maintained a resident
initially blamed with accidentally starting the fire could not have
done so.
   One of the Parkers' sons, 16-year-old Herbert Kenneth Parker,
died in the fire.
   When the initial investigation was conducted, fire officials
said they believed an elderly, slightly retarded man given to
playing with cigarette lighters started the blaze in his room and
then panicked.
   But the Parkers said the flints had been removed from the man's
lighters as a precaution.
   District Attorney Mike Bottoms refused comment on his
investigation of the fire, citing a past legal relationship with
Howell. He also ordered investigators not to comment.
   Arraignment was scheduled Monday.
   If convicted, he could receive the death penalty.

   The State Department on Wednesday criticized
proposed legislation that would ban all U.S. investment in South
Africa.
   ``We don't believe that they (sanctions) have, or will, achieve
their intended purpose and would in many respects be
counterproductive,'' department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   He was reacting to a bill passed Tuesday by the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, which now heads for debate in the full House.
   Redman said the trade sanctions against South Africa legislated
in 1986 by Congress ``have not led to significant positive changes
in South Africa and we don't believe that additional ones are any
more likely to succeed.''
   He said the administration had been lobbying Congress against
the bill and would continue to argue its position.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III violated a
White House ban on intervening in government contracts on behalf of
friends when he tried to help the Wedtech Corp., a Senate
subcommittee report concludes.
   The report, according to Senate subcommittee staff members, says
that while Meese was counselor to President Reagan in 1981 and
1982, he violated the policy despite warnings by White House
officials not to intervene. The staffers spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Meese responded to 16 memos written by his longtime friend E.
Robert Wallach on behalf of Wedtech by directing White House
staffers to ensure that the firm got a fair hearing from the Army
in the company's efforts to obtain a $32 million no-bid engine
contract. The company was awarded the contract after Meese's
deputy, James Jenkins, intervened in the spring of 1982, calling a
crucial White House meeting at which officials of the Army, the
Small Business Administration and Wedtech executives worked out
their differences over price and the SBA agreed to contribute
millions of dollars in advance payments and loans to assist the
company.
   ``Former Counselor to the President Edwin Meese III and former
Deputy Counselor Jim Jenkins failed to observe the White House
policy on contacts with procurement officials, which failure
resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor,'' the
report said, according to the Senate staffers.
   Meese's lawyer, Nathan Lewin, disputed the findings reached by
all nine Republicans and Democrats on the Senate subcommittee
chaired by Carl Levin, D-Mich. Lewin said Meese's actions didn't
give the appearance of impropriety and did not fall within the
scope of the White House regulation.
   Lewin said the White House policy was designed to prohibit a
White House official from intervening at the request of a friend
who was asking that a certain company be awarded a contract. Lewin
said that in this instance, Meese was simply trying to ensure that
Wedtech was treated fairly when it was considered for the contract.
   The White House procurement policy in effect since October 1981
says that ``obviously, no member of the White House staff should
contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a
personal financial interest or in which a relative, friend, or
business associate has a financial interest.''
   Fred Fielding, Reagan's former counsel, told the subcommittee
staff that he advised Meese's office on two occasions not to
intervene on behalf of Wedtech, a New York City defense contracting
firm that was seeking government business.
   Fielding said he stated that ``this is a government procurement
situation. The White House should not be involved. There shouldn't
even be the appearance of White House involvement.''
   The Wedtech report was prepared by the Senate Governmental
Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management.
   Wallach and Meese's former financial adviser, W. Franklyn Chinn,
face trial in New York on federal racketeering and conspiracy
charges that include accepting funds to influence Meese on behalf
of Wedtech.
   The subcommittee cited testimony from White House officials that
the effort to help Wedtech was based on the president's campaign
promise to bring jobs and industry to the South Bronx, where the
defense contractor was located.
   ``The intervention of Mr. Meese ... appears to go beyond this
purpose and to have been due in no small part to the influence of
Welbilt consultants and personal friends E. Robert Wallach and Lyn
Nofziger,'' said the report, according to the staffers. Wedtech was
then known as Welbilt Electronic Die Corp.
   Nofziger, Reagan's former political director, was convicted in
Feburary of illegally lobbying for Wedtech.

<TEXT>
   The top political and military leadership of
the Nicaraguan Contras visited the State Department on Wednesday
and said a deep split in the rebels' top ranks was being patched up.
   ``We have a Democratic organization,'' said Enrique Bermudez,
commander of the rebel forces. ``We have a right to dissent, and
the organization has the mechanism to solve any kind of problem.''
   Adolfo Calero, one of five members of the Contra directorate and
a rival of Bermudez, replied when asked whether the rebels were
unified, ``Yes, sure we are. We're all here.''
   Bermudez vowed to stay on as military commander despite efforts
to oust him.
   He joined Calero and four other members of the directorate for a
meeting with Secretary of State George P. Shultz. State Department
officials, speaking only on condition they not be named, said
Shultz made general statements to the group stressing the need for
a unified front against Nicaragua's leftist government.
   As recently as last week Calero was reported to have described
Bermudez as the rebels' ``Noriega,'' a reference to the embattled
commander of Panama's Defense Forces, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Two weeks ago Calero led a move in the directorate to oust
Bermudez but the bid was blocked by two other members, U.S.
officials said.
   Calero, the senior member of the directorate, is said to believe
that Bermudez, in violation of the concept of civilian supremacy,
had sought to wrest control of the movement.
   The Washington Post reported in Wednesday's editions that a
petition demanding Bermudez's removal and signed by 49 rebel
commanders is to be presented to the civilian directorate.
   But Bermudez said there were only about half a dozen regional
commanders opposed to him out of a total of more than 300.
   ``It is not a majority,'' he said. ``If only a few commanders
dissent, it's acceptable.''
   The rebels briefed Shultz on a meeting they had last week with
Sandinista leaders in Managua.
   Virtually no progress was made on the goal of reaching a
permanent cease-fire and an overall settlement of the country's
six-year civil conflict.
   Calero said the rebels were unified in support of the temporary
cease-fire signed between the combatants last March 23 at Sapoa,
Nicaragua. Alfredo Cesar, another member of the directorate, joined
Calero in blaming the Sandinistas for the the lack of progress.
   ``Our demands are reasonable. The Sandinista position has been a
stumbling block,'' Cesar said.
   Calero said, ``We're all standing behind Sapoa. We're all facing
the Sandinistas together. We have to.''

<HEAD>Conservatives Face Tough Battle In Municipal Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
government, hurt in opinion polls by fierce opposition to welfare
shake-ups and a new property tax, faces a tough battle in municipal
elections Thursday.
   The local contests, ranging from the big industrial cities of
the north to town councils in the prosperous south, are the first
electoral test of Mrs. Thatcher's government since she won a third
successive in June.
   The opposition socialist Labor Party ended an upbeat campaign
buoyed by revolts among rank-and-file Tory members of Parliament
against the tax and welfare changes, which critics say will hurt
the poor.
   ``The political contours of Britain are shifting before our
eyes,'' Labor campaign manager Bryan Gould declared as the party
hit a seven-year high of support.
   Labor support has surged from the 30.8 percent in the 1987
general election. The Conservatives won that vote with 42.3 percent
of the vote. This month's Gallup poll indicated 41.5 percent
support for Labor, one point ahead of the Conservatives.
   At stake are one-third of the seats in 158 English and Welsh
districts and the entire councils of all 53 cities and towns of
Scotland. There are no elections this year in London and Northern
Ireland.
   Among the biggest prizes are Birmingham, Britain's second
largest city, Edinburgh, the Scottish capital, and the southwest
England port of Bristol, all narrowly controlled by Labor.
   Twenty million Britons are eligible to vote in the elections to
fill nearly 4,000 seats last contested in 1984. About 10,800
candidates are running.
   In the pre-election battle, opposition parties have attacked the
government's proposed welfare changes, which are aimed at ending
what the Tories call Britain's ``dependency culture'' nurtured by
the welfare state.
   The opposition has also criticized the new property tax
legislation _ the latest Conservative salvo in its battle to clip
high-spending, left-wing local authorities. Under the changed laws,
which are getting a rough ride through Parliament, property taxes
will be levied on every adult in a home, instead of on the building.
   Critics say the so-called ``poll tax'' will double or triple
bills for millions of households.
   A rough calculation shows that a four-adult family in a
middle-class London suburb, which used to pay $930 a year on its
house, will now pay $370 per head for a total of $1,480. But the
figures vary and are disputed.
   Mrs. Thatcher calls the new tax a ``community charge,''
insisting ``poll tax'' is pejorative because it falsely implies
that citizens will have to pay for their voting rights.
   Her 101-seat overall majority in the 650-member House of Commons
was slashed to 25 this month in a vote on the bill.
   Surveys show two-thirds of voters oppose the tax.
   Mrs. Thatcher argues that left-wing councils run costly policies
geared to their own low-income supporters, and finance them by
placing the main tax burden on the Tories' constituency _
businesses and middle-class households.
   When the tax comes into force in 1990, Mrs. Thatcher believes,
it will bring home to everyone, rich and poor, the cost of electing
left-wing councils.
   The councils, which run services ranging from education to
garbage collection, raise half their revenue from property taxes.
The government provides the other half.
   In an added boost for Labor, the elections are also the first
since Britain's two centrist parties merged last March into the new
Social and Liberal Democratic Party.
   The new party, known as the Democrats, and a breakway Social
Democratic Party led by former foreign secretary David Owen, are
fighting each other for about 150 seats.
   The Gallup poll indicated 11 percent support for the Democrats
and 4 percent for Owen's breakaway faction.
   In Scotland, where the Tories suffered humiliation at the last
election when they won only 10 of the 72 Scottish parliamentary
seats, the territory looks even more hostile to Mrs. Thatcher.
   Polls indicated 23 percent support there for the Tories,
compared with Labor's 50 percent and 18 percent for Scottish
nationalists.

   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank, saying
federal restrictions on Postal Service finances are ``absurd,''
called Wednesday for more control over his budget as one way to
avoid an accelerating pace forreases further,'' said
Frank, who took over the Postal Service just weeks before last
month's postal rate increase. ``I believe that the American people
are not going to be happy forever with an inexorable cycle of rate
increases every third year.''
   Frank testified at a hearing of two House Post Office and Civil
Service subcommittees, at which one congressman said talk of
inevitable rate increases is ``in and of itself negativism.''
   Rep. Frank Horton, R-N.Y., urged the Postal Service to lower
rates instead, saying ``even if it's just one cent, I think it
could be a tremendous step forward.''
   But the postmaster general said that ``over the next several
years, we need to improve our situation just to continue to meet''
the past schedule of rate boosts roughly every three years.
   Frank said the Postal Service needs more control over its
budget, hopes to find new sources of revenue in areas ranging from
transportation to philately and is examining other initiatives to
improve its management of costs.
   Horton said the April rate increase, combined with reduced Post
Office window hours because of budget cuts enacted by Congress,
plays into the hands of those who want to turn mail delivery over
to private business.
   Federal budget director James C. Miller III has called for
ending the government monopoly on mail service, and a presidential
commission in March advocated allowing private companies to go into
the mail business.
   Frank, who is a critic of such proposals, said efforts to
privatize the Postal Service ``can find fertile ground for growth
only in shortcomings and failures of the postal system itself.''
   He pledged to restore full window service as soon as finances
allow, and voiced support for legislation to separate Postal
Service finances from the rest of the federal budget.
   Frank said it was ``absurd for the Postal Service to be
regulated by budgetary `scorekeeping' rules'' designed to bring
about deficit reductions.

<HEAD>Opinionated Actor Says Speaking His Mind Cost Him Stardom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sam Elliott's first film, ``Lifeguard,''
didn't catapult him to stardom as predicted a dozen years ago, due
mainly, he says, to a penchant for speaking his mind.
   When ``Lifeguard'' was released in 1976, Elliott publicly
attacked the studio that made the film for advertisements
emphasizing an unsavory element that didn't exist in the film.
   ``It was about a guy coming of age and making important
decisions in his life, and they were talking ... beach blanket
bingo,'' he said. ``I know it had an effect on my career. Some
people just don't want to hear the truth.''
   Elliott, who lives in Malibu with his actress-wife Katharine
Ross, is starring in ``Shakedown,'' being released Friday. And he's
still speaking his mind.
   ``I'm probably more outspoken now than I was before,'' the
43-year-old actor said recently. ``But I don't think I put off
people as much now because of my sense of humor.
   ``A lot of what I've said over the years was just kidding
anyway, but people didn't realize it. Being opinionated was all it
was.''
   Elliott confesses his undercover cop role in ``Shakedown'' is a
conscious effort ``to elevate myself in this business.''
   ``I'm trying to ally myself with commercially oriented movies so
that I can become bankable and therefore get better roles,'' he
said. ``I've turned stuff down because I didn't believe in it, and
I don't want to do anything I can't believe in.
   ``If it isn't real for me, it won't be real up on the screen.''

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Judge Cites Lack of Progress in Declassifying
Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra trial Wednesday
ordered governent security officials to explain at a closed hearing
the ``apparent lack of progress'' in declassifying key documents
for the trial.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell scheduled the hearing for
Friday morning and ordered the attendance of representatives of
national intelligence agencies who are reviewing some 300,000 pages
of classified documents collected by independent counsel Lawrence
E. Walsh. The hearing will be closed to reporters and the public.
   Gesell issued the order a day after Walsh reported that 82,820
pages of classified documents plus another 22,965 pages of
classified or sensitive non-government papers had been placed in a
security facility for examination by defense lawyers for Marine Lt.
Col. Oliver L. North and three co-defendants.
   Gesell said it apeared ``from this report and other information
available to the court that the interdepartmental review committee
charged with examining classified documents is apparently failing
to meet the requirements of this criminal action.''
   The judge, who last week accused the Reagan administration of
``intentional withholding of documents necessary for the defense,''
said the closed hearing would be convened to consider ``the
apparent lack of progress being made in declassifying essential
papers.''
   Gesell's order indicated impatience with the progress that had
been made in a week. On April 28, Walsh reported that 35,254
classified government documents were ready for defense review.
   At the hearing on Friday, Gesell said he would set deadlines for
``reporting the final results of the declassification process.''
   North and his co-defendants, former national security adviser
John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord also were directed to appear
along with their lawyers and prosecutors.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, secret
documents cannot be introduced into evidence unless they are
declassified by the agency that generated them.
   The interdepartmental task force that is reviewing the material
consists of representatives from the White House, the CIA, the
National Security Council as well as the departments of Defense,
State and Justice.
   Gesell has warned repeatedly that unless the defendants are able
to introduce relevant portions of the secret documents as evidence
he would be forced to dismiss charges they conspired to divert
profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels.
   During one hearing last week, Gesell said ``a stone wall is
being built up between this court and the trial.''
   Walsh has described the documents as containing some of the
government's most closely guarded secrets, the disclosure of which
could jeopardize the lives of hostages being held in the Middle
East or compromise U.S. intelligence and military planning.
   Some of this secret material, if disclosed, could ``expose
people in very difficult situations to torture and death'' in the
Middle East, Walsh said.
   Walsh testified last week there were some documents found in
North's office that were so secret even ``he shouldn't have had.''
   Meawhile, the defense has argued that the unprecedented volume
of classified documents will make it impossible for the four
defendants to get a fair trial under procedures imposed by the law
for disclosing government secrets in court.
   The classified procedures statute requires the defense to notify
the prosecution in advance of trial of any secrets it wants to
disclose in court. This requirement, among other things, would
force the defense to tip its hand before trial, the defense lawyers
contended in a motion filed last week to declare the law's
provisions unconstitutional as applied to this case.

<HEAD>Interior Minister Says Nicaragua Talked to Rebels Because of War's
Cost</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge said the
government agreed to negotiate with Contra rebels because of the
high cost of the war in lives and resources and as a way of holding
indirect talks with the United States.
   But he cautioned that if the cease-fire talks failed, the entire
nation would be called to battle the U.S.-supported rebels.
   The leftist leader, in an interview Tuesday night, described the
almost 9-year-old Sandinista government as ``the Nicaragua we
dreamed of,'' despite opposition from a U.S. ``administration that
is particularly aggressive, visceral, expansionist and
reactionary.''
   The Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolution that deposed
the pro-American dictatorship of the late Anastasio Somoza. The
Contras began their fight 1{ years later.
   ``We've paid a high price to defend our national sovereignty and
dignity,'' said Borge, one of nine commanders in the directorate of
the governing Sandinista National Liberation Front.
   More than 26,000 people have been killed in the war, and the
government claims the economy has suffered losses of more than $3
billion.
   Recent talks in Managua with the Contras to work out a lasting
armistice have faltered as the two sides attempt to define a
vaguely worded cease-fire pact signed March 23.
   A fragile 60-day truce remains in effect until the end of this
month. The rebels have refused a Sandinista offer to extend it an
additional 30 days.
   Should the truce end without an agreement to either prolong the
cease-fire or a lasting peace plan, ``we'll mobilize the entire
nation,'' Borge said.
   He said Nicaragua agreed to negotiations with the rebels because
it ``has paid a high cost in blood'' in the war.
   ``But if the Contras were not badly beaten militarily, or held
land, they would never negotiate with us,'' he said.
   The Sandinistas initially refused to hold direct talks with the
Contras or allow them to come to Nicaragua for discussions. Borge
acknowledged the back-pedaling but said, ``We will never discuss
political power'' with the Contras.
   ``We understand the negotiations with the Contras are indirect
(talks) with the United States,'' he said.
   The Sandinistas had long said that any discussions to end the
fighting should be with the Reagan administration because of its
aid to the Contras.
   Borge dismissed rumors that the directorate was split between
his hard-line followers and those of President Daniel Ortega.
   ``The worst enemies of revolutions are the revolutionaries ...
who fight among themselves,'' Borge said. ``We all discuss and
discuss until we're in agreement. There are certain contradictions.
That's natural and helps contribute and move things forward.''
   He said the Sandinistas would give up power if they lost in
elections, but said that would be the end of the Nicaraguan
revolution.
   ``And this is impossible, nothing can kill the revolution,'' he
added.
   Asked if the government was Marxist-Leninist, Borge said the
teachings of those two thinkers was ``a universal science and
anyone who doesn't study it is either mentally retarded or
ignorant.'' He said Marxist-Leninist theory ``was an important
guide in our decisions.''
   He praised the government's ties to the Soviet Union, which
provides most of the country's aid. The Soviet Union, he said,
``helps us and respects us and we appreciate it.''

   The play was praised but the critics were not as
kind to Madonna, making her Broadway debut in ``Speed-The-Plow,''
David Mamet's scathing comedy about two Hollywood producers and a
temporary secretary.
   ``No, She Can't Act'' headlined the New York Daily News. Its
drama critic, Howard Kissel, called ``Speed-The-Plow'' ``Mamet's
clearest, wittest play,'' but added ``I bet it would be even
funnier with an actress.''
   Clive Barnes of the New York Post agreed. He said the rock star
``sounds more as if she were auditioning than acting, and the
audition is scarcely for the big time. There is a genuine, reticent
charm here, but it not yet ready to light the lamps on Broadway.''
   Frank Rich of The New York Times was more positive. He said
Madonna ``serves Mr. Mamet's play much as she did the Susan
Seidelman film `Desperately Seeking Susan,' with intelligent,
scrupulously disciplined comic acting.''
   ``She delivers the shocking transitions essential to the action
and needs only more confidence to relax a bit and fully command her
speaking voice,'' the Times said.
   Madonna's role is the smallest in the three-character play, and
she is on stage less than half the time. The play also stars Joe
Mantegna and Ron Silver.
   But it has been Madonna who sold tickets. ``Speed-The-Plow''
orginally was scheduled to open at the 299-seat Mitzi Newhouse
Theater in Lincoln Center but ticket demand was so great than it
was moved to the 1,058-seat Royale Theater.
   Even so, the Lincoln Center Theater, which produced the play on
Broadway, deliberately downplayed Madonna's role in the production.
It declined all interviews for the star and kept publicity to a
minimum.
   By the time the show opened Tuesday night, it had a good but not
overwhelming advance sale of $500,000. With the favorable reviews,
the box office expected to take in more than $100,000 the day after
the opening, said Merle Debuskey, a spokesman for the show.
   Mantegna and Silver, who play the sleazy Hollywood producers,
were universally lauded. Linda Winer, writing in Newsday, called
Mantegna ``irresistible,'' and she said Silver delivered ``a
riveting breakthrough performance.'' Said Rich, ``The men could not
be better. Mr. Silver gives the performance of his career.''
   ``Speed-The-Plow'' is Mamet's third play to be done on Broadway.
``American Buffalo,'' starring Robert Duvall, has a financially
unsuccessful run in 1977, but later was revived successfully
off-Broadway with Al Pacino. Mamet's ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' which
opened on Broadway in 1984, won a Pulitzer Prize for drama.
Mantegna won a Tony Award in that play.
   All three stars are committed to appear in the play for six
months.

<HEAD>$6.5 Billion A Year Needed To Upgrade Nation's Housing, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will have to spend $6.5 billion
more a year on housing over the next 15 years if every American is
to have a decent, affordable place to live, an industry-backed
study said Wednesday.
   The study, financed by the National Association of Realtors,
estimated the nation will need to spend $41 billion to help build
or renovate 36 million housing units over the period because many
Americans now live without adequate plumbing, sewage disposal or
electricity or in overcrowded conditions.
   In addition, $56 billion over current levels will be needed to
subsidize families that would otherwise have to pay more than the
recommended 30 percent of their income for housing, according to
the study performed by the Urban Institute, a research organization.
   ``We are reminded daily of the homeless on our streets and
shelters. Less visible, but no better off, are those who live in
inadequate housing or who pay the majority of their incomes just to
stay off these streets,'' said Nestor Weigand, president of the
Realtors association, who presented the study at a news conference.
   ``If we don't take some affirmative action,'' the ``primary
American dream of home ownership'' will not be realized for growing
percentages of people, the real estate executive said.
   With the widening gap between income and housing costs, home
ownership for people between the ages of 25 and 34 has dropped 20
percent so far in the 1980s, he said.
   In addition to government help to build and upgrade housing,
Weigand recommended restoring tax incentives for investment in
low-and moderate-income housing, more local government action to
encourage building and a law to allow younger people to use
tax-free retirement funds for down payment on a home.
   The study, ``America's Housing Needs to the 21st Century,'' said
7.7 million households are living in substandard units and 3.2
million others are in overcrowded conditions.
   It said more than 6 percent of housing units in urban areas and
17 percent of units in rural areas don't meet minimum standards set
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD classifies
a dwelling as substandard if it does not have electricity, lacks
adequate plumbing or lacks sewage disposal.
   The study did not address the likelihood of getting additional
funds through Congress at a time of budget constraints imposed by
the high federal deficits.
   John Tuccillo, Realtors association chief economist, said the
group is working with members of Congress on comprehensive housing
legislation that he expects to pass next year. The Reagan
administration has generally opposed any new housing initiatives
and scaled back many of the programs in existence when it came into
office in 1981.
   The Realtors-Urban Institute study is the latest of several
recent reports looking into the country's housing needs. In March,
the National Housing Task Force issued a report recommending a
12-year program with a goal of providing livable housing for all
Americans.
   The private task force recommended the program begin with a $3
billion appropriation to be used as seed money to stimulate state
and local efforts to develop and renovate low-income housing.
   Tuccillo said all the recent studies point to the same need. He
said the Realtors study is the first to evaluate what it would take
to wipe out the housing problem over a set period of time.

   Superintendent of Public Instruction Lynn
Simons announced Wednesday she will seek the Democratic nomination
for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Malcolm Wallop.
   Simons, head of the state's public education system since 1978,
joins Democrats state Sen. John Vinich and University of Wyoming
Professor Peter Maxfield in seeking the office Wallop has held 12
years.
   Simons, a former teacher, said the economic policies of the
Reagan administration have done little for the country or the state.
   ``It certainly has not been good for the state,'' she said. ``I
am the right person at the right time for the right job.''
   Simons said she believed her position would help her address
issues in the Senate. ``If there is a hope, and I believe there is
one, education is exceedingly important in the change to a new
economy,'' she said.
   Simons said she decided Friday to run, and added she did not
consider the announcement late, even though the state Democratic
convention is Saturday.
   ``I had to get through the legislative session and take care of
my court case,'' she said.
   The court case stemmed from Simons' decision in 1987 to seek the
dismissal of employees without regard to state personnel rules. A
federal jury found against Simons and her deputy in a lawsuit filed
against them, but Simons said she did not know if the incident
would hurt her chances for support from state employees.
   Simons said she supported a fee on imported oil and did not
support a tax increase.
   State election officials have said she would have to resign only
if she wins the election.

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop is mailing
every American household a historic pamphlet with explicit advice
on how to avoid the deadly AIDS virus, including the use of condoms.
   In unveiling the booklet at a news conference Wednesday, Health
and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen said the $17 million
AIDS project represented ``the first time the federal government
has attempted to contact virtually every resident, directly by
mail, regarding a public health crisis.''
   Bowen said he asked Koop to play the leading role in the project
because ``Americans know and have faith in the health advisories of
the surgeon general, and that trust will help ensure the success of
this effort.''
   Koop's photo appears on the cover, along with a brief message
over his signature.
   ``Some of the issues involved in this brochure may not be things
you are used to discussing openly,'' he wrote. ``I can easily
understand that. But now you must discuss them. We all must know
about AIDS. Read this brochure and talk about it with those you
love.''
   Although fine print at the bottom identifies it as an official
government document _ ``HHS Publication No. (CDC) HHS-88-8404'' _
the slick layout produced by a private public relations company
does not smack of officialese.
   And despite the explicit language contained in the eight pages,
the booklet will not be in a plain brown envelope when it starts
appearing in the nation's mailboxes May 26.
   Before that time, television networks have been asked to
broadcast a series of promotional spots alerting their viewers to
be looking for the mailer. Posters also are going up in 7,000 post
offices and other locations advertising: ``You Asked For Answers
About AIDS. They're In The Mail.''
   The AIDS virus most often is spread through close contact with
blood, blood products or semen from infected persons.
   The second page of the brochure bears the blue heading ``How Do
You Get AIDS From Sex?'' and goes on to state that the deadly AIDS
virus ``can enter the body through the vagina, penis, rectum or
mouth.''
   ``Anal intercourse, with or without a condom, is risky,'' it
continues. ``The rectum is easily injured during anal intercourse.''
   The fourth page is half filled by a section boldly headlined:
``What Is All The Talk About Condoms?''
   ``Not so very long ago, condoms (rubbers or prophylactics) were
things we didn't talk about very much,'' it says. ``Now, they're
discussed on the evening news and on the front page of your
newspaper, and displayed out in the open in your local drugstore,
grocery and convenience store.
   ``For those who are sexually active and not limiting their
sexual activity to one partner, condoms have been shown to help
prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. That is why
the use of condoms is recommended to help reduce the spread of
AIDS.''
   Federal health officials have projected there will be 270,000
cases of AIDS in the United States by 1991 and that as many as 1.5
million Americans are infected with the virus now.
   The content of the pamphlet was a closely held secret in an
obvious _ although not officially acknowledged effort _ to keep the
message from being diluted by political pressure from outside the
health department.
   In his remarks at the news conference, Koop said, ``A careful
reading of this brochure should enable the reader to separate true
health information from various political agendas promoted at the
expense of the public's health.''
   He said mailing the brochure ``is the closest we can come to
making something required reading in every American home. I hope
that parents, grandparents, children and teen-agers will set a time
when they can sit down together and review the information in these
eight pages.
   ``I would hope that schools could do the same thing in
classrooms where the age is appropriate,'' added Koop, who came
under stern criticism from conservatives in 1986 when his initial
36-page, more technical report on AIDS called for sex education in
schools to help combat the epidemic.
   Asked if he expects a new wave of criticism in response to the
latest report, Koop said, ``I expect everything all the time.''
   The surgeon general noted that legislation ordering a national
mailer by June 30 spelled out that its content was not to be
subject to clearance outside the health department.
   ``We took them at their word,'' Koop said. ``This was not
cleared in the sense that some documents are.''
   Koop did say it was ``discussed with key people'' at the White
House.
   Asked later to elaborate, Dr. James Mason, head of the Centers
for Disease Control, said staff members of the White House Domestic
Policy Council asked to see a copy after ``camera-ready'' pages of
the brochure were ready to send to the printers.
   ``No changes were made,'' Mason said.
   Plans for a national mailer last year were dropped, largely
because the Domestic Policy Council suggested that such a project
should be reviwed by the then newly appointed White House AIDS
commission.
   Although the content was tightly controlled by Bowen, Koop,
Mason and other top federal health officials, the design of the
brochure was handled by Ogilvy & Mather.
   Neil Cameron of the company's Atlanta office said focus group
sessions held around the nation found that the explicit language
used in the brochure was acceptable to the overwhelming majority of
those asked to respond.
   The project calls for 110 million copies to be printed in
English and an additional 4 million in Spanish. The bulk will be
mailed directly to the 107 million households served by the U.S.
Postal Service.
   The chief victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have
been homosexual men and intravenous drug users, although a small
percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated
blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women
to their offspring.
   As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500
Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000 have died since
June 1981, according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered
from AIDS.

   President Reagan, taking a conciliatory tone
toward the Soviet Union, said today he believes that ``there is
hope for further change'' in Soviet human rights policies.
   At the same time, Reagan acknowledged that the United States has
an ``agonizing'' problem in dealing with its homeless and needs to
do more to curb unemployment and combat bigotry.
   Reagan made the remarks in a speech that was markedly less
confrontational than his foreign policy address in Springfield,
Mass., April 21, which Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev rebuked as
confrontational.
   Both speeches were billed as scene-setters for the May 29-June 2
summit meeting between the two leaders in Moscow.
   In his address here to the National Strategy Forum, a
non-partisan organization that sponsors educational programs on
national security and foreign policy issues, Reagan said that over
the last three years some 300 political and religious prisoners
have been released from Soviet labor camps.
   He said the changes were ``limited'' and added, ``We encourage
the Soviets to go further.''
   ``But we applaud the changes that have taken place,'' he said.
   Reagan said the United States is also ``heartened'' by the
increased rate of people being permitted to leave the Soviet Union.
   In a brief question-and-answer session with the audience, Reagan
said he was willing to give Gorbachev ``the benefit of the doubt,
up to a point,'' that he sincerely wants to achieve the program of
economic and social reforms known as glasnost.
   He also expressed a dream ``to rid the world'' of nuclear
weapons. He compared the danger of nuclear weapons to a
hypothetical situation in which the world was threatened by a power
from outer space.
   ``Wouldn't we all of a sudden find that we didn't have any
differences between us at all, we were all human beings, citizens
of the world, and wouldn't we come together to fight that
particular threat?,'' Reagan asked.
   On Tuesday, Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for
human rights and humanitarian affairs, said that applications for
Jewish emigration are now being handled ``reasonably fast.'' But he
told the National Conference on Soviet Jewry that Jews wishing to
leave the Soviet Union should apply now, lest the approval process
slow down.
   For his part, Reagan said, ``In recent months, the Soviet Union
has shown a willingness to respect at least some human rights. It
is my belief that there is hope for further change, hope that in
the days ahead the Soviets will grant further recognition to the
fundamental civil and political rights of all.''
   Reagan also noted that Gorbachev has initiated some reforms _
allowing over the last three years the release of 300 political and
religious prisoners from prison camps, slowing the incarcerations
of dissidents in mental hospital and prisons, and allowing some
broadenings of freedom of the press.
   He then noted that the Soviets often reply to criticism of their
human rights record by noting that the United States has problems
of homelessness, unemployment and discrimination within its own
borders.
   ``Yes, the United States has social and economic shortcomings,''
he said.
   ``Unemployment, for one. As a free people we have created an
economic expansion that over the past five years has created nearly
16 million jobs, but we need to do more.''
   ``Homelessness is indeed a problem, and an agonizing one,'' he
added. ``As a free people, our churches, synagogues, and a host of
volunteer organizations do much to provide the homeless with food,
clothing and medicines. And yet, there is no denying that a problem
remains.''
   ``Racial discrimination -- our strides as a free people during
just the past three decades have been dramatic,'' the president
said. ``Yet the problem lingers, and we continue to battle bigotry
and prejudie.''
   Reagan said that while ``so-called economic and social rights
belong to an essentially different category from civil and
political rights,'' it is also true that ``the Soviets may be
coming to understand something of the connection ... between human
rights and economic growth.''
   ``The Soviets should recognize basic human rights because it is
the right thing to do,'' he said. ``But, if they recognize human
rights for reasons of their own _ because they seek economic
growth, or because they want to enter into a more normal
relationship with the United States and other nations _ well, I
want to say here and now, that's fine by me.''
   In his Springfield speech, Reagan had said that if the Soviet
Union was changing it was ``because the costs of aggression and the
real moral difference between our systems were brought home to it.''
   Reagan also spoke sharply of the Soviets in that speech and
suggested they might not be sincere about their stated intention to
end their military occupation of Afghanistan.
   Gorbachev, in a Moscow meeting with Secretary of State George
Shultz, criticized Reagan's speech, giving way to a round of harsh
tit-for-tat rejoinders that have marked U.S.-Soviet comments in
recent weeks.
   Gorbachev decried the ``confrontational'' tone of the speech and
said that if the Soviets responded in kind, it could become ``no
longer possible to solve any further issues'' between the two
superpowers.
   In a speech Tuesday, the president said Gorbachev has admitted
the Soviet Union made mistakes dealing with religious believers in
decades past and they would be ``rectified.''
   ``What we hope for ultimately is a willingness to see continued
change, in the spirit of glasnost, when it comes to matters of
religion,'' Reagan told a meeting on religious rights at the White
House.
   Glasnost is the Russian term for the Soviet leader's policy of
bringing openness to Soviet society.

   A teen-ager was charged with assault Wednesday
after he shot one of six youths who robbed him aboard a subway
train, police said.
   The bullet glanced off the young man's chest and he was not
seriously injured, said Transit Authority police spokesman Al
O'Leary.
   Officials denied any similarity between the incident and the
highly publicized Bernhard Goetz shooting. Goetz, who is white,
shot four black young men who surrounded him and demanded money
aboard a subway.
   O'Leary said Decosta Wright, 17, shot Anthony Smith, 22, after
Smith and five others accosted Wright as a train pulled into a
Brooklyn subway station around 12:40 a.m. Wednesday.
   The gang put Wright in a headlock, threw him to the floor of the
subway car and took a gold ring and his wallet, containing $20,
O'Leary said.
   ``At some point, Mr. Wright decided he had enough and he pulls
out a .25-caliber silver Raven automatic pistol and fires one
shot,'' striking Smith, O'Leary said.
   The TA spokesman denied any similarity to the Goetz case,
saying: ``Here a violent felony was committed against the victim
before he fired any shots. In the Goetz case there was a threat or
perception of a crime about to be committed.''
   Goetz, who was acquitted of attempted murder and assault charges
but convicted of weapons possession, said he thought the young men
were trying to rob him. His victims said they were only panhandling.
   In the Brooklyn shooting, the victim and his attackers were all
black.
   The wounded youth stumbled off the train and told a transit
officer he had been shot. After transit police found Wright and
heard his story, they arrested both Smith and Wright.
   Police also eventually arrested four other teen-agers, including
a 14-year-old boy who had Wright's gold ring and a high school pass
in his pockets. Transit police were still looking for the other
youth.
   Wright was charged with second-degree assault, illegal weapons
possession and reckless endangerment, according to O'Leary. In
addition to the attackers, there were several other passengers
aboard the train.
   Smith and the other four were charged with first-degree robbery.

vowed to put their principal on the roof and up on the roof went
Principal Jim Hand.
   Hand was holding up his end of a bargain to sit on the roof one
minute for every five pounds of aluminum cans students brought to
school as part of a Keep America Beautiful campaign.
   McDonald students collected 624.5 pounds of aluminum cans, which
means Hand owes two hours and four minutes on the roof. Because of
rain, he spent only about 15 minutes there Tuesday.
   Hand finished paying his IOU on Wednesday. He went to the roof
with a lawn chair, fishing pole and bucket of minnows so he could

   A group of elementary school pupils in
Clinton hope to make friends and pick up pen pals among Soviet
children by sending them a 64-page book they wrote about life in
America.
   Steven Nagler, a Yale professor who is leading a 14-day tour of
five Soviet cities, intends to present the book at an elementary
school along his route. The group leaves Friday.
   A class of second- and third-graders at Joel Elementary School
prepared the book with the help of their teacher, Robert Sepanik.
Sepanik wrote the introduction and had an inscription written in
Russian: ``Greetings from the children of the Joel School.''
   The youngsters wrote about Clinton, their school and their
families, their hobbies and interests and sports and holidays.
   Nagler, whose 8-year-old daughter is in Sepanik's class, is a
social work professor at the Yale Child Study Center and is leading
50 students on a tour of child and older adult welfare programs in
the Soviet Union.

   The one thing William Ennis doesn't want
to do in a doctor's waiting room is wait.
   So when he had to wait an hour to see Dr. G. Richard Cohen of
Lake Worth in August 1987, the Lantana plant nursery owner sued for
$90, to compensate him for lost time.
   Ennis said he had called twice to make sure that his 8:45 a.m.
appointment with Cohen to discuss cornea implant surgery would be
on time.
   When it wasn't, Ennis got mad.
   Cohen said that he had five legitimate emergencies that morning
and tried to apologize to Ennis, but didn't get a chance.
   Ennis proposed a settlement: If Cohen would donate $90 to the
Lion's Club, the matter would be forgotten. Cohen agreed to make
the donation this month, The Miami Herald reported Wednesday.
   ``I did it just to avoid going to trial,'' said Cohen. ``This
could cause havoc if people could sue just because they have to
wait. Next they'll be suing if they wait in line at Sears.''

   US Accuses Japanese of Protectionism, But Opens Door to Resuming
Talks
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter on
Wednesday sharply accused Japan of protectionism in its dispute
with the United States over beef and orange import quotas. But he
left open the door to restarting negotiations that collapsed here
Tuesday night.
   Yeutter said the Japanese restrictions ``presumably'' will be be
declared illegal by GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, under a complaint process accepted by Japan at a GATT
meeting in Geneva hours after breakdown of the Washington talks.
   Such a finding would open the way to compensation or possible
U.S. trade reprisals or a combination of both, he said.
   ``My patience as a negotiator has come to an end,'' Yeutter told
a news conference, but he still talked of a possible resumption of
talks.
   He accused the Japanese of failing to match U.S. concessions in
the prolonged dispute and of making a beef price-fixing proposal
amounting to ``clearly the antithesis of free and open trade.''
   However, Yeutter said overall trade relations between the two
countries are ``still very good'' and the United States ``would be
happy at any time'' to listen to new Japanese proposals provided
they ``reflect a whole lot more market liberalization than surfaced
in the last few days...
   ``Hopefully they will reappraise their position and come forth
with much more accommodating proposals sometime in the future ...''
Yeutter said. ``If an opportunity arises to resolve the issue
through negotiations in the next two to three months while the GATT
panel is organizing itself, we would be very pleased.''
   Yeutter said during the talks he had offered to waive U.S.
claims for potential compensation for damages to its export trade
if the Japanese would agree to a two-year phaseout of the quotas
``but even that was unacceptable.''
   The Commerce Department has estimated that annual U.S. beef
exports to Japan of about $550 million could grow to about $1
billion under free trade and exports of oranges and orange juice,
now less than $100 million a year, could top $150 million.
   Warning that ``we will not tolerate stalling of the GATT process
by the government of Japan,'' Yeutter said, ``we will be a lot
harder to deal with once we have a decision'' from GATT.
   ``We will not permit this case to spill into the next
administration. We're going to resolve this dispute one way or
another during this (President Ronald Reagan's) administration,''
he said.
   He also accused Japan of delaying action on opening markets to
12 varieties of U.S. processed foods in a case settled by GATT
earlier this year. The United States will pursue this with GATT in
June, he said.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said in a statement issued
by his Washington office that the United States has insisted
throughout on complete removal of the beef and orange quotas.
   Disclosing new details of his negotiations with Japanese
Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato, however, Yeutter said the United
States would have accepted a proposal for a three-year phaseout of
the beef quota if Japan had not sought to raise new barriers.
   He also said a two-year phaseout of orange and orange juice
import quotas could have been accepted, but Japan insisted on five
years and offered only a 10 percent annual tonnage increase.

<HEAD>Metzenbaum Ready for Fight in Ohio; Bayh Campaigns for Indiana
Governorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum predicted a tough battle
against his GOP challenger, Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, but
the outspoken liberal added: ``I must be doing something right if
so many people want to beat me.''
   ``There isn't a hit list in America that doesn't have me at the
top of it,'' the 70-year-old Metzenbaum told reporters in Cleveland
after he crushed a little-known primary opponent to win nomination
for a third term.
   Voters in two other primaries Tuesday chose Democratic
candidates for governor in states where Republicans now hold the
top job.
   In Indiana, Secretary of State Evan Bayh swamped his only
primary foe and will face Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz, who was unopposed
for the GOP nomination. With Gov. Robert Orr barred by law from
seeking a third term, Democrats hope to recapture the governor's
mansion for the first time in 20 years.
   In North Carolina, Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan beat four rivals for the
chance to face Gov. Jim Martin, who is only the second Republican
governor in the state this century. Martin, seeking a second term,
was unchallenged in the primary.
   Voinovich, a 51-year-old moderate who was the only Republican in
the race, promised a ``barn-burner'' of a fight and said he had
``never seen people more excited about a senatorial campaign,
whether it's enthusiasm for me, or antagonism toward Metzenbaum.''
   Metzenbaum is among the most liberal members of Congress and as
a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee played a key role in
killing the nomination of Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The contest is expected to be one of the most expensive in Ohio
history, with the two men having raised more than $7 million
through the end of March.
   In Indiana, Bayh has the benefit of one of the state's most
popular political names as the son of former Sen. Birch Bayh. But
Mutz has been attacking him on the issues of age and experience _
he is 32 and has held statewide office less than two years.
   The Mutz campaign quickly unveiled television advertisements
showing each candidate's photograph atop a resume. Mutz's resume
fills with his record as a successful businessman, 13-year member
of the General Assembly and two-term lieutenant governor presiding
over the state's economic development program.
   The lone entry on Bayh's resume is a reference to 15 months as
secretary of state. After that image appears, the two resumes are
shown side by side and viewers are told Mutz is ready now for
Indiana's toughest job.
   Two-term Republican Sen. Richard G. Lugar and Democrat Jack
Wickes, an Indianapolis attorney, were unopposed for Senate
nominations.
   In North Carolina, Jordan acknowledged his standing as an
underdog against a popular incumbent, but said he counted on help
from a Democratic Party that is ``unified in a way that I have not
seen it before.''
   Merle Black, political science professor at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said that to win Jordan must
``present a positive agenda that will excite Democrats and
independents to vote for him.''
   ``But he's also running as an underdog and he's got to give
people reasons why Jim Martin shouldn't be re-elected,''
   Here are the vote totals from the primaries:
   _ In Ohio, final unofficial results showed Metzenbaum with
1,067,138 votes, or 83 percent, to 213,120, or 17 percent, for
Ralph Applegate, who runs a Columbus lawn-care business.
   _ In Indiana, with 98 percent of precincts reporting, Bayh had
482,393 votes, or 83 percent and former Kokomo Mayor Stephen J.
Daily had 66,001 or 11 percent. The rest of the votes went to
Senate Minority Leader Frank O'Bannon, whose name was put on the
ballot as a precaution by the Bayh campaign when it appeared Bayh
might be found in violation of the state's residency requirement.
   _ In North Carolina, with 99 percent of precincts reporting,
Jordan had 404,091 votes or 80 percent to 61,291 votes or 12
percent for Billy Martin, a service-station employee from Carthage
not related to the governor. Ex-Ku Klux Klansman Carroll Crawford
had 22,061 votes or 4 percent, James Lloyd of Salisbury 10,433
votes or 2 percent and anti-nuclear activist Bruce Friedman of
Sylva 9,713 votes or 2 percent.

   Israeli forces shelled a Syrian-held
town and battled pro-Iranian guerrillas today and then announced
that the Israeli drive into southern Lebanon had ended.
   Israel reported that three Israelis and more than 40 Arab
guerrillas were killed.
   The Israeli military said in a statement issued late today in
Jerusalem that the two-day operation had ended and all
participating Israeli forces had returned to their bases.
   The Israeli military statement said 17 Israelis were wounded. It
said most of the Arab guerrillas killed were members of Hezbollah,
Lebanon's most radical Shiite Moslem faction.
   The army statement said Hezbollah guerrillas had expelled all
the residents from the village of Maydoun, some 12 miles north of
the Israeli border, and were using the village as a launching point
for attacks on Israeli forces and their Lebanese militia allies.
   Dozens of Hezbollah guerrillas were in Maydoun when the fighting
started today, the Israeli army command said. It said helicopter
gunships and Israeli artillery destroyed the guerrillas' artillery
and vehicles with mounted anti-aircraft guns.
   Israel identified two of the dead troopers as Capt. Boaz Ravid
of Beit Ovad and Sgt. Marco Bernstein of Nahariya. The name of
third dead Israeli was not immediately made public.
   Security sources in south Lebanon said earlier today that the
Israeli soldiers died when the army stormed Shiite guerrilla bases.
   A police spokesman, who like the security sources spoke on
condition of anonymity, said seven guerrillas were killed in the
shootout around the villages of Maydoun and Ein el-Tineh in the
southwestern sector of the Bekaa Valley.
   The villages are five miles south of the town of Mashghara,
where police said a 50-man Syrian garrison came under Israeli
howitzer fire.
   There was no immediate word on any Syrian casualties, and it was
not known if the Syrians responded to the Israeli shellfire.
   Mashghara is four miles west of the Israelis' forward positions
and is the Syrians' southern outpost in the western Bekaa.
   The action was the first contact between the Syrians, who have
16,000 troops in the Bekaa, and the Israelis since they pushed out
of their self-designated border ``security zone'' Monday night to
knock out guerrilla bases.
   It was also the first time the Syrians have come under Israeli
fire in Lebanon since they were forced from south Lebanon in heavy
fighting when the Israelis invaded in June 1982.
   An Israeli armored column stormed bases manned by guerrillas of
Hezbollah in hills overlooking Maydoun and Ein el-Tineh.
   The villages are nine miles west of five villages the Israelis
sealed off Tuesday and searched for Palestinian guerrillas and
allied Lebanese militiamen.
   U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel said U.N. spotters saw an Israeli
helicopter exchange fire with guerrillas in a dry riverbed
southeast of Maydoun about 4:30 a.m. He said he could not confirm
Lebanese reports a helicopter was shot down.
   The police spokesman said gunners of the Lebanese army later
opened up on Israeli tanks with Soviet-made 130mm howitzers
deployed near Lake Qaroun, about six miles east of Maydoun.
   Security sources in south Lebanon reported that Israel sent two
more mechanized battalions into the area during the night, doubling
the size of their force to about 2,500 troops.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Tuesday he did not
expect the operation to provoke a confrontation with Syria,
Israel's staunchest enemy. The Israeli operation in Lebanon is its
largest in two years.
   The clashes in southern Lebanon occurred as Palestinian
protesters virtually shut down the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip with a general strike.
   At least 180 Arabs have been killed since the unrest began in
the occupied territories Dec. 8. An Israeli soldier and a Jewish
teen-age settler also have been slain.
   Police said hundreds of civilians fled villages near the
security zone during today's fighting.
   Reporters in the Bekaa saw dozens of villagers carrying
belongings, blankets and mattresses heading for safer areas behind
the Syrian lines.
   Shortly after today's advance, 500 Israeli soldiers began
withdrawing from five Bekaa Valley villages. A police spokesman
said the Israelis began pulling out of Ain Ata, Memis, Kfeer,
Khalwat and Ain Zeta after ``completing the search.''
   The spokesman said the Israelis rounded up several Lebanese
militiamen allied with the Palestinians in the five villages and
seized ``large quantities of weapons and ammunition.''
   A resident of Khiam told reporters Israeli soldiers detained 30
men in the village Tuesday. The Israeli army declined comment.
   The Lebanese spokesman said the Israelis used police dogs in
house-to-house searches in Ain Ata and nearby villages and called
on the population ``not to cooperate with saboteurs and
accomplices.''
   Israel set up the security zone after it withdrew the bulk of
its army from Lebanon in 1985, three years after invading its
northern neighbor.

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down Beach Segregation In Port Elizabeth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court ruled Wednesday that
Port Elizabeth must let all races onto its beaches. Groups of
blacks rushed to the shore, running triumphantly on the previously
``whites only'' sand.
   The regional Supreme Court in the southeastern port supported a
city councilor and a member of Parliament who claimed the city
council acted without proper authority when it passed a resolution
in 1966 segregating the beaches of the nation's fifth-largest city.
   Chris Heunis, the constitutional development minister, and Cape
Province administrator Gene Louw opposed the suit. Their lawyers
said they may appeal.
   Heunis and President P.W. Botha have taken a middle ground
recently on the volatile issue of ``beach apartheid,'' saying some
beaches should be integrated but others reserved for whites. The
extreme-right Conservative Party, whose power is growing, opposes
any integration of beaches.
   Graham Richards, the white city councilor who filed the
challenge, called the court decision ``a small victory for those of
us fighting what sometimes seems to be a losing battle against the
continuous inroads made by the government against basic human
rights.''
   Most beaches are open to all races in the two largest coastal
cities, Durban and Cape Town. One section of Durban's beachfront
remains segregated. blacks are barred from many beaches in smaller
communities.
   In January 1987, Port Elizabeth's beaches were the scene of a
political confrontation between Botha and the Rev. Alan Hendrickse,
leader of the mixed-race chamber of Parliament.
   Hendrickse waded into the surf in well-publicized defiance of
apartheid segregation laws. He later apologized to Botha, which
hurt his credibility with anti-apartheid groups.
   After learning of Wednesday's ruling, Hendrickse said in
Parliament: ``Somebody owes me an apology.''
   Also Wednesday, two African National Congress guerrillas were
sentenced to be hanged for land mine explosions that jolted
northern farming communities in 1985-86. They were convicted of
murder last week in Messina, near the Zimbabwe border.
   Mzondileli Nondula, 25, was convicted of planting a mine that
killed two white women and four white children in December 1985.
Mthetheleli Mncube, 28, was convicted of setting a mine that killed
a black man in November 1985 and of killing two white policemen in
a subsequent escape attempt.
   ``We have lost the battle but not the war,'' Mncube said after
the sentence. ``We shall win.''
   The ANC is the main guerrilla movement fighting white domination
in South Africa.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok offered to compensate
relatives for the funeral expenses of two boys shot to death in
1985 by policemen who were hiding in crates on a truck to entrap
stone-throwing youngsters in a mixed-race township.
   A judge ruled at an inquest March 3 into what is called the
``Trojan horse'' incident that police acted unreasonably, but on
Tuesday a prosecutor declined to press charges against the officers.
   Vlok said his department would pay the funeral expenses and
legal costs borne by the families of Michael Miranda, 11, and Shaun
Magmoed, 16. The families are expected to get about 900 rand ($425)
each.

   Slain Lumbee Indian candidate Julian T.
Pierce outpolled Joe Freeman Britt in the race for a superior court
judge's seat in Robeson County, but Britt will become judge in
December.
   Even though the vote Tuesday carries no legal power, Pierce
supporters said it has symbolic meaning for minority residents'
struggle to rid their county of discrimination and corruption.
   ``The turnout in the minority precincts was even higher than for
school merger (which was passed by county voters March 8),'' said
Harvey Godwin, Pierce's campaign manager. ``That is people making a
strong statement. The voters believed in what he stood for.''
   Britt, the county's district attorney, was automatically
declared the winner of the Democratic nomination for a new state
superior court judgeship after Pierce was killed in his home March
26 by three shotgun blasts in what authorities say was a domestic
dispute. One man was charged with murder in his death, while
another committed suicide before he could be arrested, authorities
said.
   In unofficial vote totals from 28 of the county's 40 precincts,
Pierce got 7,652 votes to Britt's 5,238 in the judgeship race.
   Elections Board Chairman Murchison ``Bo'' Biggs said state law
prevents election officials from counting or publicizing the
results of the Britt-Pierce race because there was no contest. The
totals were reached by reporters checking codes for the early
unofficial returns. Reporters were not allowed to see codes for the
later returns.
   The Robeson County legislative delegation and Pierce's campaign
committee have agreed to ask the Legislature to create another
Superior Court judgeship for the county, and Gov. Jim Martin said
he would appoint a minority, probably an Indian.
   The county's population of about 100,000 is 37 percent Indian,
37 percent white and 26 percent black.
   On Feb. 1 this year two Lumbee Indians took over the offices of
The Robesonian newspaper to protest alleged discrimination against
minorities in the area. The siege ended when Martin agreed to
appoint a task force to study the matter.

   Iran said Wednesday its security men
arrested a Saudi Arabian spy in Tehran. It also claimed the Saudis
beat up Iranian diplomats and seized documents after the rupture in
relations between the two countries.
   The Iranian allegations underscored the growing tension between
the two Persian Gulf neighbors. Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic
relations with Tehran on April 26.
   In a brief statement, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
said security authorities ``arrested an agent of the Riyadh regime
who had entered the country illegally with 300 million rials (4.5
million dollars).''
   ``He will be dealt with as a spy,'' the statement said.
Convicted spies may be sentenced to death under Iran's Islamic law.
   IRNA also quoted an unnamed Information Ministry official as
saying the man was planning to ``spread Wahhabi faith and the
American brand of Islam.''
   The Wahhabis are an ultra-conservative Sunni Moslem sect. Most
Saudis, including Saudi Arabia's ruling family, are Wahhabis. The
majority of Iranians are Shiite Moslems.
   ``The measures that were taken were no more than the normal
procedure in line with diplomatic norms under such circumstances,''
the official was quoted as saying.
   Saudi Arabia made no immediate comment on the arrest of the
alleged spy.
   Diplomats from Tehran's embassy in the Saudi Arabian capital of
Riyadh and a consulate in the Red Sea port city of Jiddah, who were
given one week to leave the country, returned home Wednesday.
   Saudi Arabia called ``totally baselesss'' Iranian claims that
the diplomats were beaten up and that documents were confiscated
from the two missions.
   Saudi-Iranian ties have deteriorated rapidly in recent months
after repeated Iranian charges that the Saudis are helping Iraq in
its war against Iran.
   Last year, Iranians ransacked the Saudi Arabian embassy in
Tehran and killed a Saudi diplomat, saying the action was in
retaliation for the killings of 275 Iranian pilgrims in clashes
last July with Saudi security police in Islam's holy city of Mecca.
   Iran has called for the overthrow of the Saudi regime and said
it must be stripped of control of Islam's holy shrines in Mecca and
Medina.
   The Saudis said they will allow only 45,000 Iranian pilgrims to
enter Saudi Arabia during this year's pilgrimage. The Iranians have
insisted they will send the same number of pilgrims as last year _
150,000.

<HEAD>Coretta Scott King Aims To Cut Short Showdown With BU Over King
Papers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coretta Scott King has asked a judge to skip a
trial and immediately decide whether she or Boston University own
papers of her slain husband, civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr.
   At issue are 83,000 documents now at King's alma mater that
range from letters to Eleanor Roosevelt to the outline of his ``I
Have a Dream'' speech.
   A sworn statement and documents turned over by the university
support allegations that King never donated his papers to BU, Mrs.
King claimed in a request for a summary judgment filed last week in
Suffolk Superior Court.
   ``It's kind of a shortcut in the case,'' said Archer Smith, Mrs.
King's Atlanta attorney, in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``The
letter is so clear. We're asking the judge to cut through the
jargon and everything else.''
   No hearing on the request for summary judgment was immediately
set. The case has not yet been assigned to a judge.
   Last December, Mrs. King sued Boston University to recover the
papers her husband gave to the school where he earned a doctorate
in theology in 1955. The suit claims the university has not
properly maintained the papers and is illegally keeping them. King
sent the papers to the school in 1964, four years before his
assassination.
   Mrs. King wants the papers kept with 100,000 more in his
archives at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social
Change in Atlanta.
   In the request for a summary judgment, Mrs. King's lawyers said
that Howard T. Gotlieb, chief of reference and special collections
for Boston University libraries, had indicated in a deposition that
as far as he knew, King never designated any of the papers at the
university as an outright gift.
   The university also gave Mrs. King's lawyers a 1964 letter by
G.A. Harrer, then director of libraries for the university, saying
the university was interested in becoming the repository for King's
papers.
   Melvin B. Miller, a BU trustee whose law firm is representing
the university in its countersuit against Mrs. King, scoffed at the
latest volley from the other side.
   ``It's strange that they think there are no questions of fact in
this case,'' he said. ``Everything is to be settled. Nothing is
settled.''
   Key to the entire battle is a July 16, 1964, letter by King
naming Boston University repository of his papers. King was killed
in 1968 and did not leave a will.
   In the letter, King said the papers would remain his legal
property but that every year he would donate part of the collection
to the university.
   Mrs. King's lawyers maintain that while King sent papers to
Boston University, he did not take the step of making them a gift.
   The university in its countersuit claims it owns the King papers
in Atlanta as well as those it has because the 1964 letter made
Boston University the depository for all King's papers.
   Mrs. King's lawyers insist the letter did not constitute a
contract or charitable pledge and violates laws governing wills.
They have asked that the countersuit be dismissed.

   President Reagan said Wednesday the selection of
a nuclear-waste dump site is sure to spark objections from people
who live nearby but ``you've got to put it someplace.''
   Reagan made the comment in a question-and-answer session after a
speech to the National Strategy Forum, a nonpartisan group that
specializes in foreign policy and national security issues.
   Asked how the United States would dispose of nuclear waste,
Reagan said a number of states had been selected as possible
candidates for depositories.
   ``And then a commission is investigating everyone and then we'll
name what they believe are the correct places and the best places
for the safety of the people and the disposition of that nuclear
waste,'' Reagan said.
   ``I realize that somebody's going to think it's too close to
them when it happens,'' he added, ``but you've got to put it
someplace.'' The audience laughed and applauded.
   Yucca Mountain, Nev., has been selected by Congress as well as
the Energy Department over sites in Texas and Washington state as
the best place to study building a high-level nuclear waste dump.

<DATELINE>MOUNDS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To local folks they're known as ``granny
kids,'' children who leave their homes and big-city schools in the
Chicago area for quiet Southern Illinois towns and their smaller,
friendlier schools.
   They're scattered throughout the area, living with their
``grannies'' and other relatives during the school year and heading
for the urban north in the summer.
   It's hard to determine exactly how many there are because they
list home addresses in the area when they enroll, school officials
say.
   But they're there, and have been for years.
   ``We just have to check to make sure their guardianship is in
the hands of someone in our district,'' said Mike Corzine,
assistant superintendent in the Egyptian School District near Tamms.
   ``There's not a major number of them, though,'' Corzine said in
a recent interview.
   Gang violence, drugs and overcrowding are among the reasons
given for leaving city schools, said Don Shaner, guidance counselor
at Meridian High School in Mounds.
   But such problems are ``societal,'' not school-bred, Chicago
Board of Education spokesman Bob Saigh said Wednesday.
   ``Chicago, like any other big city, it's got its share of
problems,'' he said. But he added that the city's schools are ``100
percent safe. I defy anybody to say they're unsafe.''
   Many of the imported students at local schools are carrying on a
family tradition.
   Jerry Richmond, 15, is attending Meridian like his older sister,
who graduated from there before going on to Northwestern University
at Evanston.
   ``It's a lot friendlier here,'' Richmond said. ``Up there, the
teachers don't even know your name.''
   Richmond began his freshman year last fall at Evanston Township
High School in suburban Chicago, which has 4,000 students, some
gang problems and ``a lot of drug traffic,'' he said.
   At midterm, he transferred to the 320-student Meridian. His
parents sent him south _ more than 350 miles south _ to live with
his grandparents so that he could attend a smaller, quieter high
school.
   ``We do have gangs in the city of Evanston. There is no visible
of gang problems at the school,'' said William Logan, director of
the safety department at Evanston Township High. ``There's no doubt
some kids are using drugs and selling them, but it's not rampant.''
   ``I think it's a safe school for studets to come here and study,
if that's what they want to do,'' Logan said.
   But Richmond's story was not new to school administrators in
Southern Illinois.
   There has been a Chicago-to-Southern Illinois school connection
for at least 20 years, said Terry Rueffer, director of special
programs in the Century School District at Ullin.
   ``A lot of them even start when they are little,'' Shaner said.
   Most granny kids adapt readily to the new environment _ but it
does take some adjustment.
   Richmond's school-year home of Pulaski has a population of 500 _
about one-eighth the student body at his hometown school.
   ``There's not much to do,'' he said of the village just north of
Cairo at the southern tip of the state.
   ``My mom thought this would be a better place for me,'' Richmond
said.
   And with fewer distractions, he said he can concentrate on
another goal.
   ``I just want to get into a good college.''

   Leftist guerrillas who kidnapped 14
Colombian, West German, French and Swiss officials and journalists
said they will release the hostages soon with a message, the sister
of one captive reported Wednesday.
   Attorney General Eduardo Serra called the abductions ``a
propaganda operation'' by two guerrilla organizations: the National
Liberation Army, a pro-Castro group; and the Maoist Popular
Liberation Army.
   A National Liberation Army spokesman Tuesday night phoned the
sister of kidnap victim Dario Parra, president of the legislature
of the department of Santander.
   Matilde Parra said the spokesman told her that her brother and
the others were being held at a camp in the country's northeastern
mountains, where the guerrillas are active.
   The guerrillas will release their hostages in the next few days
with a ``document of an international importance,'' she quoted the
spokesman as saying.
   In Bonn, a spokesman for the West German Foreign Ministry
confirmed Wednesday that honorary consuls Sigfried Markert and
Helmut Luecker were kidnapped Tuesday.
   Local police said four armed guerrillas kidnapped Markert, 59,
from his metals company in Bucaramanga, 200 miles from Bogota, as
employees watched.
   Luecker, West Germany's honorary consul in Medellin, also
disappeared Tuesday. Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, is
250 miles from the capital.
   Callers identifying themselves as National Liberation Army
members told Bogota radio stations they had seized Jean Christophe
Rampal, a public information officer at the French Embassy.
   In Paris, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said
French officials had not heard from Rampal since Friday but could
not confirm he had been kidnapped.
   Two Swiss officials, Wilfred Lehner and Richard Aufereggen, were
captured Tuesday by commandos who attacked the office of the
Colombia-Swiss Chamber of Commerce in Bogota and overpowered 10
workers, police said.
   The Colombians are Parra, journalists Augusto Jerez, Guillermo
Vallejo, Luz Marina Giraldo, Raul Numas, Omar Paez, and an
unidentified cameraman working for a Bogota television station. The
others are two regional politicians, Otoniel Gomez and Luiz Lopez.
   Police said the guerrillas also tried to kidnap Luisa Victoria
de Porras, the honorary consul of Panama in Cartagena, and Annette
Exiga, the honorary consul of France in Cali.
   One police officer was killed and another one was wounded in a
shootout when the guerrillas tried to abduct Mrs. Exiga, police
said. Two would-be kidnappers of Mrs. de Porras were arrested.
   Guerrillas bombed Colombia's main pipeline in four different
places on Tuesday, forcing operations to stop.
   The pipeline, which carrries 215,000 barrels a day from Cano
Limon, near the Venezuelan border, to the Caribbean, is partly
owned by Occidental Petroleum of the United States.
   Serra said the National Liberation Army is waging a ``terrorist
campaign'' to force Occidental Petroleum out of Colombia.

<HEAD>Simon Steadfastly Holds Delegates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAHOMET, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Paul Simon says he is virtually
certain that one-time presidential rival Michael Dukakis will be
the nominee but he refuses to release his delegates ``in the
unlikely event that Michael Dukakis stubs his toe between now and
the convention.''
   The Illinois senator, who put his presidential campaign on hold
a month ago, said he would not surrender about 180 delegates
committed to his campaign despite pressure to do so by supporters
of Jesse Jackson.
   Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer and some black lawmakers have urged
Simon to officially drop out of the presidential race. They contend
his continued presence hurts any chance Jackson has of keeping the
nomination away from Dukakis.
   ``I'm going to hold out until the California and New Jersey
primaries on June 7 and see whether I can still have an influence
on the nomination,'' Simon said Wednesday.
   He said he was ``95 percent certain'' that Dukakis would win the
nomination.
   Simon also ruled out a later bid for the White House and said he
was focusing on a probable Senate re-election bid.
   ``I'm definitely getting back to my job as a senator,'' said
Simon, first elected to the Senate in 1984. ``I took a year of my
life to try and make a difference in this country, and I think I
accomplished that.''

   ``Injured'' astronauts and launch
pad workers scrambled into escape baskets Wednesday as they fled a
mock fire and explosion during a space shuttle disaster drill.
   For safety reasons, they did not ride the baskets down long
cables, traveling instead by elevator to the ground, then
re-entering the baskets to continue the exercise. NASA said it will
``man-rate'' the baskets before the next shuttle flight.
   All seven participating astronauts and several other personnel
received make-believe injuries in the four-hour pad test. Two of
the astronauts were among nine ``seriously injured'' people
transported by helicopter to two hospitals that conducted their own
emergency rehearsals.
   The drill tested new safety procedures initiated since the
in-flight explosion of Challenger and the loss of its seven crew
members Jan. 28, 1986. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since
then, and NASA's top official, administrator James C. Fletcher,
said Tuesday that flights are not expected to resume before late
August or September.
   Kathy Thornton, one of the astronauts taking part, told a news
conference later: ``We felt it was really a good test. We have to
be prepared for a launch pad emergency, and we very happy with the
way the system worked today.''
   Among new launch pad features tested Wednesday were improved
fire detection equipment, more fire-resistant material, a new
steel-reinforced concrete underground bunker and a backup
electrical relay line that flashes a warning to launch directors if
a pad emergency occurs.
   Such an ``emergency'' took place shortly after the seven
astronauts, all trainees, rode elevators to the 195-foot level of
launch pad 39B as if they were to board a shuttle on launch day.
   Although there was no shuttle on the pad, they simulated entry
into a spacecraft cabin. About that time, a smoke bomb was
detonated on the pad, and test director Frank Merlino ordered an
evacuation.
   With water spraying the area as it would in a real emergency,
the astronauts and the seven members of the spacecraft closeout
crew donned oxygen masks and made their way to seven slidewire
baskets at the cabin level of the pad.
   Fire-rescue workers rushed to the pad from a station a mile
away. As they fought a mock fire at the 175-foot level, a
``hydraulic explosion'' occurred and test observers declared five
firefighters ``injured.''
   No one rode the escape baskets down 1,200-foot cables to the
ground. Some officials believe the swift 50 mph trip and abrupt
halt in netting at the bottom would be risky and should be
attempted only in an actual emergency.
   NASA has said it plans soon to test the baskets with human
passengers.
   They most seriously ``injured'' were transported in fireproof
tank-like vehicles to a heliport for air delivery to Florida
Hospital near Orlando or to Jess Parrish Memorial Hospital in
Titusville.
   Astronauts participating Wednesday were Frank Culbertson, Ken
Cameron, Carl Meade, David Low, Thornton, Pierre Thuot and Jerome
Apt.
   Another emergency drill is scheduled Friday to simulate a rescue
of crew members from a shuttle that has ``crash-landed'' in a swamp
near the shuttle landing runway.

   A new poll indicates two-thirds of Americans
support making the District of Columbia the nation's 51st state,
leaders of the statehood movement said Wednesday.
   A telephone survey of 1,011 households nationwide conducted in
March by the Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton, N.J.,
indicates that 66 percent of those contacted support making the
nation's capital a state, an increase of 14 percentage points
increase over a similar poll conducted a year ago.
   ``We can proclaim today that the American people overwhelmingly
support statehood for the nation's capital,'' said Del. Walter
Fauntroy, D-D.C., who has introduced in the House of
Representatives a bill to establish the state of New Columbia.
``America now knows, and cares, that we achieve full citizenship.''
   Results from the poll, which carried a margin of error of 3
percentage points, also indicate that 83 percent of those surveyed
believe residents of the district ``should have the same rights as
citizens of the other 50 states.''
   Fauntroy's bill, which was passed by the House District of
Columbia Committee last year, would create a state out of all
non-federal lands in the district, give voting rights to a member
of the House and two senators, and establish a state government.
   Currently, Fauntroy is the only congressional representative for
the 625,000 residents of the nation's capital, and he cannot vote
on the House floor.
   The measure has 197 co-sponsors, and Fauntroy said he was
confident he will secure the 218 votes needed to assure House
approval. He said he hoped to bring the matter up for a vote
``before the Fourth of July.''
   One former opponent, Rep. Roman Mazzoli, D-Ky., said Wednesday
that he has decided to support the bill after Fauntroy agreed to
study the possibility of eliminating the city's federal subsidy.
   The district receives about $500 million of its $2.8 billion
annual operating budget in direct federal subsidies, and Mazzoli
and others have opposed creating a state that would receive federal
money in such a way.
   Fauntroy, who noted that 55 percent of all land in the nation's
capital is federally owned, and thus off the tax rolls, predicted
that congressmen will understand the district's unique position.

   The folks who gave us Mickey, Dumbo and Bambi
have signed on Woody, Franny and Marty.
   That's Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese.
The three directors are making a film for Disney's Touchstone
Pictures on life in modern-day Manhattan.
   Production work has started on the trilogy, and since the
project was spearheaded by Allen, it carries its usual Allenesque
cloak of secrecy.
   All a Disney spokesman would say was that Allen will write,
direct and star in his segment but that no other casting has been
confirmed. Coppola is writing his segment with his daughter, Sofia.
Richard Price (``The Color of Money'') is writing Scorsese's part.
   All three filmmakers have used New York as their celluloid
playgrounds. Coppola shot ``The Godfather'' and ``The Cotton Club''
here. Scorsese did ``Raging Bull,'' ``Mean Streets,'' ``Taxi
Driver'' and ``King of Comedy'' on the sidewalks of New York.
   And just about all of Allen's work is Manhattan-bound.
   Disney would not discuss the project's budget, and said the
movie, tentatively titled ``New York Stories,'' will be released in
early next year.

<HEAD>Illegal Belize Immigrant Says Legal Residency Will Let Her Sleep
At Night</HEAD>

   Wendy Davis hasn't slept well since leaving
Belize six years ago to come to the United States illegally, but
she expects that to change once she receives her papers under the
federal amnesty program.
   ``I had insomnia. I worried at night that someone could come and
take me away. When my papers come, I'm going to sleep at night,''
said Mrs. Davis, one of thousands of illegal aliens who jammed
Immigration and Naturalization Service offices in south Florida on
Wednesday, the last day to apply for residency under the law.
   The law permitted people who came to the United States illegally
before Jan. 1, 1982, and lived in this country continuously to
apply for temporary resident status. They later must apply for
permanent status and can eventually apply for citizenship.
   Immigration officials expected up to 125,000 aliens to apply in
Florida. By Wednesday morning, 112,000 had done so, and
applications were pouring in as the midnight deadline neared, said
Richard Smith, deputy director of the Miami INS office.
   Like Mrs. Davis, many said they waited until the last minute
simply because they procrastinated. Lines were long at the INS
office here, but most of the waiting people were smiling.
   ``They say this place is bad, but it's the best there is,'' Mrs.
Davis said, referring to U.S. citizens who complain about their
government.
   But as an illegal alien, ``I didn't have a life of my own,
control of my destiny,'' said Mrs. Davis, 19, who married Judd
Davis, a Chicago native, last July 4. The newlyweds moved recently
to Miami Beach, which reminds her of Belize City, which she
couldn't risk visiting as an illegal alien for fear of not being
allowed back into the United States.
   A sister and two brothers in Belize ``keep writing, asking me
when I'm going to visit. I wanted to go but I couldn't. I'd say I
was going soon as I get my papers,'' she said, beaming at the
prospect of receiving a work permit next week and residency status
this summer.
   Mrs. Davis' mother, a nurse, moved illegally to the United
States when her daughter was 3. Almost 10 years later, she sent for
her children, and friends smuggled three of them into the United
States via Mexico.
   ``I went right through the border. They just asked if we had
fruits,'' she said. She lived in Chicago with her mother, who
applied for amnesty Tuesday, and attended the Kenwood Academy there.
   Her husband, who works at a Miami Beach apartment complex, said
his wife's easy entry compounded her immigration woes. ``They say
she couldn't have gotten through the border. It'd be easier if we
said she swam across the Rio Grande.''
   The couple said they were advised it would be faster for her to
receive a work permit by seeking amnesty rather than applying as a
citizen's spouse. When the papers come through, the Davises plan to
save up, buy a home on Miami Beach, and visit Belize often.

   Cincinnati voters approved a tax increase to
repair streets and bridges, but by such a thin margin that
officials say they feel challenged to prove they will use the money
effectively.
   ``I think people are still saying that they are skeptics, and we
have to make them believe we will do the work we said we would,''
said Vice Mayor Peter Strauss.
   The measure received 27,201 votes in favor, or 50.3 percent, to
26,920, or 49.7 percent.
   It will increase Cincinnati's earnings tax from 2 percent to 2.1
percent, effective July 1, the first increase in the payroll tax in
16 years.
   The tax is paid by everyone who works in the city, everyone who
lives in the city and works elsewhere and also by businesses on
their net profits. Cincinnati's business community supported the
increase, while a homeowners' group led by suburbanites fought it.
   The increase is expected to generate $6.9 million in additional
annual revenue to repair everything from deteriorating public
buildings to potholes.
   ``I think it indicates that people are very reluctant to raise
taxes,'' City Manager Scott Johnson said of the close vote. ``I
don't think it's people saying, `I looked up the street and I like
what I see.'''

   Michael Dukakis underscored his standing as Democratic
presidential nominee-in-waiting on Wednesday after his latest
landslide primary victories, even though Jesse Jackson said he
would stay in the race because ``It's not really over till it's
over.''
   Republican George Bush made light of astrology but noted a lot
of voters believe in it.
   ``There are two edges to this sword,'' the vice president said
as Air Force Two carried him to California on a campaign swing.
   At a news conference in Boston, Dukakis said he welcomed
Jackson's continued candidacy, so long as his rival would ``keep it
positive and address issues.''
   The governor's aides expressed irritation in recent days with
Jackson's barbed comments during the Ohio and Indiana campaigns,
although Dukakis himself replied only indirectly.
   Dukakis, savoring Tuesday's lopsided primary victories in
Indiana and Ohio, picked up a handful of fresh Democratic National
Convention delegates and arranged to receive the backing of half a
dozen or more Democratic governors later in the week _ perhaps
including Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and Louisiana's Buddy
Roemer, both of whom earlier supported Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
Campaign aides said Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton was rounding up the
support for Dukakis.
   Pointing his attention toward the fall campaign, Dukakis also
signed up veteran Democratic warriors Kirk O'Donnell and Dick Moe
as advisers to his campaign.
   Jackson won support for his decision to stay in the race from
Bruce Babbitt, who dropped out last winter. ``I think he should
because he has something to offer and I think it makes it a little
more interesting,'' the former Arizona governor said.
   Jackson spent the day in Washington, where he met with
Democratic House members and others after winning a landslide
victory in the primary election in the nation's capital.
   In an interview with CBS, he said he would remain a candidate
after the primary season ends on June 7, and added, ``...I know
what the boundaries are and I will respect those boundaries.''
   But he also appealed to party leaders to avoid flocking to
Dukakis' side until after the primary season ends.
   ``If super delegates wait until after June 8 they are in a
better position as judges to help bring balance'' rather than using
party machinery to parcel out delegates before the primaries end,''
he said in a reference to 645 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention who are party leaders and not elected by voters in
primaries and caucuses.
   Campaign dropout Paul Simon said he was ``95 percent certain''
that Dukakis would win the Democratic nomination, but he said he
would hold onto his 184 delegates to wield influence ``in the
unlikely event that Michael Dukakis stubs his toe between now and
the convention.''
   ``I'm going to hold out until the California and New Jersey
primaries on June 7 and see whether I can still have an influence
on the nomination,'' said Simon.
   Dukakis has roughly 1,500 delegatges in The Associated Press
count, out of 2,081 needed to win the nomination. He leads Jackson
by more than 600.
   Bush amassed the delegates needed to assure his Republican
nomination a week ago in Pennsylvania's primary, but he kept up a
heavy schedule of campaigning with his trip to the West Coast.
   He told California reporters he has not yet begun selecting his
vice presidential running mate. He praised California's GOP
governor, George Deukmejian, lavishly, and said he would
``absolutely not'' rule him out for his ticket.
   In a conversation with reporters en route, he was asked about
the reported statement in former White House Chief of Staff Donald
Regan's soon-to-be published book that first lady Nancy Reagan
consulted astrologers about the timing of presidential events. The
president says he has never based any policy or decision on
astrological forecasts, but does not deny consulting the writings
of astrologers.
   Bush referred in a joking manner to the disclosure, telling
reporters he hadn't checked his horoscope before leaving Washington
but then added that he and his wife were ``both Geminis.''
   Asked about the assertion that the Reagans relied on the
position of the sun and moon and stars to make decisions, Bush
said, ``I don't know about that. But I'll tell you one thing: there
are two edges to this sword.
   ``There are a helluva lot of people across this country that
read these columns. Otherwise they wouldn't be in the papers.''
   Bush brushed aside a claim by astrologer Joyce Jillson that she
helped Reagan's aides select his running mate in 1980. He said he
never heard of her, but then joked:
   ``I'll work closely with her. She's brilliant.''

   Hundreds of children and adults sporting
cowboy boots and hats turned out Wednesday to watch as Winterset's
busiest street was named for John Wayne, the community's most
famous native son.
   Much of the attention focused on Wayne's widow, Pilar, who with
her daughter helped dedicate John Wayne Drive.
   ``I'm thrilled, flabbergasted. I think it's one of the most
wonderful things to have this done,'' said the widow of one of
Hollywood's most famous tough guys.
   ``He was the most admirable human being I ever met,'' she said.
``Truly, he had Iowa stock in him _ and that's a great stock to
come from.''
   Wayne's daughter, Marisa, 22, who attends Mountain College in
Steamboat Springs, Colo., was impressed with the turnout.
   ``This is great, it's bigger than I expected,'' she said. ``It's
very flattering. I think he would've loved this.''
   Wayne was born Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907, and he
spent the first three years of his life in Winterset before his
family moved to Earlham.
   State and Winterset officials have touted Wayne's house as a
national attraction for the past several years.
   ``Tourism in Winterset has doubled because of the interest in
the John Wayne birthplace,'' said Gov. Terry Branstad, who presided
over Wednesday's ceremonies.
   A band from the local high school welcomed Wayne's widow and
daughter as they were driven into town. Hundreds of children
excused from school joined residents and business people along the
curb and holding signs saying, ``We Love You Pilar.''
   After the ceremony, Mrs. Wayne and her daughter toured the
restored one-story, four-room white house on a corner a block from
the newly named street.
   Dozens of people thrust paper and pens at the Duke's wife and
daughter for autographs. Some brought Mrs. Wayne's new book, ``John
Wayne, My Life with the Duke,'' for her to sign, while others
wanted her to sign pictures and sketches of her late husband.
   ``I'm a great fan of his. He was my favorite star, he always has
been, '' said George Henry Blades, 68, of Winterset, who carried a
four-foot high picture showing himself standing in front of a huge
statue of the Duke, taken at the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma.
   Laura Skeffington of Stewart also said Wayne was her favorite.
   ``Oh my God, yes. If you could see my home, I've got a six-foot
tapestry,'' she said. Added her daughter-in-law, ``Her bedroom is
done in John Wayne.''

   The worst incident was reported in the Gaza Strip's Jabalia
refugee camp, where Israeli soldiers opened fire on a crowd of
protesters, killing two and wounding six, Arab reports and Gaza
City's Ahli Arab hospital officials said.
   Hospital officials identified the dead as Jamal Mahmoud El
Madhoun, 20, and Rizik Hussein Abbah, 17.
   The army confirmed the clash. A spokesman said that ``there were
killed and wounded'' but did not give the exact figure.
   The army clamped a curfew on Jabalia, an Arab reporter in Gaza
said. He said troops also declared curfew in the Shati refugee camp
and had to drive residents into their homes with tear gas and
rubber bullets.
   Seven Arabs were wounded as army troops opened fire to disperse
stone-throwing rioters at a village near Ramallah in the occcupied
West Bank and in the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, hospital
officials said.
   A 21-year-old Arab woman was hit with rubber bullets after she
tried to stab an Israeli soldier in the marketplace in the West
Bank city of Nablus, the army said. The soldier was not hurt.
   The army said troops also opened fire on stone-throwing Arab
protesters in the West Bank village of Silwad. Two Palestinians
were wounded in the legs, Ramallah Hospital officials said.
   According to U.N. figures, the fatalities brought to 182 the
number of Arabs killed in the occupied territories since the start
of the Arab uprising last Dec. 8. Two Israelis have been killed.
   Palestinians shuttered their stores and shut down public transit
throughout the occupied territories in response to a leaflet signed
by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The leaflet called for a ``day of confrontation'' and ordered
Palestinians to ``cultivate the land and rebuild the houses
demolished by the racist Israeli occupation.''
   In Nablus, even bakeries and street vendors that normally
operate during strikes were reported closed.
   Wednesday's general strike was the latest of dozens of such
protests called by uprising leaders, but some Arabs have started to
complain about the work stoppages.
   ``When you ask people to do the same thing over and over, it
gets to be too much. Merchants are regular people. They have to eat
and feed their children too,'' businessman Farouak Abu Sharekh said
in Gaza City.
   But Zahran Zhran, a businessman from Nablus, said the strikes
were needed to train Palestinians to keep up long-term protests.
``You have to make them ready for the civil disobedience or they
will be shocked and not listen to you,'' he said in an interview.
   Hundreds of Palestinians chanting anti-Israeli slogans marched
in the West Bank village of Bani Naim, 30 miles south of Jerusalem,
to protest the deaths of two villagers killed Tuesday by Israeli
troops.
   Carrying 15 outlawed Palestinian flags and signs reading ``We
prefer to die than to submit,'' about 2,000 villagers marched
through narrow dirt streets to the village cemetery.
   About 30 masked men set up barricades and set tires ablaze as
Israeli soldiers watched from rooftops.
   In London, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin called for an
Arab-Israeli peace settlement entailing a jointly run
Jordanian-Palestinian state in 60 percent of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   In an interview published in Jane's Defense Weekly, he said his
Labor Party, which shares power with the right-wing Likud Bloc,
insisted that ``Jerusalem must be united under Israeli sovereignty
and remain its capital.''
   Israeli residents of towns bordering the Gaza Strip submitted a
petition to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres expressing support for a
U.S. peace initiative and urging that Gaza be exchanged for peace
with Israel's Arab neighbors.
   The group said they were willing to remain on the border with an
independent Palestinian state in Gaza, Israel radio said.
   Peres, leader of the Labor Party, supports a U.S. peace plan
that calls for an international conference and exchanging territory
for peace. The initiative is opposed by Peres' governing partner,
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the Likud bloc.
   Israeli media said police would recommend that an Arab woman be
charged in the slaying of an Israeli teen-ager shot to death by a
Jewish guard in a clash between Arabs and Jewish settlers last
month.
   The slaying in the West Bank village of Beita caused an uproar
in Israel.
   The woman, who was not identified, allegedly hurled a rock that
hit a Jewish settler guard, Romam Aldubi, in the head, prompting
him to fire wildly and kill 15-year-old Tirza Porat, Israel radio
and two newspapers reported.
   Jewish settlers blamed Arabs for the death, but an army
investigation said she was accidentally killed by Aldubi.

<HEAD>TV Newsman Runs into Trouble with Story about Felons Buying Guns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents are investigating the actions of a
television newsman who had a convicted robber buy three handguns to
show how easy it is to conceal a criminal record and buy guns.
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms will give
results of its investigation to the U.S. attorney's office, which
will decide whether charges should be filed, said agent Gary Wurm.
   Newsman Tom Martino of KCNC-TV in Denver and a cameraman
accompanied a man identified as Ollace M. Williams, 36, to at least
three gun stores as part of Martino's report.
   Williams filled out federal firearms purchase forms and bought
three revolvers, omitting disclosure of a 1972 robbery conviction.
   Williams bought a .357-caliber Magnum from Checkpoint Firearms
on April 26, another .357-caliber handgun from Scottie's Guns &
Militaria on April 28, and a .38-caliber revolver from the Gun Room.
   All three dealers said Williams stated on the forms that he was
not a convicted felon.
   Federal law bars convicted felons from buying guns, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Mackey. It also is a federal
violation to advise someone else to break a federal law.
   On Monday, Martino went back to the Gun Room, returned the
weapon, got a refund and told owner Bill Molnar the purpose of the
purchase. Molnar said Martino then asked him to destroy the federal
firearms purchase form.
   Instead, Molnar called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms because, he said, destroying the purchase form is a
federal offense.
   ``They set me up, and I don't like that,'' he said.
   Channel 4 ``didn't rush headlong'' into the story, said news
director Marv Rockford. ``We set out to show how easy it is for an
ex-offender _ a convicted felon _ to purchase a firearm.''
   He said the station had checked with lawyers and Police Chief
Ari Zavaras. Rockford said Denver police endorsed the idea, but
Detective John Wyckoff, a spokesman for Zavaras, said the
department ``declined to participate.''

<TEXT>
   The United States said Wednesday that the
captivity of 18 foreigners in Lebanon could be prolonged if France
made concessions for the release of its three remaining hostages.
   In a brief statement, the State Department said it still was
awaiting details about the terms under which the three Frenchmen
were released earlier Wednesday in Beirut.
   ``We would be concerned by any sign that concessions were
made,'' the State Department said. ``We believe concessions
encourage future kidnappings and could prolong the captivity of
other hostages.''
   There were news reports last November that France paid a ransom
for the release of a French television worker by his kidnappers in
Lebanon.
   The release of the three Frenchmen leaves 18 foreigners,
including nine Americans, missing and believed held captive in
Lebanon. The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Mainer Declines to Give His Salmon to Reagan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARS HILL, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tradition calls for the first Atlantic
salmon hooked in Maine's Penobscot River to be presented to the
president, but Ronald Reagan will have to settle for No. 2 this
year.
   Neil Donnelly refused to give up his catch.
   Donnelly, of Mars Hill, signed papers saying he did not wish to
turn over his salmon to President Reagan, state Inland Fisheries
and Wildlife officials said.
   ``I understand he ate it the very same day'' the salmon was
caught, Sunday, said fisheries spokesman Paul Fournier. ``Now it's
gone.''
   Donnelly could not be immediately reached Wednesday. He does not
have a telephone, and messages seeking comment had not been
returned.
   Instead, an 8-pound, 27-inch Atlantic salmon caught by Charles
A. Caron, 53, of Brewer will go to the White House on Thursday.
Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. is planning to be there, along with
members of Maine's congressional delegation.
   The tradition started in 1912, when a salmon caught at the
Bangor Pool, a fishing area on the Penobscot, was presented to
President William Howard Taft.
   The tradition continued through seven more presidencies, but
pollution and dams put an end to Atlantic salmon runs and forced
the tradition to be suspended during Harry S. Truman's
administration.
   After years of cleanup efforts, the Atlantic sea-run salmon
returned to the Penobscot and the tradition was revived by the
Reagan White House in 1982.
   Not all salmon fishermen vie for the privilege of giving up
their fish. In the Eddington Salmon Club along the Penobscot, a
member posted a sign that says he already paid several thousand
dollars in taxes ``and doesn't want to pay any more,'' said J.
William Peppard, a member.

<HEAD>Bush Jokes About Astrology Influence at White House</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Bush on Deukmejian as V.P., inserting 4 grafs
after 2nd graf pvs, The vice</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush, a Gemini, made light of
reports of astrological influence at the White House on Thursday
but suggested the issue was a ``two-edged sword'' because a large
number of Americans believe in the practice.
   The vice president also hinted jokingly that an astrologer
claiming to have helped pick him as Ronald Reagan's running mate in
1980 might be a useful member of his Cabinet.
   On another subject, Bush told reporters in California he would
``absolutely not'' rule out the state's governor, George
Deukmejian, as a possible running mate.
   Bush, sharing the platform with the Republican governor at a
news conference, reiterated an earlier assertion that he would not
even begin to consider the selection process until after the
Democratic convention in July.
   Still, Bush said of Deukmejian, ``The respect I have for this
governor has no limitation.''
   On the subject of astrology, Bush said: ``I know it is a
fascinating, titillating subject for all, with particular emphasis
on the journalistic community.''
   A spokesman, Steve Hart, said the vice president, who has a lock
on the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, ``does not consult
astrologers or horoscopes or anything of the kind. He doesn't even
know where the horoscope is in the newspaper.''
   Speaking to reporters on Air Force II, Bush said he had not
checked his horoscope before beginning his three-day campaign swing
through the West.
   ``However, if you're interested, we're both Geminis,'' Bush
said, referring to himself and his wife, Barbara, both born in June.
   Bush's jocular retort matched the lighthearted manner in which
other administration officials have responded to disclosures
earlier this week of first lady Nancy Reagan's interest in
astrology.
   The disclosures are contained in an upcoming book by former
White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan.
   Bush, who in the past has voiced disdain for ``kiss-and-tell''
books by former administration officials, said it was hard to
respond to Regan's specific allegations since the book hasn't been
published yet.
   ``I don't think anyone knows what the charge, the allegation
is,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed
that Mrs. Reagan had consulted an astrologer on the president's
plans for travel and scheduling. However, President Reagan denied
that any of his decisions as president had been influenced by
astrology.
   Asked about the disclosures on astrology and presidential
scheduling, Bush said: ``I don't know about that. But I'll tell you
one thing: there are two edges to this sword.''
   ``There are a helluva lot of people across this country that
read these columns. Otherwise, they wouldn't be in the papers.''
   Asked about Joyce Jillson, a Los Angeles astrologer who contends
she advised Reagan campaign aides to select Bush as a running mate
in 1980, Bush said he had never heard of her.
   But, he joked: ``I'll likely work closely with her. She's
brilliant.''
   Then, pretending he didn't quite get the name, Bush deadpanned,
``Joyce Jillson? Secretary of what?''
   Bush spoke en route from Washington to Sacramento. He planned to
spend the next three days campaigning in the West, with events
scheduled for California, Idaho and Montana as well as Nebraska.
   Peter Teeley, campaign press secretary, said Bush planned two
additional trips to the West coast between now and the June 7
California primary.
   ``We can't ignore the West,'' Teeley said, even though Bush
clinched the GOP nomination a week ago by piling up more than the
1,139 delegates needed at the party convention this August in New
Orleans.
   ``We've got organizations in place and people on the ground that
have been working for us. You've got to keep those troops
energized,'' Teeley said in Washington in advance of Bush's
departure.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: tiene el SIDA.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   La diferencia entre donar y recibir sangre
   1. Donar sangre. Usted no esta ahora, ni ha estado nunca en
peligo de adquirir el SIDA por donar sangre a un banco de sangre.
Las agujas que se usan para las donaciones de sangre son nuevas.
Una vez que se usan, son destruidas. No hay forma en que usted
pueda entrar en contacto con el virus del SIDA por donar sangre.
   2. Recibir sangre. El riesgo de adquirir el virus del SIDA por
una transfusion de sangre ha sido reducido enormemente. Con el
proposito de que el suministro de sangre sea lo mas seguro posible,
se investiga a los donadores para detectar probables factores de
riesgo; a la sangre donada se le hace la prueba de anticuerpos del
SIDA. Si tiene alguna pregunta, llame a su banco de sangre.
   ?Que clase de comportamiento lo pone a usted en riesgo?
   Usted tiene el riesgo de resultar infectado con el virus del
SIDA si usted tiene relaciones sexuales con alguien que este
infectado.
   Ya que usted no puede estar seguro de que alguien este
infectado, el riesgo de estar en contacto con el virus aumenta con
el numero de companeros sexuales que usted tenga.
   Cualquier intercambio de sangre, semen o fluidos vaginales
infectados puede transmitir el virus y ponerlo a usted frente a un
gran riesgo.
   Los siguientes comportamientos constituyen un riesgo cuando se
practican con una persona infectada. Usted no puede saber a simple
vista si una persona esta infectada.
   COMPORTAMIENTO ARRIESGADO
   Compartir agujas y jeringas para inyectarse drogas.
   Contacto sexual anal, con o sin condon. Contacto vaginal u oral
con una persona infectada, o con alquien ue se inyecte drogas o
practique el sexo anal.
   Contacto con alguien que usted no conoce bien (un encuentro
casual o una persona que practique la prostitucion) o con alguien
que usted sabe que tiene varios companeros sexuales.
   Contacto sin proteccion (sin condon) con una persona infectada.
   COMPORTAMIENTO SEGURO
   No tener relaciones sexuales.
   Tener relaciones sexuales con una sola persona que no este
infectada y ser mutuamente fieles.
   No inyectarse drogas.
   ?Y hablando de citas?
   Tener citas y concoer a otras personas es algo normal en la
vida. Tener una cita no es lo mismo que tener relaciones sexuales.
El contacto sexual, como parte de una cita puede ser arriesgado.
Uno de los riesgos es el SIDA (AIDS).
   ?Como puede usted saber si la persona con la que usted esta
saliendo o le gustaria salir ha estado expuesta al virus del SIDA?
Lo malo es que usted no puede saberlo. Pero lo bueno es, que
mientras evite las relaciones sexuales y no comparta las agujas
para inyectarse las drogas, no importa.
   Usted debe tener mucho cuidado con la persona con quien usted
tenga relaciones sexuales, haciendo su propia decision sobre la
persona, basandose en su buen juicio. Esto puede ser muy dificil.
   ?Ha tenido esta persona alguna enfermedad sexualmente
transmisible? ?Con cuanta gente ha tenido relaciones sexuales? ?Ha
experimentado con drogas?
   Todas estas preguntas son delicadas, pero importantes. Pero
usted tiene la responsabilidad personal de preguntar.
   Pienselo de esta manera. Si usted conoce a alguien lo suficiente
como para tener relaciones sexuales, entonces usted deberia hablar
francamente del SIDA. Si alguien se niega a hablar del SIDA, usted
no deberia tener relaciones sexuales con esa persona.
   ?Pueden las personas casadas adquirir el SIDA?
   Las personas casadas que no estan infectadas, que son fieles y
que no se inyectan drogas no tienen ningun riesgo. Pero si siguen
un comportamiento arriesgado (vea la pagina 3) ellos podrian
infectarse con el virus del SIDA e infectar a su pareja. Si usted
cree que su conyuge pudiera estar poniendole en una situacion
arriesgada, hable con el o ella. Es su vida.
   ?Por que se habla tanto de los condones?
   No hace mucho tiemo, los condones (hule, la gomita, o
preservativo) eran cosas de las que no hablabamos mucho.
   Ahora esto se discute en las noticias de la television o en la
primer aplana de su periodico y los condones se exhiben libremente
en su farmacia local, supermercado o tienda.
   Para aquellos sexualmente activos, que no limitan su actividad a
una sola pareja, se ha demostrado que el uso de los conones ayuda a
prevenir la diseminacion de enfermedades sexualmente transmisibles.
Por eso se recomienda el uso de los condones para ayudar a reducir
la transmision del SIDA.
   El uso de los condones es la mejor medida preventiva contra el
SIDA, fuera de no tener relaciones sexuales y de practicar un
compartamiento seguro (vea la pagina 3).
   Pero los condones no son absolutamente seguros. Usted debe de
usarlos apropiadamente. Y usted debe usarlos cada vez que tenga
relaciones sexuales, desde el principio hasta el final. Si usted
usa un condon debe seguir las siguientes recomendaciones:
   (1) Use condones hechos de latex, ya que el latex sirve como una
barrera para el virus. Los condones ``lambskin'' o ``natural
membrane'' no son tan buenos por los poros en el material. Busque
la palabra ``latex'' en el empaque.
   (2) Un condon con un espermicida puede proporcionarle proteccion
adicional. Se ha demostrado en pruebas de laboratorio que los
espericidas matan el virus del SIDA. Use el espermicida en el
interior de la punta y en el exterior del condon.
   (3) El uso del condon es mas seguro con un lubricante. Revise la
lista de ingredientes en la parte posterior del empaque del
lubricante para estar seguro de que tenga base de agua
(water-based). No use lubricantes con base de petroleo, cold cream,
aceite para bebes o manteca vegetal para cocinar. Estos pueden
debilitar el condon y ser la causa de que se rompa.
   ?Como luce una persona con SIDA?
   Es muy importante que todos entiendan que una persona puede
estar infectada con el virus del SIDA (AIDS) y no mostrar ningun
sintoma.
   Es posible estar infectado por anos, sentirse bien, lucir bien y
no tener manera de saber que usted esta infectado, a menos que a
usted le hagan una prueba para el virus del SIDA.
   Este periodo en que uno esta infectado sin saberlo es una de las
cosas que mas preocupan del SIDA. Durante este periodo, sin
embargo, las personas infectadas con el virus del SIDA, pueden
transmitir el virus a sus companeros sexuales y a la gente con
quien comparten las agujas para inyectarse drogas. Las madres
infectadas pueden transmitirlo a sus hijos durante el embarazo o
durante el parto.
   Una vez que se presentan los sintromas, estos son similares a
los de algunas otras enfermedades. Mientras la enfermedad progresa,
los sintomas se vuelven mas serios, porque el virus del SIDA no
permite a las defensas naturales de su cuerpo funcionar
correctamente.
   Si a usted le precoupa seriamente la posibilidad de estar
infectado, usted tiene que pensar que su comportamiento puede
afectar a otros. Si usted cree que deberia hacerse una prueba de
sangre para el virus del SIDA, consulte a un doctor o a un
consejero del SIDA para mas informacion. (Lea abajo.)
   ?Hay una cura para el SIDA?
   Actualmente no hay cura para el SIDA.
   Las medicinas, tales como AZT, han prolongado la vida de alguna
gente con SIDA. Existe la esperanza de que se desarrollen nuevos
tratamientos.
   Tampoco existe una vacuna para prevenir la infeccion en gente
que no esta infectada. Los investigadores creen que pasaran anos
antes de que se descubra una vacuna segura y eficaz.
   La manera mas eficaz para prevenir el SIDA es no exponerse al
virus, cosa que usted puede controlar con su propio comportamiento.

transmitir el virus a sus companneros sexuales y a la gente con
quien comparten las agujas para inyectarse drogas. Las madres
infectadas pueden transmitirlo a sus hijos durante el embarazo o
durante el parto.
   Una vez que se presentan los siintromas, estos son similares a
los de algunas otras enfermedades. Mientras la enfermedad progresa,
los siintomas se vuelven mas serios, porque el virus del SIDA no
permite a las defensas naturales de su cuerpo funcionar
correctamente.
   Si a usted le precoupa seriamente la posibilidad de estar
infectado, usted tiene que pensar que su comportamiento puede
afectar a otros. Si usted cree que deberiia hacerse una prueba de
sangre para el virus del SIDA, consulte a un doctor o a un
consejero del SIDA para maas informacioon. (Lea abajo.)
   ?Hay una cura para el SIDA?
   Actualmente no hay cura para el SIDA.
   Las medicinas, tales como AZT, han prolongado la vida de alguna
gente con SIDA. Existe la esperanza de que se desarrollen nuevos
tratamientos.
   Tampoco existe una vacuna para prevenir la infeccioon en gente
que no estaa infectada. Los investigadores creen que pasaraan annos
antes de que se descubra una vacuna segura y eficaz.
   La manera maas eficaz para prevenir el SIDA es no exponerse al
virus, cosa que usted puede controlar con su propio comportamiento.

<HEAD>Pope Names High-Level Churchmen for Soviet Religious Event</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday named the
largest delegation of Roman Catholic clergymen ever to visit the
Soviet Union as representatives at a major religious celebration
next month.
   The high-level group of 13 includes 10 cardinals, among them
John O'Connor of New York and Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the No. 2
man in the Vatican hierarchy after the pope.
   John Paul has often expressed the desire to visit the Soviet
Union, but the Vatican earlier disclosed that the invitation from
the Russian Orthodox Church did not extend to the pope.
   The Vatican officials and bishops from various parts of the
world will be attending the celebrations marking the millenium of
Christianity's arrival in what is now the Soviet Union.
   Although the invitation was in the name of the Orthodox Church,
the naming of such a top-level delegation clearly demonstrates an
attempt by John Paul to improve relations with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Vatican, in announcing the names, said John Paul attaches
great importance to the event and hopes it will open ``new paths
toward reconciliation, peace and justice of which humanity has so
much need.``
   In addition to Casaroli, the Vatican delegation includes
Cardinal Johannes Willebrands, a Dutchman who heads the secretariat
for Christian Unity, and Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, the French
president of the Justice and Peace Commission.
   The delegation also includes cardinals Joseph Marie Trinh Van
Can of Hanoi; Jozef Glemp, Roman Catholic primate of Poland;
Julijans Vaivods of Latvia; O'Connor of New York; Friedrich Wetter
of Munich; Franz Koenig, retired archbishop of Vienna, and Carlo
Martini of Milan.
   It also includes Archbishop Laszlo Paskai of Hungary, Bishop
Dario Castrillon Hoyos of Colombia, head of the Latin American
bishops conference; and Bishop Gabriel Gonsum Ganaka of Nigeria,
representing Africa.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the delegation was not
only the largest group of Roman Catholic prelates to visit the
Soviet Union but was also the first Vatican delegation ever to get
a formal invitation, although Casaroli and other churchmen have
visited individually in the past.
   Navarro could not recall such a large church delegation ever
attending a single event anywhere.
   The Vatican said that while Casaroli and Etchegary would only
attend the main celebration in Moscow, Willebrands would represent
the Holy See at all events.
   The pope has said often that he would travel to the Soviet Union
only if he could visit his flock throughout the country,
specifically the Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Byelorussia and
Kazakhastan.

   A man who woke up to find another man
trying to kiss his girlfriend in bed was in critical condition
Wednesday with stab wounds allegedly inflicted by the intruder,
authorities said.
   ``They fought all over that house,'' said Investigator Mark
Culbertson. ``They tore that house up. There was blood everywhere.''
   Anthony Bell, 22, of Vicksburg was being held in Warren County
Jail in lieu of $50,000 bond, facing charges of burglary and
aggravated assault, Chief of Detectives Bob Woods said.
   Raymond A. Barrentine and a friend were asleep at his house
Wednesday when she awoke to find a man trying to kiss her and began
screaming, police said.
   The two men fought, and Barrentine was stabbed at least five
times with a hunting knife before the intruder fled, Woods said.
   Culbertson said there was no indication the burglar knew
Barrentine or the woman. She was not injured, nor was Bell, police
said.
   Barrentine, 33, underwent surgery, and his condition was listed
as critical Wednesday afternoon.
   Police said Bell was captured later in the morning at a
convenience store and the knife they believe was used in the
assault was found at his home.
   Nothing was taken from the house, police said.

   The mayor and the five-member
city council of this southern town were put under house arrest
Wednesday after being charged with embezzlement and fraud, police
said.
   The politicians, all Communists, were accused of using public
funds totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars for private
purposes from 1985 to 1987, according to authorities in Cosenza,
the provincial capital.
   Charged were Mayor Fernando Fabiano, 33, a doctor, and
councilmen Francesco Curcio, 32; Francesco Abbritti, 31; Francesco
Mancuso, 51; Emilio Carravetta, 39, and Biagio Martino, 47.
   A spokesman for the Communist party in Cosenza was quoted by the
Italian news agency ANSA as saying that ``further investigation
will prove the groundlessness of charges.''
   The Italian Communist Party is the largest in Western Europe and
has campaigned vigorously against corruption in public
administration, especially in the underdeveloped south.

<HEAD>NRC Proposing Rules Change That Could Lead To Seabrook Low-Power
License</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted 4-0
Wednesday to propose a rules change that would allow the Seabrook,
N.H., reactor to obtain a low-power operating license without a
siren system to warn nearby Massachusetts residents in an emergency.
   The proposal, which will be subject to a 30-day public comment
period before a final NRC vote, would apply to any plants seeking a
5 percent power license, but was aimed at Seabrook.
   In February, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board
blocked a low-power permit for Seabrook because there was no siren
system in place for the six Massachusetts communities that fall
within a 10-mile evacuation zone around the southern New Hampshire
plant.
   The rules change would allow Seabrook owners to obtain the
low-power license and go ahead with testing while trying to get
approval of an alternate siren system. An approved warning system
would still be necessary to obtain a full-power license.
   New Hampshire Yankee, the plant's operator, was forced to remove
its Massachusetts sirens last year after a federal appeals court
sided with local officials. State and local officials led by
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis believe no evacuation system
can adequately protect nearby residents, and are fighting to block
the plant's opening.
   The company's new alert plan includes truck-mounted sirens and
siren-equipped helicopters as a backup.
   Critics say the license issue has grown more critical for
Seabrook owners, fearing the beleaguered reactor will never be
approved if Dukakis is elected president.
   The idle $5.4 billion plant is losing $50 million each month in
maintenance and finance costs, plant officials say.
   Current NRC rules do not specify off-site safety requirements to
obtain a low-power license, but a 1982 commission ``explanation''
of the rules does. The rules have been widely interpreted to
require an off-site alert system such as sirens for low-power
licensing.
   The NRC staff, in recommending the rules change, cited the ``low
risk'' involved in low-power testing.
   But critics led by Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., complain that
the risk has not changed since 1982, and therefore there is no
legitimate reason to change the regulations.
   In New Hampshire, Seabrook spokesman Rob Williams applauded the
NRC decision, saying it ``correctly addresses the very low risk of
low-power operation.''
   Commissioner Fred Bernthal did not vote because he is leaving
the NRC soon for a State Department post, said commission spokesman
Robert Newlin.

   A man who owns a tropical fish business was
arrested Wednesday and accused of smuggling 700 baby boa
constrictors into the United States from Colombia, authorities said.
   The snakes, which are a protected species in Colombia, were
concealed in five boxes that were part of an otherwise-legal
shipment of fish that arrived March 7 at Kennedy International
Airport, U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said.
   The snakes, 21 inches long, were discovered during an inspection
by agents of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the airport.
   The shipment was addressed to Agremiro Espana, 43, of Queens,
who owns Miro Espana Co., a wholesale tropical fish business. He
was charged with violating the federal Lacey Act, which outlaws the
interstate or foreign transportation of illegally captured wildlife.
   The charge carries a maximum sentence upon conviction of five
years in jail and a $250,000 fine.
   Under Colombian law, it is illegal to export boa constrictors,
said John Meehan, a special agent with the wildlife service.
   The snakes are a protected species under the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,
a treaty to which the United States is a party.
   All but 38 have been returned to their natural habitat in
Colombia, said Meehan. The rest will be used in the prosecution of
the case and may eventually be given to American zoos.
   The snakes were all newborns, Meehan said.
   He said baby boas can be bought in South America for about $5
and resold in the United States for as much as $200. Adult boa
constrictors, which grow up to 15 feet in length, bring much higher
prices.
   Meehan said boa constrictors are very popular among amateur
herpetologists because of their docile temperament and because they
are increasingly difficult to obtain.

   A series of explosions at a space shuttle
fuel plant rocked this southern Nevada city Wednesday, destroying
the facility and a marshmallow plant, killing at least one person,
injuring 96 and leaving scores of others missing.
   Flames and orange smoke rose 100 feet into the sky and buildings
shook 10 miles away in Las Vegas after the midday explosions at the
Pacific Engineering & Production Co. of Nevada. The plant
manufactures ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in fuel for the
shuttle's solid rocket boosters, but NASA said the accident was not
expected to delay resumption of shuttle flights.
   ``What we see is pretty much total devastation,'' said Fred
Gibson, an executive at the plant.
   All roads to Henderson, a town of 25,000 midway between Las
Vegas and Hoover Dam, were closed because of concern that toxic
gases might escape.
   At the command post near the blast site, Clark County Fire
Spokesman Mark Hector said at least one person had been killed.
   Emergency workers were forced to stand by for fear of additional
explosions. State records showed 125 people worked at Pacific while
the next-door Kid Marshmallow Plant employed 85, but few employees
of either plant had been seen at hospitals, authorities said.
   ``There are people out there who are probably dying,'' said
Janet Smith, a spokeswoman for Mercy Ambulance in Las Vegas, whose
company dispatched ambulances to the site. ``This is going to be a
daylong and nightlong event because no fire unit has been out there.
   ``People are out there on the desert wandering aimlessly'' if
they were lucky enough to have escaped, she said.
   David Coats, administrator of Saint Rose de Lima Hospital, said
96 injured people had been brought in. He said most of the injuries
were minor but at least three were critical.
   Gibson, asked if toxic products could have leaked, said the
plant's ammonia tanks could not be seen. ``We can't tell at the
moment whether these tanks are secure.''
   ``One of our pieces of equipment malfunctioned and caught on
fire. The fire spread quickly and there was an explosion,'' Gibson
said. At least two blasts followed the main blast within seconds.
   He said the smoke was so thick he couldn't see if any of
Pacific's buildings were still standing. ``I suspect there are
none,'' Gibson said.
   Emergency workers warned residents away from the area as smoke
billowed across the entire Las Vegas Valley. All schools in the
area were evacuated and closed for the day, United Blood Services
of Las Vegas made an emergency appeal for contributions to help
victims, and hospital workers were called in or put on standby
throughout the area.
   One victim with an open skull fracture was being flown by
helicopter to Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, said Tina Ashcraft,
Life Flight helicopter dispatcher.
   ``Our windows blew out. It blew the frame off the door. We are
probably five or six miles away. The thing is on fire,'' said Lee
Hall, secretary at the Henderson Convalescent Hospital.
   Ms. Hall said hospital officials were checking for injured
patients and employees. ``A window blew up in somebody's face,''
she said.
   Several people injured in the blast were taken to nearby Saint
Rose De Lima Hospital, where the explosion also shattered windows,
hospital spokeswoman Marcia Hawkins said.
   Ms. Hawkins said many patients were cut and bruised.
   ``The windows blew. The workers are helping the patients,'' Ms.
Hawkins said. ``It's near here and all we can see is the black
cloud of smoke.''
   In Las Vegas, buildings shook and a huge plume of smoke was
visible in the air. People leaving offices for the noon hour stood
on the streets, gawking at the smoke.
   A worker at Hoover Dam, Bob Baker, said he was deep inside the
dam when the blast rattled windows at the power plant in the belly
of the facility. He did not feel the dam itself shake.
   Jay Herman, an engineer who was less than two miles from the
plant site, said he heard three blasts, the first ``worse than any
sonic boom. I thought it was a plane crash but there was too much
smoke.''
   He said the second blast five minutes later `` almost knocked us
over'' and when the third hit, he crawled under a desk. ``I thought
it was a nuclear bomb.''
   NASA said in Washington that Pacific Engineering provides the
ammonium perchlorate to Morton Thiokol, NASA's prime contractor for
the motors, as well as to some Department of Defense programs.
   Don Amitor, a spokesman for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., said Morton-Thiokol had enough ammonium
perchlorate in supply for the next five shuttle launches. Under the
present schedule, the fifth launch would be in mid-1989.
   Amidor said a Kerr-McGee plant, also in Henderson, is capable of
making enough ammonium perchlorate for boosters to support eight
space shuttle flights a year.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Soviet Human Rights Progress Is Slow But Better Than
Nothing</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS 5 grafs with White House official's comment on tone of
Reagan rhetoric</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, abandoning his harsh criticism
of the Kremlin, credited the Soviet Union on Wednesday with making
progress on human rights and said gradual improvements were `better
than no change at all.''
   Striking a conciliatory tone in a pre-summit address, Reagan
readily acknowledged that the United States has its own problems
with homelessness, racial discrimination and unemployment, as
Moscow has charged.
   Reagan's remarks appeared intended to soothe Soviet anger about
his demand for the Kremlin to ``tear down a wall of oppression''
and his claim that the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan was
being made under pressure.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Secretary of State
George P. Shultz in Moscow last month he was tired of Reagan's
sermons. And the Soviet government accused Washington of ``imperial
arrogance.''
   In his remarks to a Chicago group, Reagan went out of his way to
credit Gorbachev with loosening restrictions on religion, freedom
of speech and emigration.
   ``We applaud the changes that have taken place and encourage the
Soviets to go farther,'' Reagan said. ``We recognize that changes
occur slowly but that is better than no change at all.''
   In a brief question and answer session with the audience, Reagan
said he was willing to give Gorbachev ``the benefit of the doubt,
up to a point'' _ that the Soviet leader sincerely wants to achieve
the program of economic and social reforms known as ``glasnost.''
   The president said he believed Gorbachev was pursuing the
reforms because of economic problems in the Soviet Union.
   Reagan said he hoped he could offer Gorbachev at this month's
U.S.-Soviet summit some suggestions as to how he could move ahead
with glasnost.
   ``That, I think, is preferable to staging a kind of contest with
him so that someone looks like a winner or loser,'' Reagan said.
   He also expressed a dream ``to rid the world'' of nuclear
weapons. He compared the danger of nuclear weapons with a
hypothetical situation in which the world was threatened by a power
from outer space.
   ``Wouldn't we all of a sudden find that we didn't have any
differences between us at all, we were all human beings, citizens
of the world, and wouldn't we come together to fight that
particular threat?'' Reagan said.
   Reagan's speech was part of a series of addresses intended to
frame the issues he will highlight at the summit in Moscow with
Gorbachev May 29-June 2. His audience was the National Strategy
Forum, a non-partisan organization that sponsors educational
programs on national security and foreign policy issues.
   The president said the Soviets have had ``limited successes'' in
improving their economy.
   ``I do not bring this up simply for the sake of sounding
critical,'' Reagan said. He said he mentioned it because of a
development ``of tremendous significance'' in recent months, that
the Soviets themselves are beginning to talk about shortages in
their country.
   On human rights, Reagan said some 300 political and religious
prisoners had been released from labor camps over the last three
years, and that the incarceration of dissidents in mental hospitals
and prisons had slowed, and in some cases, stopped.
   ``And while the press remains tightly controlled by the
(Communist) Party and the state, we've seen the publication of
stories on topics that used to be forbidden _ topics like crime,
drug addiction, corruption, even police brutality,'' the president
said.
   ``These changes are limited and the basic standards contained in
the Helsinki Accords still are not being met,'' Reagan added.
   Underscoring his theme, Reagan said, ``We welcome the human
rights progress the Soviets have made and believe there is good
reason to hope for still more.''
   Reagan said there is no guarantee that the progress is
permanent. He said the late Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev
``loosened things up a bit'' but that it was reversed later.
   ``And for the nearly three decades until our own day, oppression
and stagnation once again became the determining characteristics of
Soviet life,'' Reagan said.
   ``And just as previous hopeful moments in Soviet history ended
all too soon, so, too, `glasnost' _ today's new candor _ will
succeed if the Soviets take steps to make it permanent, to
institutionalize it,'' he said.
   Asked by reporters about the softened tone of Reagan's rhetoric,
White House communications director Tom Griscom said the speech was
different because the topic was different, such as human rights
versus regional issues.
   ``Is there anything wrong with saying since 1985 we've seen
things that are positive and we hope to see more?'' he said.
   In an April 21 speech in Springfield, Mass., Reagan said, ``Two
of the most basic rights that we have called on the Soviets to
comply with are the right to emigrate and the right to travel. How
can we help but doubt a government that mistrusts its own people
and holds them against their will? ...
   ``In the new spirit of openness, why doesn't the Soviet
government issue passports to its citizens? I think this would
dramatically improve U.S.-Soviet relations.''
   The speech led to Gorbachev's complaint to Shultz about U.S.
sermonizing.

   More than four tons of cocaine was discovered
in hollowed-out Brazilian lumber bound for U.S. cities, federal
authorities announced Wednesday.
   An anonymous letter from Cali, Colombia, tipped drug agents that
the freighter Amazon Sky would be smuggling the cocaine, which is
expected to total 8,800 pounds, said U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle.
   ``If true, it would represent the largest cocaine seizure in
U.S. history,'' said Merkle. ``We're at 6,000 pounds and still
counting.''
   The largest previous seizure, found stuffed into picnic
furniture in Port Everglades, was 8,700 pounds.
   The cocaine is believed to have been imported by what U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agents call the Cali Cartel.
   The group ``is a world-class competitor of the Medellin
Cartel,'' the violent Colombian gang responsible for up to 80
percent of U.S. cocaine imports, said Tom Cash, head of the Miami
DEA office.
   Three men _ two Colombians and an American _ have been arrested,
authorities said.
   Michael Tsalickis, owner of the Amazon Sky and the Tarpon
Springs warehouse where the cocaine-filled lumber was taken, Fredy
Perez and Pedro Navarez were charged with conspiracy to import and
to distribute the cocaine.
   Tsalickis, 60, is reputedly an associate of two top Cali Cartel
leaders, according to DEA files.
   The cocaine entered the country aboard the Amazon Sky in a
shipment of Brazilian cedar, authorities said. The ship, after
loading up in Brazil, stopped in Leticia, Colombia.
   There, Cash said, an estimated 800 to 1,000 people must have
hollowed out the lumber packed the cocaine in styrofoam containers,
stuffed them inside and resealed the lumber.
   The shipment then went down the Amazon River and arrived at
Bayboro Harbour in St. Petersburg on April 19. There, under DEA
surveillance because of the February letter from Cali, part of the
lumber was unloaded and taken to Tsalickis' warehouse.
   The confiscated cocaine was headed to New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles and Miami, Cash said.

<HEAD>Man Arrested Six Years After Losing Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHUAC, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For six years Richard McKeand went on with
his life, thinking an appeals court had cleared him of an armed
robbery conviction.
   But recently an arrest warrant with his name on it surfaced and
now he is in jail, awaiting transfer to serve a five-year prison
term for robbing a convenience store a decade ago.
   As it turns out, the appellate court had rejected his appeal and
the paperwork apparently got lost.
   Part of the confusion likely resulted from the death of his
attorney, former Texas House Speaker Price Daniel Jr., who was shot
and killed a few months after McKeand's trial. Then Daniel's
assistant in the case, Frank Hughes, relocated.
   McKeand, 29, who was arrested last week, had made no attempt to
hide. He had continued to list his number in the telephone book
while working as an oil rigger.
   ``Everybody knows what he did was wrong,'' said his
sister-in-law, Rayleene McKeand, 24. ``But the courts should have
taken care of it right then before he'd built a new life. Everybody
changes after 10 years.''
   ``I remember he was very young and didn't have a record. He
wasn't a big-time bandit,'' said State District Judge Carroll
Wilborn Jr., who prosecuted McKeand.
   McKeand and another teen-ager, Thomas Williard Reeves, used a
shotgun to rob a convenience store of $100 on July 2, 1978. They
were pulled over by police 1{ hours later, confessed and turned
over the money and weapon.
   Reeves, who agreed to a three-year sentence in a plea bargain
and testified against McKeand, was released from prison in 1981
after serving 11 months.
   McKeand's mother, Betty McKeand, said some community business
leaders have offered to write a letter asking that her son be
pardoned or paroled.
   She said her son's attorneys had not told him that the appeal of
the 1979 conviction had been denied in 1982 and a warrant had been
issued for his arrest.
   She said her son now has an acre or so of land with a mobile
home and recently bought a truck. McKeand, married with a
5-year-old son, separated from his wife this year after seven
years. He was looking forward to his son visiting him during the
summer, his mother said.
   Court records show an arrest warrant was issued Oct. 6, 1982.
The warrant was later returned unserved from the sheriff's office.
   ``These things sometimes happen,'' said Sheriff C.E. ``Chuck''
Morris. ``We handle about 100 warrants per month. There's a
horrendous workload. I don't know whether a secretary misplaced it
or what.''
   The appellate court was reviewing its records last month and
noticed it had never been notified about McKeand's arrest. It sent
a letter to the district clerk, the error was discovered and a new
warrant issued.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III should resign
in the best interests of the nation, Rep. Carl Pursell, a Michigan
Republican, said Wednesday.
   ``The continued controversy which surrounds Ed Meese is
counterproductive,'' said Pursell, a deputy Republican whip in the
House. ``It has impacted on his credibility, as well as everyone
with whom he is associated. I believe a new attorney general is
needed to restore credibility at the Justice Department.''
   Meese figures in several investigations into allegations of
ethics violations in awards of government contracts, improper stock
ownership and other improprieties.
   The Senate subcommittee on oversight of government management,
whose chairman is Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., concluded in a report
that Meese failed to observe an ethics policy in dealings with
Wedtech Corp., a New York defense contractor.
   Pursell's comments were made prior to the report's release.

<HEAD>No City Funds If Jackson Heads Cinco de Mayo Parade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Word that city funds will be withheld from
the Cinco de Mayo parade if presidential candidate Jesse Jackson is
its grand marshal has angered a parade organizer.
   Chief Administrative Officer Rudy Nothenberg recently notified
the Mission Economic and Cultural Association that it would not be
reimbursed for parade expenses on grounds that taxpayers' money
shouldn't be used for such explicitly political purposes as an
appearance by Jackson.
   Jackson is a candidate in California's Democratic primary on
June 7.
   Association director Roberto Hernandez said withholding the city
money could cost the group $14,000 and would be hypocritical
because politicians such as Mayor (then Assemblyman) Art Agnos,
former Mayor Dianne Feinstein, state Sen. Milton Marks and other
politicians have participated in the parade _ some as grand marshal.
   But Nothenberg responded that public officials who have joined
the Cinco de Mayo festivities were city or state office-holders at
the time.
   ``They're incumbents,'' he said. ``He (Jackson) is a candidate.
... The issue is very clear. This is a partisan political event. We
do not allow city money to be used for political events.''

<HEAD>Idea of North Senate Candidacy Divides Virginia GOP Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North, indicted for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair, has very little time to decide on a Senate bid
this year, the head of the Virginia Republican Party said Wednesday.
   North, who has been indicted on charges of trying to defraud the
government in the Iran-Contra scheme, has remained silent on a move
to draft him as the state GOP's Senate nominee.
   But if North intends to seek the seat of Republican Sen. Paul S.
Trible Jr., who is not running for re-election, he needs to declare
soon, says state GOP Chairman Donald W. Huffman of Roanoke.
   ``It'll be tough unless they actually get North to say, `I'm
running,''' Huffman said of the draft effort. Even then, he said,
North's indictment would pose a major obstacle to winning the
nomination.
   Tim Phares, an organizer of the draft-North movement, said North
may have sent a signal about political plans in a commencement
speech Monday at the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Liberty University when
he talked about finding good candidates for office.
   ``Obviously, we can't read his mind. But that's how we interpret
it,'' said Phares.

<HEAD>Jackson Meets With 13 Western Lawmakers To Discuss Western Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest lawmakers came away from a 40-minute
meeting with Jesse Jackson on Wednesday impressed with the
Democratic presidential candidate and his committment to Western
issues.
   ``He was obviously very tired, but made an effort to sell his
program and respond thoughtfully to our concerns,'' said Oregon
Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio. ``Just by coming he showed his
understanding of the importance of the West.''
   Thirteen lawmakers from seven Western states attended the
meeting to discuss a ``Go West '88'' strategy as the campaign trail
heads to Oregon and California over the next month.
   ``We don't think that any recent candidate, including the
incumbent president, has realized the needs and concerns of the
West,'' said DeFazio. ``We are left out of the debate.''
   Oregon Democratic Rep. Ron Wyden said he thought Jackson
addressed the ``key issues very well. He laid out a specific agenda
addressing our concerns and seemed to understand that a Western
strategy may be a key to winning in November.''
   Wyden was one of the organizers of the campaign by more than 40
Western representatives and senators to impress on Jackson and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis the importance of Democrats
winning the West if they want to claim the White House.
   The group expects to meet with Dukakis later.

<HEAD>Texas Air Chief Sees Eastern Losses Continuing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp.,
said Wednesday the turmoil surrounding Eastern Airlines ``continues
to ravage'' the financial performance of the air carrier, with
losses expected through the first half of this year.
   Lorenzo in remarks to the International Aviation Club said
Eastern, a Texas Air subsidiary, will post continuing losses during
the second quarter.
   He blamed it in part on the airline unions' campaign against
Eastern, the refusal by the Machinists union to agree to
concessions and the series of government investigations of the
Miami-based airline, which has been in the center of labor turmoil
for years.
   ``The present environment is having a serious impact on Eastern.
It continues to ravage the financial results and the future of this
great airline,'' Lorenzo said.
   ``Currently we are looking at very sizable and continuing losses
in the second quarter because of all the activities that are taking
place and their impact on travelers.''
   Eastern has not made public its financial results for the first
quarter of 1988, although Texas Air officials have made clear that
the carrier lost money. Last year Eastern lost $181.6 million,
including a staggering $143 million in losses during the fourth
quarter.
   Eastern's president, Philip Bakes, several weeks ago
acknowledged that the airline was losing some bookings because of
the recently announced Federal Aviation Administration
investigations into the carrier's safety procedures and its labor
battles.
   Lorenzo said Wednesday that he welcomed the FAA investigation
and said he anticipates it ``will put into perspective the
misinformation and nonsense that's been peddled to the media, the
FAA and Congress'' by Eastern's unions.
   Last month, the FAA announced it was seeking $823,000 in
penalties from Eastern for past safety violations and that it was
beginning a plane-by-plane inspection of the carrier.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor told reporters Wednesday that
the Eastern inspections are expected to be complete in about a
week. He said inspectors continue to uncover some infractions
requiring corrective action in 7 percent to 8 percent of the planes
checked.
   McArtor said that while in many of those cases the planes had to
be taken out of service briefly, he did not consider the percentage
of infractions unusually high.
   Lorenzo characterized the problems found by the FAA inspectors
so far as minor and said they likely would have been discovered by
airline employees had the government inspectors not been present.

   Medical, health and education groups hailed
the government's new AIDS booklet Wednesday as clear, direct and
compassionate, and said it should be required reading for all
Americans.
   The pamphlet, ``Understanding AIDS,'' was developed by the
Public Health Service under orders from Congress and will be sent
to every household with a mailing address on May 26.
   Despite some grumbling over the length of time it took to
produce the eight-page pamphlet, there was almost unanimous praise
for its content.
   ``This pamphlet should be required reading for every American
citizen,'' the American Hospital Association said in a statement.
   ``Everyone who reads this mailer will understand the disease
better, and I hope this understanding will lead to urgency and
compassion, and replace panic and fear,'' Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., said in a statement headlined ``At long last,
information.''
   Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce health
subcommittee, said the booklet comes ``years after any reasonable
American would have expected it'' and two years later than similar
efforts by other nations such as Britain.
   He said it took two acts of Congress to pry the information
loose from what he termed ``White House censors.'' Congress
expressly prohibited the booklet receiving clearance from anyone
outside HHS.
   The pamphlet says people cannot get AIDS from casual contact
such as kisses, mosquito bites, sweat, tears, clothes, telephones
or toilet seats. It also describes explicitly how the AIDS virus
enters the body and what can be done to minimize risk, including
instructions on the correct use of condoms.
   Amid the chorus of approval, Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif.,
disputed the booklet's assertions and said it would mislead the
public.
   ``You get the impression that none of us have anything to fear
from associating with people who have the virus, ARC (AIDS-related
complex) or AIDS. Nothing could be further from the truth,''
Dannemeyer said. ``The report should not go out to the American
people.''
   Asked why Americans should listen to him rather than the battery
of scientists, doctors and others endorsing the pamphlet,
Dannemeyer said public health officials have exercised questionable
judgment so far in handling the AIDS crisis. He said they haven't
shut down homosexual bathhouses or required that infected
individuals be reported to authorities by name, among other things,
and said President Reagan had been poorly served by his health
appointees.
   But Dannemeyer was a lonely voice of protest. The pamphlet won
praise from a diverse range of interest groups ranging from gay
organizations to the American Medical Association, labor unions to
the American Red Cross.
   Jeff Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, called the booklet long overdue and ``generally a very
positive step. It is compassionate, accurate, straightforward and
non-judgmental. The strong statements about casual contact are
particularly important.''
   Scott D. Thomson, executive director of the National Association
of Secondary School Principals, said the booklet is ``highly
readable for youth'' and will help families discuss AIDS ``in a
candid yet friendly framework.''
   The material is specific and may offend some people, said
Elizabeth Whelan, executive director of the American Council on
Science and Health. ``But in dealing with matters of life and
death, sensibilities should not dictate educational efforts aimed
at prevention,'' she said.
   In addition to being mailed to all American households, the AIDS
booklet will be available at Planned Parenthood clinics and other
facilities.
   Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood, called the
pamphlet a ``frank and thorough guide'' that her group is happy to
distribute. ``We are pleased and relieved that this nation is
finally acknowledging that the AIDS epidemic is a health issue, not
a moral issue,'' she said in a statement.

<HEAD>Actress Calls For Medicare Coverage Of Mammogram Tests For Breast
Cancer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Lynda Carter teamed up with medical
experts Wednesday to call for Medicare coverage of mammogram
screening tests to detect breast cancer in older women.
   ``Although I am a professional actress and entertainer, I speak
to you today not as a public figure but as a private person _ a
woman who has many female family members and friends for whom
breast cancer remains an ever-present threat and concern,'' Ms.
Carter told a House Appropriations subcommittee.
   ``Mammography can pick up many breast cancers when they're very
small, even before they can be felt,'' Ms. Carter said. ``But for
economic reasons, mammography isn't accessible to many of the women
who need it.''
   She said that making the tests more readily available ``makes
sense for financial as well as humanitarian reasons,'' because
early detection of breast cancers avoids the high costs to treat
cancers discovered later.
   ``All of us can help in our own way to bring about this needed
change,'' she said. ``All of us have a stake in making it happen _
because we are women, or because the lives of women important to us
are affected by the issue.''
   Ms. Carter appeared alongside Dr. Marvin A. Rich, president and
director of AMC Research Center in Denver, before the subcommittee
on labor, health and human services and education and related
agencies.
   Rich said Medicare, most Medicaid programs, and the majority of
private insurers do not pay for routine screening mammograms, only
for tests that are performed after symptoms of breast cancer have
appeared.
   He said the cost of the test, averaging at least $100, is ``a
significant deterrent to utilization of mammography by many of the
women who need it.''
   Because 40 percent of all breast cancers occur in women over age
65 and the risk of breast cancer climbs 15 percent for every five
years of age after 65, ``it is essential that women in the
Medicare-age population receive annual screening mammograms to
detect tumors in the early, most treatable stage,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bill Proposes US Buy Site Near Civil War Battleground to Block
Shopping Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two congressmen moved Wednesday to protect a
historic Civil War battlefield, introducing legislation for the
federal government to purchase the land next to the battle site in
order to block a planned shopping center.
   The bill, authored by Reps. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., and Michael
Andrews, D-Texas, would direct the Interior Department to purchase
from a developer a 600-acre plot of land adjacent to the Manassas
National Battlefield Park, where two important Civil War battles
were fought.
   The congressmen, who are Civil War buffs, say plans for a 1.2
million square-foot shopping center would violate the battlefield
site.
   ``We've come to this conclusion because both of us feel there's
no other choice,'' said Andrews. ``Both of us are convinced that
the local developers and politicians intend to build the shopping
mall.''
   The land-purchase bill comes a week after Mrazek attached
language to a House appropriations panel supplemental spending bill
that would block any federal highway money for road improvements
associated with the shopping complex.
   The 3,800-acre Manassas battlefield, about 27 miles west of
Washington, was the site of the first significant land battle of
the Civil War in 1861.
   In a second, three-day battle in 1862, 24,000 Union and
Confederate casualties were recorded, as Union forces that had been
as far south as Richmond 60 days earlier were pushed back into the
nation's capital.
   The battles, known in the North as the Battles of Bull Run, and
in the South as the Battles of Manassas, helped convince Union
officials that the war would be a protracted affair.
   Developers originally sought to build the shopping center on a
plot of land where historians say Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
had his battle headquarters, but have met with opposition from
local preservationists.
   Last Thursday, Hazel-Peterson Companies agreed to move the
complex a short distance away, at the suggestion of Interior
Department and National Park Service officials.
   Mrazek and Andrews rejected that move.
   ``I don't think that compromise is what we're looking for at the
battlefield,'' said Mrazek, who noted that the developer has
upgraded plans for the development several times. ``I don't think
the property ought to be desecrated, and that's what we view it
as.''
   The land-purchase bill will be referred to the House Interior
Committee.
   Rep. French Slaughter, R-Va., whose district includes the
battlefield site, has not yet studied the land-purchase bill, but
would support a move to reroute roads now running through the
battlefield, he said.
   Interior Department officials were unavailable for comment on
the latest proposal.
   In addition to asking the federal government to use its right of
eminent domain to acquire the land, Andrews, a member of the House
Ways and Means Committee, said he will ask his panel to reexamine
tax breaks given to developers building near national park sites.
   ``The question is, are we really going to protect the buffer
zones around national parks,'' Andrews asked. ``This is an
egregious example of where developers have been invited in by the
local politicians.''
   Andrews said he hoped to move the bill out of committee and onto
the House floor by July.

   An attorney for a woman who got AIDS during a 1983
transfusion charged Wednesday that the blood bank that supplied the
tainted blood neglected to take adequate precautions against the
deadly disease.
   Susie Quintana's lawsuit against a blood bank and two doctors
opened Wednesday before a six-person jury in Denver District Court.
   Similar suits have been filed, but lawyers said this may be the
first case in the nation in which a jury will decide an AIDS
victim's claim against a blood bank. In a 1986 California case, a
jury was chosen but the lawsuit was settled out of court before the
trial ended.
   ``It was just like a time bomb, waiting to send an AIDS virus
into a person's body. That person turned out to be Susie
Quintana,'' A. Bruce Jones said of the plasma supplied to his
client after she was injured in a gun accident.
   Jones said in his opening statement Wednesday that testimony
would show the doctor who treated Quintana used the blood bank's
plasma despite offers by family members to share their blood
because of their concern about AIDS.
   Quintana, 50, of Dolores, is suing United Blood Services, whose
blood bank in Albuquerque, N.M., supplied the contaminated blood;
Dr. Edward G. Merritt, Quintana's doctor; and Dr. Donald Kearns, a
Denver infectious disease expert who first tested Quintana for
exposure to AIDS.
   The defendants' attorneys planned opening statements later. The
doctors have defended their treatment of Quintana as proper, and a
lawyer for the blood bank previously said that tests for detecting
AIDS in blood were not available until two years after the woman
was infected.
   Judge John W. Coughlin is presiding over the case, which began
with jury selection on Monday.
   Chris Quintana, 53, also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, claims his
wife's illness affected the couple's sex life and potentially
exposed him to AIDS as well. The Quintanas seek ``substantial
damages,'' but their lawsuit does not name an amount, Jones said
Wednesday.
   Quintana has had full-blown AIDS since September 1987, but her
husband's tests have been negative, said Jones.
   ``Chris has not had an easy time since Susie was told she has
AIDS,'' Jones said Wednesday. ``Thank goodness he's not infected,
but they didn't know that at the time'' they had sexual relations
after the transfusion.
   Quintana was brought to Southwest Memorial Hospital in Cortez in
May 1983 for treatment of an accidentally self-inflicted gunshot
wound, Jones said. Merritt was the doctor who treated her, he said.
   ``One hour later, that unit of frozen plasma was put into
Susie's body,'' said Jones. ``You are going to hear evidence that
over that one-hour period that Ron (Quintana's eldest son) could
have given blood, Chris (Quintana's husband) could have given
blood.''
   Jones claimed that the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
was aware as early as January 1983 of the need to make blood safe
from AIDS, identifying male homosexuals and intravenous drug
abusers as high-risk groups.
   United Blood Services, he said, issued a joint statement with
the Red Cross and other organizations following a CDC meeting that
January that recommended ways for the public to avoid contaminated
blood. But he said the statement failed to call for blood donors to
be asked about their sexual preference.
   Jones said Kearns initially tested Quintana for exposure to AIDS
and told her the tests were negative, and Merritt also told Chris
Quintana that his wife did not have AIDS exposure.
   Biopsy tests performed in fall 1985 confirmed that Quintana had
been exposed to the AIDS virus, said Jones.

   What was planned as a quick, surprise strike at
guerrillas in south Lebanon encountered stiff resistance, leading
some Israeli experts to question the wisdom of the operation.
   Israeli officials initially said the operation that began Monday
night was small in scale and would last only about 24 hours, but
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Wednesday the soldiers were in
a tough battle.
   An army announcement later said the operation ended Wednesday
night with three Israeli soldiers dead and 17 wounded. It said more
than 40 guerrillas were killed, nearly all in Maydoun village, a
stronghold of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   At first, the primary objective appeared to be convincing
villagers not to provide guides and other aid to guerrillas, who
have made a dozen raids across Israel's northern border since last
November.
   A military source said privately, however, that ``the original
plan changed'' when the guerrillas stood and fought.
   The newspaper Haaretz said Israeli officials were angry about
information leaks just before troops entered Lebanon under cover of
darkness.
   ``Early publication of the army operation in Lebanon without the
approval of military censorship chased away hundreds of guerrillas
who were the main objective of the operation, and in fact caused
the main goal of the operation to fail,'' the independent daily
said.
   Some military analysts who criticized the mission said it may
encourage more attacks across the frontier rather than deterring
the guerrillas.
   Yossi Olmert of Tel Aviv University said: ``The results won't be
very significant.''
   He said guerrilla activity in the past two decades ``shows that
after military actions like this, they'll just try harder again
against us just to make a show of force.''
   Olmert also expressed doubt that the thrust to within a few
miles of Syrian army lines in east Lebanon would encourage Syria to
control the guerrillas.
   ``It's very likely that Syria is not impressed by this
operation,'' he said in an interview.
   Yehoshua Saguy, former chief of army intelligence, predicted the
guerrillas would only suffer a temporary setback.
   In an Israel television interview, he said: ``The immediate
achievement will be a relative calming down and decline in attempts
to infiltrate and attack for the not too distant future.''
   Saguy also said: ``We will have to repeat such operations to
prevent the guerrillas from reorganizing in the area.''
   Israel ended a three-year occupation of south Lebanon in June
1985. Many Israelis were left with deep suspicions about future
military entanglements, and the new operation raised immediate
questions.
   ``It's always easier to go in than it is to come out,''
Transportation Minister Chaim Corfu told The Associated Press.
   Military commentator Ron Ben-Yishai predicted in the daily
Yediot Ahronot that guerrillas would resume and even redouble their
efforts to get into Israel.
   Palestinian guerrilla groups will continue military action to
show support for Palestinians who have rebelled for five months
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, he said.
   Ariel Merari, an expert on terrorism at the independent Jaffee
Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv, said the effect of such a
quick thrust would not last long, especially without the element of
surprise.
   ``The main achievement is immediate if it comes as a surprise,''
he said. ``If it doesn't come as a surprise, what remains, and that
is doubtful, is deterrence of the local population from cooperating
with terrorists.''

   An electronic implant in the inner ear has not
restored full hearing to any of the 3,000 profoundly deaf who have
received the device, but it has provided at least some help to most
patients, a panel of experts concluded Wednesday.
   The device, called a cochlear implant, uses electrodes implanted
in the middle ear to send impulses to the hearing nerve. The
impulses are created by amplified sounds which are picked up by a
microphone from outside the body and relayed to the electrodes.
   A National Institutes of Health panel that examined the use and
success of the cochlear implant during a conference this week,
reported Wednesday that though results from the device have been
mixed, there is a promise of improvement as the technology develops.
   ``Reports have sometimes claimed a spectacular return of normal
hearing in deaf people with cochlear implants,'' said Robert I.
Kohut, chairman of the panel and a professor at the Wake Forest
University Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. ``Unfortunately,
to date, no person can be documented to have had normal hearing
restored by this device.''
   The committee report said that less than 1 percent of the 15
million hearing-impaired Americans are potential candidates for the
cochlear implant.
   Those who could use the device, the committee said, should be
profoundly deaf adults who receive no benefit from hearing aids,
who previously could hear and speak, who are in generally good
health and who have the intelligence and psychological strength to
learn how to interpret the sounds detected by the implant.
   Of the 3,000 who have received the implant, the report said,
only about 5 percent have experienced an improvement sufficient for
them to communicate without lip reading. About 60 percent to 70
percent have experienced what the group called ``significant
improvement.'' Another 2 percent to 15 percent of the patients have
stopped using the device because they found it irritating or
unhelpful. The rest received more limited improvement.
   Using the device on children is still controversial, the
committee said, though about 20 centers around the country are
putting the implant in young children on an experimental basis.
   Estimated cost of the procedure is $10,000 to $20,000.
   The group said there was great difficulty in predicting prior to
surgery who will benefit and who will not. Some patients have had
such success with the implant that they can talk on the phone,
while others, who appeared to be equally fit candidates, have not
benefited.
   A patient wearing the implant hears static and buzzing sounds
that vary in intensity and tone. The patient must learn to
interpret these sensations as sound.
   Irwin J. Shumacher, 67, a Washington man who received a cochlear
implant in 1980, was asked by the panel Wednesday to explain what
he ``hears'' from his implant.
   ``It sounds like a radio that is just a little off center,''
like static, he said.
   Shumacher said he is able to understand some speech although he
has one major problem. When people tell jokes, he said, their
voices tend to drop when they come to the end.
   ``So I sometimes miss the punchline,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A federal court jury convicted the reputed boss
of the Genovese organized crime family and eight others Wednesday
of a massive racketeering scheme that rigged multimillion-dollar
bids in the construction industry.
   But in an apparent setback for a government effort to oust the
current leadership of the Teamsters union, Genovese boss Anthony
``Fat Tony'' Salerno and two others were acquitted of tampering
with national Teamsters elections.
   Federal prosecutors and defense lawyers declined to comment on
the verdict, citing a judicial gag order. The order remains in
effect because the jury will reconvene next week to consider
forfeiture proceedings against the convicted defendants.
   Teamsters officials proclaimed the verdict a vindication.
   Salerno, 77, who is already serving a 100-year prison term for a
1986 conviction, and eight of 10 co-defendants were convicted of
racketeering and racketeering conspiracy, both of which carry
maximum 20-year prison terms.
   In all, Salerno was convicted on 28 counts, including extortion,
mail fraud and illegal gambling in addition to racketeering.
   Salerno grimaced slightly and sat down after his conviction on
the first count was announced. He saluted the jury from his seat
when they acquitted him on the Teamsters charges.
   He was acquitted on a total of five counts, including wire fraud
for allegedly engineering the 1983 election of Jackie Presser and
his predecessor, Roy L. Williams, as president of the 1.7
million-member Teamsters.
   Reputed Cleveland mobster John ``Peanuts'' Tronolone and
Clevelad businessman Milton ``Maishe'' Rockman also were acquitted
of tampering with Teamsters elections.
   It was not immediately known what affect the acquittals would
have on reported plans for a government civil suit to seek the
ouster of Presser and other Teamsters officials because the union
is allegedly ``extensively influenced'' by mobsters.
   Sources in the Justice Department, speaking on condition of
anonymity, had said the suit was drawn up but not filed to avoid
prejudicing the Salerno trial.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani has declined to confirm those
reports and would not comment Wednesday because of the gag order.
   Spokesmen for the Justice Department could not be reached
immediately for commen after the verdict.
   In Washington, Teamster officials said the verdict ``once and
forever'' shatters law officials' claims that organized crime
figures engineered the elevation of first Williams and then Presser
to the union's presidency.
   Teamster General Counsel John R. Climaco said Presser and other
top officials of the union ``feel vindicated ... and are comforted
by the fact that after over one year of testimony, this jury was
able to accurately ferret out the truth.''
   ``For the past two years, it has been widely reported, first
through calculated media leaks, and then through the use of
innuendo and even perjured testimony, that the elections of
Williams and Presser had been engineered and manipulated by
organized crime elements,'' Climaco said. ``Today that myth has
been once and forever shatttered by the jury verdict in the Salerno
case.''
   Tronolone and Rockman were acquitted of all charges against
them, including racketeering, conspiracy and wire fraud.
   In addition to Salerno, those convicted of racketeering were:
four New York area businessmen, Edward Halloran of Pelham, Nicholas
Auletta of Pelham Manor, Alvin O. Chattin of Dix Hills and Richard
Costa of Scarsdale; two other alleged Genovese capos, Matthew
``Matty the Horse'' Ianniello and Vincent DiNapoli; DiNapoli's
brother, Louis; and reputed Lucchese crime family capo Aniello
``Neil'' Migliore.
   Various defendants were convicted of rigging bids on numerous
construction projects including more than $30 million in concrete
work for the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.
   It took the court clerk and jury forewoman nearly an hour to
work their way through the 40-page verdict sheet. The jury began
deliberating April 26.

<TEXT>
   Federal agencies that fail to require
seat-belt use on roads running through U.S. parks and other lands
will be called before Congress to explain why, a House committee
chairman said. Wednesday.
   ``Obviously, this administration has not been willing to show
the best example when it comes to federal areas and belt use,''
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said in a speech to the Society of
Automotive Engineers.
   Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
vowed to use his subcommittee on oversight and investigation to
force greater seat-belt use in government. He said he would call in
representatives of federal agencies to explain the rule-making
process.
   ``If the example won't come from the administration, perhaps the
example will come from the oversight committee,'' Dingell said.
   He said the Defense Department has cooperated in his campaign to
require seat-belt use, but civilian agencies ``are more
recalcitrant.''
   The National Park Service proposed ``a seat-belt use requirement
as part of a revamping of its safety rules,'' Dingell said.
``However, when the rules were finalized, this requirement was
quietly dropped.''
   The Park Service in a letter said the proposed rule was removed
because of adverse public comment, Dingell said. Further
investigation showed ``that all but one of those comments came from
the Park Service employees,'' he said.
   A Park Service spokesman, Andrew Ringgold, said the agency
follows state law in determining seat-belt use. Where states
require seat belts, the parks also require them; where states have
no such requirement, neither does the Park Service.
   ``Our philosophy ... was that states were the appropriate
authorities to regulate traffic and that National Park Service
traffic regulations should be limited to situations that are either
unique to park areas or that are not consistently addressed by
state traffic regulations,'' Ringgold said.
   Also, the public would be confused by mandatory seat-belt use in
parks situated in states lacking such a requirement, Ringgold said.
   More than half the parks administered by the service require
seat belts be worn, Ringgold said. About 8,000 miles of public road
run through Park Service land, he said.
   Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have enacted
laws requiring seat-belt use, ``but the public has been lukewarm to
the use of seat belts, despite their known and obvious benefits,''
Dingell said.

<HEAD>Dyson Denies Homosexual Rumors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM STUCKEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUGHESVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Roy Dyson on Wednesday openly
confronted rumors that have spread since the apparent suicide
Sunday of his top aide, firmly denying that either he or the aide,
Tom Pappas, was homosexual.
   ``Tom and I were very, very good friends. He was like a brother.
We had a personal and professional relationship,'' the Maryland
Democrat said at a news conference three days after Pappas
apparently jumped to his death from the 24th floor of a New York
hotel.
   ``Was he (Pappas) a homosexual?'' Dyson was asked.
   ``No, he was not,'' Dyson replied.
   To the same question about himself, he responded firmly and
without emotion, ``No, I am not.''
   Dyson said he thinks Pappas jumped to his death because he could
see his reputation being ruined by a story in Sunday's Washington
Post that Pappas forced young male staffers to attend social
functions he arranged, fired one staffer who refused to stay at a
staff party and asked another male staffer to perform a strip-tease
at an office retreat.
   Dyson complained that the story was based on interviews with a
few disgruntled former staffers and gave only one side of the story.
   He said he doesn't think publicity about Pappas, including
earlier stories that he failed to properly report payments he
received from campaign funds, will hurt his chances of beating a
little-known Republican opponent, Wayne Gilchrest, in November.
   ``I am ready to go. I love campaigning,'' he said.
   He said he could not answer questions about the campaign funds
because Repubicans have lodged a complaint with the Federal
Election Commission.
   Until the news conference, Dyson, 39, had been in seclusion
since the 46-year-old Pappas died. The two men, and a third
staffer, Todd Skipper, were in New York for the weekend.
   Dyson said he talked with Pappas after the story was read to him
Sunday and that ``he seemed to be holding up very well.'' He said
Pappas denied the allegations in the story, but knew that ``the
damage had been done.''
   Dyson said Pappas was totally devoted to him and the 1st
Congressional District. ``I think he sensed he was losing it,'' he
said.
   A note left in the hotel room by Pappas ``did not seem like a
suicide note to me,'' Dyson said. The note was not addressed to
anyone and did not mention any names, he said.
   Addressing specific incidents in the Post story, Dyson said he
has discussed them with other staffers since Sunday and ``they have
shed a distinctly different light'' on them.
   He said he does not remember Pappas ordering an aide to perform
a strip tease although he was present at the retreat where the
incident allegedly happened.
   Other staffers told him there is a different explanation for
that incident, he said, but he refused to discuss it, saying ``in
time we'll get to that.''
   Dyson also discussed the firing of aide Andy Hira when he
refused to remain at a party at an Annapolis hotel earlier this
year. He said he was present and that Pappas told Hira he had to
attend because it was a party for constituents who had come to hear
the congressman announce he would run for another term.
   ``He (Hira) said he was not going to stay in the room with those
old bags,'' Dyson said.
   ``At that point, I think Tom told him he was no longer on the
staff,'' Dyson said.
   He said he did think it was improper for Pappas to advertise in
a Missouri newspaper for young men to fill staff positions and to
require them to send Pappas a photograph. He would have put a stop
to that had he known it, he said.
   Dyson said Pappas made some mistakes, but called him ``a man of
integrity, of compassion.''

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shelled a Syrian army
garrison Wednesday and used tanks to chase pro-Iranian guerrillas
from villages, then Israel announced that its two-day invasion of
south Lebanon was over.
   The Israeli military command in Jerusalem reported three Israeli
soldiers and more than 40 Arab guerrillas killed and 17 Israeli
troopers wounded. It said all Israeli forces had returned to their
bases.
   Israeli artillery shelled the 50-man Syrian garrison at Mashgara
while other units were storming a nearby town with tanks, driving
out guerrillas and knocking down houses.
   Whether the shelling was deliberate was not clear, and the
Syrians did not shoot back.
   Lebanon's state radio quoted a Syrian general in the Bekaa
Valley, who was not identified, as saying: ``We are watching
closely. We shall fight them if they make further advances.''
   No casualties were reported among the Syrians, who came under
Israeli fire for the first time since being forced out of south
Lebanon by the Israeli invasion of June 1982. Syria has 16,000
soldiers in the Bekaa.
   ``We have taken all the necessary measures and precautions to
avoid friction with Syrian forces,'' Col. Raanan Gissin, the army
deputy spokesman, told reporters in Tel Aviv.
   Troops flashed victory signs as they rolled back into Israel in
armored vehicles and tanks covered in dust.
   At a border checkpoint in the Israeli town of Metulla, soldiers
were offered candy and cold drinks. ``I couldn't care less about
the sweets, I just want to go home,'' one shouted.
   Another trooper sat glumly on an armored personnel carrier,
holding the helmet of a dead comrade.
   A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
unexpected resistance from the Lebanese Shiite militiamen altered
the Israeli plan for a quick operation, which Israeli officials
expected would last only 24 hours.
   ``The original plan changed with the clashes occurred,'' said
the source.
   Security sources said Israel added two mechanized battalions to
its operation Tuesday night, doubling to 2,500 troops the size of
the force that began the thrust the night before.
   Invading soldiers penetrated several miles beyond the ``security
zone'' Israel has maintained just north of its border since ending
a three-year occupation of south Lebanon in June 1985. The zone
ranges from 6 to 10 miles deep.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel had told Parliament in
Jerusalem earlier Wednesday the soldiers met resistance and might
continue the operation for two more days.
   A statement from the military command said most of the
guerrillas killed belonged to Hezbollah, a radical Shiite Moslem
group loyal to Iran.
   The operation was conducted ``in the framework of the ongoing
defense policy and with the aim of hitting terrorists ... recently
deployed in the security zone and on its outskirts,'' the statement
said.
   Lebanese police said Israeli troops stormed Maydoun village in
the western sector of the Bekaa on Wednesday after 11 hours of
street battles with Shiite militiamen. They blew up several houses
and retreated just before sundown, the police said.
   Shiite factions said eight militiamen were killed and 20 wounded.
   According to the Israeli army, guerrillas expelled all residents
of Maydoun last year and ``built fortifications and trenches,
turning the village into a fortified outpost of the Shiite
terrorist group.''
   At Mashgara, the Syrians took cover in sandbag positions and
foxholes during six hours of shelling by 155mm howitzers. Mashgara
is five miles north of Maydoun.
   Syrian troops in the Bekaa were put on maximum alert when
helicopters landed Israeli soldiers before dawn Tuesday near their
lines in the Mount Hermon foothills.
   The hills around Maydoun and nearby Ein el-Tineh are traditional
strongholds of Hezbollah, whose name means Party of God.
   Police said Hezbollah guerrillas, who claimed responsibility for
several raids into the security zone in the past two years, were
overwhelmed by the Israeli onslaught.
   A spokesman said five fighters were killed and 16 wounded trying
to stop the Israeli advance.
   Wednesday's thrust took Israeli forces 9 miles west of five
villages they entered Tuesday in search for Palestinian guerrillas
and allied leftist militiamen.
   At noon Wednesday, the Israelis withdrew from the villages of
Ain Ata, Memis, Kfeer, Khalwat and Ain Zeta after ``completing the
search,'' the police spokesman said.
   Ain Ata Mayor Hussein Qadi, 70, said an Israeli officer told
him: ``Do not allow saboteurs into your village and we'll not come
again.''
   ``I told him the guerrillas do not ask our permission to attack
Israel,'' Qadi said.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee OKs $100 Million For Super Collider</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Appropriations subcommittee on
Wednesday recommended spending $100 million next year on the
proposed superconducting super collider research project.
   The amount approved by the energy subcommittee was $40 million
more than it had originally recommended, but was less than
one-third the $363 million asked by President Reagan.
   ``This is the first hurdle for funding,'' said Rep. Carl
Pursell, R-Mich., the only subcommittee member whose state is a
candidate for the project. ``To survive, it is important that the
project receive adequate support at this stage.''
   Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., chairman of the subcommittee, said the
legislation limits spending to research and development leading to
the $4.4 billion physics research project, which will include a
53-mile-round particle accelerator.
   ``We feel like the $100 million is adequate to hold the team
together, the scientists, and also to go ahead with the necessary
reserch and all the preliminaries ... getting ready for
construction,'' Bevill said.
   But he added that ``this money is not to be used for purchsing
equipment or starting construction.''
   Bevill said the subcommittee increased its recommendation with
the backing of the House Democratic and Republican leadership.
   The Senate Budget Committee has recommended $200 million for the
super collider and other high-energy and nuclear-physics projects
but has not recommended an appropriations amount.
   Bevill said he and other subcommittee members would support
legislation authorizing the super collider project, ``but I think
every one of the panel feels as I do that we've got to have some
extra revenue before we commit this government to a project that is
going to cost somewhere between $5.3 billion and $9 billion.''
   The $5.3 billion estimate includes anticipated inflation. The $9
million estimate was produced by Bevill's staff.
   The super collider would fire subatomic particles against each
other at high speeds for research into the nature of matter.
   Seven states _ Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North
Carolina, Tennessee and Texas _ have been selected as potential
sites for the project, which is expected to create 4,000 permanent
jobs and have an annual budget of $280 million.
   Supporters argue that the super collider is needed to keep the
United States competitive in the next century. Opponents say the
project would siphon much-needed money from other scientific
research.
   Meanwhile, a group of Arizona business, education and labor
leaders presented the Energy Department with a plan to pay for the
super collider without immediate outlays by the federal government.
   Ian Macpherson, assistant attorney general and Arizona's super
collider coordinator, and Robbie Aiken, Washington representative
of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Corp., said the plan would create a
state agency to issue bonds for construction of the project, which
would be leased to the federal government.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy has enjoyed healthy growth so
far this year, with even such depressed sectors as energy and
farming showing improvement, according to an economic assessment
released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve.
   The central bank said ``continued moderate growth of the
nation's economy'' was confirmed by the reports received from the
Fed's 12 regional banks.
   Economists at the regional banks survey economic conditions in
their districts and the reports are compiled for use by Fed
policymakers when they meet every eight weeks to review monetary
policy. The next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee will
be on May 17.
   The government reported last week that the overall economy, as
measured by the gross national product, expanded at an annual rate
of 2.3 percent from January through March. It was a far better
performance than the recession that many analysts had feared
immediately following the Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
   This better-than-expected growth has led to expectations that
the central bank may soon begin tightening up on credit conditions
and boosting interest rates as a way of fighting inflationary
pressures.
   Such an action would seem to be consistent with the generally
upbeat economic assessments contained in the Fed report Wednesday.
   The report said manufacturing activity remained strong,
primarily because of strong growth of U.S. exports. It said housing
activity has shown some improvement following the slump at the end
of last year caused by high interst rates and consumer jitters
caused by the stock market collapse.
   The Atlanta Federal Reserve bank, which covers Georgia,
Tennessee, Alabama, Florida and part of Mississippi, reported that
textile mills in the region were running at near capacity, in part
because of rising export sales.
   Several regional banks in the West reported a pickup in oil
drilling activity. The Dallas region said oil-drilling had
rebounded sharply with the number of rigs in use growing for the
first time in six months.
   In agriculture, the report said farm incomes were expected to be
high this year, but down slightly from the 1987 level because of
smaller government payments and smaller profits in the livestock
sector.
   ``Farmland values are generally rising in most areas and farm
financial conditions appear to be strengthening,'' the report said.
   The Dallas bank found that the number of farmers and ranchers
leaving agriculture had slowed considerably, while the Atlanta and
the St. Louis districts predicted that cotton acreage should be up
substantially this year.

   How can anyone resist a bite of
Arthur Gutkin's spinach rolls when he is deliberately pulling them
apart in front of passers-by, letting the hot mozzarella ooze out?
   And who would walk by meatballs bubbling in sauce, or a pizza
laden with pepperoni, when samples are there for the taking?
   The public doesn't get to walk through this particular valley of
temptation: The two-day Taste Show at the Convention Hall is
designed for potential customers from the food service and retail
food industries.
   But for the lucky convention-goers, it was a golden opportunity
to try Robert Zitin's honey ham, or maybe Stuart Schnurman's mango
nectar. They could chew on rope cheese, nibble at the chocolate
cake, sample some shrimp or munch some macaroni salad.
   But above all _ Eat! Eat! Eat! That's what this convention is
all about. There were 200 representatives of food product
manufacturers on hand.
   ``This show is a glutton's fantasy,'' said Michael Villari, vice
president of the Tri-State Dairy-Deli Association, the show's
sponsor.
   On Tuesday, Peter Meyer handed out paper-thin slices of
soppressata, a spicy luncheon meat made by a company in Ontario,
Canada.
   Across the aisle, Zitin was promoting ``Made In the U.S.A.''
honey ham that he says has only 25 calories per serving.
   ``Ham has a bad reputation because people perceive it as
fatty,'' he said. ``We have a hard time showing it off _ it's just
a big wrapped loaf in the deli cooler.''
   If Zitin thought he had a hard time marketing his meat, consider
Jeff Groezinger, who was pushing ``headcheese'' made of pork
tongues and pork snouts. ``People love it _ really,'' he said.
   The battle of the pizzas at The Taste Show was intense. Sam
Sheaffer said his family company is the ``largest manufacturer of
crusts in the country.''
   But Henry Hips touted his ``gourmet pizza'' as fresh, not
frozen. Unlike frozen pies, the melted mozzarella cheese pulls away
from the crust when bitten into.
   ``This is wall-to-wall cheese,'' Hips said proudly. ``Women want
fresh, you know?''
   Schnurman, meanwhile, had a catalog with more than 2,000
products ranging from pita crisps to preserves to spicy sauces for
ribs. He was attracting a variety of nibblers to his table.
   Vic Loperfido, on the other hand, was attracting some skeptics.
People peered at his ``Sea Legs'' selection _ processed fish formed
to look like shrimp and lobster tails.
   ``We sell these everywhere, from four-star restaurants to
mom-and-pop delis to the local prison,'' he said. ``Why should
people have to deal with shells and other inconsistencies in real
shellfish?''
   Jim Johnston had no problems with promoting his product, as
eager tasters lined up for Ben & Jerry's ice cream. Business is so
great, he said, that ``we're not going into new markets right now,
but just trying to consolidate business in the states we're now
in.''
   Conventions in this seaside resort normally hand out tote bags
with freebies _ key chains, rulers and posters. But at The Taste
Show, no shopping bags are allowed. Only stomachs are allowed to
leave full.

   The top court of the United Methodist Church
gave the go-ahead Wednesday to a four-year, scientific-theological
inquiry into homosexuality.
   The nine-member Judicial Council said the study is intended to
provide ``a base of information to assist the church in resolving
the difference of opinion within the church regarding the
interpretation of homosexuality in the context of the Christian
gospel.''
   The go-ahead to the homosexual study, one of the most extensive
ever undertaken by a church, came after its legality was questioned
under a church rule barring funds to gay groups or ``to promote
acceptance of homosexuality.''
   The church court held that providing for the study clearly was
``not in conflict'' with the proscription. No estimate was given of
the cost of the study authorized at the church's governing
conference, held every four years.
   Earlier in the conference, the 9.6-million-member denomination
strongly reaffirmed a ban on active homosexuals in the clergy and
condemned such activity.
   The Rev. James A. Wall of Chicago, a Methodist and editor of the
ecumenical weekly Christian Century, said that undertaking the
study ``leaves our position under a question mark.''
   ``The simple fact that the study is being made says there may be
something that was missed by the delegates'' in their actions, he
said.
   In authorizing the study, the conference said ``homosexuality
has proved to be particularly troubling to conscientious Christians
of differing opinions,'' with biblical, theological and scientific
questions about it in dispute.
   To try to get the answers, the church directed a study enlisting
the ``best biological, psychological and sociological
information,'' as well as theological and ethical analysis.
Scientists and other experts from outside the denomination will be
consulted.
   The conference, attended by nearly 1,000 delegates, also called
for a moratorium on the patenting of animals produced by genetic
engineering and authorized a major study of the ethical and other
implications of such technology.
   Meanwhile, a Chinese Protestant leader who addressed the
conference said Christianity is growing rapidly in his country and
voiced hope for reconciliation between Chinese Catholics and the
Vatican.
   ``I would say I hope very much and pray very much for
normalization between the Chinese church and the Vatican and for
reconciliation between the two sides,'' Bishop K. H. Ting, head of
the China Christian Council, said at a news conference.
   Chinese Catholicism broke ties with the Vatican after Communism
came to power and functions independently as the Catholic Patriotic
Association. Rome has made numerous recent moves for reconciliation
without avail.
   Ting said there are 8 million Christians in China, about 4
million Protestants and 4 million Catholics. He said Protestants
are increasing twice as fast as the population.
   However, he discounted Western evangelical reports of 50 to 70
million Chinese Christians. ``Conversion to the Christian faith is
not not that easy,'' he said.

   A Senate subcommittee said Wednesday it had
referred to the Justice Department for criminal investigation a
Navy official's testimony about his lobbying contacts on a $130
million pontoon contract for scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   Testimony of Everett Pyatt, assistant Navy secretary for
shipbuilding, about his reasons for agreeing to set aside the
pontoon contract for Wedtech ``contains serious inconsistencies and
contradicts relevant documents warranting further investigation,''
the Senate subcommittee on oversight of government management
concluded in a report on Wedtech and its involvement with Attorney
General Edwin Meese III.
   Pyatt's testimony before the subcommittee last year was sent to
the Justice Department last December and has been under review,
said Senate subcommittee aides, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   Pyatt, who was instrumental in awarding the pontoon contract to
Wedtech, denied at the hearings that he spoke to Wedtech lobbyists
Lyn Nofziger and Mark Bragg before the contract was awarded in
April 1984.
   Nofziger, convicted earlier this year of illegal lobbying on
behalf of Wedtech and other clients, was President Reagan's White
House political director until January 1982.
   The Senate subcommittee's report said the evidence includes
statements by former Wedtech executive Mario Moreno, former Wedtech
consultant E. Robert Wallach and a calendar of Pyatt's secretary
showing that Pyatt met at least three times with Nofziger in
September and October 1983.
   The calendar also shows Pyatt accepted an invitation to an
anniversary celebration of the Nofziger-Bragg firm on Feb. 2, 1984.
   Pyatt also ``failed to disclose the full scope'' of his
relationship with Nofziger and Bragg, said the report by the Senate
subcommittee on oversight of government management.
   It wasn't until after last year's hearings that Pyatt supplied
the subcommittee with office calendars indicating that he spoke to
Nofziger and Bragg on the phone ``on at least 60 other occasions in
1984, 1985 and 1986.''
   The post-hearing documents supplied by Pyatt showed he had a
breakfast and two other meetings with Nofziger in 1983; seven
meetings with Bragg in 1984 and 1985; at least two lunches with
Nofziger in 1985 and 1986; and that he attended three anniversary
celebrations of Nofziger and Bragg's lobbying firm.
   Pyatt supplied the information after testifying that he last
talked to Bragg about Wedtech in early 1984. Wedtech officials have
said Bragg claimed to have discussed the pontoon contract
extensively with Pyatt in this period.
   Subcommittee chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., said in a statement
that the Defense Department's inspector general found Pyatt had
violated department ethics policy and Navy regulations when he
attended the events.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Brian Cullin, said Pyatt's office stands
on the testimony that the assistant secretary gave earlier to
Levin's subcommittee and that he would not comment further.
   Wallach and two other men are under indictment for racketeering
charges for allegedly extracting payments from the Wedtech in a
scheme to influence Meese and other public officials.

   Here are some comments Wednesday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   JESSE JACKSON, vowing to continue his campaign despite his
fading delegate count: ``We're within striking distance. It's not
over really till it's over.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, countering Jackson's recent criticism that he's
a manager rather than a leader. ``People who know me know I'm a
leader as well as a manager. One of the ways you demonstrate that
you can lead is you go out and win elections.''
   
   BRUCE BABBIT, who dropped out of the Democratic field last
winter, supporting Jackson's decision to stay in the race: ``I
think he should because he has something to offer and I think it
makes it a little more interesting.''
   
   PAUL SIMON, saying he will hold onto his 184 delegates in case
Dukakis ``stubs his toe'' before the Democratic National Convention
in July: ``I'm going to hold out until the California and New
Jersey primaries on June 7 and see whether I can still have an
influence on the nomination.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, asked about assertions that the Reagans consulted
astrologers about the timing of presidential events: ``I don't know
about that. But I'll tell you one thing: there are two edges to
this sword. There are a helluva lot of people across this country
that read these columns. Otherwise they wouldn't be in the papers.''

   After spending more than $2,000 and
eight years seeking help from attorneys, illegal immigrants
Santiago and Beatriz Casares took their six children and applied
for amnesty on their own Wednesday, the last day of the program.
   They said they gave up on one lawyer last week after it took him
a year to tell them their papers were no good.
   ``He wanted to charge us $1,750 more to arrange the amnesty,''
said Casares, who says he has lived in Edinburg with his wife since
1979.
   They borrowed the $420 family application fee from relatives in
time to spend Tuesday night and early Wednesday wrapped in blankets
outside the Immigration and Naturalization Service's legalization
center here.
   The couple and their children were among about 1,000 people in
line when the center serving the Lower Rio Grande Valley opened
Wednesday.
   Mrs. Casares came to the United States legally from Reynosa,
Mexico, with a border crossing card in 1979 and never returned, her
husband said. Casares said he swam the Rio Grande, a river that
forms the border between Texas and Mexico.
   They have worked various construction, yard mowing and migrant
farm labor jobs since then.
   Mrs. Casares said many employers paid them in cash because they
did not have Social Security numbers, but whenever they were given
a check, she saved receipts.
   She also held on to rent receipts from the four-room house they
have rented for eight years. ``I thought we might need them
someday,'' Mrs. Casares said.
   All the while, they put their faith in people representing
themselves as immigration attorneys, in an effort to become legal
residents.
   Most of the more than $2,000 they spent on the lawyers was for
``identification letters'' they would have to renew monthly,
usually for $40, they said.
   Such letters have little value, said Charles Perez, chief
legalization officer at the Harlingen INS center.
   ``All that is is a letter saying they are clients of an attorney
and that the authorities have to call the attorney before deporting
them,'' Perez said, adding he has heard of similar fraud schemes
throughout his 33-year career with the agency.
   ``There are lawyers who thrive on that,'' he said. Or, the
``attorneys'' may have been notaries public who prey on Mexicans
who think the title means the same as ``notario publico,'' a term
for lawyer in Mexico, Perez added.
   Casares, 42, said the first attorney took $1,600 of their money
over seven years then told them he could not do anything for them.
   The second man took $600 in a year before the Casares family
decided a week ago they were wasting their money and their quickly
expiring time.
   They said they would use their rent receipts, check stubs and
other papers to show they have lived in this country since before
Jan. 1, 1982, as called for in the 1986 amnesty law.
   On Wednesday, the couple and their older children born in Mexico
received slips of paper telling them to report to the center Nov. 3
for legalization interviews.
   Mrs. Casares said she is confident their applications will be
accepted and that their landlady will vouch for them if necessary.

<HEAD>Crack Raid Involves 100 Police Officers Taking Over One Block</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 police officers, their guns drawn,
briefly took over a one-block area of a residential neighborhood
intending to wrest control of a cluster of suspected ``crack''
houses.
   ``A lot of people were dealing out of multiple locations,''
Deputy Police Chief John Laux said after Tuesday night's raid.
``They are taking over a block and saying, `This is our block.'
We're saying ... it's a block and we're going to take the block
back.''
   Seven persons were arrested in the raids on seven suspected drug
houses, which police said was the department's largest single
police criminal action in recent memory. There was no shooting
during the raid.
   One man faces possible felony charges was carrying 13 doses of
crack, $600 and a handgun when police broke into one of the
suspected crack houses, Laux said.
   The sweep only turned up two other small amounts of the drug and
one shotgun, Laux said. If any charges are filed against the
remaining suspects, they would be misdemeanor charges, Laux said.
   ``In that respect it was disappointing,'' Laux said. ``It
certainly is nicer if somebody is there holding a large amount (of
drugs.) But the message still goes out to the neighborhood that we
will not let them take over city blocks and ply their illegal
trade.''
   The raids were prompted, in part, by hundreds of calls from
residents to police and to City Council member Sharon Sayles
Belton, who accompanied officers on the operation.
   ``The calls have been coming in every day of the week, whenever
you're in the office,'' she said. ``People are frustrated that the
narcotics unit can't come immediately. But concrete information has
to be pulled together first. People don't understand that. They see
it at all hours on the street.''
   In fact, police said, most of the houses raided by special
assault teams Tuesday had been raided at least once in the past few
months.
   In addition to making undercover purchases in the crack houses
in recent weeks, surveillance officers witnessed drug deals taking
place in front of several of the houses, said Sgt. Doug Smith, who
organized the entry teams.
   Neighbors said drug dealing has been prevalent not only on their
block, but on surrounding blocks as well.
   ``You can bust 'em, and bust 'em and bust 'em, but that doesn't
mean they're going to go away,'' said a man drinking beer on his
steps next to one of the houses that was raided. ``This has been
going on for months. It's gotten real bad. There's little kids here
and everything.''

<HEAD>House Votes Deep Reduction in `Star Wars' Spending</HEAD>

   Ignoring a veto threat, the House voted
Wednesday for a deep reduction in spending for President Reagan's
``Star Wars'' anti-missile defense program.
   After a long series of votes, the Democratic-controlled chamber
ended up approving $3.5 billion for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known.
   The decisions came as the House worked on a huge bill
authorizing Pentagon spending for the fiscal year which begins Oct.
1.
   Reagan had sought $4.8 billion for Star Wars, compared with the
current $3.9 billion budgeted for the five-year-old program.
   The Star Wars budget was approved Wednesday on a 223-195 vote,
after three earlier votes which rejected both total elimination of
all Star Wars money and granting Reagan his entire request, along
with another proposal to provide $4.1 billion.
   First, the House voted 312-105 to reject an amendment that would
have granted Reagan's entire $4.8 billion request. Then it turned
down, 299-118, another proposal to eliminate the entire SDI budget.
After that, a 227-190 voted turned back the $4.1 billion budget
recommended by the Armed Services Committee.
   Later, the House voted 244-174 to limit spending on the
so-called ``phase one'' of SDI to 40 percent of the total Star Wars
budget. ``Phase one'' is aimed at developing an early version of
the missile defense and current plans called for raising the level
of ``Phase One'' spending within the SDI program from 40 percent to
50 percent.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said the $3.5 billion SDI
figure in the House bill isn't enough and warned that he will
recommend a Reagan veto unless Star Wars spending is increased.
   ``If the Congress sends the president a defense bill that
contains a funding level for SDI that is in my view inadequate, I
would have no choice but to recommend a veto of that bill,''
Carlucci said in a letter read during the debate.
   The votes were part of the complicated congressional budget
process and the $3.5 billion spending level means the final
congressional SDI figure is likely to be around $4.1 billion.
   That's because the Pentagon budget bill that will be considered
by the Senate starting next week proposes $4.6 billion for Star
Wars. Reagan's SDI program traditionally has fared better in the
more conservative Senate, even though that chamber also is
controlled by Democrats.
   Differences between the two bills, including the SDI budget,
will eventually be reconciled by a House-Senate conference
committee. If the Senate votes $4.6 billion and the House figure
remains at $3.5 billion, the likely compromise will be around $4.0
billion, said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee.
   During four hours of debate, SDI critics and supporters repeated
their past statements. Critics contended the program won't work
because it is technologically unfeasible, while supporters argued
that SDI scientists have made a number of breakthroughs and U.S.
advances worry the Soviet Union.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., called Star Wars ``an astrological
dream our president decided to pursue,'' a reference to reports
that Reagan and his wife, Nancy, follow astrology.
   But Rep. John R. Kasich, R-Ohio, said, ``The debate no longer is
whether we ought to have an SDI ... the experts on both sides all
support it.''
   Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., said ``It makes no sense to spend
billions on long-shot futuristic dreams'' when the budgets for
non-nuclear weapons such as tanks and planes are being reduced.
   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., said SDI is full of ``half-baked
proposals'' and he urged the House to ``prevent a rush to deploy
inadequate and destabilizing weapons in space.''
   For Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., the House was being
``reckless, counterproductive'' to reduce the SDI budget below the
current figure.
   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., urged increases in SDI spending
because he said, ``We're asking a question with this research and
... we have to devote resources to answer this question.''

<HEAD>Police Identify `Little Kenny'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Little Kenny, a toddler found wandering in
traffic almost six weeks ago, has been identified, police said
Wednesday.
   But the boy's father, who came forward last week after hearing
news accounts of the child's odyssey, has dropped out of sight
again now that police have discovered warrants against him.
   The 20-month-old boy is Theodore Kenneth Shirley Jr., the son of
Ted and Mary Shirley of Zephyrhills, said Detective Miles Watson.
   ``The father gave me a lot of information that matched with what
I had,'' Watson said. Police decided late Tuesday that Shirley's
information was accurate after checking birth records and
footprints.
   The thin, fair-haired boy with brown eyes had been unidentified
since he was found in the street, dirty and hungry. Police said he
may have been wandering for two days.
   Shirley, 21, told police when he first contacted them Friday
that his wife and Kenny left with a man named Lucky Skaggs in
August while Shirley was in jail on spouse abuse and bad check
charges.
   After Shirley gave police Kenny's birth certificate, officials
at the Pasco County Medical Center compared Kenny's footprints with
birth records on file at the hospital. The records show that Kenny
was born on Aug. 19, 1986.
   Shortly after the boy was found, a drunken man reported to
police he had lost ``little Kenny,'' and told a hard-to-follow
story about being given the boy at a skid-row bar.
   Skaggs, in the company of a woman named Mary, according to the
report, left the child in a Lakeland bar and went to Washington
state on a borrowed motorcycle. Police say the owner of the
motorcycle has since filed a report on the bike because it has not
been returned.
   Lakeland police say there is no new information in their effort
to locate the child's mother or Skaggs.
   ``I'd be interested in speaking to the mother,'' said Watson,
but added there have been no charges filed against her.
   Pasco County deputies tried on Monday and Tuesday to arrest
Shirley on outstanding warrants related to driving while
intoxicated and failure to complete more than 30 days in jail.
   Deputies have been unable to contact him at home. He works out
of town as a carpenter, they said.
   A woman who showed up in Bartow on Thursday asking for custody,
claiming to be the child's maternal grandmother, was arrested
Friday in Naples on Washington state grand theft and fraud charges
involving about $110,000 in cash and merchandise.
   Diane Pierce, a child protection supervisor for the state's
Health and Rehabilitative Services in Bartow, said she can't say
how the arrests will affect the child's future.
   Besides Shirley, his parents and his mother-in-law, a maternal
aunt in Texas have asked for custody. Home studies will be made to
consider all custody requests by relatives, Ms. Pierce said.
   The boy continues to live with a family licensed by the state
agency as an emergency shelter.

   Sandinista police thwarted an
anti-government rally by rounding up more than 25 opposition
leaders Wednesday, and the leftist government restricted the news
operations of several radio stations.
   Radio Corporacion was closed for 24 hours while Radio Mundial
and Radio Catolica were barred from regular news programming for
eight days. The government said they had been broadcasting ``false
news'' related to a strike.
   The actions came on the ninth day of a hunger strike by about 30
construction workers and auto mechanics who are demanding higher
pay. Union officials said 4,500 workers remained off the job
Wednesday, more than two months after their strike began.
   Lorena Obando, a member of the Social Democratic Party, said
police in military and civilian vehicles picked up 25 members of 14
opposition political parties, ranging from the rightist Social
Christians to the Communists.
   They had gathered at the Social Democrats' office and were
preparing to leave for the General Workers Federation building
about a mile away, where the hunger strikers were holed up. The
opposition leaders had planned to hold a rally at about noon, but
it did not take place.
   An Interior Ministry spokeswoman, Alma Morales, later said the
group ``was invited'' to meet with Cmdr. Doris Tijerino, head of
the Sandinista police, and taken by bus to meet the commander. She
did not elaborate.
   Police also detained two opposition leaders _ Augustin Jarquin
Anaya and Armando Guadamuz, both of the Social Christian Party _ as
they arrived at the Workers Federation headquarters.
   ``This is the repressive customs of the (Sandinista) Front,''
Guadamuz said before the police led him away. ``They are violent by
tradition.''
   More than 40 people have been taken into police custody in
connection with the hunger strike since it began April 25.
   Police cordoned off the front of the Workers Federation building
and officers ringed the area. Reinforcements waited in military
trucks.
   The protesting workers stood behind locked gates.
   At one point, the police pushed several journalists and demanded
they move to another area.
   Under an Interior Ministry order issued late Tuesday, Radio
Corporacion was shut down immediately and Radio Mundial and Radio
Catolica, a Roman Catholic radio station, had their news broadcasts
restricted.
   Jose Castillo Osejo, director of Radio Corporacion, was punched
in the mouth by Interior Minister Tomas Borge last week because the
station broadcast what Borge said was incorrect information about
the fast, according to Barricada, the official Sandinista newspaper.
   Radio Catolica had been shut down for almost two years for
failing to broadcast the president's end-of-year message in 1985.
   The only opposition newspaper, La Prensa, was shuttered on June
26, 1986, for 15 months.
   Press restrictions were common under a state of emergency
enacted by the government in March 1982, four months after the war
began with the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras.
   President Daniel Ortega lifted those restrictions in January to
comply with a regional peace plan signed in August by five Central
American presidents.
   The Workers Federation, a coalition of socialist unions, said
4,500 construction workers and car mechanics went on strike Feb. 25
to demand higher salaries and better working conditions.
   Borge has said only 400 workers are on strike.
   The interior minister, during an interview late Tuesday, said
the strike was ``political and exaggerated.'' He defended the
police actions, saying: ``Our police are absolutely
anti-repression. They never are abusive, or use torture or murder.''

   A spill of 28,000 gallons of acid into a
Gulf Coast shipping channel has killed thousands of fish and left
environmental officials threatening to shut the plant responsible.
   The phosphoric acid that spilled into the 30-foot-deep mouth of
the Alafia River was a 54 percent concentration, according to
Gardinier Inc., which reported the spill soon after it occurred
Sunday.
   ``That's real strong. It would burn you badly,'' said Roger
Stewart, Hillsborough County Environmental Protection Commission
director.
   Gardinier, a subsidiary of Cargill Inc. of Minnesota that makes
fertilizer from the acid, reported the spill from a storage tank
Sunday by leaving a message on the commission's telephone answering
machine.
   ``The company said there's nothing wrong,'' Stewart said. But
Tuesday, thousands of fish and other wildlife, including blue
crabs, flounder and ray, were floating dead on the water.
   ``The time has come for that plant to shut down. I've got an
attorney working on that,'' said Stewart, adding that Environmental
Protection Agency officials were en route to the scene from Atlanta
on Wednesday.
   Stewart said experts had not decided whether to let the acid
dissolve or churn up the brackish, 3,000-foot-wide mouth of the
river to dilute the acid with seawater.
   The acid overflowed Sunday from one of Gardinier's 5,500-ton
tanks, said Gray Gordon, the plant's vice president for industrial
relations. Company engineers estimated 200 tons of the acid spilled
into the river, he said.
   Gordon said a plant operator was trying to pump the liquid from
a tank to another area where it would be mixed with phosphate rock.
Instead, an open valve that the operator thought was closed allowed
the liquid to flow into another tank, causing it to spill over,
Gordon said.
   Company officials at first thought the acid was trapped in a
retention pond around the tank, Gordon said.
   Residents fishing near the plant Monday and Tuesday said they
noticed milky-colored water and dead fish and crabs in the river
and called the commission.
   The county recently cited Gardinier after a cloud of sulfur
dioxide and ammonia sickened residents and diners in a restaurant
across the river April 7. The company, which was cited for not
notifying the county, blamed the leak on an improperly programmed
computer that opens and closes valves.
   After heavy rains in 1987, storm-water retention ponds
overflowed and Gardinier dumped 13.7 million gallons of acidic
waste into Hillsborough Bay. The spill resulted in a massive fish
kill, and the state fined Gardinier $200,000.

   The average full professor at an American
college or university now earns $47,400, a faculty organization
said Wednesday.
   The American Association of University Professors said that
campus salaries rose by 4.9 percent in 1987-88, compared to 5.9
percent the year before.
   Across all faculty ranks, the average salary was $37,000.
   The association, which conducts collective bargaining on some
campuses, said that after inflation, faculty salaries rose in real
terms by just 0.9 percent.
   Based on figures compiled from more than 1,900 institutions with
300,000 full-time faculty members, it said the average salaries
were:
   _$47,400 for full professors;
   _$35,300 for associate professors;
   _$29,200 for assistant professors;
   _$25,470 for lecturers;
   _$22,090 for instructors.
   It was the third consecutive year that the rate of increase fell
below the previous year's increase.
   The association said that faculty salaries vary widely by
region, with full professors averaging $52,510 on the West Coast
and Hawaii, and less than $42,000 in some Southern and Central
states.
   Across all faculty ranks, the average salary ranged from a high
of $43,590 on the West Coast and Hawaii to a low of $32,720 in
Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee.
   Salaries rose 5.6 percent at private, independent colleges and
universities, compared with 4.7 percent at public and
church-related campuses.

<HEAD>Drexel Burnham Says It Will Prohibit Employees from Buying Some
Junk Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. told Congress on
Wednesday that it will stop allowing its employees to buy junk
bonds the firm underwrites, a practice that had been criticized as
unfair and possibly illegal.
   Drexel chief executive Frederick Joseph informed Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., by telephone that the firm was stopping purchases
of new issues by so-called ``insider accounts,'' which had been the
focus of congressional hearings last week, said Dennis Fitzgibbons,
Dingell's spokesman.
   Drexel, which was instrumental in developing the market for
high-yield, high-risk ``junk'' bonds, had allowed employees and
partnerships formed by employees to buy bonds from hot new issues
even though that sometimes denied public customers the opportunity
to buy all of the bonds they wanted.
   Dingell, who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, had raised questions about the legality of the trading
and its fairness to the customers.
   Employees, according to the committee, were able to make
substantial profits by purchasing newly issued bonds from the firm
and holding them for several weeks or months and then reselling
them.
   Joseph, in 6{ hours of hearings last Thursday, defended the
practice as perfectly proper, saying bond prices were not as
subject to manipulation in the same way as stock prices. But he had
acknowledged that he was troubled by the appearance of a conflict.
   Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman in New York, said the firm
was barring employees and employee partnerships from buying new
public issues of debt securities ``to avoid any appearance of
possible unfairness.''
   Dingell praised the decision as ``a very good step,'' adding in
a statement, ``It should lay to rest questions associated with the
fairness and legality of that particular practice. ... Drexel's
decision is both good from the standpoint of the public interest
and wise.''
   However, Fitzgibbons said Dingell has made no decision regarding
his committee's ongoing investigation of Drexel.
   Dingell has been criticized by Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., for
subpoenaing Michael Milken, chief of Drexel's Beverly Hills,
Calif., junk bond unit, to appear before the committee even though
Milken had indicated in advance that he would refuse to testify
based on his constitutional protection from self incrimination.
   Dingell said the firm's retreat ``indicates that the behavior of
the committee was correct and fair in bringing these matters to
light.''

   Shipping executives said Wednesday that
U.S. and British warships were investigating reports of Iranian
vessels sowing mines off the United Arab Emirates, but there was no
confirmation any were found.
   Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, met with senior Bahrain government officials on the second
day of a visit to the Persian Gulf, where Iran and Iraq have been
at war since September 1980.
   Iran claimed its anti-aircraft batteries shot down three Iraqi
warplanes during air raids, the first reported since an informal
truce halted attacks on cities two weeks ago.
   Shipping executives said a civilian helicopter pilot reported
Tuesday seeing two ships thought to be Iranian between Das island,
an oil terminal off the Emirates, and the Iran-owned Sassan
platform that U.S. forces destroyed April 18.
   His report raised fears the ships were sowing mines.
   Das Island, 80 miles offshore and 30 miles from Sassan, is run
by British Petroleum and connects with pipelines from two offshore
Emirates fields, Umm al-Shaif and Zakum.
   The executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
pilot described one ship as a ``landing craft'' and the other as
resembling a frigate, but could identify neither.
   A reported mine sighting in the same area a week ago turned out
to be dead sheep floating with hooves in the air, a fairly common
sight in the gulf.
   Crowe met with Bahrain's prime minister, Sheik Khalifa Bin
Salman Khalifa, about ``bilateral relations, current developments
and issues of mutual interest,'' the Gulf News Agency reported.
   Also present were the foreign, defense and interior ministers
and Bahrain's military commander. Crowe was accompanied by U.S.
Ambassador Sam H. Zakhem.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said two
French-built Mirage F-1s were shot down during one of two Iraqi
raids on Shiraz, southwestern Iran. It said several people were
killed.
   Tehran radio said a third Iraqi jet was shot down, but gave no
details.

   Afghanistan has asked the world to help it
repair the damage of war and resettle millions of refugees.
Neighboring Pakistan, where most of the refugees live, called the
request a propaganda tactic.
   Pakistan and the United States armed and supported Moslem rebels
who have fought Soviet-supported governments since a Communist coup
in April 1978.
   The Kremlin has had military forces in Afghanistan since
December 1979, but has agreed to withdraw its estimated 115,000
soldiers in nine months beginning May 15.
   ``Pakistan will support aid for the people of Afghanistan at the
proper time but this is not the appropriate time, while Soviet
troops have not started to withdraw,'' Mansoor Suhail, press
spokesman for the Pakistani U.N. mission, said Wednesday.
   He called the Afghan request ``a propaganda tactic to seek
legitimacy of the Kabul regime which was installed by the Soviet
Union ... a regime which is not acceptable to the people of
Afghanistan.''
   More than 5 million Afghans, about one-third of the population,
have fled their country since the civil war began. At least 3
million live in border camps and cities in Pakistan that serve as
bases and supply points for the guerrillas.
   Afghanistan's ambassador, Shah Mohammad Dost, asked the Economic
and Social Council for urgent consideration of the request for
assistance after the Soviets leave, but did not name a figure.
   The council, which held its first meeting of 1988 on Tuesday,
will consider next week whether to put the question on its agenda.
   Dost said in a letter to the secretary-general and council that
the withdrawal agreement, mediated by the United Nations and signed
April 14 in Geneva, paved the way for normalizing the situation in
and around Afghanistan.
   ``This enables the government of Afghanistan to embark upon a
huge reconstruction effort to undo the enormous damage inflicted by
the war and to resettle the Afghan refugees returning to their
country,'' he said.
   ``Such an effort is beyond the domestic means available to
Afghanistan and requires the assistance of this world body.''
   The 18-member Economic and Social Council makes recommendations
to the General Assembly, which has voted overwhelmingly every year
for withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.

<HEAD>Astronomers Find Lightest Weight Star Yet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A star that may be the least massive ever
found has been located by three Princeton University
astrophysicists at a point 3,000 light years across the Milky Way.
   The star was discovered when it repeatedly eclipsed a heavier,
rapidly spinning companion pulsar star, the National Science
Foundation announced Wednesday.
   Discoverers of the pair of stars were Andrew S. Fruchter, Daniel
R. Stinebring and Joseph H. Taylor, all of the physics department
at Princeton.
   The astronomers said the dwarf star interrupts or eclipses the
radio signals from the pulsar star at regular intervals as the two
stars circle each other every nine hours and 10 minutes.
Measurements of this interval helped determine the size of the two
stars.
   ``The dwarf star is possibly the smallest star ever seen,''
Stinebring said in the NSF announcement. ``It's also unlike typical
stars in that it does not shine by its own nuclear reactions. Nor
is it anything like a planet.''
   He said the pulsar star, which is much heavier though smaller in
circumference than the dwarf star, is spinning at the rate of 622
times per second. This is the second-fastest spin of the 440 known
pulsars. The fastest rotates at 642 times per second.
   Pulsars are small, dense stars thought to be remnants of
exploded stars, or supernovas. Pulsars emit radio signals that are
pulsed by their rotation.
   The pair of unusual stars was discovered using the world's most
powerful radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.
   The pulsar was first seen March 3 by Fruchter. Two weeks later,
the Princeton team discovered that the pulsar signal was
interrupted for 50 minutes during each pulsar orbit.
   By carefully measuring the eclipse, the team discovered that the
dwarf star is about 50 percent larger in circumference than the
sun, but has only about 2 per cent of the sun's mass.
   Stinebring said this means that the dwarf star is only 25 times
more massive than Jupiter, the largest of the sun's planets.

   Jesse Jackson on Wednesday met with advisers,
liberal activists and congrssional Democrats as he vowed to
continue his campaign for the presidential nomination despite his
fading delegate count.
   Turning his attention to the West and the delegate-rich
California contest on June 7, Jackson held meetings with a group of
Congress members from western states and with some 50 or 60 members
of the House Democratic Caucus, with his advisers and with a group
of representatives from liberal organizations.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said Jackson gave ``pep talks'' and
heard reports about what's going on with various interest groups,
including consumer and peace organizations, as he headed down the
home stretch of the primary campaign.
   Rangel said there is no intention to ``work any less'' in the
face of Gov. Michael Dukakis' widening lead. He said the Jackson
camp sees no reason to ease up on criticism of Dukakis in the
interest of party unity, and that Jackson supporters will be ready
to make their wishes known at the convention.
   ``There's no marriage unless we get to the wedding,'' he said.
   Jackson's heavy losses to Dukakis in Ohio and Indiana on
Tuesday, and his runaway victory in the District of Columbia left
the delegate count at 927 for Jackson to 1,500 for Dukakis.
   The seven states remaining on the primary calendar hold 577
delegates, including 314 in California and 109 in New Jersey.
   Meanwhile, Jackson aide Frank Watkins said Wednesday that he
apparently made a mistake in saying that Jackson received about
$46,000 in consulting wages from entertainer Bill Cosby last year.
   ``That was my mistake. They have not paid him any money. They
(Cosby, through his production company) have paid money to
Personalities International. I don't know the details of that,''
Watkins said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
   Personalities International, Inc., a company headed by Jackson's
wife, received payments for his other speaking engagements and
publications. The company paid Jackson $159,000 as an employee and
consultant last year, according to the tax forms.
   Watkins said he did not know how much Cosby's production company
gave the firm or what the payment was for, and said any details
would have to come in writing from Jackson's lawyer John Bustamante
or his accounting firm, Washington, Pittman and McKeever. Neither
Bustamante nor the accounting firm immediately returned messages
left at their Chicago offices Wednesday evening.
   The discrepancy arose when Cosby, through a spokesman, disputed
Watkins' explanation Tuesday of the $46,535 business services
income reported on Jackson's 1987 tax return. Watkins said then it
was mainly consulting fees paid by Cosby.
   Meanwhile, Jackson, who has made a point of stressing party
unity, said at a news conference that he is not happy with the
delegate-selection process in some states, but did not specifically
say he would challenge it.
   He said Dukakis leads him by only 8 percentage points in the
popular vote, and that margin should be reflected in the voting by
super delegates _ those delegates selected by virtue of holding
important party positions or public office.
   ``The super delegates will do America a super favor by not
interfering in the process. ... I simply want fairness,'' he said.
   The super delegate system allows those delegates to back the
candidate of their choosing, but Jackson said they should follow
the popular vote, suggesting they should not try to settle the
nomination before the primary season is over.
   ``We're within striking distance,'' Jackson said. ``It's not
over really till it's over.''
   ``The party machinery is saying, in fact, go for Dukakis. The
pundits are saying go for Dukakis. In some sense, the super
delegates are moving in that direction and so against the party,
the pundits, the press. We press on against those odds,'' he said.
``We're not about to turn back.''
   The Democratic Caucus chairman, former presidential candidate
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, said ``everyone admires the
grace and tone'' with which Jackson has conducted his campaign, and
characterized the morning meeting as `'warm and successful.''
   In his meeting with 13 Democratic members of Congress who are
part of a ``Go West '88'' group, Jackson discussed issues of
concern to western states.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., an organizer of the group, said they
talked about trade, drugs, immigration and energy.
   ``He made it clear trade expansion was something very important
on his agenda,'' said Wyden, who told reporters the sessiom was ``a
very positive kind of discussion.''

   Three thunderous explosions destroyed a
space shuttle fuel plnt and a candy factory Wednesday, generating a
five-square-mile toxic cloud, injuring more than 150 people and
leaving others unaccounted for, authorities said.
   Because of toxic smoke and flames, it was not immediately known
whether all the workers at the plants escaped. Authorities
initially said one person had died, and there were unconfirmed
reports nine people had died, said Mike Cool, assistant Clark
County manager. Gov. Richard Bryan later said there were no
confirmed deaths, although two people were missing.
   Flames and orange smoke rose into the sky, and buildings shook
10 miles away in Las Vegas after the midday explosions at the
Pacific Engineering & Production Co. in the southern Nevada
community of Henderson.
   ``It flipped cars over, knocked pedestrians to the ground and
windows in the whole town shattered,'' said Susan Russo, 37, of
Henderson, who was getting gasoline when the blasts occurred.
   ``We have tried to count noses. We're uncertain whether we've
accounted for everyone. What we see is pretty much total
devastation,'' said Fred Gibson, Pacific spokesman.
   All roads to Henderson, a town of 54,590 people midway between
Las Vegas and Hoover Dam, were closed. Residents were told to keep
windows closed against the toxic cloud.
   Two of the blasts, which leveled the fuel plant and the Kidd &
Co. marshmallow factory next door, registered on earthquake
seismographs 200 miles away at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena, Calif., said spokesman Bob Finn.
   The first blast, at 11:53 a.m., measured about 3.0 on the
Richter scale of ground motion; the second at 11:57 a.m. had a
magnitude of 3.5. ``I find that absolutely amazing. That is
extremely powerful,'' said Finn.
   The fuel plant manufactures ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer
used in fuel for the shuttle's solid rocket boosters, but NASA said
the accident was not expected to delay resumption of shuttle
flights.
   The explosions followed a fire that began when ``one of our
pieces of equipment malfunctioned,'' Gibson said. ``The fire spread
quickly and there was an explosion.'' At least two blasts followed
shortly.
   More than 150 people were injured at the plants and in
surrounding neighborhoods, according to tallies from hospitals.
Most had cuts and bruises from flying glass and debris. Others
suffered burns, broken bones or shock.
   Firefighters were unable to enter the site for nearly three
hours after the explosions because of the threat of additional
blasts and the toxic cloud.
   Two hundred people were believed to be at the fuel plant at the
time of the blasts, said Clark County spokeswoman Lisa Godwin. The
candy plant employed 85 people, but few employees of either plant
had been seen at hospitals, authorities said.
   ``There are people out there who are probably dying,'' said
Janet Smith, a spokeswoman for Mercy Ambulance in Las Vegas, which
sent ambulances to the site. ``People are out there on the desert
wandering aimlessly'' if they escaped, she said.
   The toxic cloud, five miles square and moving to the northeast,
contained hydrochloric acid and ``it is very important that no one
be within five miles of the smoke or fire,'' said Doug Bradford, a
spokesman for the city of Las Vegas. ``The strategy is to let it
(the plant fire) burn.''
   Hospitals reported treating at least 154 people, and at least
four were in critical condition.
   More than 70 residents of the Glen Halla Nursing Home, two miles
from the blast, were evacuated to the Las Vegas Convention Center,
after the explosion damaged their building, officials said.
   Emergency workers warned residents away from the area as smoke
billowed across the entire Las Vegas Valley. All area schools were
evacuated, and United Blood Services of Las Vegas appealed for
emergency contributions.
   ``Our windows blew out. It blew the frame off the door. We are
probably five or six miles away,'' said Lee Hall, secretary at the
Henderson Convalescent Hospital.
   NASA said in Washington that Pacific Engineering provides the
ammonium perchlorate to Morton Thiokol, NASA's prime contractor for
the motors, as well as to some Department of Defense programs.
   Don Amitor, a spokesman for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., said Morton-Thiokol had enough ammonium
perchlorate in supply for the next five shuttle launches. Under the
present schedule, the fifth launch would be in mid-1989.
   Pacific is one of two companies that supply ammonium perchlorate
for all U.S. solid fuel rocket engines, including the space
shuttle, Minuteman and Titan projects. The other is Kerr-McGee,
also near Las Vegas.
   The Pentagon said Pacific received no Department of Defense
contracts in fiscal 1988, although they had two in 1987, totaling
$675,000.
   ``Currently, we have no information that Department of Defense
work is in any way related to the fire,'' the Pentagon said in a
statment.
   Kidd, based in Ligonier, Ind., expanded to the Gibson Business
Park and opened its 36,500-square-foot plant about two years ago.

   Dall Forsythe, son of ``Dynasty'' television
star John Forsythe, is getting his own dynasty of sorts _ New York
state's budget.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo on Wednesday named him budget director.
   Forsythe, whose mother is actress Parker McCormick, succeeds R.
Wayne Diesel, who announced his resignation last week to join an
investment bank. Forsythe joined the Cuomo administration as deputy
budget director in January 1986 and became director of Cuomo's
Office of Management and Productivity in September.
   He had previously worked at Shearson Lehman Brothers as a senior
vice president for investment banking and has a doctorate in
political science from Columbia University and has taught political
science and finance at Columbia.
   Forsythe, 45, will be paid $92,059.
   The budget director is the governor's chief fiscal adviser and
is largely responsible for handling the executive branch's end of
state budget negotiations. The budget director also is largely
responsible for formulating the governor's annual budget proposal.

   Congress refused to go along Wednesday with a
Reagan administration plan to negotiate with a private firm for
lease on a space factory that would be put in orbit by the space
shuttle and serviced periodically by astronauts.
   The House space science subcommittee, in an action approved by a
voice vote, said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
may call for bids on a so-called Commercially Developed Space
Facility, but that it cannot award contracts without the express
permission of Congress.
   The committee's instructions are part of a bill that would
authorize $11.5 billion to be spent by NASA in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. It requires NASA to submit the results of its
request for proposals to Congress before the next presidential
budget message next January or February.
   President Reagan's new space policy, announced in February,
included ``an intent for the federal government to lease space as
an anchor tenant in an orbiting space facility ... that is
financed, constructed and operated by the private sector.''
   NASA, which had strongly opposed such a facility until that
time, came to Congress and said it would lease 70 percent of the
factory for five years at $140 million a year. The agency declared
its intent to issue requests for proposals within two months,
saying the facility was needed to bridge the time span until a
space station is in orbit in the mid-1990s.
   A Houston firm, Space Industries, Inc., has designed such a
robot space factory, but the House subcommittee specified that
proposals must be submitted by more than one company.
   Some critics see any government agreement for the Commercially
Developed Space Facility as usurping funds and thus killing the
space station, and the space subcommittee specified in its bill
that the money for the facility must not come out of funds for
other projects.
   Last Friday, four influential members of the Senate Commerce
Committee sent a letter to NASA administrator James C. Fletcher
saying they will not permit NASA to enter into a lease in the next
fiscal year and that they object to even a request for a proposal.
   Their argument _ that the idea had not been studied sufficiently
and its need had not been established _ was carried on in the House
subcommittee hearing. The subcommittee, however, voted 18-8 against
a proposal that would have shelved the idea completely until next
year.

<HEAD>Church Trying To End Hunger Strike By Thousands Before Pope's
Visit</HEAD>

   Roman Catholic leaders are trying to
negotiate an end to a hunger strike by at least 5,000 workers and
students before Pope John Paul arrives next Monday on his first
visit to Bolivia.
   The hunger strikers, who began their fast last week, oppose
government economic programs and demand higher wages. Hundreds of
students and workers have marched through the streets of La Paz
almost daily in anti-government protests.
   Interior Minister Juan Carlos Duran said extreme leftist groups
organized the hunger strike and the protest marches to create ``a
climate of social unrest that will show a distorted image of
Bolivia when the pope arrives.''
   On Pope Paul's five-day visit here next week, he will travel
from the 13,000-foot-high city of La Paz to the lowlands and will
meet miners, farmers, and Indians as well as church and government
officials.
   Church officials here are also trying to soft-pedal a letter
sent by a group of Bolivian priests to the Vatican last month
protesting the appointment of foreign bishops.
   ``It seems strange to us that after nearly half a century of
evangelization in America, we must still import the ecclesiastical
hierarchy to teach, santify and rule Christians in Bolivia,'' said
the letter.
   The protests originated after three foreign bishops were named
in April to run dioceses in La Paz.
   According to figures released by the church, 634 of the 834
priests working in Bolivia are foreigners, as are 17 of the 29
bishops.
   Church officials have been meeting with leaders of the Bolivian
Workers Central trying to resolve the hunger strike.
   The Workers Central represents most workers in Bolivia. Its
secretary-general, Simon Reyes, says, ``The situation of hunger and
misery can no longer be supported and for this reason the protests
will continue until our demands are met. We cannot hide the
dramatic reality, economic and social reality, from the eyes of the
pope.''
   The Workers Central demands a wage increase higher than the 10
to 20 percent given by the government last month. With the increase
the minimum monthly wage is $35. The Workers Central says a worker
needs 10 times that amount to subsist.
   The Workers Central also demands bigger budgets for health and
education. The Vatican ambassador to Bolivia, the Rev. Santos Abril
y Castello, said ``the Roman Catholic Church sees with great
preoccupation how the social situation in Bolivia could tarnish the
visit of the Holy Father.''

   When the explosions at a fuel plant
jolted nearby casinos Wednesday, some gamblers packing roulette and
card tables rushed to cash in their chips before evacuating,
officials said.
   After the first blast, ``people still played, they didn't want
to leave, but after the second blast, everybody took it
seriously,'' said shift manager Paul Naujokas at El Dorado casino
in Henderson.
   The building rattled, the glass front door shattered, and
ceiling tiles were knocked down, he said.
   Some of the 60 to 70 card players and slot machine users cashed
in their chips before evacuating the building, which is about two
miles from the plant, Naujokas said.
   The casino closed for about three hours.
   ``The place (Rainbow casino) across the street never closed,''
Naujokas added.
   Hundreds of people were routed from their tables for about 15
minutes at Sam's Town, a casino-hotel-restaurant complex about
seven miles northwest of Henderson, said Shelley Roberts, acting
director of advertising.
   An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people were at the complex when the
building shook slightly. Fire alarms ushered them outside.
   ``No one quite understood what was going on until they got
outside, and then it was obvious, you could just look at the
skyline,'' Ms. Roberts said. ``I never heard one person complain
that it interrupted their bingo and their Keno.''
   The gamblers, mostly local residents, returned to their games
after the evacuation.
   ``It doesn't seem to bother them. It was like a thunderstorm
that just came and went,'' said employee Beverly Armengo.

<HEAD>South Africa, Cuba and Angola In Peace ``Step,'' Says U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South Africa, Cuba and Angola made progress in
U.S.-sponsored negotiations on ending the civil war in Angola and
will meet again in Africa within weeks, the United States announced
Wednesday.
   Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, said the agreement to meet again was ``an important step''
toward getting Cuban and South African troops to withdraw from
Angola and securing independence for South African-controlled
Namibia, or South-West Africa.
   ``We were impressed by the tone of the discussions, by the
absence of polemics and the iterations of seriousness,'' Crocker
said of the unprecedented meeting between South Africa's white
generals and the Cuban and Angolan leaders.
   Crocker also raised the prospect of the United States and Soviet
Union guaranteeing an eventual settlement similar to the deal for
the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   ``But it is fair to be skeptical,'' Crocker told a news
conference at the U.S. Embassy at the end of the two-day talks.
``There are big, tough issues that lie ahead. Gaps need to be
bridged. We do not think they should be unbridgeable.''
   The place and date for the talks in Africa has not been decided,
Crocker said.
   He said the talks at a London hotel focused on an Angolan
proposal put forward in March for about 40,000 Cuban troops to
leave Angola in a phased withdrawal, while South Africa pulled its
forces out of Angola and Namibia. No specific timetable for the
withdrawal was described.
   The Cubans went to Angola in 1975 to defend the Marxist
government against pro-Western rebels of UNITA, the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola. The United States aids UNITA.
   South African troops are in southern Angola to back UNITA and
attack bases of the South-West African People's Organization, or
SWAPO, which is fighting for Namibian independence.
   In past months, fighting has intensified around the strategic
southern city of Cuito Cuanvale, where Angolan and Cuban forces are
apparently hanging on under attack from UNITA and South Africans.
   South Africa, which has acknowledged 50 servicemen killed in
Angola in recent months, says it has up to 3,000 troops in the
country. Angola says 9,000 South Africans are there with heavy
artillery.
   Crocker said the talks reflected improved U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``There may be a mutual recognition that it could be useful if
the difficulties in these negotiations are addressed periodically .
.. between us and the Soviets and some effort made to explore how
it might be possible for our two countries to support a
settlement,'' he said.
   The talks took place after Crocker conferred in London last week
with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamishin.
   UNITA and SWAPO were not invited to the discussions which
Crocker described as confined to ``sovereign governments.'' He
added that U.S. support for UNITA continued and was not part of the
negotiations.
   The United States has been trying for eight years to get the
Cubans out of Angola. Cuba and Angola, backed by the Soviets, have
demanded a South African withdrawal Angola and independence for
Namibia.
   Previous settlements have foundered partly on U.S. support for
South Africa's argument that it cannot accede to United Nations
demands for pre-independence elections in Namibia while Cuban
troops remain in neighboring Angola.
   Earlier, the United States, South Africa, Cuba and Angola issued
a joint statement saying: ``The meeting took place in a
constructive atmosphere and progress was made.''

   Rain drenched parts of the Ohio Valley and Southeast on
Wednesday, while much of the rest of the nation enjoyed pretty
spring weather.
   Thunderstorms ranged across Kentucky and Tennessee and produced
small hail at Somerset, Ky. Thunderstorms also developed over
Alabama and Georgia Wednesday morning and across the Carolinas in
the afternoon. Marble-size hail was reported west of Raleigh, N.C.
   Elsewhere along the East Coast, showers and a few thunderstorms
were found in southeast Florida, from eastern Maryland to southern
New Jersey and central New England.
   Showers were widely scattered from Idaho across Washington and
Oregon to Northern California. Small hail was reported with a
thunderstorm at Burney, Calif. Snow fell at Klamath Falls, Ore.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included an inch at Louisville, seven-tenths of an inch at
Knoxville, Tenn., and London, Ky., and about a half-inch at
Lexington, Ky.; Charleston, W.Va.; and Atlanta.
   Gusty wind developed in parts of the Southwest. Around midday
Wednesday, gusts to 43 mph were clocked at Ely, Nev., and 35 to 40
mph at Desert Rock, Nev.; Milford, Utah; San Nicolas Naval Air
Station, Calif., and San Francisco.
   Much of the nation, including the Midwest and Great Lakes
region, had sunshine and mild temperatures. Early-afternoon
temperatures approached 80 in central Minnesota, while the northern
and central Plains had 40s and 50s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT Wednesday ranged
from 40 degrees at Klamath Falls, Ore., to 89 degrees at Gila Bend,
Ariz., and Harlingen, Texas. The nation's morning low was 20
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
the Carolinas to New York and across the central Appalachians to
the upper Ohio Valley. Showers and a few thunderstorms were
forecast from eastern Montana across the northern Rockies to Idaho
and along the West Coast, with scattered snow showers in northern
Nevada.
   Temperatures were predicted to rise into the 50s along the
northern Pacific Coast, upper 40s and 50s from northern Nevada
across parts of Utah to northern Arizona, 80s and some 90s in the
southernmost states and 60s or 70s elsewhere.

   The State Department has never filed an
official protest with the South Korean government over evidence
that American-designed M-16 rifles built in Korea have been sold to
foreign countries in violation of a U.S.-Korean agreement,
according to a General Accounting Office report.
   GAO found that there was little U.S. oversight of the program
and confusion over which government agency should be in charge of
the 1971 pact, which banned sales to foreign nations without U.S.
permission and placed a cap on the number of rifles Korea could
produce.
   When presented with evidence of illegal foreign sales, U.S.
officials usually instructed embassy officials to remind Korea of
the ``seriousness'' of such sales. A strong, official government
protest was never lodged, GAO said.
   The agreement included Colt Industries Firearms Division of
Hartford, Conn., which set up the Korean rifle plant in exchange
for per-weapon royalties.
   Government officials told GAO investigators that the program's
management ``was left largely to Colt.''
   A State Department official close to the M-16 program agreed
there was some confusion over ``who was supposed to be watching
every element of implementation and how much day-to-day watching
was appropriate.'' The official said a ``more meticulous accounting
arrangement'' may be necessary in the future.
   But the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
defended the government's actions in following up on illegal sale
evidence, saying an official government protest was not necessary
and that reminding Korean officials of the agreement had been
successful.
   Colt sued Korea after the Connecticut company stopped receiving
royalties in 1982. That was the year the Korean government, which
operated the plant, turned over ownership to Daewoo Precision
Instruments, a private company.
   The GAO report, a copy of which was obtained Wednesday by The
Associated Press, said records show that Korea produced more M-16
rifles and spare parts than allowed under the agreement. It also
found that M-16s and parts were sold to third parties without U.S.
permission, a violation of the agreement.
   The third-party nations were not mentioned in the report, which
was declassified. A Colt official said Tuesday that the company had
evidence of M-16 sales to Indonesia.
   Sukhan Kim, a Washington attorney representing the Korean
Defense Ministry in the Colt suit, said Korean officials have told
him neither the government nor Daewoo has sold M-16s or parts to
other countries or violated the production cap.
   He declined further comment, citing the pending litigation.

   Pacific Engineering and Production Co.
had a good safety record, a state official said Wednesday, after a
series of explosions leveled the plant and a factory next door.
   Mike Tyler, administrator of the state Occupational Safety and
Health Division, said his division will investigate the explosion,
which plant officials said followed a fire.
   ``We investigate any catastrophe,'' said Tyler. ``We would be
looking for safety and health violations. If there were any
violations, we would cite them.''
   The division's maximum penalty is a fine of $10,000 and up to
six months in jail for each violation. A final decision on fines is
made by Tyler's boss, state Industrial Relations Director Jim
Barnes.
   Tyler and Barnes said they are barred by law from discussing
safety problems of companies. But Laury Lewis, general manager of
the State Industrial Insurance System, said his records indicate
Pacific Engineering ``has always been a pretty good risk.''
   Pacific Engineering, owned by state Sen. Jim Gibson and his
brother Fred Gibson, has been in business ``a long time and they
have had no previous multiple injury problems or explosions at all,
as far as I know,'' Lewis said.
   The space shuttle fuel plant was established in 1959. It
manufactures ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in fuel for the
shuttle's solid rocket boosters, but NASA said the accident was not
expected to delay resumption of shuttle flights.
   SIIS handles claims for insurance benefits from workers injured
at work.
   Gov. Dick Bryan said he has dispatched all state agencies for
immediate response, including the Employment Security Department
which must process applications for jobless relief from workers who
had been employed at Pacific and at a nearby marshmallow factory
also destroyed in the blast.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham on Wednesday
refused to relinquish the $92,000 protocol fund that figured
prominently in his impeachment trial, and his successor said she
will sue to get it back.
   ``The people who put it in (the fund) said it belongs to me,''
said the former Republican governor. ``If we go by the intent of
the giver, well, it's mine.''
   On April 4, the Senate convicted Mecham of misusing $80,000 from
the fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. He also was
convicted of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death
threat. Upon conviction he was removed from office.
   On Tuesday, Attorney General Bob Corbin released a letter in
which he gave Mecham until 5 p.m. Wednesday to return the money to
the office of Gov. Rose Mofford. The deadline passed without action
by Mecham.
   Mrs. Mofford and Corbin both said the Senate essentially
determined the protocol fund was state money when it convicted
Mecham if misusing it.
   Mrs. Mofford said before the deadline that she will sue to get
the money back. She said she will put the money in the state
general fund.
   The former governor said in a telephone interview he was looking
forward to a lawsuit to determine whether he or the state owns the
money.
   The fund was created with receipts from Mecham's inaugural ball
in 1987.
   After it was determined under state law that the money could not
be used to pay off campaign debts, the Maricopa County attorney and
the inaugural reached an agreement to put the money into a fund to
finance things like receptions and gifts for visiting dignitaries.
   Mecham said Wednesday some of the money was spent, but he would
not say how much of the $92,000 was left.
   The former governor also faces a May 19 trial on felony charges
of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.

<TEXT>
   An amateur radio buff was convicted
Wednesday of sending a false distress report that prompted an
all-out search for a downed plane Jan. 8 at the height of one of
the worst snowstorms of the year.
   A U.S. District Court jury deliberated two hours before finding
Mark Blair guilty of making a false report to the government.
Blair, 29, could receive up to five years in prison at sentencing
July 1.
   ``Imagine the power he felt making this Navy plane run east to
west and north to south,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Papps
said, referring to a Navy plane that for nearly four hours flew low
over risky terrain searching for a small downed jet with a badly
injured pilot and three dead passengers.
   The report of the downed plane sparked a search that cost about
$50,000 and involved up to 100 people, 20 aircraft and six police
agencies.
   Defense lawyer Paul Twomey said he will appeal on grounds of
insufficient evidence. ``This case is garbage, absolute garbage,''
Twomey said.
   Blair testified he couldn't have committed the hoax because he
was asleep and wasn't aware that a plane was reported down until he
woke and turned on a police scanner.
   Blair said he then overheard the pilot tell the Navy plane that
he believed passengers were dead, that he had lost a lot of blood,
was having trouble staying conscious, and could see and hear the
Navy plane overhead.
   That recollection conflicted with times given by David Webster,
the Navy reservist who piloted the Navy plane. Other critical
testimony came from Timothy Dinan, 24, who lived in Blair's
apartment building.
   Dinan said he heard the scratchy sound of a two-way radio
through an open window in Blair's apartment and a clear voice
saying, ``I am in trouble. I am losing blood.''
   When police searched Blair's apartment and a storage shed, they
seized radio equipment and printed material that included the name
Dale, the name given to searchers by the man who said he was the
injured pilot.
   The materials also contained highlighted references to radio
frequency used that night and information about police emergency
codes.

   Hundreds of mourners, some shouting
``Marcos! Marcos!'' packed a Mass Wednesday for Ferdinand E.
Marcos' mother after the government refused her deathbed wish to
let the ousted president come home.
   President Corazon Aquino cited national security for her
decision to stop Marcos, exiled in Hawaii, from coming home. Marcos
vowed to ``exhaust all possibilities'' to return to the Philippines.
   Former Marcos Cabinet members were among the crowd in a suburban
church for the Mass for Josefa Edralin-Marcos, 95.
   Vice President Laurel, who sent a wreath of white orchids,
arrived after the Mass. He said Marcos' return ``could divide the
country further'' but told reporters the former president should be
allowed to attend the funeral.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, a distant cousin of Marcos, sent
a wreath of yellow orchids, but the crowd refused to allow the
wreath inside the church. ``That color is sickening,'' shouted a
man.
   Yellow was Mrs. Aquino's color during her campaign against
Marcos, who was deposed in February 1986 in a military-civilian
uprising.
   Some people shouted, ``Marcos, Marcos!'' as Mrs. Edralin-Marcos'
coffin was brought in. The Mass was said in honor of Mrs.
Edralin-Marcos, but was not a funeral Mass. No funeral or burial
date was set.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos was hospitalized Sunday suffering from
pneumonia, diabetes and kidney failure. She died Wednesday as Mrs.
Aquino and key government ministers discussed her deathbed appeal.
   Marcos supporters have been linked to several coup attempts
against Mrs. Aquino, whose husband, opposition leader Benigno
Aquino, was assassinated Aug. 21, 1983.
   ``After careful assessment in consultation with the leadership
of both chambers of Congress and the Cabinet committee, I regret
that considerations of national welfare, which are above the
individual interest, forbid us from allowing the former president
to return,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   Mrs. Aquino had told air force cadets Monday that the threat
from Marcos supporters had been neutralized. But police said
Wednesday they seized more than 40 rifles, 300 sticks of dynamite
and hundreds of rounds of ammunition during two raids this week on
buildings owned by Marcos supporters.
   In Hawaii, Marcos issued a statement saying he would ``exhaust
all possibilities that may be available to us to return to our
motherland, to help save her from the threatened communist takeover
or a possible civil war.''
   But Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad, who read the statement to
reporters, said the former president ``won't violate any laws to go
back.''
   Marcos was not permitted to return for the funeral of his
sister, Elizabeth Marcos-Keon, who died in December 1986.
   ``We have a government of neo-barbarians,'' Marcos attorney
Rafael Recto told The Associated Press. ``They act like they've
never had mothers.''
   Six of the 23 members of the Senate, including opposition leader
Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, issued a joint statement urging the
government to allow Marcos to return for humanitarian reasons.
   One woman in the crowd at the Mass, Aurora Alcala, 54, said of
the president: ``I thought she had a pure heart. But it turns out
she has no heart at all.''
   In a letter to Mrs. Aquino, Mrs. Edralin-Marcos said she was
near the end of her life and wanted to see her eldest child one
last time.
   ``My dying wish, the one thing that will put a smile upon my
lips when I leave this world, is to see my Ferdinand by my bedside
as I say goodbye to all of you. Pray grant me this wish and this
privilege as one mother to another,'' the letter said.
   Marcos' father, Mariano, was a politician and lawyer who died in
1944.

<TEXT>
   The revelation that President Reagan and his wife
consult astrologers was greeted by the British press Wednesday with
the sort of relish that even the sorriest soothsayer could have
predicted.
   ``White House Watchers Wild about Nancy the `Stargazer,'''
blared the headline in The Daily Telegraph, which went on to report
that ``Washington was abuzz with claims ... that Nancy really
believes what the stars foretell.''
   Newspapers in Italy, West Germany and Sweden gave relatively
straightforward coverage to the president's denial Tuesday that his
policies or decisions were influenced by astrology.
   But their British counterparts could not resist poking fun at
the Reagans or the former administration officials who have
revealed juicy White House gossip.
   ``There is no wrath like that of a former Reagan aide,
apparently,'' said the Independent newspaper. ``Or, to put it
another way, former Reagan aides will do anything to get their
memoirs on the best-seller list.''
   Donald T. Regan, former White House chief of staff, reportedly
asserts in a forthcoming book that Nancy Reagan regularly consulted
astrologers in shaping the president's schedule.
   The tabloid Daily Mirror devoted almost an entire inside page to
the hubbub. It also listed _ under the banner headline ``Star
Struck!'' _ the famous people who purportedly sought insight from
astrologers.
   Among them were Albert Einstein, Queen Elizabeth I and Napoleon
Bonaparte.
   Einstein once wrote that ``astrology was a science in itself
(that) ... taught me many things,'' according to Daily Mirror
columnist Louise Montgomery.
   Elizabeth I, the 16th-century English monarch, rarely acted
without the advice of astrologer John Dee, and French emperor
Napoleon commissioned at least two astrological charts and ``placed
his trust in the movement of the stars,'' she added.
   A sober headline in the Independent said ``Reagan Takes a Dim
View of Star-Gazing Tales'' while the tabloid Daily Express' banner
headline proclaimed, ``Ronnie and Nancy's Star-Struck White House.''
   In Sweden, Aftonbladet bannered the story saying ``Reagan
Governed by the Stars'' while the liberal Expressen had a large
picture of the presidential couple and a headline reading ``Nancy,
What's the Stars Predicting for Today?''

   Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling broke
his silence Wednesday to deny taking bribes from drug smugglers as
claimed at the trial of reputed cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas.
   ``I have never been offered a bribe and have never accepted a
bribe,'' he said in a statement released to The Associated Press by
Ken Heinrich, Miami bureau chief of Bahamas News Bureau, a
government news agency.
   Pindling's government had repeatedly said it would not comment
on allegations made at Lehder's trial until it was over. The
defense rested Monday without calling any witnesses.
   Several witnesses at the Jacksonville trial, which is expected
to go to the jury next week after six months of testimony, have
charged Pindling filled his pockets with money from smugglers such
as Lehder, who allegedly used Norman's Cay in the Bahamas as a
transfer point for Colombian cocaine bound for Florida and Georgia.
   George William ``Bill'' Baron, 42, a marijuana smuggler,
testified in February about paying $3 million to $5 million in
bribes to Pindling. Baron also testified Lehder was paying Pindling
a flat $200,000 a month.
   ``George Baron, in accepting what he believed was an open
invitation to perjure himself in plea bargaining, told a story
about me that is patently false and a complete fabrication, which
can easily be shown to be such by even a casual observation of the
alleged facts and the circumstances he described,'' the Pindling
statement said.
   According to recent news reports, grand juries in Jacksonville,
Tampa and Miami are looking into Pindling's affairs. U.S. Attorney
Robert Merkle, whose district includes Jacksonville and Tampa, has
refused comment on the claim.
   ``I would be surprised, however, if anything came out of those
investigations,'' Pindling said. ``This is so because the testimony
given concerning me is totally and absolutely untrue.''
   Pindling's name has frequently been tied to drug investigations.
In 1984, a royal commission of inquiry in the Bahamas found that
Pindling had more money than known income, but that none of that
appeared to be drug-related.
   Pindling won re-election a year ago, invoking the fear common to
small nations in the Western hemisphere that the United States is
meddling in their affairs.
   Lehder has been charged with smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine from
Colombia via Norman's Cay to the United States from 1978 to 1980.
He is accused of being a leader of the Medellin cartel, believed
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into United
States.

<HEAD>Pepsi Says It's First Advertiser To Buy Spots on Soviet TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pepsi-Cola said Wednesday it has become the
first advertiser to buy commercial time on Soviet television.
   Pepsi-Cola International, a Somers, N.Y.-based unit of Pepsico
Inc., said it purchased five minutes of commercial time on a
five-part program to be broadcast May 17-21 on the Soviet Union's
main television channel.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the American company
that represented the Soviet broadcast agency Gosteleradio in the
sale said previously the going rate was $10,000 for a 30-second ad.
   Among the six commercials Pepsi plans to run are two 60-second
spots that feature entertainer Michael Jackson. All six ads have
already been shown on U.S. television.
   The ads are to appear on the broadcast of ``Pozner in America,''
a joint U.S.-Soviet production featuring Soviet commentator
Vladimir Pozner talking with Americans on topics such as attitudes
toward the Soviet Union and American family life.
   Barry Holt, a spokesman for Pepsi-Cola International, said Pepsi
felt its purchase made it the first paid advertiser on Soviet
television.
   He said that commercials are scarce on Soviet television and
that Pepsi had been told Soviet advertisers were not charged for
running their commercials.
   Pepsi has been selling soft drinks in Russia since 1974, and
Holt said it has 20 bottlers there.
   This would not be the first time Soviet television viewers have
seen a Pepsi ad, however. Holt said a Pepsi ad ran free of charge
on Soviet television during telecasts of the 1986 Goodwill Games.

   Hundreds of volunteers were graduated
from military exercises Wednesday and declared ready to fight any
invasion by the United States.
   The nation's military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
attended the ceremony for the men and women of the so-called
Dignity Battalion, and reiterated he was willing to meet with
opposition leaders to bring an end to the nation's political crisis.
   ``We are willing to talk (with the opposition) if and when there
is respect,'' he told reporters at the end of the ceremony.
   The Dignity Battalion was established last month as the
government began to whip up nationalistic sentiment against the
U.S. government. The volunteers have been training two to three
hours a day for five weeks.
   The United States imposed sweeping economic sanctions on Panama
in an effort to force the ouster of Noriega, the commander of the
15,000-member Panamanian Defense Forces and power behind the
civilian government. He is under indictment in the United States on
federal drug trafficking charges, which he denies.
   Noriega arrived two hours late for the ceremony as unconfirmed
reports circulated that U.S. officials had arrived for new talks
about his departure.
   Opposition sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two
State Department officials were in the country. A military
spokesman said he did not know if the reports were true.
   Although Noriega's late arrival was unusual, no explanation was
given for the delay.
   Noriega has acknowledged meeting with a State Department envoy
last week but denied reports from Washington that he had agreed to
leave his military post.
   During Wednesday's ceremony, the battalion members carried old
M-2 carbines and M-16 rifles. They wore red-and-white caps with
tiny Panamanian flags and white T-shirts with ``Dignity Battalion''
stamped on them.
   Noriega, who watched from the stands as two of the platoons
demonstrated a mock assault, waved and smiled.
   ``Don't run when you see this,'' an instructor told some of the
women before the mock attack, showing them a smoke grenade. ``This
is smoke, not tear gas.''
   ``They have shown a great deal of enthusiasm,'' said Maj. Cesar
Dominguez, commander of the battalion, who said its members had
been trained in light weapons.
   ``We are here to say `No' to intervention and `No' to
aggression,'' said Alba Iris Castro, a battalion member.
   At the end of the ceremony, Noriega stood, called the battalion
to attention and shouted, ``One whole territory,'' a reference to
the year 2000 when the last of the U.S. military bases here will be
turned over to Panama.
   Meanwhile, the National Banking Commission confirmed the banks
will reopen next week but with restrictions on the amount of cash
depositors can withdraw.
   The banks were closed March 3 by government order.
   Banks were allowed to accept deposits on April 18 and resume
other services, such as handling letters of credit, a week later.
   The commission said depositors will be allowed to withdraw 25
percent of the cash that was in their checking accounts as of March
3.
   The association represents 93 of the 117 banks operating in
Panama, most of them foreign.

   Afghan President Najib met with Indian
leaders on Wednesday and discussed the future of Afghanistan after
the planned withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   Najib met privately with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for two
hours while Indian and Afghan delegations held talks, said Foreign
Ministry spokesman D.K. Maitra.
   ``The talks were warm, friendly and cordial,'' Maitra said.
``The talks pertained to recent developments in the region
including the signing of the historic Geneva accord and the
developments that have taken place after the signing.''
   He declined to give further details.
   Earlier, Najib met President Ramaswamy Venkataraman and spoke of
the Afghan government's efforts to increase development.
   The India visit is Najib's first trip overseas since the Geneva
accord was signed on April 14. Under the United Nations-sponsored
accord, the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan are to
begin pulling out on May 15 and complete the withdrawal by Feb. 15,
1989.
   Later, at an official banquet, Najib said that the signing of
the accord represented ``the solving of one of the most complicated
regional crises'' in the world.
   ``The successful conclusion of the Geneva agreement ...
testifies to the prevalence of common sense,'' he said.
   Najib said he was ``profoundly grateful for the selfless and
consistent assistance'' of the Soviet Union and the support of
India during difficult moments.
   India has maintained close ties with successive governments in
Kabul since the Soviet military intervention in 1979. Indian
newspapers said Wednesday that New Delhi may offer financial
assistance to Afghanistan for rebuilding the country after nearly a
decade of fighting between Moslem guerrillas and the government.
   Najib returns to Kabul on Friday.

   Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima of Japan was elected
director-general of the World Health Organization on Wednesday to
succeed Dr. Halfdan Mahler of Denmark, who held the post for 15
years.
   Nakajima's appointment was approved unanimously by
representatives of the 157 member nations attending the annual

behind closed doors. WHO has 166 members.
   Nakajima, 59, is a specialist in psychopharmacology, the study
of the effects of drugs on the mind. He begins his five-year term
on July 21.
   In his acceptance speech, Nakajima cited health problems facing
the world including AIDS, the burden of aging, lack of safe
drinking water and sanitation in many parts of the world, and
pollution.
   Nakajima headed WHO's Manila-based regional office for the
Western Pacific since 1979. He was nominated for director general
at a WHO executive board meeting in January.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two families swapped their 9-year-old
boys Wednesday after a court ruled that the children were switched
by mistake at birth, a newspaper reported.
   The Joongang Daily News said Park Jong-tae, 44, of Seoul,
tearfully said good-bye to a boy he had believed to be his son.
   At about the same time, Kim Hyung-shin, 35, in Anyang south of
Seoul, said goodbye to Jong-suk, the boy he thought was his eldest
son, the report said.
   ``I am glad to have my real son back, but it's a real pain to
bid farewell to a boy whom I have raised with all care,'' Joongang
quoted Park as saying.
   The paper said the switch was discovered in 1985 when the boy
raised by Park, Jung-soo, had his blood type tested at school.
Jung-soo's blood type was A but his parents' blood types were both
O.
   Joongang said Park's wife feared her husband would think she had
committed adultery so she went to the hospital where she gave birth
Sept. 4, 1978.
   With the help of doctors, she went through records of all
children born at the hospital that day, the paper said.
   A suspected accidental switch was discovered and the hospital
arranged a meeting for the two families, the paper said. There was
no doubt the children were switched because they were strikingly
similar to each other's parents, it said.
   After discussions, the families agreed to get a formal court
order to swap their children, it said.

   The United Auto Workers and Chrysler
Corp. reached tentative agreement Wednesday on a job-protecting
contract covering 66,000 employees in 15 states.
   The two-year agreement was reached after about 40 hours of
non-stop bargaining. It would replace a three-year contract that
runs out Sept. 14.
   The new pact would expire on the same date in 1990, putting
Chrysler's contract in sync with the rest of the Big Three
automakers for the first time in a decade.
   Negotiators adapted to the No. 3 automaker the so-called pattern
contract established last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors
Corp.
   The agreement will be presented Friday to the UAW's 140-member
national Chrysler council for approval before it is put to a
ratification vote next week.
   The pattern contract protects jobs by requiring companies to
keep on the payroll workers whose jobs are eliminated for any
reason except slow sales. It also requires hiring of one worker for
every two who leave the company.
   The pattern forbids plant closings except for those announced
before negotiations began.
   In addition, the agreement includes $1,000 signing bonuses and
lump-sum payments of 3 percent in 1989 and 1990, and provides
profit-sharing for the first time. Profit-sharing will follow the
formula in place at Ford and GM.
   The Chrysler agreement also includes the union leadership's
commitment to encourage its local unions to consider accepting
so-called Modern Operating Agreements _ Japanese-style practices in
which workers are organized into teams.
   Talks began April 18, two to three months earlier than normal,
in an effort to mend three months of discord between the company
and its workers over various job security and retirement issues.
   ``We achieved the full pattern settlement we set out to achieve,
and we accepted no deviations from what we have in effect today at
GM and Ford,'' union President Owen Bieber and Vice President Marc
Stepp said in a statement.
   Anthony St. John, Chrysler's chief bargainer and vice president
for human resources, called the agreement ``affordable and
equitable'' and said the bonus is ``in recognition of the UAW's
contribution to Chrysler's productivity and profits during the past
few years.''
   Unlike the GM or Ford contract, the Chrysler contract also
includes the company's commitment that executives will receive
neither cash nor stock bonuses in years when the profit-sharing
formula produces no payout for workers.
   The two sides negotiated through the weekend to settle separate
but related contracts covering about 7,000 former American Motors
Corp. workers in Wisconsin.
   The national contract will cover workers left on the job after a
former AMC plant employing 5,500 in Kenosha, Wis., closes.

   An attorney for a woman who got AIDS during a 1983
transfusion charged Wednesday that the blood bank that supplied the
tainted blood neglected to take adequate precautions against the
deadly disease.
   Susie Quintana's lawsuit against a blood bank and two doctors
opened Wednesday before a six-person jury in Denver District Court.
   Similar suits have been filed, but lawyers said this may be the
first case in the nation in which a jury will decide an AIDS
victim's claim against a blood bank. In a 1986 California case, a
jury was chosen but the lawsuit was settled out of court before the
trial ended.
   ``It was just like a time bomb, waiting to send an AIDS virus
into a person's body. That person turned out to be Susie
Quintana,'' A. Bruce Jones said of the plasma supplied to his
client after she was injured in a gun accident.
   Jones said in his opening statement Wednesday that testimony
would show the doctor who treated Quintana used the blood bank's
plasma despite offers by family members to share their blood
because of their concern about AIDS.
   Quintana, 50, of Dolores, is suing United Blood Services, whose
blood bank in Albuquerque, N.M., supplied the contaminated blood;
Dr. Edward G. Merritt, Quintana's doctor; and Dr. Donald Kearns, a
Denver infectious disease expert who first tested Quintana for
exposure to AIDS.
   UBS attorney Douglas Irish told the jurors they will have to
base their decision on scientific knowledge at the time and the
judgment that was used.
   ``You will hear from doctors ... that there is a risk ... that
any blood transfusion can carry some disease,'' Irish said.
   The blood bank's lawyers earlier said tests for detecting AIDS
in blood were not available until two years after the woman was
infected.
   Susan Fisher, an attorney for Merritt, said Merritt was not even
in charge the night the woman was treated.
   Kearns' attorney, Joseph Jaudon, said Kearns was called in as a
consultant and ``saw the patient on frequent visits, spent time
with her, answered her questions and talked with her.''
   Judge John W. Coughlin is presiding over the case, which began
with jury selection on Monday.
   Chris Quintana, 53, also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, claims his
wife's illness affected the couple's sex life and potentially
exposed him to AIDS as well. The Quintanas seek ``substantial
damages,'' but their lawsuit does not name an amount, Jones said
Wednesday.
   Quintana has had full-blown AIDS since September 1987, but her
husband's tests have been negative, said Jones.
   ``Chris has not had an easy time since Susie was told she has
AIDS,'' Jones said Wednesday. ``Thank goodness he's not infected,
but they didn't know that at the time'' they had sexual relations
after the transfusion.
   Quintana was brought to Southwest Memorial Hospital in Cortez in
May 1983 for treatment of an accidentally self-inflicted gunshot
wound, Jones said. Merritt was the doctor who treated her, he said.
   ``One hour later, that unit of frozen plasma was put into
Susie's body,'' said Jones. ``You are going to hear evidence that
over that one-hour period that Ron (Quintana's eldest son) could
have given blood, Chris (Quintana's husband) could have given
blood.''
   Jones claimed that the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
was aware as early as January 1983 of the need to make blood safe
from AIDS, identifying male homosexuals and intravenous drug
abusers as high-risk groups.
   United Blood Services, he said, issued a joint statement with
the Red Cross and other organizations following a CDC meeting that
January that recommended ways for the public to avoid contaminated
blood. But he said the statement failed to call for blood donors to
be asked about their sexual preference.
   Jones said Kearns initially tested Quintana for exposure to AIDS
and told her the tests were negative, and Merritt also told Chris
Quintana that his wife did not have AIDS exposure.
   Biopsy tests performed in fall 1985 confirmed that Quintana had
been exposed to the AIDS virus, said Jones.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Controversial Amnesty Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uruguay's highest court on Wednesday
upheld a law granting amnesty to military officers accused of
torture and other human rights violations during the 1973-85
military regime.
   The Supreme Court ruled 3-2 that the amnesty law of 1986
``coincides perfectly with constitutional principles.'' The
dissenting judges said portions of the law were unconstitutional,
but did not elaborate.
   The ruling stemmed from a case brought by an unidentified man
and woman who said they were tortured while in military custody in
the 1970s.
   The law granted protection to about 100 officers accused of
atrocities during military rule.
   Forty-eight other appeals of lower court rulings upholding the
law are pending, but Wednesday's case was considered decisive.
   The law was approved by the official Colorado Party and the main
opposition party, the National Party, after former commanding Gen.
Hugo Medina threatened to order accused army members to refuse to
appear for trial.
   President Julio Sanguinetti, who became president when the
military surrendered rule in 1985, signed the amnesty law in
December 1986 under pressure from the military.
   According to human rights organizations, about 50,000 Uruguayans
_ one in every 60 citizens _ were arrested and many were tortured
during the military's harsh 12-year reign. Scores more were
reported slain or missing.

   North Yemen and Marxist South Yemen
eased restrictions on North-South travel and settled a bitter
dispute over an oil field that straddles their border, a South
Yemen news report said Wednesday.
   Aden radio said the agreements were reached during the night at
a meeting that included President Ali Abdullah Saleh of North Yemen
and South Yemen's Ali Salem Al-Baidh, secretary-general of the
Yemeni Socialist Party.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
South Yemeni representatives also told their counterparts they may
be willing to consider a merger with the larger North Yemen in five
years.
   The agreements were seen as a significant step toward easing
tensions between the two nations. Both command the strategic Bab
al-Mandab straits, gateway to the Red Sea and a crucial Arab oil
shipping route.
   Aden radio said details would be released later. But the sources
said people traveling from one country to the other no longer have
to change buses at the border.
   Buses now can travel directly to and from the capital cities of
Aden and San'a, they said.
   Aden radio said an agreement also was reached on the border oil
field. Oil was discovered in commercial quantities in both
countries relatively recently, and the largest fields are near the
border.
   South Yemen is the only Marxist state in the Arab world. North
Yemen is a republic and home to many South Yemeni opposition
leaders.

<HEAD>Police Crush Protests Marking Anniversary Of South African Attack</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ Police fired rubber bullets
Wednesday at thousands of black youths marching to commemorate
hundreds of their countrymen killed in a South African military
strike a decade ago.
   Inspector Kierie du Rand, a police spokesman, said the ranks of
marchers swelled from an initial 400 schoolchildren to about 3,000
as the procession moved through the black township of Katutura,
outside the capital of Windhoek.
   He said police used rubber bullets when the marchers reached the
township police station.
   The Namibia Communications Center estimated the number of
marchers at 6,000 and said police used tear gas and truncheons as
well as rubber bullets. The communications center is a news agency
that works with churches opposed to South African rule of
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   The center said one youth was shot in the leg by the bodyguard
of a pro-government tribal chief. Police reported no injuries or
arrests.
   Wednesday was the 10th anniversary of a South African military
strike on Cassinga, an Angola town about 150 miles north of the
border with Namibia.
   The South-West African People's Organization, which has been
waging a guerrilla war for independence for 20 years, says 582
Namibian refugees camped at Cassinga were killed in the attack by
370 South African paratroopers. Among the dead refugees were 120
children, the rebel group says.
   South African military officials contend that Cassinga was the
guerrilla group's main operational base and that the attack was
necessary to pre-empt guerrilla strikes in Namibia. They say 800
guerrillas and six South African soldiers died in the battle.
   A military parade celebrating the Cassinga strike was held
Wednesday at Oshakati, a major South African army base in northern
Namibia.
   Lt. Gen. Ian Gleeson, South Africa's army chief of staff, said
the raid had dealt the guerrilla group a blow from which it had
never fully recovered, forcing it to concentrate on non-military
targets.

   Two supporters of rival presidential
candidates were shot to death during campaign rallies, officials
said Wednesday.
   A runoff election will be held Sunday to replace conservative
President Leon Febres Cordero, whose four-year term ends in August.
   At a news conference, Interior Minister Heinz Moeller condemned
the Tuesday night killings and said police security would be
increased at campaign events and candidates' offices.
   The violence came as backers of Rodrigo Borja, candidate of the
Democratic Left Party, and of populist Abdala Bucaram, candidate of
the Roldosista Party, held marches in this port city 180 miles
southwest of Quito, police said.
   Police declined to give details. Earlier campaign violence
killed at least two other people dead and injured several.
   Borja spokesman Kenneth Carrera said the Borja adherent was
killed by Bucaram backers. Guayaquil Mayor Elsa Bucaram, sister of
the populist candidate, accused Borja supporters of killing the
Roldosista supporter.
   Rumors of a military coup have surfaced frequently since Borja
and Bucaram won a first-round election in January because of
uncertainty over what the winning candidate will do once in office.
   Sunday's vote will mark the third presidential election since
this small Andean nation returned to democracy in 1979 after a
decade of military governments.

   An avalanche swept down Mount Sissone
on Wednesday and killed five skiers, raising to 25 the death toll
on the Swiss alps this year, police said.
   The avalanche struck around noon about 9,240 feet up the
mountain and was witnessed by Swiss soldiers and civilians who
immediately alerted rescuers, police reported.
   Police said all five were well equipped for the mountain ski
trip above this Upper Engadine resort and had electronic beepers
that would signal search teams in an avalanche.
   Rescue teams with specially trained avalanche dogs were flown by
helicopter and recovered the five from beneath seven feet of snow,
police said. All were pronounced dead on the scene.
   Identities and nationalities of the victims were not divulged

six Dutch members of a ski party were fatally injured in a
snowslide below Mount San Lorenzo, also in the Engadine.

<TEXT>
   The release of three French hostages by pro-Iranian
kidnappers in Lebanon follows reports of intense diplomatic
activity on their behalf by Premier Jacques Chirac's government.
   There was no immediate indication whether France made
concessions in talks with representatives of Iran. Chirac and other
French officials refused to answer questions about the negotiations.
   There were unconfirmed reports in Beirut in recent days that
France had agreed to pay Iran $670 million, the amount owed to Iran
on a billion-dollar loan made by the late Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi. Payments were frozen by the French government after the
1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.
   Ten French hostages have been freed since the conservative
premier took office in March 1986. The government says an 11th
hostage was killed.
   Although Chirac's government has denied making deals, releases
often coincided with expulsions of Iranian exiles, cash payments to
Iran on a disputed loan or other apparent concessions.
   The final releases occurred four days before Chirac faces
President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, in the presidential
runoff election.
   Chirac trails in opinion polls and commentaries have said
release of the hostages could give him the boost he needs.
   Politicians on both sides saluted the release of journalist
Jean-Paul Kauffmann and diplomats Marcel Fontaine and Marcel
Carton, and denied that there would be political ramifications.
   ``The first politician who declares that this liberation was
obtained for the electoral calendar, that politician will dishonor
himself,'' said Alain Juppe, spokesman for the Chirac campaign.
   ``I don't want to make it an electoral game, but you have to
have the courage to say it. ... When Jacques Chirac came to power
there were 10 Frenchmen held hostage in Lebanon. Today there are
none.''
   Charles Hernu, a former Socialist defense minister, said: ``We
must not mix up these two things. Frenchmen and Frenchwomen know
that in a liberation of this kind, no partisan exploitation is
possible.''
   After Chirac announced the release at a campaign rally in
Strasbourg, however, the audience began chanting: ``We're going to
win! We're going to win!''
   Families of the freed hostages reacted with joy undiluted by
considerations of secret dealing or politics.
   Joelle Kauffmann told The Associated Press her husband's release
was ``a great present.''
   Interviewed on French television as she drank champagne with
friends and relatives, Mrs. Kauffmann said she got the first word
by telephone from the wife of French special envoy Jean-Charles
Marchiani, but thought the call a hoax.
   ``I'm sorry; I took it badly,'' Mrs. Kauffmann said. ``I told
her, `I've had enough with jokes this past month.' She was very
disappointed. She said, `You can believe me or not, but I am
Marchiani's wife. They called me from there (Lebanon) and told me
to tell you this, so there.'''
   Among the mysteries of the sudden release was a possible
connection with France's expulsion Tuesday of Syrian businessman
Omran Adham under procedures of ``absolute urgency.'' He was
involved in previous efforts to free the hostages.
   Le Monde said, without giving sources, that the expulsion was
prompted by an article in the pro-Syrian Beirut newspaper Al Haqiqa
saying France had sent negotiators to Beirut and Tehran. Iran asked
for arms in exchange and ``Chirac responded favorably,'' Al Haqiqa
reported.
   The French paper said Adham ``inspired'' the article.
   Al Haqiqa said France paid 50 million francs ($9 million) for
the release last November of French hostages Roger Auque and
Jean-Louis Normandin.
   French officials have denied paying ransom and insist they have
not dealt directly with terrorists, only with governments like
Iran's that might have influence with the captors.
   Iran had offered to help win the release of French hostages in
Lebanon if France repaid the $1 billion loan made before the
Islamic revolution, cracked down on Iranian exiles and stopped
selling arms to Iraq, which has been at war with Iran since
September 1980.
   French officials said privately Iran also sought its own
supplies of French arms and freedom for five men convicted in a
1980 attempt to assassinate Shapour Bakhtiar, the last prime
minister before Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown in
February 1979.

<HEAD>Attorney General Withdraws From Financial-Disclosure Investigation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona's attorney general withdrew from
an investigation of Gov. Rose Mofford's financial-disclosure forms
Wednesday, citing a possible conflict of interest in his being next
in line to succeed her.
   Maricopa County Attorney Tom Collins agreed to take over the
investigation from Attorney General Bob Corbin, who is prosecuting
former Gov. Evan Mecham on charges of omitting a $350,000 loan from
his disclosure forms.
   Mrs. Mofford said she saw no conflict to having Corbin
investigate her and Mecham said he believed Corbin should handle
the probe for the sake of consistency, but Corbin said he
considered it inappropriate because he might be accused of
benefiting from Mrs. Mofford's ouster or of having partisan motives.
   Corbin, Collins and Mecham are Republicans while Neely and Mrs.
Mofford are Democrats.
   Collins said he had agreed to take the case because he felt he
could probably ``do it well, quicker than anybody else and at a
lower cost than if they had to appoint a special prosecutor.''
   ``This is clearly a damned if you do and damned if you don't
case,'' Collins added, predicting that Mrs. Mofford's supporters
would accuse him of partisanship if he brought charges against her
and that Mecham's supporters would accuse him of throwing the case
if he declined to press charges against her while Corbin proceeds
with the case against Mecham.
   ``Since I am not running for re-election, I feel that I am
perfectly positioned,'' he said.
   Collins accepted after Pima County Attorney Steve Neely declined
to take the case, said Corbin.
   Neely did not return calls to his office Wednesday, and a
spokeswoman, Kathi Barber, said he would not explain why he had
decided against taking the case.
   ``I didn't ask him,'' Corbin said. ``I assume he had his
reasons.''
   Mrs. Mofford, elected as secretary of state, succeeded Mecham
upon his impeachment and removal last month.
   Her replacement as secretary of state cannot become governor
because he was appointed rather than elected, and Corbin is the
next highest elected official.
   As secretary of state for 10 years, Mrs. Mofford was in charge
of explaining disclosure requirements for state officials.
   The Associated Press disclosed on April 22 that she had not
reported loans, land holdings and partnerships dating back to 1978,
and Mrs. Mofford, saying she had made ``an honest mistake,'' filed
amended reports a week later.
   Mecham has said that his legal troubles also stem from ``an
honest mistake,'' and he accused Corbin on Wednesday of ``ducking
the issue'' by delegating the job instead of taking the case to a
grand jury.
   ``I think he needs to be man enough to stand up and do his
duty,'' Mecham said.
   Mrs. Mofford had no immediate reaction to Collins taking over
the case, press secretary Vada Manager said.

   Luis Aguilar appeared relaxed Wednesday as
he waited to file for amnesty by the midnight deadline for illegal
aliens. He said he wasn't worried whether he would receive amnesty
and had no fear of being deported.
   After all, he said, he has been deported five times since coming
to the United States nine years ago. And he keeps coming back,
swimming the Rio Grande.
   ``I've been so long here, I just make myself at home,'' Aguilar
said while waiting for his name and number to be called at the
Immigration and Naturalization Service office. ``I've been here
since 1979. I don't even know who the president of Mexico is.''
   Aguilar, 26, was one of hundreds of illegal aliens who waited
until the last two days to bring whatever documents they had to the
Oklahoma City INS office.
   Most of the last-minute applicants cited insufficient documents,
money or fear as their reason for procrastinating.
   For Aguilar, the reason appeared to be lack of interest.
   ``If they send me back to Mexico, I figure I can't stay there,''
he said. ``I've spent almost half my life here. The last time I was
there, I stayed three days and came back. I figure I belong here.''
   Aguilar said he works on a ranch in Konawa, where he earns about
$200 a week. He said his wife, Rosie, persuaded him to apply for
amnesty, and he was able to squeeze a trip to Oklahoma City into
his work schedule.
   He met his wife seven years ago while working at a ranch in
Seminole County.
   ``He would get deported, but he always knew where to find me,''
Mrs. Aguilar said. ``One time he came right back three days after
he was deported.''
   They were married in 1983, and A.J. Irwin, the chief
legalization officer at the Oklahoma City INS office, said he was
surprised Aguilar didn't apply for citizenship since his wife, a
Seminole Indian, is a U.S. citizen.

   Disclosures that President Reagan and his wife
consult astrologers have opened them to taunts from Congress and
criticism from scientists, but the first lady isn't about to drop
her longtime interest in stargazing, an aide says.
   ``She doesn't think that there's anything wrong with it. It
doesn't control policy and it doesn't control their lives,'' Elaine
Crispen, the first lady's press secretary, said Tuesday.
   White House officials were clearly discomfited by the revelation
_ at one moment offering smiles and shrugs for reactions, at others
stern denials that serious policy matters have been left to
soothsayers.

   A group of world-famous scientists intent on
debunking the claims of astrologers says it is dismayed that
President and Mrs. Reagan use ``superstition'' and ``mystical
fortune telling'' to make decisions.
   The practice, said the Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, harks back to ancient
times when monarchs and emperors resorted to the musings of fortune
tellers for advice.
   ``We are concerned by the apparent return to medieval
superstitition,'' the statement said. ``Dozens of tests in recent
years by scientists can find little, if any, evidence for
astrological claims. Horoscopes have been shown under the most
rigorous scientific analysis to fail completely in predicting
future events.''
   The statement was released after reports on a forthcoming book
by former White House chief of staff Donald Regan, who says Nancy
Reagan regularly consults astrologers in shaping her advice to the
president. Reagan, the book says, also regularly reads his
horoscope. The White House later confirmed the Reagans' interest in
astrology but said it did not influence any policy decisions.

government's fault and a new trial would violate their clients'
right to only one trial on the charges.
   The trial, which began in December, already was proceeding
slowly when testimony was all but halted two months ago for
hearings on whether prosecutors deliberately withheld evidence from
the defense, including a memo in which two pivotal figures in the
Iran-Contra affair discussed alleged infiltration of LaRouche
groups.

   Not all the animals running loose in New York
City are dogs, cats or freewheeling cab drivers. It IS a jungle out
there.
   ``I don't expect to see a zebra, but then again this is Fun City
so you'll never know,'' said George S. Watford, head of rescue
services for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.
   In 28 years with the humane society, Watford has seen
alligators, baboons, bears, barn owls, caimans, chimpanzees and
eagles. Foxes, horses, lambs, lions, mandrills and monitor lizards.
Parrots, peregrine falcons, pigs, raccoons, sea turtles and sheep.
Swans, tarantulas and tigers.
   They all make their way to special ASPCA preserves such as the
room marked ``EXOTIC ANIMALS'' at the Manhattan shelter. There, in
the din of baying dogs and mewling cats, one can occasionally hear
a hiss, screech or roar more common to the wilds of the Amazon or
deepest Africa.
   Last year, officials say, the organization captured 5,304 exotic
animals _ a category that includes everything but dogs and cats.
But it takes something special to turn the head of an ASPCA veteran.
   ``People consider bats exotic,'' said Watford. ``We don't. We
get a lot of them flying through New York City.''
   The Manhattan shelter had three quail in its exotic ward one
recent day; they had been seized from a pet store because selling
the birds is illegal. Two weeks earlier, the Brooklyn shelter
confiscated a ram from a Moslem family planning to slaughter it for
a feast.
   In December, a South American cargo ship 400 miles offshore
radioed that an osprey had crash-landed on its deck. Once the
vessel was in the harbor, a shelter worker was dispatched in a
motor launch to retrieve the fish-eating hawk, now on the
endangered species list.
   In the Greatest Hits category, nothing tops the Burmese python
that police discovered protecting a Queens drug dealer's apartment.
   ``I've never seen anything that large, anything that weighed
more than me in the snake area. And I weigh 200 pounds,'' said
Watford. The python was estimated to weigh 300 to 350 pounds. It
measured 16 feet long and at least 30 inches around at the head. In
the exotic animal room, the snake stood straight up on its tail and
sniffed the ceiling.
   Police told Watford the diet of the ``guard snake'' had been
full-grown rabbits, six at a time.
   ``If it got around your neck, God knows what would happen,'' he
said. ``It was certainly capable of swallowing a 12-year-old kid
whole.''
   Watford does not always know how the animals come to New York.
``How does a sea turtle end up in a bathroom in upper Manhattan?''
he said with a shrug. But he does know how they come to the
attention of the ASPCA.
   They run amok.
   Take snakes. ``(Owners) wake up one morning and it's not where
it's supposed to be. It's not in the glass aquarium. Maybe the
neighbor finds it in her bathtub. Or under her bed. Or in her bed.
That creates the kind of environment that is quite frightening.''
   Sometimes, the animals are involved in crimes. Richard A. Orzo,
a 32-year veteran of the rescue service, remembers a monkey trained
to perform specialized burglaries. The owner would cut circular
holes in the windows of Brooklyn liquor stores and send the monkey
in for cocktails.
   Sometimes, the animals kill. Two years ago, a Queens woman was
found dead in her home near aquariums full of venom-spitting cobras.
   ``They're fascinating. They're beautiful,'' said Watford.
``People fall in love with snakes, even the most venomous type. ..
. Just a nick and it could kill you.''
   Often, it is not humans but the animals who are imperiled.
Scores of barnyard animals have been confiscated before they could
be sacrificed in religious ceremonies.
   ``We take a dim view of the killing of any animal,'' said
Watford.
   Once captured, the animals are given to zoos, sent to animal
farms or, when possible, released into the wild. They are not
returned to their owners; keeping exotic animals is against New
York City health codes.
   The owners, who sometimes have invested thousands of dollars, do
not always relinquish the beasts gracefully.
   Police took custody of an ocelot after the forest cat ripped
open both arms of its mistress, a Bronx woman. Her arms were placed
in casts, and her cat was placed with the ASPCA.
   When she came to visit, shelter workers left her briefly alone
with her pet and she was next seen trying to spirit the ocelot out
the door, cradling it in her casts.

   The faces of the rowers looked as cold
and wind-stung as early morning on the Charles River.
   Oars ripped into the tea-colored Charles to the cadence of the
coxswains. The tension was acute. Six women were trying out for the
four remaining port-side rowing seats available for a race in
Seattle, one of the last major events before the Summer Olympic
trials in June.
   ``Now switch seat three,'' ordered Coach Holly Hatton over a
megaphone.
   Hatton maneuvered her motorboat around the two racing shells,
watching to see how the shift affected their speed. She took a few
notes on a dog-eared pad, but she instantly detected the stronger
rower.
   Hatton would arrange six five-minute races before deciding on
the Seattle team.
   ``The anxiety level is tremendous these days,'' Hatton said.
``The Olympics has everyone on edge. Now, everything is on the line
all the time. It's tough mentally as well as physically.''
   For more than a year, the lives of about a dozen elite female
rowers have centered on the weathered Boston Rowing Club boathouse
down the street from Harvard Yard. For some, the old building will
be a gateway to Seoul, South Korea.
   ``It's come down to this, and everyone is looking for the little
edge, that little extra, to put them on the team,'' said Hatton, a
coxswain on the 1980 team pulled from the Olympics by the U.S.
boycott protesting the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   Except for an unlikely surge by a college team in upcoming
races, the Olympic women's team will come from the BRC and
Seattle's Pocock Center. A series of lesser races culminates with
the June 22-26 nationals in Indianapolis, the most important event
in selecting the members of the four-and eight-member shells and
the single scullers.
   Slowly, outside lives have dissolved for the rowers, who came
from around the country to the BRC last year. Jobs, such as
carpenter and physical therapist, have been abandoned as the
training intensified.
   ``There's a feeling that time is running out,'' said Stephanie
Maxwell, 24, who came to train at the BRC after graduation from
Cornell University and rowed with the eight-member team that placed
second behind Romania in last year's world championships in
Denmark. ``There are so many peaks you go through, you just try to
stay on top as the Olympics near.''
   For 31-year-old Abby Peck, the 1988 games may mean a last chance
for an Olympic medal she missed by two-tenths of a second four
years ago in Los Angeles.
   ``I try to keep my mind off the Olympics,'' said Peck, a member
of five national teams since beginning to row competitively six
years ago. ``The emotional tension would be just too exhausting.''

<HEAD>First Collection of Asian Export Art Unveiled At Peabody Museum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Peabody Museum was established in
1799, thousands of artisans in Canton and other ports in the Orient
were crafting elaborate objects from porcelain, silks, ivory,
silver and rare woods for export to the West.
   But the goods made by Easterners for Western commercial
consumption never have been treated as a separate, scholarly
discipline or gathered in one place.
   Enter the Peabody, which calls itself the nation's oldest
continuously operating museum. The museum will dedicate an $8.1
million new wing to house the first permanent collection of Asian
export art in the world on May 14.
   ``We consider the Asian influence on our decorative arts second
only to the classical influence of Greece and Rome,'' said Crosby
Forbes, curator of the Asian export collection. ``Our debt to Asian
culture and our awareness of these influences needs to be more
emphasized.''
   Forbes and other scholars in the field spent over 20 years
promoting the concept of a field devoted to the disparate objects,
materials, styles and destinations of Asian decorative art.
   The collection is a combination of 2,000 pieces from the
Peabody, established by the East India Marine Society in 1799, and
8,000 from the China Trade Museum of Milton, Mass., located in a
home built by a sea captain in 1833.
   The two merged in 1984 and the new museum is the first to treat
products exported from the Orient as one body of art. The Victoria
and Albert Museum in London contains a small gallery with about 120
items of Chinese export art, and other museums display random
pieces of Asian made items.
   About 1,000 objects are displayed in the Peabody Museum's
three-story new wing, a well-lighted and spacious area that
features central displays explaining the key components of Asian
trade.
   Forbes said exports from China began as early as 1498 and
flourished after 1557, when the Portuguese settled Macao, giving
Westerners a formal presence in Asia and opening a permanent market
to the West.
   ``Those voyages of exploration and discovery that started in the
15th century and attempted to find the route to Asia were primarily
to obtain spices, which were sort of essential to the rich,''
Forbes said.
   The Spanish began regular trips in the late 16th century, while
the British and Dutch East India Trading companies were established
in the early 17th century.
   Forbes said American colonists first imported goods through
Europe then set up direct trade with the Orient. Chinese porcelain
has been found at trading posts in Jamestown and Williamsburg, Va.,
and Nova Scotia, he said.
   In the 18th century alone, when the trade peaked, about 40
million pieces of porcelain were exported to Europe. Newspapers in
New England frequently advertised up to 20 different kinds of
Oriental cotton into the early 19th century.
   Asian-export decorative arts were made in China, Japan,
Indonesia, the Philippines, India and Ceylon, now known as Sri
Lanka. Tea, coffee, spices, textiles and porcelain accounted for
about 90 percent of the exports; the rest were special orders such
as furniture, paintings and carved wood.
   The Peabody's collection includes Chinese porcelains owned by
George Washington and Thomas Jefferson; a pair of lacquer card
tables brought to Salem 50 years before Japan opened to trade in
1854; a silver cup dating to 1840 depicting a rowing race between
foreigners on the Pearl River at Canton; and a massive ``moon bed''
made for the Philippines centennial in 1876.
   ``The quality of goods in Asia was very high,'' Forbes said.
``The materials were there _ you could have lacquers, porcelains
and silks that were not available in Europe.''
   Because wages were low and raw materials abundant, the products
were cheap for Western consumers; importers paid the local rate for
silver and another 15 percent to 25 percent for labor, compared to
a 100 percent markup in the United States.
   The influence of Asian export art ranges from pavilions and
pagodas depicted in ceramics and wallpapers to the fluting on
teapots made by American silversmith Paul Revere.
   In addition, the community of Asian artisans _ some 250,000 in
Canton alone from 1750-1842, ``was in touch with Western influences
and applied itself to making these remarkable objects,'' Forbes
said.
   This cultural dichotomy was never reflected in Western
collections because Asian export art was scattered in Europe and
America. The style was considered both Asian and European, and as
such scholars pushed it aside, Forbes said.
   ``For the first time people will see the variety and richness of
the field,'' he said. ``People will see that it started in the late
Middle Ages and comes up right to the present.''

<HEAD>Panama's Health System Suffering as Crisis Drags On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The signs are everywhere that
Panama's health system has been thrown into disarray by the
nation's political and economic crises.
   An entire floor of one hospital is boarded up and closed.
   Thousands of doctors and nurses have been sent home on unpaid
vacations.
   Pharmacists are running out of everything from heart medicine to
surgical gloves.
   ``We're living on borrowed time,'' said Dr. Luis Casco Arias, a
prominent physician.
   Since Panama became a cash-only society with the closing of
banks March 4 because of U.S. economic restrictions, it has been
hard, often impossible, for patients to pay their medical bills,
for hospitals and clinics to pay their workers, for pharmacists to
pay suppliers.
   Government hospitals began turning away all but emergency cases
in March during a five-week strike by doctors and nurses demanding
payment of their salaries.
   In time, patients stopped going to the dentist or seeking
elective surgery and laboratory tests because of the money problems
and the uncertainty.
   One 28-year-old woman said she has delayed a hysterectomy for
two months and wonders if she'll develop complications during the
wait.
   ``I told my doctor that I'm optimistic,'' the woman said. ``He
told me he's pessimistic.''
   Casco Arias said patients with serious problems are being cared
for.
   Health Minister Franciso Sanchez Cardenas said a 25 percent drop
has been noted in the number of people seeking medical care at
government-run hospitals and clinics.
   ``The Panamanian people have understood they should go for
medical services only when it is really required,'' he said.
   Sanchez denied reports from medical associations of shortages of
food and medicines in state facilities. At the same time, he
acknowledged that the cash-starved government has requested and
received a donation of drugs from Cuba and is expecting more from
other sources.
   The Health Ministry agreed to put the Cuban antibiotics through
laboratory tests after the National Association of Pharmacists
questioned the quality of the drugs.
   Doctors and nurses at government clinics say they are working
only 12 hours a week instead of the usual 40. The modern,
four-story Paitilla Medical Center, a private hospital, has closed
off its second floor.
   Dr. Fernando Boyd, a dentist, said the private Arango Clinic
where he works is opened only half a day and half the 45-member
staff has been sent home on unpaid vacations for a month.
   Boyd added that some of his patients have been unable to pay
even part of their bills.
   ``But if somebody comes to you and is pain, what are you going
to say?'' he said.
   Horacio Icaza, president of Casa Del Medico, the country's
largest medical supply firm, said his sales fell to $9,000 in the
first three weeks of April from a monthly average of $500,000
before the crisis.
   He added that his warehouse is 75 percent empty and some of his
U.S. suppliers are refusing to sell him more supplies until he pays
his bills.
   Icaza said he has large and small rubber surgical gloves but is
out of medium sizes and has run out of units for intravenous
feeding. He has casting material for setting broken bones but has
run out of the stockings that are put on a patient's foot before
the cast is set.
   Icaza said he recently sold his last two tubes used in cases
where brain fluid must be drained.
   ``I'm the only supplier of those in the country,'' Icaza said.
``And if you run out of those, the patient is a goner.''
   Pharmacists say they are running short of some of the most
commonly used drugs, including some heart medicines, antibiotics
and tranquilizers.
   Druggist Manuel Dominguez said his sales of tranquilizers are up
30 percent.
   ``Demand is up because there is a lot of tension over what's
happening in this country,'' he said.
   But psychiatrist Ramiro Diaz said he is seeing 30 percent fewer
patients.
   ``In my field we know there are people who feel down or stressed
_ we call it nerves _ but they'd rather live with it than spend the
$50 an hour,'' he said.
   ``The stress level of the whole community is way up,'' he added.
``My own is too.''

<HEAD>New Policy To Protect Burial Grounds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE M. ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SENECA ROCKS, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 18th-century graveyard on the
grounds of a new U.S. Forest Service campground will be left intact
through a trial policy adopted this year to recognize the religious
views of American Indians.
   The gravesite, which forest service archaeologist Janet G.
Brashler believes dates from at least 1791, contains no remains of
any tribal members.
   But the policy, put into effect Jan. 29 by the forest service,
encompasses all human burial grounds, regardless of race.
   ``It comes down to First Amendment freedom of religion rights,''
Brashler said.
   The gravesite policy was developed in conjunction with American
Indian and archaeology groups, she said. It is in effect in the
Eastern and Southern regions of the forest service, which include
land east of the Mississippi River, and will be put into effect
nationwide if successful.
   Pre-historic American Indian sites, as well as homesteads dating
from the 17th, 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, are scattered
throughout Appalachia, archaeologists believe.
   ``We've had lots of problems, both at the federal and state and
graverobber levels, where desecration was taking place with
increasing frequency,'' said Suzan Harjo, executive director of the
Washington, D.C.-based National Congress of American Indians.
   ``Any place where there are Indian remains, it takes place.''
   Although the plan specifies that the graves should be left
undisturbed if possible, it does make provisions for scientific
study, Brashler said.
   ``We need to be allowed to study and obtain samples of material
_ that's going to be a bone of contention,'' Brashler said.
   The policy would allow some human remains to be exhumed, but
only after the forest service consults with the tribes involved,
Brashler said. Any human remains exhumed must be returned to the
ground, she said.
   ``The issue is a pan-tribal concern,'' Brashler said. ``It
actually represents two conflicting world views _ archaeology as a
science and what we know about descent and cultural practices, and
religious views.
   ``The Western European view of death relating to one's ancestors
is so different than Native Americans' view of death and
ancestry,'' Brashler said. ``It's a deeply personal and spiritual
thing for some of them.''
   Tribal groups, especially in the Great Lakes area and in the
West, were concerned that their ancestors were being unearthed from
public lands with little concern for the tribes' religious beliefs.
   Brashler said the new policy was sparked by complaints from
American Indians about national forests in Wisconsin, Minnesota and
Michigan, which are rich in tribal artifacts. California has also
developed a tough policy to protect gravesites, Brashler said.
   The forest service policy requires that agency workers in each
state deal directly with tribes to work out a plan to handle each
specific gravesite, regardless of whether it belongs to those
tribes.
   ``They feel that the tribal affiliation is not important,''
Brashler said. ``Descecration of one is descecration of all.''
   In West Virginia, where no active American Indian tribes are
left, administering the policy would be slightly different, she
said.
   ``It will involve making good faith efforts to research who the
people are in those graves,'' Brashler said.
   The tiny graveyard at Seneca Rocks is nearly hidden by brush.
The graves, some marked by worn rocks that once were headstones,
resemble shallow trenches. Brashler said the indentations could
indicate the people were buried in coffins.
   The forest service archaeologist said she believed the graveyard
was in use for 50 to 60 years. One headstone contains a barely
decipherable inscription including the year 1791.
   The hill, overlooking Seneca Rocks, was a popular homesite for
settlers in the 18th and 19th centuries, Brashler said. Walking
through the future campground, she identified several signs
indicating people had lived there.
   Chips and flakes of stone, unearthed when workers leveled the
ground for the campsite, show the site also was inhabited by
American Indians, Brashler said.
   ``There must be some great spiritual significance the site held,
but we'll never know,'' she said.
   The graveyard will be preserved in place, and Brashler said the
forest service may clean it up and post some explanatory signs.
   Archaeologists say hundreds of historical homesites are located
throughout the region, although many are hard to identify.
   ``One difficulty of managing historic sites in the eastern
United States is you can't see them.'' Except for such artifacts as
stone chips, Brashler said, ``there's nothing there _ it's not like
the big stone pyramids in Mexico and Egypt.''
   Many of the sites were occupied from the post-Civil War period
to the Depression, but prehistoric American Indian camps also are
scattered throughout the area, Brashler said.
   ``They give a really nice indication that even the mountains
were occupied for thousands of years,'' she said.

<HEAD>RX for Long-Term Investing: DRPs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an era when the investment climate seems as
changeable as the spring weather, it takes a special discipline to
think long-term in managing your money.
   But many of the typical investor's financial objectives require
long-term strategies _ retirement planning, for example, or saving
to pay a child's college tuition.
   Thus, say many advisers on personal financial matters, now may
be a particularly appropriate time to check into stocks of
companies that offer dividend reinvestment plans, or DRPs.
   ``Stocks?'' you might well say. ``I don't want any part of
stocks, they way the market goes up 80 points, down 100, and that
computer program trading ...''
   Well, the point of systematic investing through some arrangement
like a dividend reinvestment plan is to smooth out all that
short-term volatility and maybe even turn it to your advantage.
   The first corporate DRPs were created in the 1960s, based on an
idea borrowed from mutual funds, where they had long been popular
and remain so to this day.
   The basic principle is simple: Instead of sending stockholders a
check for their quarterly dividends, the company in question
automatically invests the payout in more shares for their accounts.
   As DRPs spread, they acquired extra features. Beyond the
dividend, some companies offered participants the right to invest
additional cash at no charge.
   Owners of International Business Machines stock, for example,
can invest as little as $10 or as much as $5,000 each quarter. At
General Motors, the range is $20 to $5,000.
   As a further inducement, some companies issued stock to DRP
participants at discounts of 3 percent to 5 percent below the
market price. Though these discounts have been growing scarcer
lately, Standard & Poor's Corp. still counts 47 exchange-listed
stocks that offer them, including such familiar names as Chase
Manhattan, Texas Utilities and Xerox.
   Even without a discount, the savings on brokerage commission
costs can be significant. Traditionally, most companies with DRPs
have charged no fees or only a modest service charge to buyers.
   DRPs plainly are not for people who need current income from
their savings or who are looking to make fast trading profits. But
that's just the point.
   With regular investing in a DRP, you gain the benefit of dollar
cost averaging. Your money buys more shares per dollar when the
price is low.
   ``If you're investing in specific companies for the long term,
dividend reinvestment offers a sound forced-savings technique that
could be particularly attractive for retirement plans or children's
funds,'' says William Brennan, publisher of the financial
newsletter Brennan Reports in Valley Forge, Pa.
   DRPs come with no guarantees. Dollar-cost-averaging won't help
much if you do it in a stock that falls into the basement and takes
up permanent residence there.
   These programs require some good record-keeping for tax
purposes. What's more, the dividends you reinvest count as taxable
income in the year in which they are paid, even though you don't
actually receive the money.
   You won't find brokerage firms volunteering much information on
DRPs, since these plans bypass brokers.
   But if a company's stock looks good enough to you to warrant a
long-term commitment, you can determine what sort of DRP, if any,
it offers by inquiring directly at its shareholder relations office.
   Several independent investment advisory services and investor
groups offer information and, in some cases, active help in DRP
investing.
   Some examples:
   Standard & Poor's offers a current brochure listing almost 600
companies with DRPs (Price: $2. Write Public Relations Dept.,
Standard & Poor's Corp., 25 Broadway, New York NY 10004).
   A more elaborate directory of some 1,000 companies, describing
details of each plan, is published by Evergreen Enterprises, P.O.
Box 763, Laurel, Md. 20707, which charges $24.95.

<TEXT>
   Businessman Guy Smith met Jesse Jackson across a
negotiating table in 1981 when Smith was a vice president for 7Up
Corp. and Jackson was pressuring corporations to expand
opportunities for blacks.
   They met several times with subordinates and alone, coming up
with a ``covenant'' under which 7Up agreed to spend $61 million to
improve its minority hiring and spending program.
   Today, Smith says, `I am a Republican, but if Jesse is the
(Democratic) nominee, I will vote for him.''
   ``He never one time wanted us to give something to somebody. He
wanted us to give opportunity,'' for blacks, which ultimately was
great for the 7Up business, recalled Smith, now a Phillip Morris
vice president.
   It was a different side of Jesse Jackson that Smith and other
corporate executives saw _ different from the man the public had
come to know as a fiery spokesman for black concerns, who led
street demonstrations, railed against City Hall, blasted the
administration in Washington and spouted militant rhetoric.
   The public Jackson, as head of his civil rights organization
Operation PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity), was honing his
skills as a champion headline grabber, always able to seize on an
issue or tactic that would put PUSH in the news.
   During those years, he began to develop a less flamboyant side,
with the tactics of conciliatory persuasion that he is showcasing
in his campaign for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination.
   For instance, he was given credit for successful mediation of
the devastating 1980 Chicago firefighters' strike _ 22 people died
in fires during the strike _ after marathon sessions with blacks,
who were insisting on affirmative action before they would unite
with white unionists, and with white firefighters and city
officials.
   That side of Jackson has become more dominant in the years since
his 1984 presidential bid.
   Gone are the dashikis, blue jeans and leather vests that were
the uniform of Jackson's youthful protest days.
   Also gone is much of the confrontational rhetoric typified by
his remarks on the day he launched PUSH in 1971: ``Power must not
be blind. It must be used ... to picket, vote and if necessary to
engage in civil disobedience ... We will be as nonviolent as we can
be, and as violent as we must be.''
   In Chicago, it is difficult to find many associates who don't
offer the observation that Jackson has grown and matured since
those days.
   Today, in impeccable business suits and silk ties, Jackson
projects himself as a conciliator and mediator, holding himself
above the fray of campaign attacks and holding out the promise of
understanding to all constituencies.
   Even in the heat of the New York primary, when Mayor Ed Koch
called Jackson a liar, Jackson brushed it off.
   One former critic, Chicago radio commentator Lu Palmer, says he
set aside his misgivings about Jackson after determining his ego
wasn't as big as it used to be.
   ``I was one of Jesse's greatest critics in the 70s. I was not
convinced he was as serious about the movement as he was about
himself,'' Palmer said. ``I had quit attending PUSH because I was
convinced Jesse was not for real. Now I'm one of his biggest
supporters.''
   But some say it's the old Jackson in a new package.
   ``Jesse is for Jesse. Everything else is No. 2,'' said Marshall
Field, former owner of the Sun-Times newspaper. He declined further
comment.
   Many who have been critical in the past seem reluctant to say
anything negative about Jackson today as he glows in the successes
of his presidential campaign.
   Former Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne contends Jackson was always
capable of both protesting and trying to bring people together. ``I
don't see him any different today,'' she said.
   But Jackson backers point out that times have changed since the
South Carolina native arrived in Chicago as a semininary student in
the early 1960s _ and Jackson has changed with them.
   ``Those were the days when he was absolutely confrontational,''
said Bishop H.H. Brookins of the African Methodist Episcopal
Church, a longtime ally. ``That was the only way he got coverage
was to be confrontational ... He's much more thoughtful now than he
once was. I attribute that to maturing at the public level.''
   In the PUSH days, when Jackson was fighting to improve the
economic and political clout of blacks, he achieved many of his
goals through boycotts or the threat of boycotts, public attacks on
adversaries during revival-style PUSH meetings and an ability to
mobilize black followers.
   Recognized today as a master at using the news media, Jackson
made every effort to cultivate reporters, especially those from the
black press, said Nate Clay, a former PUSH spokesman and now editor
of the weekly Chicago Metro News.
   A workaholic who has skimmed several newspapers by 6 a.m.,
Jackson knew how to make headlines, Clay said. He gave his staff
tips on how to give reporters short, snappy quotations.
   ``He did not hesitate to call up editors and make his views
known on editorials and stories,'' and before long Jackson was the
one who was called by reporters for comment on the various civil
rights stories of the day.
   ``If I was critical of him, he'd almost always call and try to
talk it out,'' said Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko. ``Even if
I was 100 percent right, I'd spend the next three days walking
around with my liberal guilt throbbing.''
   Royko said Jackson tried to persuade rather than intimidate him.
But a former Chicago Sun-Times official said that Jackson would
make threatening calls ``unless the Sun-Times did exactly what he
wanted.''
   ``He would say it was anti-black,'' and threaten to make a
public uproar over the matter, said the newspaper official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

   On one occasion, Jackson saw a new black reporter on TV, Clay
recalled.
   ``He started asking around the room, `Who is that?' A week or so
later, this reporter was at Jesse's house. Jesse told him he had an
exclusive for him.''
   That was typical of the way Jackson would ``cultivate anybody
who could do him a favor,'' Clay said. ``Jesse has a knack of going
around picking up people like some people pick up stray dogs.''
   ``He certainly was very fiery,'' in those days, said Chicago
political consultant Don Rose, who now says his previously reported
description of Jackson conniving to grab the mantle of the slain
Dr. Martin Luther King has been overblown.
   Rose said in a recent interview that the day after King's 1968
assassination in Memphis, Jackson asked Rose to set up a couple of
TV interviews for him in Chicago.
   In general conversation, according to Rose, the two subsequently
fell to discussing how Jackson ``had terrific potential to become
the leader of the movement.''
   But Rose said there was no concerted plan, as he had been quoted
saying, to engineer that eventuality.
   In any event, Jackson for two days wore a turtleneck _ even in a
King memorial service of the Chicago City Council _ stained with
what he said was King's blood.
   He told the council: ``I come here with a heavy heart because on
my chest is the stain of blood from Dr. King's head.''
   Jackson's biographer, Barbara Reynolds, said that more than 100
articles in the year after King's assassination reported that
King's blood was on Jackson's shirt and that Jackson had cradled
the dying leader or that he was the last person King had spoken to.
All these details are disputed by some King associates who were
present on the balcony of the Lorraine motel in Memphis, Tenn.,
where King was shot.
   Jackson has been vague in more resent interviews on the events
in Memphis. He said in an interview on television's Phil Donahue
show in April that it was not true he had not touched the dying
King. He said he ran up to the balcony after a sheet had been put
over the body. ``I then got up from a very bloody scene,'' he said.
``Blood was everywhere.''
   Mistrust of Jackson lingers from those days. King's widow,
Coretta Scott King, and some other civil rights colleagues refuse
to endorse Jackson.
   In his campaign, Jackson frequently cites his ties to King, but
the Rev. Hosea Williams, an Atlanta city councilman, said Jackson
``could never work as a team person,'' with King or other members
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   Williams recalled a staff meeting where Jackson stubbornly
challenged King's ideas.
   ``It got so ridiculous that Dr. King got up and walked out. As
he got to the door, he turned around and he said, `Jesse, if you
want to start your own national orgnization you can do so, but you
don't have to destroy me ...''
   Ultimately, Jackson split with SCLC leaders over finances and
the leadership of the Operation Breadbasket arm of SCLC which he
headed.
   Jackson's longtime friend and pastor, the Rev. Clay Evans,
contended some were jealous of Jackson because of his stature and
support.
   In Chicago, ``he was the movement,'' Evans said. ``Without him
there wouldn't have been any movement.''
   Jackson's fame grew as he took on everything from housing
discrimination and youth problems and signed minority opportunity
pacts with such companies as Anheuser Busch, Burger King, Heublein
and Coca Cola.
   One day he would be launching boycott against Coca Cola, telling
blacks ``Don't choke on Coke.'' The next day he might be pledging
to defeat a proposed police chief or school board member.
   ``Nobody wants to be on PUSH's so-called list,'' said Heublein
spokesman Erik Pierce. ``He wasn't just a ragtag individual. He was
head of a significant organization.''
   PUSH had 32 chapters nationwide and Jackson's weekly sermons
were carried on live radio every Saturday.
   ``I think anybody that was in business knew about Jesse
Jackson,'' said Frank Sellinger, former head of Schlitz Brewery.
   The Schlitz-PUSH pact was signed before Sellinger arrived in the
late 1970s. But he said he heard from Jackson later when Jackson
fought the brewery's efforts to force out an unprofitable black
distributor.
   ``If PUSH decided to get on your case about something, you got a
real fight on your hands,'' said Evans. ``PUSH became the eyes, the
ears and the feet of the black community.''
   Those who dealt with Jackson say he was as canny and in control
behind closed corporate doors as he was firing up his followers.
   ``It wasn't a lot of yelling ... but it was, `You're going to do
this,''' said Pierce of Heublein.
   ``He was very businesslike. I found him to be tough but fair,''
said former Schlitz spokesman Ben Barkin. He said Jackson `'made it
clear his demands were either, or else.''
   Former Heublein spokesman John Cox said he never dreaded going
to the PUSH negotiations. Jackson was ``electric and charismatic,''
and a sharp negotiator.

<HEAD>EAST ST. LOUIS: cash bond.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The inmate who beat DeBow was placed in the same cell even
though empty cells were available.
   Kuehn said the state had repeatedly warned the city its jail was
being operated unsafely. ``The city was in an indefensible
position,'' he said. ``(DeBow's attacker) was only the bullet. The
weapon was trained and held by the city.''
   Carr called the case ``the avalanche that broke the camel's
back. If not that, it would be something else.''
   East St. Louis has long suffered a rough, ugly reputation. Its
history of gangsters, gambling dens and gun battles in the streets
has been updated only in the particulars, especially in politics.
   Last year, for example, a candidate for alderman was arrested
hours before the polls opened for barging into a radio station and
threatening to shoot another candidate, the host of a call-in show.
Charges were dismissed.
   Since 1980, guilty pleas have been entered by a police captain
who took bribes, a sergeant who sold drugs, a precinct committeeman
who committed murder and a St. Clair County board member charged
with unlawful use of a weapon _ he shot at a man he mistakenly
thought stole his car, said County State's Attorney John Baricevic.
   Two of last year's mayoral candidates were convicted in years
past of extortion, and a third was found guilty of forging
government checks and mail fraud. One had also pleaded guilty to
trying to arrange another's murder.
   Gentry himself faces trial on charges of misusing city money to
buy campaign advertisements for Officer. Other charges are pending
against Officer's administrative assistant and a second man, a
convicted rapist and unsuccessful aldermanic candidate.
   The city denies allegations that some police go without cars or
radios or cope with equipment in dangerously poor repair. Baricevic
said some police have bought their own radios and detectives have
used their own cars.
   If a cop ``gets shot at, how does he get help? He doesn't,''
Baricevic said. ``If he tries to get away ... (in) some of the
cars, you've got to roll down the window to get out of the car.''
   Because of the ever-rising crime problem, state troopers were
called in two years ago to help fight gangs and armed bandits
preying on motorists.
   ``The public response was overwhelming,'' said Bob Fletcher,
state police spokesman. ``People would wave to them from windows.
It's like the vets from World War II coming into towns into France.
It's the kind of things that brings tears to a cop's eyes.''
   As of May 1, the state police had made 2,250 criminal arrests,
and robberies and gang activities are down, said Capt. Bobby Henry.
   The city has received other assistance. Operating on grants, the
East St. Louis Community Foundation established an alcohol
treatment center and school-work program, but the association
fizzled in 1987.
   Former U.N. ambassador Donald McHenry, an East St. Louis native
and a former chairman of the community foundation, said that
despite hard work from many residents and the outside aid, ``most
of it was probably wasted'' due to inappropriate programs,
corruption, inefficiency and poor coordination.
   A former foundation director offers another assessment. City
leaders, said Handy Lindsey, ``make their own rules about
everything. If you come to that community and are not prepared to
play by their rules, they run you out.
   ``Nobody seriously gives a damn about East St. Louis,'' Lindsey
said. ``I think people who run it give a damn about their own
personal fortunes.'
   Still, Lindsey and others agree hope lies along the riverfront.
Bonds have been issued to build a port, a waste recycling facility
and middle- and upper-income housing.
   But some are skeptical the project will even get off the ground.
   Because of deadlines and legal questions, there's ``very little
evidence (the projects) will come to fruition,'' said Barry
Freedman, executive director of Target 2000, a private economic
development firm.
   A management company has sued the city for breach of contract,
alleging that a man acting for Officer tried to solicit a $500,000
finder's fee and, when no money was paid, the company was illegally
dropped from two riverfront projects.
   Even if Officer's plans fail, Freedman is confident the
riverfront will be developed. He mentioned other plans for
rejuvenation, including a proposal to extend a St. Louis park
across the river and make a national park.
   Freedman admits that promoting the city isn't easy.
   ``People tend to discount it automatically,'' he said. ``Once
they get past it, they're surprised at what they find. ... The
perception is worst than the reality.''

   Banks will reopen for nearly normal
operations next Monday after being closed for two months because of
Panama's economic and political crisis, the president of the
Bankers' Association announced Tuesday.
   Edgardo Lasso, the Bankers' Association president, said in a
television interview that to avoid a run on the banks, the amount
of cash depositors can withdraw will be restricted.
   ``We are trying to reactivate the economy of the country,''
Lasso said.
   ``We will take care of the public in all banking activities''
within the restrictions set by the government's Banking Commission
late in March, he said.
   Conditions for reopening the banks limit withdrawals to 25
percent of checking account balances as of March 3, the day the
government ordered banks closed. It sets a maximum of $10,000, with
the rest frozen for 90 days.
   Withdrawals of up to $50 may be made from savings accounts one
month after banks reopen.
   Payment of interest is restricted and subject to cash
availability in each bank.
   The commission has promoted a gradual reopening of the banks. On
April 18, it let them begin accepting deposits. Because of limits
on withdrawals, however, about 75 percent of the checks deposited
bounced, analysts and business people said.
   A week later, about a dozen additional services were resumed,
including handling letters of credit; collecting outstanding loans;
transferring funds within Panama, and making foreign exchange
transfers. But business people said the operations were largely on
paper and did little to help resolve their problems of liquidity
and credit.
   The association represents 93 of the 117 banks operating here,
most of them foreign.
   Both the March 3 closing and the reopening applied to the 67
banks holding licenses to conduct both local and international
banking business.
   Others also closed their doors because of the impact of the
crisis.
   Some closed as early as late February, after Noriega ousted
President Eric Arturo Delvalle following the president's attempt
tried to fire the military strongman.
   The political instability, U.S. economic sanctions and the lack
of banking facilities brought Panama's economy to a near-standstill.
   The Banking Commission had urged the banks to reopen with some
restrictions intended to ``maintain the cash position of the banks
and protect depositors.''

   A federal jury has acquitted an Oklahoma oil
contractor on charges of scheming to defraud Continental Illinois
National Bank & Trust Co., but failed to reach a verdict on two
bank executives charged in the case.
   U.S. District Judge Milton Shadur declared a mistrial Tuesday
after jurors said they were ``hopelessly deadlocked.''
   The government maintained during the 6{-week trial that former
banker William Patterson manipulated his two debt-plagued
co-defendants, John Lytle and Jere Sturgis, in a scheme involving
high-risk energy loans to save his own failing bank by defrauding
Continental.
   But the panel found Sturgis, an independent oil contractor from
Tulsa, Okla., innocent of wire-fraud charges. Patterson and Lytle
were charged with wire fraud and misapplication of funds.

   Oil futures prices have turned higher after
suffering a steep decline following OPEC's failure to agree on new
production cuts at its meetings in Vienna, Austria.
   In Tuesday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, June
contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude,
rose 23 cents per barrel to close at $17.37.
   The contract had dropped 85 cents on Monday, after the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries adjourned from
several days of meetings without reaching a production-cutting
agreement with independent oil producers.
   However, the cartel's inability to reach a consensus already had
been crimping prices in preceding days, said John O'Dea, manager of
international energy futures at the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
securities firm.
   ``Today was nothing more than a technical bounce-back,'' he said.
   Among refined products for June delivery, wholesale unleaded
gasoline jumped 0.91 cent to 50.28 cents per gallon, while
wholesale heating oil rose 0.82 cent to 46.77 cents per gallon.

   Xerox Corp. expects to continue nudging its
share of the world copier market higher with a new generation of
copiers offering more features at higher prices.
   The new 50 Series unveiled Tuesday is named in honor of the 50th
anniversary of the 1938 invention of plain-paper copying. It
includes Xerox's first personal copier, a model made for it by
Sharp Corp. of Japan.
   The new copiers are the successors to the 10 Series, which
helped the company begin to regain market share from Japanese
rivals after its inception in 1982.
   Wayland Hicks, a Xerox executive vice president, said Xerox
should continue recapturing market share from the Japanese with the
new machines, although the recovery will come more slowly than did
the rapid decline of the 1970s and early 1980s.
   ``Overall, I would say they're pretty impressive,'' said Eugene
Glazer, who follows Xerox for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Xerox long had resisted introducing a personal copier, saying it
could not justify the investment necessary to compete with Japanese
companies such as Sharp, Canon Inc. and Ricoh Ltd. that dominate
the low end of the market.
   Glazer said that even now the company's new personal copier ``is
not key to the company's strategy.'' It required only a small
investment by Xerox, because it is being manufactured by Sharp.
   The Xerox personal copier is a close cousin of Sharp's Z-55
except for the exterior casing, a small change in the paper-feeding
mechanism and alterations in the cartridges that make it impossible
for Sharp cartridges to be used in Xerox copiers and vice versa.
   The list price of $1,295 for the basic model is about the same
as the list price of $1,299 charged by Sharp for its Z-55. Actual
retail prices for both could be substantially lower.
   Xerox makes the other new copiers itself. The machines range in
size up to the 5090 duplicator, which starts at $145,000, makes up
to 135 copies a minute and can bind pages automatically.
   Chester Carlson, the inventor of the dry copying process,
created the first xerographic image on Oct. 22, 1938. His efforts
to market the invention were met with an ``enthusiastic lack of
interest,'' he later recalled, until the former Haloid Co. of
Rochester, N.Y., picked it up in the late 1950s. Haloid became
Xerox Corp.
   While the new Xerox copiers can not be compared directly with
their predecessors because they have more features, the prices are
about 5 to 10 percent higher than 10 Series machines with similar
copying speeds, said Roy Haythorn, a vice president for marketing.
   Haythorn said the strength of the Japanese yen made it possible
for Xerox to raise prices while remaining competitive with Japanese
rivals. Xerox recently announced price increases on its 10 Series
copiers.
   The personal copier will be sold mainly through retail stores
and office products dealers and will be available to resellers and
agents later this month. Order-taking for the big 5090 duplicator
will begin in major cities in the second half of the year.
   The rest of the line will be rolled out starting in major
Midwestern cities, beginning this month.

<HEAD>Texaco Asks Federal Court to Block Alleged Icahn Securities
Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN C. GIVEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. is counter-attacking takeover
strategist Carl Icahn, its largest shareholder and most threatening
potential antagonist.
   Alleging that Icahn has violated securities laws, Texaco asked a
federal court Tuesday to thwart his ability to use his Texaco stock
in moves against the oil giant.
   The suit filed at U.S. District Court in White Plains, N.Y.,
asked the court for an order blocking Icahn from soliciting
proxies, acquiring additional Texaco stock or voting the shares he
already holds, representing a 14.8 percent stake in the company.
   The nation's third-largest oil company also asked the court to
void Icahn's nomination of five candidates _ including himself _
for Texaco's 14-member board in elections to be held at the
company's June 7 annual meeting in Tulsa, Okla.
   Texaco said the purpose of Icahn's activities was either to
force the company to buy back his shares at a premium, to force its
acquisition by a third party or to acquire Texaco and liquidate its
assets _ in each case netting large profits.
   In seeking that goal, Texaco claimed, Icahn attempted to
``deceive investors and manipulate the market for Texaco stock''
with false and misleading statements. The company said Icahn's
group also had an illegal secret agreement to coordinate its stock
purchases with those of another ``substantial buyer,'' who was not
named in the suit.
   Icahn repsponded with a one-sentence statement issued at his New
York office, saying: ``We believe the lawsuit is without merit, and
will vigorously defend our right to communicate with other Texaco
shareholders.''
   Since last fall, when he began buying Texaco shares at prices
between $29 and $34 per share, Icahn has been an outspoken critic
of the company's management. He has offered to withdraw his slate
of directors if the company puts itself up for sale for $55 a share
or more, which Texaco officals have refused to do.
   Texaco stock fell 62{ cents to $49 a share Tuesday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Federal Judge Gerard Goettel scheduled a hearing for all parties
at 10 a.m. Thursday.
   Icahn's involvement with Texaco began in the last months of its
multibillion-dollar legal battle with Pennzoil Co. In 1985 a
Houston court ruled that Texaco, before buying Getty Oil Co., had
improperly interfered with Pennzoil's bid to acquire part of Getty.
   It awarded Pennzoil a judgment that stood at $10.3 billion in
April 1987, when Texaco filed for federal bankruptcy court
protection to avoid having to post a similar amount while appealing
the Houston judgment.
   Late last year, Icahn interjected himself as a mediator between
the two companies. In December, without his participation, the
companies agreed on a $3 billion settlement that formed the
keystone of Texaco's bankruptcy reorganization plan.
   Texaco emerged from bankruptcy last month and paid the $3
billion to Pennzoil. It subsequently expanded its original plan to
sell $3 billion of assets to $5 billion, mindful of the threat that
Icahn might attempt to take over the company in order to sell it
off piecemeal to raise the value of his shares.
   Among other things, Texaco's suit alleged that Icahn said ``he
did not intend to dispose of his stock or seek control of the
company, when in fact his true purpose was to force the sale of the
company, acquire the company himself and liquidate it or to extract
`greenmail' from the company.''
   Texaco also contended that:
   _Icahn illegally exploited confidential information he acquired
concerning the status of the settlement talks with Pennzoil in
order to acquire part of his Texaco stake.
   _Icahn's proxy for the slate of directors he plans to run
``fails to disclose important information about both Icahn and his
nominees,'' including previous SEC charges of ``serious violations
of federal proxy rules,'' and ``material arrangements or
understandings he had made with members of his proxy slate.''

   A stern message about proofreading that wasn't
proofread won one of the first annual Percy Awards given by a
private writing consultant for what he deems ugly business writing.
   ``There's a lot of bad writing out there,'' New York-based
consultant Gary Blake said Tuesday in announcing his personal
selections from more than 500 submitted letters, memos and
directives.
   The name Percy comes from ``pursuant to your request,'' a phrase
that he says weighs down the top of many memos.
   Blake _ who believes bad writing costs American businesses
millions of dollars a year _ said the most common business writing
mistakes were poor organization, wordiness, antiquated or overblown
phrases and sloppiness.
   The Percy-winning proofreading memo, submitted by a Pacific
Palisades, Calif. print shop employee, began this way: ``When asked
to `proof' something whether it is a letter, a bulletin, something
we are printing the follwoing should be the usual procedure.''
   Once readers got past ``follwoing,'' they still had to cope with
``prodedure'' for ``procedure'' and ``a rpoof'' for ``approve.''
   Dishonors also went to a U.S. Navy memo in Camp Hill, Pa., that
spent eight paragraphs explaining how to look for defects in
plastic office chairs; an unintelligible letter from an assistant
branch manager of a Seattle bank; a puzzlingly vague memo from a
Washington, D.C., magazine publisher regarding staff meetings; and
a scolding memo at a Des Moines, Iowa company that threatened the
removal of bathroom stall doors if employees didn't stop smoking in
there.
   Blake said his clients have included Hughes Aircraft Co.,
General Dynamics Corp., Chase Manhattan Bank and the Navy.

<HEAD>Mexico Will Maintain Oil Production Levels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico will maintain its current level of
crude production until OPEC agrees to cut its own production,
according to the government newspaper.
   Energy Secretary Fernando Hiriart was quoted Tuesday in the
newspaper, El Nacional, as saying Mexico would maintain its export
target of 1.36 million barrels a day until the 13-member cartel
reaches agreement on a production cut.
   Mexico, the world's sixth largest oil producer, was one of
several non-OPEC producers that last week held talks with the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries about reducing output
in a joint effort to bolster sagging world prices.
   Hiriart said OPEC had not rejected the proposal, and would
reconsider it in the coming months.
   OPEC wound up several days of meetings Monday in Vienna,
Austria, without reaching agreement on the production cutback
proposal.
   The cuts were to be made in conjunction with Mexico and five
other non-OPEC producers, which offered to lower their output by 5
percent or about 200,000 barrels a day if OPEC members did the same.
   Other non-cartel producers involved in the talks were Egypt,
China, Malaysia, Oman and Angola.
   While not an OPEC member, Mexico carefully monitors its
decisions and often follows its lead on pricing and production
policies.
   The nation's economy is heavily dependent on its oil industry,
which is the No. 1 source of foreign revenue needed to service its
foreign debt of about $100 billion, the second highest in the
developing world after Brazil.
   In an effort to ease the oil dependence, President Miguel de la
Madrid has pushed in recent years to expand sales of non-oil goods
to foreign buyers.
   A recent report from the National Institute of Statistics said
the nation earned $1.8 billion in petroleum sales in the first
three months of this year, compared to $3.5 billion in non-oil
exports.
   In all of last year, the nation gained $7.9 billion from crude
sales, a 41.2 percent increase over 1986 when oil prices plummeted
on the world market.
   The United States bought nearly 47 percent of Mexico's oil
exports last year, followed by Spain with 15.2 percent and Japan
with 13.9 percent, according to Pemex, the state-run oil company.
   Last July, the government boosted its export volume to 1.36
million barrels a day after maintaining an export target of 1.32
million barrels a day in the first half of 1987.
   Prior to the 1986 collapse in oil prices, the daily export
platform had been 1.5 million barrels.

   A jury's failure to reach a verdict on charges
that two former bank executives defrauded Continental Illinois
National Bank & Trust Co. shouldn't deter other probes of such
white-collar crime, federal prosecutors say.
   ``We sent up the best trial lawyer to try an extraordinarily
complex case. They did a good job,'' U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas
said Tuesday. ``The verdict is not going to deter us in any of our
bank-fraud cases.''
   After a 6{-week trial, the jury was ``hopelessly deadlocked''
and could not reach a consensus Tuesday in the cases of former
Continental executive John Lytle and William Patterson, former
executive of the now-defunct Penn Square Bank, of Oklahoma City.
   The jury acquitted co-defendant Jere Sturgis, an oil contractor
from Tulsa, Okla., of wire fraud.
   The government maintained that Patterson manipulated his
debt-plagued co-defendants in schemes to save his own failing bank
by defrauding Continental.
   Continental nearly collapsed in 1984 following a run on deposits
sparked partly by revelations of bad energy loans, and survived
mainly because of a $4.5 billion government bailout.
   Patterson was a Penn Square vice president until the bank's July
1982 collapse, and Lytle headed Continental Illinois'
energy-lending division.
   The government charged that Lytle, caught in spiraling personal
debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle, accepted kickbacks from
Patterson in exchange for financing high-risk energy loans for Penn
Square customers in 1981 and 1982.
   The indictment cited Lytle's involvement in $44 million in loans
made by Continental to 12 Penn Square customers, many without any
documentation.
   ``I am very disappointed,'' Lytle said after U.S. District Judge
Milton Shadur declared a mistrial after a week of deliberations.
``I had hoped for a resolution.''
   Valukas said he would huddle for a few days with assistant
prosecutors before deciding whether to seek another trial.
   Outside the courtroom, Patterson and his attorney, Warren
Bickford, had nothing to say to reporters. But in Oklahoma City,
another Patterson attorney, Burck Bailey, said he was disappointed.
   ``We were hopeful that the jury would return a verdict of not
guilty, but of course we're pleased on the other hand that there
was no guilty verdict returned,'' Bailey said.
   Sturgis was jubilant after the jury found him innocent.
   ``What can I say? The dream came true,'' he said.
   Attorneys for Lytle and Patterson contended Continental was
saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive
lending policy, not because of a fraud scheme.
   Lytle and Sturgis were accused of engaging in a related
``buyback'' investment scheme that began with Lytle buying into
Sturgis' oil operations in May 1981.
   Sturgis allegedly bought Lytle out less than a year later at
triple the original investment to improve his chances of getting a
Continental loan through Lytle, prosecutors said.
   The buyback scheme was devised as a way for Lytle to clear much
of his personal debt and for Sturgis, who was being pursued by
creditors over $100 million in business loans, to find a new
lending source, prosecutors said in closing arguments.

<HEAD>USG Sues Merrill Lynch Over Desert Partners Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp. has filed a lawsuit accusing Merrill
Lynch & Co. of illegally using confidential information to help a
Texas partnership launch a takeover bid for the company.
   The suit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, charges the
investment house provided Desert Partners L.P. with information
acquired while Merrill Lynch served as USG's financial adviser in
prior business deals.
   Merrill Lynch spokesman Fred Yager said, ``Although we have not
yet seen the lawsuit, we have reviewed the situation and Merrill
Lynch believes that no conflict exists in its involvement with
Desert Partners.''
   USG, a leading producer of gypsum and building materials, has
been fighting Desert Partners' hostile takeover attempts since last
October.
   This week, USG announced a restructuring plan to counter a $2.32
billion buyout offer from the partnership, which is headed by
oilmen Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown of Midland, Texas.
   USG's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for what it called a
misuse of confidential information in addition to the profits
Merrill Lynch will receive from ``the exploitation of USG's
confidential business information.''
   Merrill Lynch served as USG's financial adviser when it acquired
DAP Inc. last year and as its selling agent for the $59 million in
notes USG issued to acquire Masonite Corp. in 1984, the lawsuit
said.
   From both transactions, Merrill Lynch ``obtained confidential,
valuable and proprietary information about USG's financial
condition and long-term business prospects,'' the suit said.
   Desert Partners announced last week that Merrill Lynch is one of
its financial advisers and has committed $200 million of its own
money to assist the proposed takeover of USG.
   Merrill Lynch has agreed to be an equity partner with Desert
Partners throughout the transaction, obtaining 13.33 percent of
Desert Partners' profit if the takeover is not consummated and
gaining a 14.7 percent stake in USG if the deal goes through,
according to the lawsuit.
   USG said Desert Partners has paid Merrill Lynch $3 million in
fees and that the investment house will receive an additional $4
million when the takeover is completed.

   USA Today on Wednesday opened a printing plant
here, its third outside the United States, in the paper's latest
move to reach readers overseas.
   The newspaper will be transmitted by satellite from USA Today's
Washington headquarters for printing here by Consolidated
Newspapers Ltd., which is associated with Sing Tao Ltd., a
publisher of English and Chinese newspapers in the British
territory.
   USA Today, owned by Gannett Co., has a daily readership
estimated at more that 5.5 million at home and abroad.
   The paper's expansion into Hong Kong is intended to ``meet the
rising demand for the newspaper in the region and exemplifies our
commitment to better serve our readers abroad,'' said David
Mazzarella, president of USA Today International.
   USA Today also has printing plants in Singapore and near
Lucerne, Switzerland, in addition to 31 plants in the United States.
   The Hong Kong plant's opening coincided with a visit here by
members of the Gannett board headed by chairman Allen Neuharth, who
founded USA Today in 1982.
   Neuharth also is heading a Gannett news team on a global
newsgathering assignment dubbed JetCapade. The team has already
visited Central and South America, Africa, the Middle East and
India, and after China and other Asian countries will visit Europe
and the Soviet Union.

   Bargainers for Chrysler Corp. and
the United Auto Workers met through the night in attempting to
smooth out by today some last-minute snags in a proposed labor
contract covering 66,000 autoworkers.
   Negotiators, who stopped only for meals from Tuesday morning on,
had hoped to wrap up the contract by Tuesday night. But by evening,
UAW President Owen Bieber and Chrysler Vice President Anthony St.
John said they still had to resolve several, unspecified major
issues.
   ``We've got some issues we're both having some difficulties
with,'' St. John said late Tuesday. ``We're sort of in a holding
pattern.''
   Nevertheless, union officials said they still expected a
settlement today.
   Bieber said the last-minute snags were a normal part of the
bargaining process and would not keep negotiators from working
until they reach a settlement.
   Bieber and UAW Vice President Marc Stepp spent much of Tuesday
meeting with St. John and other Chrysler officials at the so-called
``little big table,'' where they use their authority to settle
issues, including contract economics, that can't be resolved at
lower-level negotiations.
   The two sides were working to fit an industry-pattern contract
established last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. to
the much-smaller Chrysler.
   The pattern contract already includes 3 percent lump-sum bonus
payments instead of wage increases in 1989 and 1990. But
negotiators must settle on the amount of funding for a crucial
job-protection program.
   That program requires the company to continue paying workers it
otherwise would lay off for any reason other than slow sales, until
funding runs out.
   Workers also were expecting a so-called signing bonus similar to
the $2,120 they each received for ratifying a three-year agreement
in 1985.
   ``If it doesn't include an upfront bonus, that would make
ratification difficult at my plant,'' said John Danski, president
of Local 1264 at Chrysler's Sterling Heights stamping plant.
   ``There's all this money flowing out of Chrysler right now, like
Lee (Iacocca)'s $17.9 million'' in 1987 earnings, Danski said. ``I
feel that our workers should get a piece too.''
   Under the pattern profit-sharing formula, Chrysler workers would
have received an average of $1,800 to $2,000 each, union officials
said. But unless the money is presented as a signing bonus,
Chrysler workers won't get 1987 profit-sharing.
   Both sides have withdrawn several demands that didn't fit the
Ford-GM pattern.
   Chrysler's current three-year contract expires Sept. 14 but
would be replaced by a two-year pact as soon as members ratify one.
   Once the two sides reach a settlement, it must be approved by
the 140-member national Chrysler council before it can be submitted
to the rank-and-file for a vote. The council meeting could occur as
soon as Friday if a settlement is reached today.
   On Monday, the UAW announced tentative settlements covering
about 7,000 Wisconsin workers who were employed by AMC when
Chrysler bought it in August and a local agreement covering 6,500
of them, who work at plants in Kenosha, Wis.
   The settlements cleared the way for a final push toward
agreement on the national Chrysler contract, which will cover about
1,200 Wisconsin workers after a 5,500-worker assembly in Kenosha
closes at year's end.

<HEAD>Government To Investigate Kuwaiti's BP Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain said today it would investigate the
Kuwaiti government's acquisition of a 22 percent stake in oil giant
British Petroleum Co. PLC to determine whether the investment harms
the public interest.
   The Department of Trade and Industry said it would refer the
acquisition, made by the Kuwaiti government's London-based
investment vehicle _ the Kuwait Investment Office _ to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   Trade Secretary Lord Young said ``the implications of BP coming
under the influence or control of a government with substantial oil
interests and which is a member of OPEC raised questions of public
interest.''
   Britain, the world's fifth-largest oil producer, is not a member
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and hasn't
cooperated with the cartel's efforts to control prices via
production restraints.
   BP shares were down about 9 cents to $4.99 on London's Stock
Exchange at about midday.
   The monopolies commission will deliver its report within four
months, the trade department said.
   The investigation does not necessarily reflect a government
intention to force the Kuwaiti government to sell any of its stake,
but might serve as a warning against further purchases.
   The Kuwait Investment Office, which refused to comment on the
referral, has said it is only interested in the BP stake as a
long-term investment. It has not indicated any plans for a takeover
bid.
   Last week, BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters told shareholders at
their annual meeting that the Kuwaiti stake ``is a higher
shareholding than one would wish to see'' and that it created
potential uncertainty about the company's future.
   Oil industry analysts said the government would be breaking new
ground in studying the stake. But some discounted the possibility
that Kuwait would attempt to acquire BP.
   ``There's just no great takeover story in this,'' said Carol
Bell, an oil industry analyst with the London investment firm
Phillips and Drew Ltd.
   The Kuwait Investment Office has accrued the stake over the last
six months. It began acquiring BP shares after the government sold
off its remaining 31.5 percent stake in the oil company in the fall.

   Stock prices marked time today as traders looked
ahead to Friday's report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 26.03 points in the
past two sessions, slipped back 4.48 to 2,053.88 by 10 a.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 515 up, 417 down and
489 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.20 million shares in the
first half hour of trading.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said
today that he looks for continuing improvement in the nation's
trade deficit.
   However, Greenspan added in written responses to questions from
the Senate Banking Committee, the trade improvement could lead to
increased inflation unless domestic spending is restrained.
   Analysts said those comments pretty well summarized investors'
mixed feelings at the moment about the economic outlook.
   If the Labor Department's monthly report due out Friday shows
continuing strength in employment growth, they observed, traders

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III was urged by
his friend E. Robert Wallach to get involved in a
telecommunications industry issue at a time when Meese owned
$14,000 in regional Bell stock, administration sources say.
   Meese subsequently obtained a White House waiver permitting him
to make a decision and then approved a reversal of the Justice
Department's previous position, urging a federal judge to lift
restrictions that were barring the regional Bell companies to enter
various new types of business.
   Meese, whose regional telephone stock holdings and meetings with
regional Bell executives have been under criminal investigation,
received Wallach's advice in a memo in mid-December 1986, according
to the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   James Rocap, a lawyer representing the attorney general in a
nearly-year-long criminal investigation of Meese's activities, said
Tuesday he had ``no knowledge that Mr. Meese ever saw or read the
memo.''
   Rocap said that Wallach's memo ``had nothing to do'' with
Meese's decision to seek a White House waiver permitting the
attorney general to approve the reversal in Justice Department
position.
   The decision to seek the waiver ``was based solely on the advice
of the attorney general's staff, out of an abundance of caution,''
said Rocap.
   Wallach is now under indictment for alleged racketeering in the
Wedtech scandal, in which Meese remains under criminal
investigation. In addition, it was Wallach who got Meese involved
in a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project which is another part of
the ongoing criminal investigation of the attorney general.
   The independent counsel investigating Meese also is examining
the $40,000-a-year job held by Meese's wife and funded by a
Washington real estate family which is leasing space to the Justice
Department.
   According to the sources, the memo from Wallach to Meese said
the Justice Department's antitrust division was making major
decisions in the telecommunications industry breakup. Wallach said
the decisions appeared to be going in the correct direction, but
that Meese should involve himself in the issue, said the sources.
   Wallach said in the memo that he based his comments on a lunch
with ``MH,'' whom the sources identified as Michael Horowitz, the
former counsel for policy analysis and law at the White House
Office of Management and Budget.
   Horowitz said in an interview Tuesday that he was beginning to
delve into telephone industry issues as a private Washington lawyer
at the time that he had lunch with Wallach. Horowitz said that he
did not recall any details of the lunch but that the two men may
have discussed telecommunications issues.
   Horowitz had joined the firm of Dickstein, Shapiro and Morin,
and Wallach was ``of counsel'' to the firm, which was analyzing for
the regional Bell companies factual submissions they had made to a
consultant, Peter Huber. Huber was hired by the Justice Department
to help the antitrust division determine whether restrictions on
the regional Bell companies should be lifted. Wallach's memo refers
to the Huber report, said Rocap.
   On Jan. 20, 1987, Meese obtained a waiver from then-White House
counsel Peter Wallison declaring that Meese and his wife's
telephone stock holdings were not substantial enough to influence
him or to cause the public to question his integrity.
   On Feb. 2, 1987, Meese approved a reversal in Justice Department
position and asked a federal judge overseeing the breakup of AT&T
to lift most of the restrictions on the types of business which the
regional Bell telephone companies could enter. The restrictions
included bans on making telephone equipment and providing
long-distance and computer services.
   Independent counsel James McKay has been trying to determine
whether Meese may have violated federal conflict-of-interest laws
by becoming involved in the issue when he owned stock in the
regional Bell companies.
   The White House waiver was based partly on incorrect or
incomplete information supplied to Wallison's office by the
attorney general's staff.
   The stock was worth $14,000, but the attorney general's staff
told Wallison's staff it was worth $9,611. In addition, Wallison
wasn't told that Meese already had met with executives of four of
the companies in 1985 and 1986. The executives urged that the
restrictions on their companies be lifted.
   Rocap says the meetings with the Bell executives were ``courtesy
calls'' which did not constitute substantial involvement by Meese
in the issue.

   The government's bankrupt Aeromexico airline
resumed service Tuesday to major Mexican cities with 10 planes, the
news agency Notimex said.
   The airline's 45 planes had been grounded since April 12, when
technical employees struck to protest planned cutbacks. Aeromexico
filed for bankruptcy four days later.
   Jose Castillo Arreaga, a spokesman for the Airline Pilots Union,
said the company's 765 pilots will rotate flying the limited

   Of the company's 1,485 flight attendants, 94 have been
contracted for the service, arranged for a 90-day period, an
official of the flight attendants union said.
   Regional airlines and Mexicana, the country's other major
airline, have taken over some of Aeromexico's 233 daily flights.

   South Korea has bowed to U.S. pressure
and agreed to remove most restrictions on the sale of imported
cigarettes, which could cut their price by 76 percent, trade
negotiators for both countries said Wednesday.
   Hwang Doo-yun, chief negotiator for South Korea's Trade-Industry
Ministry, said the two sides also agreed to extend the talks one or
two days to complete the negotiations on cigarettes, which had been
due to end Wednesday.
   Trade officials said South Korea will permit the prices of
imported foreign cigarettes to be lowered from the present $1.76 a
pack to about $1 a pack beginning in June.
   South Korea's domestic brands sell for as much as 81 cents a
pack.
   The talks could not be finished in time because of a U.S. demand
that South Korea permit cigarette advertisements through all news
media, the officials said. South Korea has said it would only allow
ads in magazines.
   No major progress was reported in talks on opening the Korean
market for U.S. agricultural products. Separate talks would be
called in June to continue discussion on this matter, the officials
said.

   Corn and soybean futures prices opened lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade while wheat futures gained
slightly.
   Weather forecasts continue to dominate price movement as soybean
planting begins, corn planting advances and the winter wheat crop
approaches maturity.
   Forecasts issued today predicted generally good planting and
growing conditions in most crop areas, which tended to depress
futures prices, said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``We're seeing a fairly typical spring situation _ scattered
showers, a little cooler, generally good conditions for crops that
are planted and dry enough for soybean planting,'' he said.
   Spilka attributed the light, early gains in wheat prices to a
technical rebound after some fairly significant recent declines.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to } cent higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $2.98{ a bushel; corn was { cent to
1 cent lower with May at $2.04\ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1\

   Cattle futures were mostly lower and pork futures were mostly

   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .08 cent higher with June at
71.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .15 cent
higher with May at 79.30 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to
.20 cent higher with June at 49.60 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to .18 cent higher with May at 51.25 cents a

   Livestock futures settled mostly higher on Tuesday while pork
bellies retreated.

   The European Economic Community
Commission said Wednesday that most EEC states have made
``signficant progress'' in adopting EEC law designed to prevent
major industrial accidents.
   EEC Environment Commissioner Stanley Clinton Davis, while
calling this ``encouraging,'' said there was a ``need for a better
inspection service in many member states.''
   The EEC Commission has pressed the 12 EEC states to adopt its
safety regulations after the November 1986, accident at Sandoz,
Switzerland, when large quantities of poisonous chemicals were
discharged into the Rhine River.
   EEC law forces industries that store or use dangerous chemicals
to reduce chances of an accident through strict safety measures and
public information campaigns. It also compels member states to
ensure their industries apply the law and provide regular
information about accidents to the Commission.
   Most member nations have amended their laws to comply with the
EEC regulations, Clinton Davis said in a statement.
   The only countries that have not taken any action are Italy and
Greece, according to the Commission.

<TEXT>
   LTV Corp. today announced a bankruptcy
reorganization plan that calls for no further layoffs or plant
closings but includes scaling back steel operations and
restructuring the company around existing business units.
   Dallas-based LTV's board of directors has already approved the
plan, which will be submitted to creditors of the
steel-and-aerospace giant for consideration, said Raymond A. Hay,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   LTV's bankruptcy, filed in July 1986, is one of the largest in
corporate history. Liabilities total about $6 billion and include a
$2 billion liability to the government-run Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp. _ LTV's largest creditor.
   Principal components of the reorganized LTV will be a smaller
but major steel company concentrating on flat-rolled products, two
aerospace-defense operating groups and a streamlined energy
products company sized for today's market place, Hay said.
   ``Today's action reflects our commitment to emerge from Chapter
11 as quickly as possible with a strong, reorganized company that
will be competitive in each of the industries we serve,'' Hay said.
   ``The settlement of claims and the financial restructuring of
the company, as proposed in the plan, are major steps in
fulfillment of that commitment,'' Hay said.
   Hay said he doubted the company would emerge from Chapter 11
this year because all creditors would have to agree on the
reorganization plan, which would then be submitted to bankruptcy
court.
   Bankruptcy-court protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws gives a beleaguered company a reprieve from
creditors while it devises a plan to stay in business and pay its
debts.
   While Hay said he anticipated no additional layoffs or plant
closings, he noted that the company is studying several
cost-cutting options and does not plan to reopen any plant it has
already closed.
   LTV has 48,115 employees worldwide.
   The reorganization plan also includes improving the bar segment
of LTV's steel business, which Hay said has been consistently
unprofitable.
   ``This is the most difficult part of the plan since we cannot
come out of Chapter 11 with any unprofitable businesses,'' he said.
   Since 1986, more than 35,000 claims have been filed against LTV,
although some were thrown out or discovered to be duplicates. That
leaves about 32,000 claims to be addressed in the reorganization
plan.
   LTV has also been feuding with the Pension Benefit Guarantee
Corp. over steel pension plans. The agency took over the plans in
1987 but then turned them back to LTV, arguing that the company
should have to fund them.
   LTV has argued it can't afford to do that, and the matter is in
court. Hay said the three LTV pension plans involved will remain
terminated in the interim, although he expects the PBGC to see a
``substantial recovery'' of the money LTV owes it.
   ``The cost associated with these pension plans was one of the
major factors that put LTV into Chapter 11,'' Hay said. ``The
reduction of costs resulting from their termination is crucial to
the company's successful reorganization.''

   Sears, Penney and Montgomery Ward. The names
once dominated American retailing, but growing competition from
specialty retailers and discount stores keeps challenging the
giants to rethink the business they helped create.
   The way they used to do business _ known as general
merchandising _ isn't working anymore.
   ``It's a very mature industry,'' said Joseph Ronning, a retail
industry analyst with the investment firm Brown Brothers Harriman
Inc. ``Mature'' means there is little opportunity for growth.
   As a result, Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest
retailer, is retooling its sales strategy and revamping its
management structure.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc., the fourth-largest retailer, already
enjoying some success from its shift to apparel, is moving its
headquarters from New York to Texas to cut costs.
   And Montgomery Ward & Co., the 11th-largest retailer, is going
private just three years after many observers expected it to go out
of business.
   At their height, Sears, Penney and Montgomery Ward stores
numbered in the thousands. Where they had no branches, consumers
could buy from their catalogs.
   But changes in American society affected the way consumers
shopped and the way these companies did business.
   ``The '70s was an era where people went to shopping malls and
had more time,'' said Barbara Loren, a consultant with Loren-Snyder
Marketing Inc. in Troy, Mich.
   In the 1980s, Ms. Loren said, working women have less time to
shop and when they need an item, they go to the store where they
are most likely to find it. Increasingly, specialty retailers are
the place they turn.
   Ms. Loren cited Toys R Us as a specialty retailer that has taken
away business from general merchandisers.
   ``I know Toys R Us will have the best selection and the price is
right,'' she said. ``I know I am going to come out with what I
want.''
   Home improvement stores such as Home Depot and electronics
stores such as Circuit City also drained business away.
   ``The specialists were clearly becoming the leaders in the
industry,'' said Bernard F. Brennan, chairman of Montgomery Ward.
``If we didn't begin to specialize, we didn't have much of a chance
to survive.''
   A further toll was exacted by discount store chains such as K
mart and Wal-Mart, which offered name brands at lower prices while
general merchandisers sold goods under their own labels.
   Penney was the first to change. In 1983, the company began to
move toward specialty retailing by focusing on its clothing lines.
It discontinued hardware and automotive items and closed
unprofitable stores.
   The strategy worked. Penney, in business for 86 years, has seen
its profitability improve dramatically.
   It was do-or-die at Montgomery Ward. In 1985, after years of
losses, the retailer closed its catalog operation and weakest
stores and eliminated money-losing lines.
   ``We clearly went to certain categories in which we had consumer
acceptance already,'' Brennan said in an interview.
   The 116-year-old Montgomery Ward is now a specialty retailer,
concentrating on appliances, apparel, automotive items and home
furnishings.
   But Sears _ headed by Edward A. Brennan, brother of Montgomery
Ward's chairman _ has been slow to catch on to new trends and has
become a follower instead of the industry leader it once was.
   ``They were the biggest and most powerful, the mostly likely to
be bound by tradition than anyone else,'' said Monroe H.
Greenstein, an analyst with Bear Stearns & Co.
   The attitude at Sears was, ``This is what Sears is, what we've
always been and what we'll continue to be,'' he said. As a result,
the 102-year-old Sears stagnated.
   The company tried to capitalize on its strong points, starting a
chain of paint and hardware stores in 1983. But not until 1987 did
Sears begin a push into specialty retailing.
   Its first steps were through acquiring other retailers, such as
Western Auto stores. Now it is experimenting with ``neighborhood
stores,'' outlets focusing on specific merchandise lines such as
home fashions.
   In its full-line stores, the company is trying to jazz up its
image, teaming with McDonald's Corp. and Walt Disney Co. to market
clothing, toys and other merchandise. And while it has sold
appliances only under its own Kenmore label, Sears will now offer
brand names, a strategy working for Montgomery Ward.
   Sears also recognizes its internal structure must change. In
March, the company announced it would overhaul its staff, reducing
the number of management levels and making each part of the
business more independent. It also wants to cut its costs, which
some analysts call the highest in the business.
   Sears Merchandise Group Chairman Michael C. Bozic indicated
Sears has become a giant bureaucracy that has to be more
manageable. ``We want to measure everything in a smaller arena,''
he said in an interview.
   Some analysts are cautiously optimistic Sears can do it.
   Greenstein said Sears' plans should increase their market share,
but just how sucessful the company will be is ``anybody's guess.''
   Walter Loeb, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co., predicted the
restructuring would be a difficult process that ``has to go slowly
to be careful not to step on any toes'' but that should pay off.
   More important, Loeb said, Sears ``has to be more responsive to
what the consumer wants.''
   Ronning, of Brown Brothers Harriman, was skeptical, noting
Sears' continuing growth in financial services through its Coldwell
Bankers real estate, Allstate insurance and Dean Witter Reynolds
investment operations.
   ``Sears is a company shifting from a retailer to a financial
services company,'' Ronning said. ``That is pretty much what the
thrust of the company is.''
   Montgomery Ward, however, is a proven success story. Before
Brennan became chairman in 1985, the retailer, owned by Mobil
Corp., was losing money. By transforming itself into a chain of
what Montgomery Ward calls ``value-driven specialty stores,'' it
became a profitable and attractive property that found the
financial backing to go private.
   Brennan said his company will continue to develop its specialty
format, but he doesn't see it branching into other directions.
   ``We are very comfortable with our structure,'' he said.
   Penney is hoping to reduce its overhead by moving to Texas. The
company won't say how many managers will relocate, but some reports
put the number as low as 15 percent.
   ``They've done a very expeditious job of replacing (management)
with qualified people,'' said Loeb. ``It may be disruptive, but
won't hurt them long term.''
   Penney won't fall behind retail trends by being in Texas,
because today's technology, including teleconferencing and
satellites, will ease the way, Ms. Loren said, adding, ``You don't
have to be living in New York to accomplish their goals.''

   Department stores have to be special these days
to hold on to their share of the retail market.
   ``They have to offer something that you can't find somewhere
else,'' said Barbara Loren, a consultant with Loren-Snyder
Marketing Inc. in Troy, Mich.
   Competition from specialty retailers, who have taken business
away from general merchandisers like Sears, J.C. Penney and
Montgomery Ward, has put big department store owners on the
defensive as well.
   Consumers who flocked to a Lazarus or May department store for
clothing, electronics and toys often turn now to stores like
Limited, Circuit City and Toys R Us.
   As a result, ``department stores as a whole have very, very
limited growth potential,'' said Fred Wintzer, an analyst with the
investment firm Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. in Baltimore.
   Some stores, such as Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom, are perceived
as unique with natiowide appeal and therefore can move into new
markets and win new customers.
   Customer service also can set department stores apart from the
specialty crowd, but it's been a problem for some companies.
   Tackling the service issue means more than adding sales help and
making merchandise returns easier. Stephen E. Watson, chairman of
Dayton-Hudson Department Stores Co., said it also may involve
changing store layout and appearance.
   ``The issue of how the store looks and its presentation is
important,'' said Watson, noting that consumers don't want to buy
new clothes in a run-down, drab store.
   It also means improving the merchandise mix, which today means
updating fashion lines so a department store can better compete
with specialty apparel retailers.
   The strategy has worked, but it also has changed the image of
the department store industry and moved the stores in the direction
of specialty retailing.
   ``They are purveyors of the current (fashion) image,'' said
Joseph Ronning, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman Inc.
``Department stores have evolved from being true department stores
to being what are primarily fashion stores.'' One of the best
success stories in department stores is R.H. Macy & Co. Inc., said
Ronning, crediting Edward S. Finkelstein, the retailer's chairman,
for turning the company around.
   ``Finkelstein came in and made major changes in the Herald
Square store, gussied up the first floor ... put in more inventory
per square foot,'' the analyst said.
   Macy also revamped the merchandise in all its stores, and in the
process won praise as a retailing innovator.
   Other department store owners also recognize their problems and
are trying to resolve them. Crumbling downtown stores are being
refurbished, and newer stores in shopping malls are also getting
makeovers. Batus Inc., the owner of Marshall Field's, plans to
spend $110 million just to renovate the chain's flagship store in
downtown Chicago.
   Monroe H. Greenstein, an analyst with Bear Stearns & Co., cited
Dillard Department Stores, a growing chain in the Midwest, and May
Department Stores Co., the nation's seventh-largest retailer, as
being among the nation's strongest department store owners.
   ``They have been more flexible with the changing times,'' said
Greenstein. Some department store companies learned too late they
should have changed their old-fashioned ways. Gimbel's failed to
keep up with the times and went out of business.
   Other examples of how not to run a department store company were
Associated Dry Goods Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc.,
Ronning said. Both companies' poor use of assets left them
vulnerable to takeovers. Associated was bought out by May in 1986
and Federated is being acquired by Campeau Corp.
   Analysts don't expect much growth in department stores, but they
also don't foresee trouble for the industry as a whole.
   ``They continue to have a future,'' said Greenstein. ``But you
have to be a strong operator.''

   A consumer in search of a television, tablecloth
or jacket has a variety of stores where he can shop. His choice
likely will depend on how much he wants to spend, the brand he's
looking for and the time he has available.
   The options include specialty stores, department stores,
discount stores, general merchandisers and hypermarkets.
   Analysts point out that the distinctions among retailers are
becoming more and more blurred. For example, department stores have
taken on a more specialized slant by concentrating on apparel, and
supermarkets are selling more general merchandise.
   These are the major categories of retailers and the markets they
serve:
   _SPECIALTY STORES. These concentrate on a specific type of
product, such as apparel, home improvement items or toys. They can
be independent stores or part of a chain such as Gap, Home Depot,
Toys R Us and Kinney Shoe.
   Specialty stores appeal to consumers because they offer a wide
selection of items within one category of merchandise. They're also
smaller than other retailers and less time-consuming to shop. Some
specialty retailers, in particular fashion stores, offer a certain
image that a consumer may be looking for.
   _DISCOUNT STORES. These offer a variety of merchandise
categories, including national brands, at lower prices. They offer
the convenience of one-stop shopping and one-stop checkouts.
Discount stores include chains such as Wal-Mart, K mart, Venture
and Target.
   _HYPERMARKETS. Such stores as Biggs and Hypermart USA offer the
same merchandise as discount stores, plus a full-line supermarket,
giving consumers lower prices and the convenience of one-stop
shopping.
   _DEPARTMENT STORES. Modern-day department stores generally serve
the moderate-to-upper end of the market, offering several
categories of merchandise with an emphasis on apparel and home
furnishings. They appeal to the consumer through their increasingly
upscale image and ambiance and by offering more services than other
retailers. They also offer one-stop shopping.
   _GENERAL MERCHANDISERS. Operations such as Sears, Roebuck and
Co., like department stores, offer a broad range of merchandise.
They emphasize their own labels, although national brands are
making their way into the selection. Their apparel lines tend to be
at the lower-to-moderate end of the market.
   _MASS MERCHANDISERS. Stores such as those operated by Woolworth
also offer a range of merchandise, generally at the lower end of
the scale. They offer the convenience of one-stop shopping and
lower prices.

<HEAD>Tenneco Boosts Quarterly Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc. profits jumped by 117 percent in the
first three months of 1988, boosted mainly by a one-time $25
million foreign tax credit, the company announced Wednesday.
   For the quarter ending March 30, Houston-based Tenneco recorded
profits of $63 million, or 38 cents per share, on revenues of $4
billion compared with earnings of $29 million, or 8 cents per
share, on $3.6 billion in sales during the same period a year ago.
   Tenneco's energy businesses had first-quarter operating income
of $205 million, compared with operating income for the 1987
quarter of $169 million.
   Despite lower domestic crude oil volumes and prices, and lower
natural gas volumes, exploration and production operating results
improved from the first quarter of 1987, the company said.
   Officials attributed the gain to higher natural gas prices,
improved international crude oil prices and volumes, and a benefit
for the reversal of excess prior years' windfall profit tax expense.
   The company's industrial businesses had first quarter operating
income of $69 million compared with $87 million for the first
quarter of last year.
   Tenneco Automotive, Packaging Corp. of America and Albright &
Wilson had first quarter operating earnings. Newport News
Shipbuilding had lower earnings largely due to a shift of
lower-margin contracts.
   Retail sales of farm equipment were much stronger in the first
quarter of 1988 for Case IH and the industry, indicating an upturn
in that business after nine years of decline. But Case IH posted a
larger first quarter operating loss than in 1987.
   The first quarter earnings included a one-time $25 million tax
credit for foreign taxes relating to Colombian oil operations.

<HEAD>Has Airline Deregulation Improved Highway Safety?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   According to a university study, the evidence is
quite strong: Airline deregulation has led to improvements in
highway safety.
   No, the study doesn't refer to highways of the air, as the air
lanes sometimes are called; the reference is to what most people
think of when they read the word ``highway,'' that is, a road on
the surface of the earth.
   The improvements, say two scholars, are significant: 1,700 lives
saved, 665,000 fewer accidents, a reduction of 66,000 in the number
of injuries and a $1.9 billion saving over what would have been
lost without deregulation.
   The authors, two Clemson University economists, say deregulation
of the airlines since 1978 has not only changed air travel patterns
but the pattern of highway travel as well.
   Most importantly, it has spurred travelers to use safer sky
routes rather than more dangerous surface transportation, say
Richard B. McKenzie and John T. Warner in their study for the
Center for the Study of American Business.
   The two professors concede air deregulation also might have
reduced air safety and slowed the long-run decline in air deaths.
But they say it is almost incontrovertible that the shift to air
did indeed make highways safer.
   Their conclusions are based primarily on two broad observations:
   1. After 1978 there was a marked ``structural'' decrease in the
growth of ground travel that was unrelated to changes in a range of
factors that normally affect driving, such as cost, income,
population and permissible road speed.
   Between 1979 and 1985, the time in which the statistical
improvements were compiled, annual passenger-car travel appears to
have droped an average of 3.9 percent below what might have been
expected.
   This and other evidence, they say, ``convinces us that
deregulation played a major role in lowering the growth in
automotive travel.''
   2. Relating the reduced surface miles to the rate and cost of
accidents per mile you come up with the statistics cited earlier.
If they seem overly large, the author's suggest you cut them in
half; what remains is still substantial.
   The authors observe that the calculations were more involved and
scientific than these points might suggest. For example, air
deregulation induced many people to fly rather than drive; but it
might have caused more driving, too.
   Deregulation, they explain, seems to have induced additional
air-miles to be flown by travelers who otherwise wouldn't have
taken as many trips. And this added air travel might have meant
more ground travel to get to airports.
   Secondly, greater efficiency in the airline industry due to
deregulation may have marginally increased national income and,
therefore, may have led to a greater demand for ground travel as
well as air travel.
   Such considerations give you an idea of how involved the study
became, but there were other things to measure as well. For
example, deregulation reduced air service to small rural airports,
forcing travelers to drive instead of fly.
   Moreover, the measurements were made more complex by the fact
that aircraft generally are flown in a more direct path to their
goal than automobiles are driven to theirs.
   While the authors agree that other scholars might quibble with
the specifics, such as the number of dollars saved, they stand firm
behind their general conclusion that air deregulation has reduced
ground-travel accidents.
   From this conclusion they distill a warning: ``Reregulation of
the airline industry could drive some air travelers back to the
nation's roads and could increase ground-travel accidents,
injuries, deaths and economic losses.''

<HEAD>Desert Partners Increases Proposal for USG</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Desert Partners L.P. today unveiled new
proposals in its pursuit to acquire USG Corp. that value the
company at about $2.58 billion in an attempt to top USG's own
restructuring plan.
   Under one scenario proposed to USG's board, Desert Partners
would pay $39 in cash, $9 in bonds and offer stock in a new company
for each of the Chicago-based company's outstanding shares. Wall
Street sources have valued the offer at about $50 a share, giving
the deal an indicated value of $2.58 billion.
   Under another scenario, Desert Partners would pay $50-a-share in
cash for 72 percent of USG's 51.5 million outstanding shares. The
remaining shares would be exchanged for bonds and stock in the new
company ``for the same aggregate amount,'' Desert Partners said in
a statement.
   USG has been fighting a takeover for months. On Monday the
building products manufacturer proposed a $2.2 billion
recapitalization plan that would pay shareholders cash and notes.
The company noted that it would have to sell off its Msonite Corp.
and Kinkead businesses to finance the restructuring.
   John L. Reed, Desert Partners' chief financial officer, called
his company's proposals ``clearly superior'' to the recapitlization
plan.
   The new proposals come less than a week after Desert Partners
said it would pay $45 a share if the two companies could negotiate
a friendly deal.
   Desert Partners, led by Texas oilmen Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack
E. Brown, is offering $42 a share in a hostile tender offer. That
bid, including debt securities and warrants valued at $42 each, has
a value of about $2.2 billion and remains in effect.
   Desert Partners owns about 9.9 percent of USG's shares and said
that as of last Friday about 19.3 million shares, or 37.5 percent,
had been tendered under its $42-a-share offer.

<HEAD>Brazil Prepares To Return to IMF After Three-Year Hiatus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN LEHMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil, strapped with the Third World's
largest foreign debt, has subdued its nationalistic rhetoric and is
preparing to resume negotiations for financial help from the
International Monetary Fund.
   Geraldo Moura, the Finance Ministry's press spokesman, said
Tuesday that an IMF mission was expected to arrive Monday in
Brasilia, the capital, to start negotiating an 18-month standby
loan of $700 million.
   The talks end a three-year chill in relations between Brazil and
the IMF, which was widely seen here as the epitome of foreign
intransigence and meddling in this country's internal affairs.
   ``Before the end of July, the agreement will be signed and
relations between Brazil and the IMF will have been formally
re-established,'' Moura said.
   He said the $700 million would help Brazil, which owes $121
billion to foreign creditors, to close this year's balance of
payments.
   Brazil stopped negotiating with the Fund in 1985. Critics said
the IMF's proposed cure for the economy was recessionary, and
nationalists protested that the agency's monitoring of Brazil's
economic performance was an affront to the country's sovereignty.
   Then-Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said this country would
never again submit an econmic plan for the Fund's approval. Brazil
would set its own goals, he said, and the IMF could take them or
leave them.
   But Brazil's independent stance made foreign bankers balk at
lending this country more money. And when the government in early
1987 suspended interest payments on about $70 billion owed to
private banks, debt rescheduling talks came to a near standstill.
   But late last year Brazil started to pay back some of the
interest due, and in January Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega
said the government would negotiate with the IMF ``an accord that
will be of interest to the country.''
   In March, Brazil and its private creditors reached a preliminary
agreement to reschedule over 20 years most of what this country
owes through 1993. Moura said only some legal details still had to
be worked out and that the accord should be signed in June or July.
   According to Moura, the outcome of the new negotiations with the
IMF will depend on an agreement on an acceptable size for the
government spending deficit.
   The government has said that this year the deficit will be cut
to 4 percent of the Gross National Product and to 2 percent in
1989. The deficit now stands at about 6 percent of the GNP,
estimated roughly at $300 billion.
   Moura denied reports that the IMF was pressuring the government
to slash its deficit to zero. ``That's something Brazil will never
be able to accomplish,'' he said.
   ``What the IMF wants is to see a downward trend in the deficit,
and this we are doing through the recent austerity measures,'' he
added.
   In April, President Jose Sarney announced deficit-cutting
measures that included a two-month wage freeze for government
workers, a limit on the number of jobs public employees can hold,
tax increases, financial incentives for early retirement or
voluntary resignation, and an end to federal wheat subsidies.
   The most important benefit of the agreement with the IMF, Moura
said, will be ``the reopening of credit lines from the Paris
Club,'' as the group of Western government lenders is called. He
said these credit lines would help finance Brazilian imports of
foreign machinery and other equipment needed ``to modernize our
industrial park.''
   He said the IMF accord ``has nothing to do with the debt
renegotiation agreement'' worked out with private creditor banks.
   ``The fact that both should be signed at about the same time is
coincidental, although it is obvious that an agreement with the IMF
will make private creditors breathe easier,'' Moura said.
   The agreement with the private creditor banks includes: a $5.8
billion loan to help pay part of the interest due in 1987, 1988 and
1989; the rescheduling, over 20 years with an eight-year grace
period, of almost $64 billion in interest and principal due through
1993, and spreads (the extra interest banks charge high risk
clients) of 0.8125 percent, down from the 1.66 percent Brazil now
pays.
   Meanwhile, Brazil, which has not paid any of the principal it
owes since 1982, has knocked off almost $400 million from its debt
in debt-for-equity swaps held in auctions at the Rio and Sao Paulo
stock exchanges in March and April.
   Through these swaps, creditor banks can exchange, at a discount,
part of what Brazil owes them in investments in Brazilian firms.

   Stock prices declined Wednesday after the

   Wall Street's lower opening added fuel to an already declining

   Traders said the bearish tone was set early in the session when
the Department of Trade and Industry announced that it would refer
the Kuwait government's purchase of a 22 percent stake in BP to the
Mergers and Monopolies Commission to determine whether it is in the
public interest.
   The referral ``completely depressed market sentiment and that

   The U.S. dollar rose Wednesday against all major

of higher U.S. interest rates. Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said trading was subdued because Tokyo markets were

   Stock prices drifted lower in slow trading today
as traders looked ahead to Friday's report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 26.03 points in the
past two sessions, dropped back 9.29 to 2,049.07 by 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally

   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said
today that he looks for continuing improvement in the nation's
trade deficit.
   However, Greenspan added in written responses to questions from
the Senate Banking Committee, the trade improvement could lead to
increased inflation unless domestic spending is restrained.
   Analysts said those comments pretty well summed up investors'
mixed feelings at the moment about the economic outlook.
   If the Labor Department's monthly report due out Friday shows
continuing strength in employment growth, they observed, traders
might interpret it as a portent of credit-tightening by the Fed.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweden's biggest private fortune was
built on a better milk carton, according to a new survey of wealth
in a country that discourages high incomes.
   The survey, published Wednesday by Affarsvarlden (Business
World), showed the four wealthiest families have left Sweden and
relocated their companies abroad to avoid a tax system designed to
equalize personal income.
   However, the magazine said its list of multimillionaires has
grown from 26 to 163 since its first survey six years ago.
   Thirty-one families were listed as having assets worth more than
one billion kronor. Three families would qualify as billionaires in
dollars. A dollar is worth just under six krona.
   The wealthiest family is headed by Hans and Gad Rausing, the
sons of Ruben Rousing who began producing milk cartons in 1952, and
in 1963 gave the world a flat-topped carton that can be packed and
shipped like bricks.
   Tetra Pak, the company at the base of the family fortune, has
its head office in Switzerland. The Rousing brothers, said the
magazine, are worth up to 30 billion kronor, or $5 billion.
   Second on the list is the family of Ingvar Kamprad who founded
IKEA, a chain store selling cheap do-it-yourself furniture and
accessories.
   Peter Wallenberg, head of Sweden's best known industrial family,
ranked 64th on the list. One distant relative was Raoul Wallenberg,
the diplomat who saved 100.000 Hungarian Jews from Nazi
extermination camps during World War II. He was arrested by the
Soviet army during final days of the war and disappeared.
   King Carl XVI Gustaf just squeezed onto the list in 158th place
with estimated assets of about 100 million kronor, or $16.6 million.
   Sweden's newest billionaire is Per Arwidsson, 35, who took a
small loan from a bank eight years ago and parlayed it into a
fortune on the stock market, the magazine said. He was 31st on the
list.
   Senior Editor Bjorn Franzon said the list was difficult to
compile fairly. ``We tried to evaluate the market value of the
family holdings in listed companies,'' he told the Associated Press.
   ``The situation is a little tricky. We are talking about family
equity because we don't care if the owner has transferred some or
all of his shares to one son or five sons ... for tax purposes,''
said Franzon.
   Most Swedes pay about half their wages in taxes, and the
marginal tax rate on top income brackets goes up to 75 percent.
Inheritance tax can amount to 100 percent, and even more, of an
estate.
   Franzon said the magazine's first survey of the super-rich was
in 1982 when the Social Democrats, who ran Sweden for 50 years,
were returned to power after six years of non-socialist government.
   The quantum leap in the length of the list was only partly due
to the government's economic policy, he said.
   That policy encourages business profits while heavily taxing
private income. Employee benefits and tax-financed government
welfare programs give Swedish workers one of the world's highest
standards of living.
   The growing number of millionaires could be attributed to a real
estate and stock market boom, despite the crash last October, and
by inflation, which pushed up the nominal value of the companies,
Franzon said.
   He acknowledged his earlier list was not as accurate as it
should have been.
   ``I'm a little ashamed to say that our journalism also is

<HEAD>Japan Retreats On Farm, Computer Chip Trade Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan retreated Wednesday in two trade disputes,
agreeing to arbitration over its restrictions on farm imports and
accepting a finding it violated world trading rules with its
pricing policies for computer chip exports.
   Dropping its long-standing resistance on the farm issue, Japan
said it would submit to arbitration on a U.S. complaint about its
import quotas on beef, oranges and orange juice.
   An international panel under the Geneva-based General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade will study and rule on the complaint.
   The renewed U.S. demand for a probe followed three weeks of
unsuccessful settlement talks with Japanese officials, according to
U.S. delegate Fred Montgomery.
   The restrictions are causing ``substantial harm'' to U.S.
exports, with up to $1 billion in lost trade possibly at stake, he
said.
   Japanese delegate Yoshio Hatano accepted the probe at a regular
meeting of the GATT Council, and said his country also will allow
consideration of a separate Australian complaint over the beef
quotas.
   In Tokyo and Washington, officials of both nations said they
still hope to resolve the beef and citrus issue in two-way
negotations in spite of the GATT proceedings.
   The GATT Council also approved a panel report ruling that Japan
violated GATT rules in the way it implemented part of a 1986
U.S.-Japanese semiconductor trade pact.
   The report found in favor of a European Economic Community
complaint, which effectively charged that Japan illegally tried to
rig the cost of certain types of computer chips in third markets
through an international price monitoring system.
   Hatano pledged Japan will take ``appropriate measures as soon as
possible'' to comply with the GATT ruling, but did not elaborate.
   The council of the 96-nation trade pact and agency traditionally
makes decisions by consensus, so Japan had the power to block
action on the farm or computer chips matters if it had chosen to.
   Delegates from Hong Kong and Singapore, both Southeast Asian
semiconductor producers, welcomed the report's adoption and urged
Japan to take action.
   Washington pressured Tokyo into the pact after U.S.
semiconductor makers complained Japanese companies sold computer
chips below cost in the United States.
   Last month, Japan blocked formation of a panel on beef and
citrus imports at a special U.S.-requested council session,
prompting U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter to threaten
retaliation.
   Australian envoy Alan Oxley said his country, once was Japan's
main beef supplier, has seen its share of imports drop from 74
percent in 1976 to 41 percent last year _ while the U.S. share rose
to 39 percent from 13 percent.
   In another development, the European Economic Community blocked
a U.S. complaint against EEC subsidies to promote processors and
producers of oilseeds and similar animal feed.
   Washington had sought a panel to investigate its charge that the
12-nation bloc's policies are illegally cutting into long-standing
U.S. soybean exports to Western Europe, which have been duty-free
under GATT since 1962.

<HEAD>Eastern Cancels Orion Pilot Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines said Wednesday it has canceled its
contract with Orion Air Inc. to provide strike-replacement pilots,
but pledged to remain flying in the event of labor troubles.
   Eastern, preparing for tough negotiations with the Machinists
union on its expiring labor pact, had contracted with Orion in case
its own pilots refused to cross picket lines, Eastern spokeswoman
Karen Ceremsak said.
   But U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker in Washington ruled in
March that the deal with Orion violated the existing contract
between Eastern and its pilots union. Replacements cannot be
trained until a strike begins, the judge said.
   Orion, based in Raleigh, N.C., is one of the largest U.S.
operators of aircraft for the small package industry. Miami-based
Eastern, the nation's sixth-largest airline, is a subsidiary of
giant Texas Air Corp.
   The Transport Workers Union filed a similar suit in April,
accusing Eastern of using its planes to train Orion flight
attendants to break a strike.
   Ms. Ceremsak refused to attribute the cancellation of the Orion
contract to Eastern's legal setbacks, however.
   The contract was terminated ``for sound business reasons,'' said
Ms. Ceremsak. ``Beyond that I can't elaborate.''
   The decision to end the contract does not mean that financially
troubled Eastern will shut down if the Machinists walk out, the
spokeswoman said.
   ``We do have plans to operate in case of a strike,'' she said.
``But our first priority is still reaching a settlement'' with the
Machinists.
   J.B. Stokes, a spokesman for the pilots union at Eastern, said
the federal court decisions against Eastern left the carrier with
no choice.
   ``This is just the inevitable recognition that you have to obey
court orders,'' said Stokes. ``The judge said you cannot train
(replacement) pilots in any capacity until such time as there is a
strike.''
   The cancellation will cost Eastern about $5.5 million under a
provision of the Orion contract, Stokes said.
   Ms. Ceremsak refused to comment on any provisions of the
contract or its cancellation.

   Lucky Stores Inc. said Wednesday it is
talking with third parties interested in buying the Arizona and
Florida stores that make up nearly a third of the chain.
   Lucky, the nation's sixth-largest supermarket chain, began the
negotiations Monday, said spokeswoman Judy Decker. She declined to
elaborate.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Lucky
said it is holding the talks with the consent of Gibbons, Green,
van Amerongen Ltd. The New York-based investment firm has agreed to
acquire all of Lucky's outstanding shares for $2.35 billion, or $61
a share.
   That deal is an effort to block hostile suitor and competitor
American Stores Co. of Salt Lake City, which made an initial offer
of $45 a share five weeks ago and has since increased it to $60.
American Stores has said it is considering making a higher offer.
   Documents filed on the agreement with Gibbons, Green, van
Amerongen said Lucky's stores in Arizona and Florida are
dispensable to reduce debt from the transaction. Stores in those
two states represent roughly 30 percent of the 481 stores that
Lucky operates.

   Stock prices slumped in slow trading today as
traders looked ahead to Friday's report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 26.03 points in the
past two sessions, dropped back 12.27 to 2,046.09 by 3 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 4 to 3 in the overall tally

   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said
today that he looks for continuing improvement in the nation's

   However, Greenspan added in written responses to questions from
the Senate Banking Committee, the trade improvement could lead to
increased inflation unless domestic spending is restrained.
   Analysts said those comments pretty well summed up investors'
mixed feelings at the moment about the economic outlook.
   If the Labor Department's monthly report due out Friday shows
continuing strength in employment growth, they observed, traders
might interpret it as a portent of credit-tightening by the Fed.

   Grain futures prices closed mostly higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade while soybeans posted
modest losses.
   Activity in both soybeans and corn, which showed only the
slightest improvement, was primarily influenced by forecasts for
favorable planting and growing weather, analysts said.
   ``We saw the effects of a fairly normal seasonal forecast with
some showers, possibly into the weekend, then generally good
conditions for planting the rest of the corn,'' said Walter Spilka,
an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Longer-range forecasts indicated conditions also would favor the
beginning of soybean planting next week, Spilka said.
   Wheat and oat prices rebounded after four straight days of
losses as traders hunted for bargains, Spilka said.
   But with the winter wheat crop nearing maturity, wheat prices
are expected to continue their seasonal decline, he said.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.01{ a bushel; corn was unchanged
to \ cent higher with May at $2.04} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to

<TEXT>
   The chairman of takeover target Cadbury Schweppes
PLC on Wednesday called on the government to block foreign raids of
Britain's confectionery companies, which have been dubbed the candy
bar wars.
   Cadbury Chairman Sir Adrian Cadbury told shareholders at the
company's annual meeting that the British confectionery industry
has been in turmoil since U.S.-based General Cinema Corp. announced
last week it planned to increase its 17.7 percent stake in Cadbury,
possibly through a tender offer.
   In the same week, Swiss-based Nestle SA launched a hostile $3.9
billion bid for British confectioner Rowntree PLC.
   Nestle said Wednesday it increased to 6.7 percent its holding in
Rowntree, which makes the Kit Kat candy bar. But Switzerland's
Jacobs Suchard SA, Nestle's rival in the battle for Rowntree, said
its stake in the British candy maker has been boosted to 23.5
percent.
   The raids on Cadbury and Rowntree, both major players in the
world confection market, have sparked an uproar in Britain.
   Cadbury said the government should not allow the stock market to
decide the fate of the companies.
   ``There are a number of public interest issues involved, which
it is for the government rather than the market to take into
account,'' he said.
   He stressed that the two Swiss companies were protected from
hostile bids in their own country while they were free to try to
acquire British companies.
   Both Cadbury and Rowntree represent ``generations of patient
British investment, and they are appreciating assets. So where the
returns from them are to flow in the future is an issue of national
significance,'' he added.
   Rowntree has not directly appealed to the government for
intervention but is discussing the matter with ``one or two
people,'' said a company spokesman who asked not to be identified.

<HEAD>FCA Posts $63.2 Million First-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial Corp. of America, the troubled
savings and loan company that federal regulators are trying to
rescue, reported Wednesday it lost $63.2 million in the first
quarter.
   That compares to a profit of $9.2 million, or 17 cents a share,
in the year-ago quarter. The first-quarter deficit follows a $224.6
million loss posted in the previous quarter by the nation's
second-largest thrift holding company and parent of American
Savings of Stockton, Calif.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which is negotiating a
possible sale of FCA to the Bass Group of Texas, has pledged to
protect depositors and general creditors of American Savings, which
has 208 offices in California.
   American's net worth stood at a negative $212 million at the end
of the quarter, in contrast to $496.7 million a year earlier.
Assets totaled $30.6 billion as of March 31.
   FCA Chairman William Popejoy said he welcomed the Bass Group's
interes. Bass recently edged out Ford Motor Co. to secure a bank
board promise of exclusive negotiations for 75 days.
   ``I believe this recently announced agreement ... has tremendous
potential for American Savings,'' Popejoy said. ``We have
consistently stated that strengthening the capital base is our top
priority. We respect the Robert M. Bass Group's reputation as
first-class business people.''
   A drain on deposits, which FCA had blamed on publicity about its
problems, apparently eased at the end of the quarter. As of March
31, the net deposit decrease for the quarter stood at $319.5
million, an improvement from the $493 million decrease the company
said it suffered in the first two months of the year.
   Deposits totaled $16.4 billion as of March 31, down from $17.7
billion a year earlier.
   In the first quarter, FCA added $107 million to its reserve for
bad loans, bringing the total reserve to $1.2 billion.
   FCA lost $468 million in 1987. The company posted profits of
$95.4 million in 1986 and $53.2 million in 1985 after losing $512
million in 1984, when its troubles began.
   The thrift has been plagued by bad loans on real estate in
economically troubled areas of California and Texas.

   While declining to say whether Control Data
Corp. has become a possible takeover target, the company's chairman
told shareholders Wednesday that management will fight to keep the
computer maker independent.
   ``I have great confidence in Control Data management to pursue
the vital task of enhancing shareholder value,'' said Robert Price,
chairman, president and chief executive officer of
Bloomington-based Control Data. ``We will fight to remain an
independent company.''
   Price met with shareholders Wednesday for the company's annual
meeting.
   On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Belzberg
family of Canada had bought a stake in the company and may be
considering a bid for it.
   At a news conference after the shareholders' meeting, Price
refused comment on whether a takeover attempt of Control Data is
under way.
   ``We don't comment on speculation and rumors,'' Price said.
   Control Data's stock rose $1.75 a share on Tuesday and was up
another 50 cents a share at $27.12{ a share shortly before the
close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
   The report of a possible takeover bid by the Belzberg family is
the latest in a series of takeover and break-up rumors that have
come since Control Data reported total losses of $832 million in
1985 and 1986. Net earnings in 1987 were $19.3 million, or 45 cents
a share, and Price said the company is still in the midst of a
turnaround.
   Despite a projection in Control Data's 1987 annual report that
the company will have a negative cash flow through most of 1988,
Price said Wednesday ``there is some good news in each of our major
areas.''
   He said the company continues to see profit margin improvements
in its data storage division, where new disk drive products were
introduced in 1987. The division suffered serious setbacks in 1985
and 1986.
   Cash flow will be held down in 1988 because the company needs to
keep spending money on improvements in data storage and other
divisions, including supercomputer subsidiary ETA Systems, Price
said.
   ``You can't do these things without spending money,'' Price
said. ``We have to be able to invest in the businesses we have
pursued.''
   Price also said he is comfortable with the size of the company's
debt load, which is between $450 million and $500 million.
   John Buckner, the company's chief financial officer, said the
terms on the debt could be better. But he said the company's
debt-to-equity ratio improved to 42 percent at the end of 1987 from
56 percent the year before.

<HEAD>LTV Discloses Bankruptcy Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY JORDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two years after seeking federal bankruptcy
protection, LTV Corp. on Wednesday unveiled a reorganization plan
that keeps the steel-aerospace giant largely intact but scales back
its steel operations.
   The reorganization plan envisions no further layoffs or plant
closings, although it includes restructuring the company around
existing business units.
   Chairman Raymond Hay said LTV's principal components will be a
down-sized steel company concentrating on flat-rolled products, two
aerospace and defense operating groups and a streamlined energy
products division.
   The plan, approved by LTV's board of directors, will be
submitted to creditors for consideration, Hay said. U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Burton Lifland, who had given the company a May 20 deadline
for the proposal, must also agree on the proposal.
   ``It has been our commitment from the beginning to emerge from
Chapter 11 as quickly as possible with a strong, reorganized
company that will be competitive in each of the industries we
serve,'' Hay said.
   LTV sought protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy laws in July 1986, one of the largest filings in
corporate history. Liabilities total about $6 billion and include a
$2 billion claim by the government-run Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp. _ LTV's largest creditor.
   The reorganization hinges on three LTV Steel pension plans,
terminated by the PBGC in early 1987. The agency took over the
plans but then turned them back to LTV, arguing that the company
should fund them.
   The dispute is now in a New York court, but Hay said the company
is confident it will prevail.
   ``It is our contention that LTV Steel did not have the ability
to fund these pension plans when they were terminated, and it does
not have the ability now,'' he said.
   ``The cost associated with them was one of the major factors
that put us into Chapter 11,'' Hay said. ``And the reduction of
costs resulting from their termination is crucial to the company's
successful reorganization.''
   Hay said he expected the company, which employs 48,115 workers
worldwide, to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings some time next
year.
   ``The thing that delayed our ability to come out as soon as we
had hoped to was the issue with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.
And that has pretty much slowed everything down,'' he said.
   Sources told the Dallas Times Herald the reorganization plan is
likely to be revised during court negotiations, and that it could
offer creditors no more than 30 cents on the dollar, mainly as an
equity stake in the company.
   Hay said several years of weakness in LTV's steel and energy
businesses, along with operating and liquidity problems that
developed in mid-1986, caused the company to seek bankruptcy
protection.
   But, he said, the company's steel operations were more efficient
than two years ago, aerospace and defense sectors were restructured
to ``sharpen the focus of on our principal lines of business'' and
energy operations were scaled down.
   Bill Deatherage, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
New York, predicted LTV will succeed.
   ``If you have a company with a substantial amount of revenues
related to aircraft, with fewer and fewer new military programs
coming on line, then these guys will have to redirect their future
somewhere,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dozen companies that represent more than 80
percent of the nation's computer and communications sales joined
Wednesday to endorse a set of standards that will some day allow
effortless communication between computers of different designs.
   The companies committed themselves to following Open Systems
Interconnect standards because of strong pressure from customers,
who are tired of computers that can't easily talk to each other.
   The federal government, the nation's biggest computer customer,
has warned computer makers that starting two years from now it will
not buy any equipment that does not follow the Open Systems
Interconnect standard, except by special waiver.
   Many big computer makers have been cautious about embracing
standards, fearing they will lose their loyal customers once it
becomes easy to mix and match computers from different suppliers.
   Wednesday's new conference in New York was a demonstration that
the companies feel they have more to lose by rejecting standards
than by embracing them.
   ``This is an epochal event, and it's all customer-driven. That's
what's so extraordinary,'' said Jonathan Fram, an analyst for Bear,
Stearns & Co.
   The 12 companies will demonstrate products that follow the Open
Systems Interconnect standard at a trade show in June in Baltimore.
   Showcased will be products for electronic mail and file
transfer. All major computer makers already offer ways to do those
jobs, but at the show they will demonstrate how they can do them in
compatible ways.
   ``OSI has left the drawing boards,'' said Lincoln Faurer,
president and chief executive of the McLean, Va.-based Corporation
for Open Systems, which brought the companies together.
   The dozen companies represented were International Business
Machines Corp., American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Control Data
Corp., Data General Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard
Co., Honeywell Bull Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., Unisys Corp., Wang
Laboratories Inc., Xerox Corp., NCR Corp., and Telenet
Communications Corp., part of US Sprint Communications Co., the
joint venture of GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc.
   Standards save money, said Murray Weidenbaum, a former chairman
of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, who was invited
to speak at the news conference.
   General Motors Corp. cut the frequency of downtime in half and
the length of downtime episodes to 5 minutes from 15 minutes when
it put a standards-based manufacturing system into its truck and
bus plant in Pontiac, Mich., said Weidenbaum, who is at Washington
University in St. Louis.
   The Defense Department expects to save 15 to 80 percent off the
cost of its antiquated, $800 million-a-year communications system
when it builds a new one that is based on Open Systems Interconnect
standards, said Michael Corrigan, a Defense Department computer
expert.

<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
accused Endotronics Inc. of reporting millions of dollars of phony
sales between 1985 and 1987 in violation of security laws.
   In charges filed Tuesday in federal court in Minneapolis, the
SEC also accuses the Coon Rapids-based biotechnology company of
filing false reports with the government and covering up that the
company's founders, Micheal and Eugene Gruenberg, were secretly
financing the sale of its instruments to foreign customers.
   In a simultaneous filing, Endotronics, while neither admitting
nor denying the charges, agreed to a permanent injunction barring
it from such actions in the future, the SEC said.
   ``We merely have agreed to manage the business professionally
and in accordance with SEC rules and the law,'' Monis Schuster,
general counsel for Endotronics, said Wednesday. ``We have clean
hands,'' she said, adding that the allegations stem from the
company's previous management.
   The injunction, if approved by U.S. District Judge Paul
Magnuson, would close the book on the SEC's investigation of
Endotronics, said Mary Keefe, chief of enforcement in the SEC's
Chicago office, which conducted the investigation.
   She said the Justice Department must decide if criminal charges
will be filed.
   Richard Sakowicz, Endotronics' current president, said Wednesday
the SEC filing, called a consent decree, does not call for any fine
against the company. It is significant because it marks the end of
the SEC and FBI investigation, which current management has
cooperated with, Sakowicz said.
   The SEC and the FBI have been investigating Endotronics, which
makes machines for use in genetic engineering, for more than a year.
   The company filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the bankruptcy code last year after the investigations were
disclosed. The disclosure came during a highly publicized effort by
the company to get the 1987 Legislature to free $24 million in
taconite production tax funds for economic development on the Iron
Range. The company said it wanted the money for research which it
said could lead to a plant in Hibbing.
   Endotronics has since emerged from bankruptcy under new
management.
   The SEC, in its first formal charges against Endotronics,
alleges that founders Micheal and Eugene Gruenberg supplied at
least $5.9 million of their own money to pay for machines that
supposedly had been sold to customers.
   The Gruenbergs and other company officials have been sued by a
group of shareholders who allege the officials faked sales to
inflate the company's stock price and defraud investors.
Endotronics stock peaked at $35.50 in August 1986, before falling
to less than $1 last year.
   The stock closed at $1.62{ Wednesday on the over-the-counter
market, down 25 cents a share.
   The SEC said at least $3.4 million of the company's sales in
Japan were false, because the customers had no firm obligation to
pay for them.
   Eugene Gruenberg, former chairman and cofounder of Endotronics,
declined to comment. He and his son, Micheal, former president of
the company, resigned last year.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed against key currencies
Wednesday in light domestic trading, which dealers attributed to a
lack of economic news.
   Gold prices rose slightly in the United States after falling in
Europe and Asia. In New York, Republic National Bank quoted bullion
at $444.40 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $443.25 Tuesday.
   Currency brokers in the United States said there was little to
influence the dollar's behavior, so the currency rose or fell
marginally based on short-term trading strategies.
   ``We're just sitting here in a very narrow range,'' said James
Hohorst, managing director of foreign exchange trading for
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in New York.
   Some traders said the dollar was mildly affected by conflicting
speculation about the the Labor Department's impending report on
April unemployment, due Friday.
   Stronger employment figures would imply greater demand for
imports and higher inflation, which would erode the dollar's value.
Conversely, weaker employment figures could help ease fears of
inflation and boost the dollar.
   Currency markets were closed in Japan for a national holiday. In
London, the dollar rose to 124.95 Japanese yen from 124.83 yen late
Tuesday. But later in New York, the dollar traded at 124.68 yen,
down from 125.15 late Tuesday.
   The British pound fell in London to $1.8650 from $1.8715. Later
in New York, the pound fetched $1.8652, less valuable than $1.8683
on Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Tuesday
included: 1.6779 West German marks, down from 1.6795; 1.3973 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3988; 1.2355 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2357; 5.7020 French francs, down from 5.7115; 1,249.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,249.375.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday
included: 1.6796 West German marks, up from 1.6770; 1.4000 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3945; 5.7075 French francs, up from 5.6935;
1.8840 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8795; 1,250.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,247.50; and 1.2353 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2294.
   Gold fell in active European trading. In London, gold dropped to
a late bid price of $444 a troy ounce vs. $445.50 bid late Tuesday.
In Zurich, it dropped to $443.50 vs. $446. Earlier in Hong Kong,
gold fell to $444.71 vs. $446.57.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery was quoted at $444.80 a troy ounce, up $1.30 from Tuesday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to $6.35 a troy ounce, down from
$6.39. On the New York Comex, silver bullion for current delivery
rose 2.9 cents to $6.327.

   Stock prices took a tumble in light trading
Wednesday as traders looked ahead to Friday's report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 26.03
points in the week's first two sessions, fell back 22.05 to
2,036.31.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 3 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 561 up, 923 down and 514 unchanged.
   Big Board volume slowed to 141.32 million shares from 176.92
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index lost
1.27 to 147.30.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said
Wednesday that he looks for continuing improvement in the nation's
trade deficit.
   However, Greenspan added in written responses to questions from
the Senate Banking Committee, the trade improvement could lead to
increased inflation unless domestic spending is restrained.
   Analysts said those comments pretty well summed up investors'
mixed feelings at the moment about the economic outlook.
   If the Labor Department's monthly report due out Friday shows
continuing strength in employment growth, they observed, traders
might interpret it as a portent of credit-tightening by the Fed.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1] at 113\; Philip Morris, down 1} at 86{; General
Electric, down 1 at 39~; General Motors, down ~ at 76, and American
Telephone & Telegraph, down | at 26].
   USG climbed 1| to 46\ in active trading. Desert Partners made a
new takeover proposal for the company with a deal involving a
combination of cash and securities.
   Conseco posted the day's best percentage gain, jumping 2[ to
13}. The company said a management group led by its chairman and
president made a buyout proposal at $13.50 a share.
   Allegis gained 5\ to 90. A union representing pilots at the
company's United Airlines raised the possibility of a $110-a-share
cash merger offer if the union prevails in a court action filed
last week.
   Arkansas Best rose | to 23], touching a new 52-week high. A
$20-a-share bid for the trucking company by a venture of two
partnerships announced on Monday has touched off speculation on
Wall Street about the possibility of a higher offer or offers.
   Coleco dropped ] to 2{. On Tuesday the loss-plagued company said
it laid off 475 employees.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $19.61 billion, or 0.75
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 169.67 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 3.17 to 303.53, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.68 at 260.32.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped .61 to 381.62. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 302.54, down .68.

   Oil futures prices slipped lower Wednesday,
pressured by a continuing negative mood in the market and a report
that showed larger-than-expected domestic inventories in gasoline
and crude.
   June contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark
crude, fell 17 cents per 42-gallon barrel to close at $17.20 on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among refined products for June delivery, wholesale unleaded
gasoline lost 0.56 cent per gallon, settling at 49.72 cents, while
wholesale heating oil dropped 0.57 cent to 46.20 cents per gallon.
   In a weekly report issued after the market's close Tuesday, the
American Petroleum Institute, a Washington-based trade
organization, said gasoline supplies jumped 5.9 million barrels in
the week ended April 29, while crude stocks were down by 700,000
barrels.
   Both figures left ``more inventory than was expected,'' said
Mary L. Haskins, an analyst at the Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
securities firm.
   The figures put downward pressure on prices because they
indicated continuing abundant supplies for existing demand.
   Ms. Haskins also said the market remained depressed by a
perception that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
will be unable to agree on a way tighten up its production, even
when it meets next month in Vienna.
   In addition, she said technical factors contributed to the day's
slumping prices.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Pressured By Breakdown Of Japan Trade Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A breakdown in talks between the United States and Japan over
Japanese restrictions on imports of beef and oranges helped push
live cattle futures prices lower Wednesday.
   Analysts said the Agriculture Department's downward revision of
its March cattle slaughter estimate would likely become a negative
factor in Thursday's trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   On other exchanges Wednesday, grain futures advanced while
soybeans retreated; precious metals were higher; energy futures
were lower and stock-index futures fell.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced in
Washington that the United States, with Japan's approval, had asked
an international trade panel to settle the beef-and-oranges
dispute. It was the second collapse in the negotiations since late
March, when a four-year agreement on Japanese beef and citrus
import quotas expired.
   ``The cattle market ... came under pressure during the day as it
appeared there would not be an agreement reached between Japan and
the United States,'' said Charlie Richardson, a livestock analyst
in Denver with Lind-Waldock & Co.
   Despite the market activity, Richardson said beef trade with the
Japanese accounts for a very small share of the U.S. cattle market.
   Meanwhile, the USDA said Wednesday afternoon it had
overestimated the number of cattle slaughtered in March by 44,000
head and revised that number accordingly.
   Richardson said the revision was ``nothing but bearish on the
cattle futures.''
   The correction should help clear up industry concerns over
discrepancies between USDA daily estimated slaughter totals and the
weekly actual figures.
   Feeder cattle futures finished mixed while pork futures advanced
on ideas that hog slaughters have passed a seasonal peak,
Richardson said.
   Live cattle settled .53 cent lower to .03 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in June at 71.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .10 cent lower to .40 cent higher with May at 79.55 cents a
pound; hogs were .17 cent to .95 cent higher with June at 50.45
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .22 cent lower to .23 cent
higher with May at 51.17 cents a pound.
   Grain futures settled mostly higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade while soybeans posted modest losses.
   Activity in both soybeans and corn, which showed only the
slightest improvement, was primarily influenced by forecasts for
favorable planting and growing weather, analysts said.
   Longer-range forecasts indicated conditions also would favor
soybean planting when it begins in earnest next week.
   Wheat and oat prices rebounded after four straight days of
losses as traders hunted for bargains.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 3} cents higher with May at $3.01{ a
bushel; corn was unchanged to \ cent higher with May at $2.05 a
bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 3 cents higher with May at $1.60\ a
bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 5 cents lower with May at $6.84\
a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures posted slight gains on the Commodity
Exchange in New York in reaction to the dollar's weakness against
the Japanese yen, analysts said.
   For the second day in a row, gold futures did not follow crude
oil futures, which finished slightly lower. Inflation-sensitive
precious metal prices often follow oil prices closely.
   Gold settled $1.50 to $1.60 higher with June at $446.60 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.9 cents to 2.9 cents higher with May at $6.327
a troy ounce.
   Oil futures prices slipped lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in response to an American Petroleum Institute report
showing larger-than-expected domestic inventories of gasoline and
crude, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 17 cents lower to 5
cents higher with June at $17.20 a barrel; heating oil was .28 cent
to .57 cent lower with June at 46.20 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .15 cent to .56 cent lower with June 49.72 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 2.85 points lower at 259.85.

<HEAD>Volkswagen First-Quarter Profit Up 2 Percent; U.S. Market Posts
Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOLFSBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Volkswagen AG said Wednesday its
first-quarter net profit rose 2 percent over a year ago, aided by
improvement in its Spanish and South American operations.
   West Germany's largest automaker said quarterly net income
increased to 144 million marks, or about $84 million, from 141
million marks in the same period in 1987.
   Sales also rose 2 percent, to 13.7 billion marks, or $8 billion,
from 13 billion marks last year.
   Volkswagen Chief Financial Officer Dieter Ullsperger said he
expected positive results for the rest of the year.
   Company officials said the company's U.S. operations will post
another loss in 1988 because the underused plant in Westmoreland,
Pa., will not be shut down until July. But he said the loss will be
smaller than the one in 1987.
   Volkswagen has also spent a total of 2.6 billion marks, about
$1.5 billion, on the development of its new mid-size sedan, the
Passat.
   Officials said the Passat will be sold in the United States
beginning next year and they expressed hopes of selling 25,000
Passats in the United States in 1989.

   Sales of domestically made cars fell 6.7 percent
in late April, with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. posting sales
gains and General Motors Corp. reporting a decline, the companies
reported Wednesday.
   GM said its car sales for the April 21-30 period trailed 19.7
percent behind unusually strong sales in the same period last year.
   Chrysler posted a 10.3 percent gain for the period and Ford's
car sales were up 8.7 percent.
   Domestic truck sales showed a 6.5 percent increase, but combined
car and truck sales were still down 2.6 percent from the year-ago
late April period.
   For the month, GM's car sales were down 14.2 percent to a
314,671 total, Ford's car sales were down 1.4 percent to 186,175
and Chrysler up 8.8 percent to 95,170.
   Among import carmakers, Toyota's April sales of domestically
made cars rose by 4.5 percent to 4,115, while sales of its imported
cars rose 0.6 percent from the previous April to 43,605. Volkswagen
domestic auto sales fell 11 percent to 4,625 while its import sales
fell 25 percent to 11,922.
   Honda import sales dropped 3.6 percent to 19,702, but sales of
domestically made Hondas were up 7.5 percent to 17,512.
   David Healy, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New
York, said a GM surge due to sales incentives last April skewed the
figures. ``They were 55 percent of the market, so the comparison
will be kind of distorted. GM will look poor,'' he said.

   Arnold C. Greenberg resigned
Wednesday as chairman and chief executive officer of Coleco
Industries Inc., according to an announcement from the troubled toy
maker.
   The company's board of directors named Morton E. Handel to
succeed Greenberg as chairman and chief executive and promote
Handel to the board, Coleco said in a statement.
   J. Brian Clarke will continue as president and chief operating
officer while Greenberg will remain as a consultant and a director
of Coleco, the statement said.
   ``It is necessary to intensify and accelerate cost cutting
actions already begun and to further contract the size of the
company,'' Greenberg said in the statement.
   He also said ``financially directed leadership is desirable
during this period, and I believe Morton Handel, working together
with...Clarke can accomplish these critical objectives.''
   Coleco, which once rode high on the success of its Cabbage Patch
Kids dolls and other toys, was hit by declining sales in recent
years, along with other major toy manufacturers.
   The toymaker posed losses of $105.4 million in 1987 and $111.2
million in 1986.
   On Tuesday, Coleco laid off about 330 employees at manufacturing
and distribution facilities, mainly at Coleco's three manufacturing
plants in the Albany, N.Y., area.
   The company also laid off about 145 members, or 35 percent, of
its corporate staff.
   Coleco attempted in March to cut its $335 million debt by more
than one half by exchanging four separate issues of debt securities
for a combination of new debt and common stock. The company said
that move was the next-to-last step before a possible filing for
federal bankruptcy protection from creditors.
   But reception to the plan has been cool, and Coleco last week
for the second time extended the deadline for holders of debentures
to agree to the proposal. The new deadline is Friday, May 13.

   The House moved to erase Alaska oil provisions
of the trade bill Wednesday and sent the plan to the Senate in what
sponsors called a compromise gesture designed to head off a
threatened presidential veto.
   ``By this action we are offering to meet the president half way
by taking care of one of the two items to which he has expressed
disapproval in this ... legislation,'' House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas.
   The House approved the measure 253-159.
   It now goes to the Senate which could take it up as early as
next week, although it is not clear when it will do so.
   The technical-corrections resolution amends the 1,000-page trade
bill passed last week. The resolution itself would not go to the
president's desk, but merely instruct a clerk to delete the Alaska
provisions before the trade bill is sent to the White House.
   Republicans complained that reopening the trade bill after it
already had been passed was a violation of House rules.
   ``You've come the wrong half and you've done it the wrong way,''
said Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn. ``When it's over, it's over.''
   President Reagan has been expressing concern about a provision
of the trade bill that would require companies with 100 or more
employees to give 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale
layoffs.
   Democrats said they wanted to compromise but ruled out deleting
the plant-closings provision. They said it was needed by
blue-collar workers whose lives are disrupted when they find
themselves out of work without warning.
   ``Maybe they should consult their astrologer to find out when
they are going to be out of work,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
   More recently, the president has been critical of the Alaska oil
provisions.
   One of the Alaska provisions would clear the way for export of
50,000 barrels of crude daily to Canada, but first require shipment
of the oil in an American vessel to a U.S. West Coast port.
   It is a favorite feature of politically influential maritime
unions and a similar provision appears in the U.S.-Canada free
trade agreement signed by Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
in January.
   The other provision would permit export of 70,000 barrels daily
of petroleum products from the refinery at Valdez, Alaska, and any
new refineries that are constructed in the state.
   Republicans have been complaining that it violates accepted
procedures to reach back and alter the bill after floor action is
complete. But Wright said bills have gotten similar handling at
least five times in the last three years and that it falls within
proper bounds.
   ``Now we again call upon President Reagan to demonstrate
reciprocal good faith and reconsider his oft-repeated threat to
veto the trade bill because of the socially responsible provision
regarding worker notification,'' he said.
   Wright acknowledged that dropping the Alaska provisions was
partly aimed at picking up two votes in the Senate for a possible
veto override.
   The measure cleared the Senate, 63-36, last week _ short of the
two-thirds margin needed to override a veto. Both of Alaska's
Republican senators, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, opposed the
bill.
   Critics of administration trade policy said the Alaskans would
have supported the bill if the export curbs had been deleted.
Stevens, however, said he could not guarantee that he would vote
for the measure, even if the restrictions were stripped from it.

   American Motors Corp. agreed
Wednesday to pay $11.5 million to a Fort Pierce woman left a
quadriplegic after a 1984 rollover accident involving a Jeep.
   In return for the settlement, Elizabeth Walker, 34, agreed not
to pursue her claim for punitive damages.
   The settlement included $9.5 million awarded by a jury in Fort
Pierce on April 1, 1986, plus interest. The same jury awarded Ms.
Walker $10 million in punitive damages, but that amount was reduced
to $1 by the state Court of Appeals.
   However, the appellate jury recommended that the Florida Supreme
Court review the punitive award, said Joe Reiter, one of Ms.
Walker's lawyers. Reiter said he had intended to seek the original
$10 million in punitive damages before the Supreme Court.
   Ms. Walker, who now is a nursing home patient, was riding in a
Jeep CJ7 on May 4, 1984, when it was struck by a car. She was
thrown from the Jeep, which then rolled onto her, and suffered a
broken neck.
   The driver of the car, Donald Robinson, earlier had agreed to a
$600,000 settlement with Ms. Walker.
   Reiter said experts convinced the jury that the Jeep's center of
gravity was too high, making it susceptible to rollover accidents.

   The United Auto Workers union and
Chrysler Corp. reached a tentative settlement Wednesday on a
two-year national labor contract, following about 40 hours of
non-stop bargaining.
   ``We achieved the full pattern settlement we set out to achieve,
and we accepted no deviations from what we have in effect today at
GM and Ford,'' the union said in a statement attributed to UAW
President Owen Bieber and Vice President Marc Stepp.
   Chrysler and the UAW began negotiating April 18 on a contract to
replace a three-year pact covering 66,000 UAW workers in 15 states,
which expires in September.
   The proposed national labor pact _ which includes a $1,000 a
worker signing bonus _ will be presented Friday to the UAW's
140-member national Chrysler council for approval. It will be
submitted to the rank-and-file for a ratification vote sometime
next week.
   Anthony St. John, Chrysler's chief bargainer, called the
tentative agreement ``affordable and equitable'' and said the
signing bonus was ``in recognition of the UAW's contribution to
Chrysler's productivity and profits during the past few years.''
   UAW President Owen Bieber told a news conference that the $1,000
signing bonus, when added to a $500 bonus Chrysler workers received
in March, would equal the amount workers would have received in
profit-sharing payments if the profit-sharing formula in the new
contract had been in effect last year.
   Negotiators adapted to Chrysler an industry-pattern contract
established last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.
   The pattern contract protects jobs by requiring companies to
keep on the payroll workers whose jobs are eliminated for any
reason except slow sales _ until funding for the program runs out.
It also requires hiring of one worker for every two who leave the
company.
   Chrysler will fund its program with $230 million.
   The pattern also provides lump sum payments of 3 percent in the
next two years and includes the profit-sharing formula that has
paid thousands of dollars to Ford workers over the past few years.
   The pattern also forbids plant closings over the life of the
contract except for those closings announced before negotiations
began.
   Unlike the GM or Ford contract, the Chrysler contract includes
the company's commitment that executives will receive neither cash
nor stock bonuses in years when the profit-sharing formula produces
no payout for workers.
   St. John said that did not prevent executives from exercising
stock options granted in previous years.
   The contract also includes the union leadership's commitment to
encourage its local unions to consider accepting so-called Modern
Operating Agreements _ Japanese-style agreements in which workers
are organized into teams.
   The new contract will expire Sept. 14, 1990, meaning Chrysler
will negotiate its next new contract at the same time as Ford and
GM for the first time in a decade.
   Chrysler and the UAW agreed to early talks in March in an effort
to ease growing labor-management friction.
   Problems stemmed partly from Chrysler's January announcement
that it would close a 5,500-worker former American Motors Corp.
assembly plant _ a sudden reversal of promises that the plant would
run five more years _ and Chrysler's aborted attempt to sell its
28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary.
   Chrysler backed down from the Acustar sale, but the early
negotiations were threatened by outrage among the rank and file
over the April 19 disclosure of 1987 Chrysler executive wages,
including Chairman Lee Iacocca's $17.9 million.
   That was followed by confirmation a few days later of the
company's plans to shift K-car production to Mexico from the United
States in July.
   Uproar over the those developments, plus Chrysler's attempts to
restrict when workers could retire with full benefits, almost
prompted the UAW to break off negotiations until August. But
following a brief UAW boycott of the talks, the company backed off
on those issues.
   The two sides negotiated through the weekend to settle separate
but related contracts covering about 7,000 former AMC workers in
Wisconsin, clearing the way for settlement of the national Chrysler
contract.
   The Wisconsin issues had to be settled before the national
contract in part because the national pact will cover workers left
on the job after the Kenosha plant closes.
